I am having great dificulty in processing information at my normal levels. I also seem to be experiancing some desturbing emotions\". Next is Riker with, \"Doctor there must be some way to correct this\". Doctor Crusher shakes her head and with a smile says, \"This is not a medical problem it's engineering problem. This transformation was brought about by a transporter malfuction. There is nothing wrong with your health. I suggest you all see Mr. La Forge and O'Brian about the transporter malfunction and Troi to help you adjust to your new appearance. First though you should all find something else to wear. The only thing I can do for you is to give you an injection to help reduce the amount of pheromones that your bodies give off. It will also help with the emotions you're feeling Mr. Data. It's a standard treatment for Orion females that serve in Starfleet. You'll have to take the injections daily or you'll have all the males on the ship chasing after you\". That last part causes Worf and Riker to squirm a little. They both know the legends about Orion females. Without the treatments they're irresistible to men and they have insatiable appetites for sex. Even with the treatments they have sex drives way higher than human females.</span></div></div>",

Riker walks into Troi's office. She has a smile on her face that stretches across her face. \"Get it out of your system\", Riker grumbles. Troi gives her a walk around and states, \"Very nice, I must admit I'm somewhat jealous.\" Riker sighs and says, \"I just need you to excuse me from duty. Crusher cleared us and I think it is very clear that was a mistake.\" Troi raises an eyebrow and asks, \"On what grounds should I excuse you from duty?\" Riker is flabbergasted and retorts with, \"Look at me, I'm a woman!\" Troi turns red and responds with, \"Being a woman is not a disability. I always knew your whole women and equal statements were bullshit. You're a chauvinistic womanizing jerk Will Riker. I think this experience will be good for you. I'm immediately recommending you for full duty.\" Riker just stands there in shock. Yeah, he always used that line about women being equal to make them feel better so he could get laid. They like hearing shit like that, but for Troi to hold that over his head. Riker then remembers how he left her all those years ago. \"Shit, I had this coming\", she thinks to herself. She knows Troi well enough that any argument will be useless. \"Fine, I'll go back to work. This is not a big deal\", Riker states and does her usual tug on her uniform top only to catch boobs this time. Riker turns and heads out of Troi's office and to the turbo left to the bridge. \"Focus on work and wait for this to get fixed\", Riker says to himself. Riker steps off the turbo lift and onto the bridge. She's immediately aware of stares from the male officers. She feels an unfamiliar strange tingling inside. \"Ah, Number One, welcome back\", the captain says. Riker takes her place in the first officer's chair. </span></div></div>",

Halfway through the next day the Captain take notice of this. \"Riker, join me in my ready room\", he orders. Riker follows the captain into the ready room. The captain assumes his chair behind the desk and Riker stands before him. \"Yes captain\", Riker states? The Captain takes a deep breath and says, \"Will, you've been up for nearly 30 hours. You should get some rest.\" Riker shrugs and says, \"I'm not tired, sir.\" That part is true. Riker doesn't feel at all tired. The only issue has been the tingling that started when she walked on the bridge has gotten stronger. She feels she needs something, but does not know what it is. Its a strange feeling. Also, he damn nipples have been hard for the past 10 hours to the point of aching. Riker isn't the only one feeling something. Since coming into his ready room and close proximity of Riker he's started to get an erection. He has also taken notice of Riker's nipples poking up. Riker walks up to the desk and lean over placing her hands on the desk. \"Captain, I'm fine. I can go for hours\", she purrs. Riker is shocked how sexy and suggestive that came out. When Riker leaned over her uniform dropped down to reveal her cleavage and blasts Picard in the face with her pheromones. Picard goes from a simple erection to a raging hard on. \"I must have her\", he thinks. Picard motions for Riker to come around the desk. Riker feels really hot as she rounds the desk. Picard swivels the chair to face her and Riker sees the captains cock tenting his pants. \"Come over here\", Picard says patting his lap. \"Oh no, I didn't get my daily shot\", Riker thinks realizing what is happening. </span></div></div>",

He can see her nipples nearly poking holes in her uniform and can smell her sex. \"She's practically dripping\", Picard thinks to himself. The thought smell sets off an alarm in Picard's brain. There is something about smell. His hands are already on Riker before his mind can process the importance of that. \"You want this\", Picard states grinding his cock against Riker. Riker does want it, but not sure if it's right to do this with the captain while he's under the influence. Riker has always admired Captain Picard, maybe even loved the man. \"What the hell, fuck me\", Riker shouts and pulls off her uniform!</span></div></div>",

Riker, the man was confident, self assured, upbeat, and very emotionally stable. The person in front of her now dressed in a silk bathrobe is an emotional mess. There is a mix of emotions being picked up by Troi's empathic senses, mainly annoyance and some depression. Troi has never felt this from Riker before, or many male staff. This mix of emotions all at once after a sexual indiscretion is usually something she gets from female staff. She now understands the depth of Riker's transformation. \"Do you want to talk about it\", Troi asks calmly? \"What's there to talk about? I fucker the Captain, I fucked Picard, or he fucked me. Shit, either way\", Riker retorts. Troi picks up on something else and says, \"You enjoyed it!\" Riker turns a darker green. She's been found out. Riker feels her throat tighten to where she can't even respond. Troi comes over and puts her arm around Riker. \"It's ok to enjoy sex. Women do enjoy sex and it's a natural thing\", she states. Riker finds her voice and says, \"Nothing about this is normal. I'm a man, Diana. This is not how things should be.\" Troi sighs and says, \"Will, you have to consider that they may not be able to reverse this and you'll be stuck like this. You'll have to adapt. You will adapt. The Will Riker I know is strong and can do this.\" This hits Riker hard. She always figured they'd figure this out and she'd get her body back. \"What if Diana is right and they can't? Oh my gawd\", Riker thinks to herself. She looks down at her body.</span></div></div>",

Troi does her best to calm Riker, but in the end decide just to sedate her. \"I should have known a chauvinist like Will would have a hard time adapting\", Diana thinks to herself. Despite his comments about women being equal, Riker has never really believed it. Diana watches Riker sleep. Each breath causes her massive breasts to rise. Her nipples are hard and erect. She can sense Riker is having an erotic dream. Riker has changed so much she doubts that even if they find a way to change them back that he will ever fully recover. Troi finds it hard to believe this incredibly oversexed Orion female fantasy was her Will Riker at one time. Something about over sexed Orion females and fantasy triggers a memory. \"Lieutenant Barclay\", Diana says out loud. She had been dealing with this just two weeks ago. Barclay had confided in her during one of their sessions that he had reduced his holosuite addiction to just one program that involved Orion women. He said it was a very special program and that he was having a hard time letting it go. \"This cannot be a coincidence\", Troi thinks to herself.</span></div></div>",

Barclay looks up at her looking tired and confused and answers with, \"I've lost them.\" Diana then asks, \"Lost what?\" Barclay stands up and answers, \"An experimental program I had developed. It was very advanced.\" \"Did this program involve Orion slave girls\", Diana asks? Barclay turns red and answers, \"Yes, it's not like that though. I mean it started out like that. They were different though. I designed them to be more real than any regular hologram. They were a DNA based program. If you remember when we had the Moriarty incident. We tried to beam him out of the simulation. It didn't work because the computer couldn't extrapolate, create stable DNA out of thin air. He immediately started to break down. I created my simulation starting with DNA sampling taken from the Federation database and transporter logs. It was like working backwards from what we tried with Moriarty. If it worked I could theoretically beam them out of the Holo-Suite, but the program vanished during the storm the other day.\" Troi sighs and then asks, \"Reg, have you heard what happened to the away team.\" Barclay looks confused. \"I think you need to go see La Forge.

Which was hardly surprising, and he stood up allowing Jean-Luc to take the command chair for the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout doubt it would be dangerous, but how often did a planet spontaneously explode. Only the vulcanologists were left on Eridani 8, everybody else being evacuated.

But something is wrong. He doesn't recognise the transporter engineer, and it is a matter of pride that he can recognise every member of his crew. It might take a week or so, for new arrivals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he looks over at the woman at the controls, there's not the least flicker of recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shriek comes from beside him, and the captain looks over to Reg Barclay.

On the far side of Dr. Crusher is a young woman, her uniform looks remarkably shiny and certainly not the usual material for starfleet uniforms. Her expression is that of suppressed panic, a familiar one for Reg... and as the Captain looks closer, he spots similiarities in her face. A beautiful face, a feminine face, but with hints of the engineer that were impossible to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA husky groan, draws the captain's eyes to the figure between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is Doctor Crusher, but with a short crew-cut hairstyle. He has the same compassionate features as Beverly but a determined chin. It sends shivers down his spine how much like Jack he now looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor...\" he asks uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it is the sound of his own voice that makes him take stock of his own situation. A quick glance downwards tells a story he doesn't want to believe. She is now undeniably a woman. The breasts are not big, however, equally they are undeniable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReg's hands clutch her chest incredulous, they heave as she start to hyper-ventilate. She is a very curvy girl, and she gets startled as a lock of long blonde hair falls across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if this is the biggest shock Jean-Luc's hands instinctively reach to her head, and she feels a full head of hair there.</span></div></div>",

Flushing red, she let go, and put her hand up to the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost as big a shock, as she felt a single pip there. Nervously she swallowed, she looked over at the hyper-ventilating Reg Barclay, and determined to not collapse herself, but be a pillar of strength for Reg. He -damn it- She needed the reassurance, especially right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go to the Medical Bay?\" Doctor Crusher asked his two new companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReg looked up at the doctor, fear painted all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean Luc glanced at the doctor and gave a curt nod of agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were out of the transporter room, they chatted nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happened?\" Reg's voice was shrill and on the verge of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to keep calm until we can be alone.\" Jean-Luc tried to sound in control as if she had a plan. However, she too was being distracted by a whole range of new sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swish of her nylons as she walked, and the flipping of her miniskirt were only a part of it. She felt that everything was moving... and everything was very distracting. Her ass had a life of it's own, and her breasts were trying to unbalance her with every pace as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew members that they walked past also frightened the women, too. The women were dressed as if living in a sexist fantasy, and all the men's crotches looked padded... at least Reg hoped it was padding, otherwise she was feeling very inadequate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attitude was clear too, the men openly ogling the women without a single complaint. Even the occasional caress as they passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean Luc was having to resist the temptation to punch the next man who touched her up. It just seemed to be accepted, and currently she didn't want to stand out. Not until she knew what was going on, and how to get back to her own universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a fraught turbolift journey, Reg was almost catatonic. An Ensign had been stroking her pussy all the time they were in the lift. Dr. Crusher almost objected, but with a shake of her head, the captain indicated he didn't want him to intervene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they reached Sickbay, and with a voice command, Beverley sealed the door.</span></div></div>",

The nurse had, during Reg's burst of engineering brilliance, been quite busy locking out the transporter room's door, behind which were the angry shouts and pounding of fists as the security team attempted to break in and punish the two women. Gripping her hypospray tighter than she thought she ever could, Alyssa leapt across the room and hauled Reg towards the master control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick! Get us out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReg shook her head and struggled to maintain her composure, digging into her engineering roots even as the assimilation effect chisled away at her, attempting to erode the mental foundation beneath her male mind's feet. The Starfleet engineer pointed to an exposed coupling near the transporter's power supply, \"The only way this works is if you're over there holding the crystal at a twenty-degree angle, otherwise we'll still be reliant on the local power grid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Well, how am I supposed to get out of here if I have to hold the thing in place?!\" Alyssa hissed, raising the hypospray menacingly to Reg's neck. The engineer whimpered and her cute face seemed on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's f-f-f-fine I s-s-swear! I-I can rig the-the transporter to delay, um, I mean, I can set it up to transport us both on a-automatic! I swear! It's j-just a m-mater of programming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReg's petite hands danced across the console display for Alyssa to see, but she was a doctor damnit, not an engineer! She couldn't make heads or tails of what it was supposed to mean. After a few moments she sighed and lowered the hypospray. \"Okay Reg, good. I trust that you know what you're doing\", and with that Alyssa slid the transporter crystal out of her pocket and made her way over to the exposed conduit, sliding the crystal into place at precisely twenty degrees. Taking a deep breath, she turned back to Reg and said with dramatic finality in her voice, \"Are we ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReg slammed her tiny fist down on the transporter's activation button and fixed Alyssa with mournful but determined eyes as the nurse was converted into pure energy from the misaligned crystal and pulled into it with a single scream that faded into nothing. The crystal itself clinked to the bottom of it's repository with a gentle clink as it began glowing with slightly pink light. Reg sauntered over, her body almost catlike as more female influences took over, and she picked the crystal up, careful to not let it touch the input port of the conduit. The crystal tingled slightly and sent a wave of pleasure rippling across her body as she eyed the converted crystal Ogawa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Alyssa, but all biological forms are just energy given a physical form...\" She purred quietly, bits of female confidence and arrogance breaking through. She stroked the crystal with a single silky smooth finger, tracing the edges, almost enraptured by the dancing light that was once human. But Reg's moment of victory was cut short by the increased pounding at the transporter room's door and she noticed a dull red patch of metal nearly five feet tall slowly growing brighter. Her breath caught in her throat, they were cutting their way in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a panicked squeal, Reg grabbed hold of the last vestiges of courage he possessed and made the few adjustments to the power conduit so that the crystal would work correctly and dashed back to the control console. Her hands moved like they had never moved before and she quickly energized, the crystal glowing brightly and the transporter's normal tinkling bells replaced with what seemed like female moan of pain as the female form of Jean Luc Picard appeared on the transporter, still immobile from the paralytic that had been given to her. Reg gave the captain a grim smile and set back to work, reconfiguring the transport to beam both of the women back to their own universe automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer final task complete, Reg leapt onto the transporter pad as the transporter room door gave way under sustained phaser fire, and with another squeal she closed her eyes tightly as the room was filled with a pink glow and the sound of a low, almost furious female groan as Reg and Picard were whisked away...</span></div></div>",

The two men shared a relieved look before Reg quickly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, Reginald was in sick bay, though there was no kind face of Beverly Crusher telling him that he was alright. Instead, it was the face of Alyssa Ogawa wearing the heavy blue coat that signified the position of Chief Medical Officer onboard the Enterprise. Still reeling from the effects of the transporter, Barclay couldn't help but emit a panicked gasp and tried to flail his limbs, but found himself restrained by a forcefield. Her was still in that horrible reality! He was still a woman! Ogawa escaped from the crystal and was there to punish him by making him like the captain! He didn't want to be a sex toy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lanky engineer thrashed as much as he could on the bed, panicking right up until Doctor Ogawa injeted him with a hypospray filled with relaxant. As the miracle drugs poured through his system Reg still felt a twinge of panic (afterall, the man was just a bundle of nervousness that could never be truly calmed) but was almost too relaxed to care. As he lolled about as medbay began to blur, he only half heard what Alyssa said about how he was safe now, and that everything had been explained before he felt his eyelids begin to droop close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Jean-Luc Picard stood next to Will Riker at the far edge of the medical bay, outside of the now dozing engineer's line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like Ogawa was wrong. He wasn't ready for the shock.\" Riker said  as he leaned against the padded beige wall, arms crossed with a looked of bemused concern on his bearded face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Number One, she has a lot to learn. She's Chief Medical Officer until we can return to Starfleet Headquarters and retrieve Dr. Pulaski, whom I hear was very pleased to get out of Starfleet Medical. In any case, I believe it is time for us to take our leave. DOCTOR Ogawa will inform us when Reg is ready to integrate back into his normal duties onboard this starship\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain and his first officer left the medical bay as quietly as they could and proceeded through the comfortable, familiar hallways of the USS Enterprise, Riker attempting to goad his captain into revealing some sort of embarrassing story from the alternate universe and Picard's brief tenure as a young woman, but the old man remained stoic and reserved until they reached a turbolift. Without hesitation Riker stepped into the lift, ready to return to the bridge, but his face scrunched in confusion as he saw Picard still standing in the passageway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you're not coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number One, I believe a Federation officer, when placed under situtions of extreme duress, can delegate command of his vessel, however briefly, to his first officer.\" Picard said, and then a rare, wry smile appeared on the older man's face. \"After all, I'm sure that, from time to time, even that alternate universe had to rely on Wilma Riker\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turbolift closed on the shocked face of William Riker as Jean-Luc strolled away, chuckling to himself as he made himself along the Federation flagship's halls and feeling QUITE relieved that the situation had resolved itself, though he could not deny the feeling of regret for leaving Beverly to her fate. After a few minutes and passing a untold number of crew, men, women, human and alien, all in proper Starfleet uniforms, Picard came to a stop before a large door. After punching some commands into the panel next to the doors, Picard entered into a large black room with a bright yellow grid. The doors of the holodeck closed behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, run program 'Lucy Picard'. And make sure that I have plenty of entertainment\"</span></div></div>",

It chirped to confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt disappointed in the Doctor and how quickly he'd submitted to the changes. As she headed out to the corridor, an idle thought sniggered at the back of her mind. Perhaps if you'd been the man here, you'd be more willing to adjust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head in denial, but the thought remained.... Who was she to judge a reality, even as a woman .... especially as a woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, in this reality weren't women less intelligent, than the men... Perhaps if the Dr. Crusher had accepted this... maybe she should too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA resounding slap on her arse as she walked, woke her to the true position of women here. There wasn't any judgement.... She just wanted out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sped up a little putting more wiggle in her walk. Well, as much as she dared. It was having a significant effect on her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turbo-lift was hellish, she had to share it with three engineers. Their hands roamed all over her body, caressing her breasts, stroking her thighs, patting her ass. One even brushed his fingers over her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was flushed and blushing crimson as she darted out of it. She hoped with a renewed passion that Reg was ready to beam out. Her blood coursed, pounding loudly in her ears. Her nipples were erect and demanding attention.

Her hands tinkering with the circuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked briefly past her breasts to see who had entered, a look of panic on her face. It looked cute to the Captain... even attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did that come from....\" she thought with a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just five more minutes, ma'am.\" Reg announced brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will take me with you, won't you?\" Alyssa's nervously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicard put a reassuring hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'll become a man back in your reality.\" she continued brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no guarantee, this will work.\" Reg piped up from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa bit her lip and shivered from head to toe.

He watched as Dean Troi's corpse rematterialised on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time when the body appeared, it was back to the more familiar female form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell.... Almost...  The face was the same for the Betazed surrounded by her long mane of hair. The body was lush with curves. Her breasts straining the uniform at every seam. Her ass was a perfect counter balance, being equally large to balance her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were screams of shock coming from various parts of the ship, and quite a few deep roars of approval as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick scan of Sickbay showed a new nurse there.

But she didn't fancy waiting to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set the console to beam her back to the original Enterprise, and flicked the switch on her phaser setting it to overload. She watched as the cargo hold vanished and the familiar but empty Transporter room of his Enterprise shifted into reality around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the other cargo hold, the phaser's power became critical and exploded in a wild flash of unrestrained energy. The cargo hold and everything it held destroyed.</span></div></div>",

He looked almost uncomfortable, as his pasty body lay there. He didn't seem complete without his holo-uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all fell into place he'd been beamed into the holodeck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor.\" he called out.

His hand rubbed his throat, which was oddly smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flicked his hand forward, this time twisting it in front of his disbelieving face. It was slender and feminine, and the nails were coated in a shiny crimson lacquer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arm matched, too, as his gaze followed it up to the shoulder.

Commander Chakotay.\" her soft voice was unsettling to her, and lacked the authority she was used to projecting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I'm open to being convinced.\" The Doctor was clearly skeptical of the beautiful bikini clad beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long raven hair flowed down her back and tickled the top of her ass. It was distracting, and as she flicked her head about, it just kept brushing against her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickling from her hair, finally annoyed her sufficiently. She reached around and snatched it all together. It also gave her a sight she never expected. Her ass looked magnificent, so round and full. And the Thong briefs just disappeared between the cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer give me the body of Commander Chakotay.\" her voice becoming almost shrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holodeck characters are not allowed to alter their own programming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was shaking his head and smiling. \"It'll take more than a male body for you to convince me that you're the Commander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, can we stop this program from such talk...\" the Doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChakotay felt a little smug, at the Doctor trying to change him... But he did feel different. He felt .... more comfortable in this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently fuming she wanted to complain, to rail against his blind stupidity... But the computer was stopping 'such talk'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girl... What is your name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belinda...\" Chakotay answered sweetly. Clasping her hands behind her back she swung her arms from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still confused where that name had come from... but probably the name of her particular routine or section of code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hear no more of this delusion about being the Commander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor's idle comment fired deep into her brain as an irrefutable command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could only nod in response, \"Uh huh.\" coming from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I just need to re-enforce your status to help your programming.\" The Doctor wasn't even addressing her anymore. Just talking to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, increase Belinda's bust size three cup sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched in horror as her breasts swelled even larger, the bikini top at least changed to cover and support her growing developments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and increase nipples, areolas and sensitivity in proportion too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she was poking through the fabric rather obviously. Her breathing sped up, as the fabric teased her enlarged flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor spun his finger in the air. And like a marionette, Belinda found herself turning on the spot. She teetered around and around as the Doctor took in her form with a cold clinical eye. <i>Didn't he know what a beautiful woman was for....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too Top Heavy...\" The Doctor sounded disappointed, but his words made Chakotay's heart sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need more balance. Computer. Add six inches onto Belinda's ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelinda stumbled as she adjusted to her new weight distribution, but she settled herself by stretching her arms outwards. Her wrists automatically cocked in a very feminine gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to save this form for Tom...\" The Doctor chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer. Reduce her English proficiency... and give her a strong Russian accent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor didn't appreciate the irony of how similar Belinda's proportions were to Seven's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vut.... Vut ar' you doink.\" Belinda said her voice now husky and low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor placed his index finger to her lips. \"Shh.... shhh.... shhh... you're the sort of girl who doesn't need to say too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear came to Belinda's eye, as she found she couldn't even object anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the Doctor spotted her companions. He waved for the three women to come over. Soon he had a blonde draped from each shoulder. They ran their hands over his body. Caressing his chest, and even brushing over his nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelinda gave an ironic smile. It was clear the Doctor wasn't used to, or even enjoying the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her smile didn't last, as the copper haired beauty, came around to her. Giving her waist a playful squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon however, her hand was sliding lower. Cupping one fulsome ass cheek, before giving it a couple of pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like to have a drink ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander was escorted away with the other scantily clad females. The two blondes now pouting when they realised that the Doctor wasn't joining them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor... please report to the bridge.\" Captain Janeway's voice coming clearly over the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End program.... and save all changes.\" The holograms faded, and the pale yellow lines on the floor returned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are pulled out and soon find yourself in a simple room. The captain is there too, and a blushing Harry. The mayor's staff have already cut away her uniform. Harry's hands twitch at her side as she stands there in her underwear. Next you see Janeway's uniform removed by the same staff with a dispassionate efficiency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reveal some fine champagne-coloured satin underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs at her treatment, but doesn't seem as upset as Harry. Not entirely surprising, given the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly you find it a little arousing, as you wait for them to attack your outfit. It will be a revelation for yourself as well as them to see what underwear, the transporter has kitted you out in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the women grabs Harry by the chin. She whimpers in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could train this one well, if she chose to stay here.\" Harry wasn't sure if she was asking a question or making a threat shook her head in denial. \"In any case, she won't be giving any orders when her rank is so apparent to everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that this punishment is intended to humiliate them, making it clear to any woman how lowly their ranking is. Tom glanced down at her own generous bust, and compared it with Harry's. There really was no comparison, she had the typical bust of an Asian woman. While the captain was more endowed, she was clearly less endowed than both herself, and Seven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom wasn't used to judging size from this angle, but he wasn't entirely sure that Seven was bigger than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it should be her in here getting her uniform cut away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo women approach, and grab you taking one arm each. You are nervous and excited, but the scissors remain unused. They take you to a wooden bar, and secure your hands there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they tighten the ropes, your hands are pulled further apart. You have to bend over to avoid having your arms pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this makes you stick your ass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment you see that your clothes won't be removed, that really won't work as a punishment in your case. But clearly they are eager to please the mayor and perhaps Seven as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven knowing what is going to happen you mentally prepare yourself, you try to brace yourself for the first blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no swish from a cane. But your ass flares in pain. As the spanking starts, you feel a pleasant warmth building even as your behind jiggles in response to the punishment. You know that you'll have a red raw hand print on your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, you feel another blow land, this time on your other cheek. Soon the blows are raining down, as both women give you a spanking. The warmth spreads and fills you, however, as it continues it gives way to pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the tears run down you cheek, spoiling make-up you weren't aware of until that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continue you start to scream, in pain and anger you curse them....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the blows stop, and you feel the ties being released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour uniform shows no sign of the punishment, and the scraps that were left hanging in tatters from the captain's shoulders she has removed, tossing them to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand back up, Harry's hands play with her shredded uniform. She appears unwilling to remove anything that gives her even the least coverage. But when she catches her reflection in a mirror, her old male eyes seem to give her a fresh perspective, and like the captain she removes the rags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women stand silently in their underwear. You rub a hand tentatively over your ass. It just feels so expansive, and warm and so very tender too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for you to rejoin your leader.\" she says, and the three of you follow her back to the mayor's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoy the movement of her ass, it moves hypnotically, and you hope you can learn to make your move like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocks on the door, and waits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the mayor invites you all in, you politely turn down her offer of a seat. Seven and the mayor are enjoying cups of tea. Seven directs a powerful stare to both Janeway and Harry, until they get the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women move to stand behind her chair, shouldering her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am\" you say, hopefully the questioning tone is clear. You give her a respectful tilt of the head as you address her.</span></div></div>",

If you'd put me across your knee, we'd be having this conversation the other way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes glare at her as she so simply recalls your humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might appear a low tech planet, but the air is alive with nanites.\" she informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can say more her badge twitters, and Janeway's voice returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd advise against beaming back up just yet.\" her tone is harsh. \"Apparently there is something in the atmosphere that meant that Harry Kim kept her female form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft sobbing is heard in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I don't appreciate being beamed back to the bridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't in charge of the transporter, Captain.\" Seven cut off the complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle escaped your lips before he could stop yourself. You feel more sympathy for Harry, but Janeway will perhaps have some trouble with a lack of respect from a couple of bridge personnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take that up with your transporter chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant snarl comes from the other end of the comm line. You don't relish rejoining your wife, when this is over.

I'd have to advise against it, unless you want her to start negociations from scratch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway ground her teeth, she was sure Seven was being deliberately obstructive. But the channel closed with a chirp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go and collect the crystals, oh wife of mine.\" she chuckled. It was a deep, husky laugh, though still feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wife?\" your voice cracks as you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I did put you over my lap. That's like a marriage proposal here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up, running a hand up your arm as she goes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wesley was finally ready for the first trial of his new holodeck modifications. He had gotten the initial idea from the incident with the Sherlock Holmes character, Moriarty that Geordi and Data had accidentally created. That, combined with Commander Riker's experience with the close to real-life simulation of Minuet created by the Binars, had made him wonder about improving the Artificial Intelligence (AI) of holodeck simulations. Since Ensign Robin Lefler had given him a cold shoulder lately, he could not do what he wanted on getting her help in rewriting the AI, and also using transporter technology to modify the user to match needs of the simulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine being able to experience being, not only on other worlds, but in the form of the beings that lived on that world! To live as a Klingon or a Vulcan for instance. Do that, with a more intelligent, and therefore more realistic holodeck characters, and the potential would be unlimited!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he decided to get Robin's help in another way. It took a long time of covertly scanning Robin's brain patterns, but he got it. After a while, he was able to figure out how to analyze the different parts of her brain and thought processes, knowledge and feelings. He was now ready to create a Robin Lefler character using her own brain patterns. If it was successful, he would have a simulation who thought and acted just like the real thing. And just to make it more interesting, he programmed her to be deeply in love with him. He also added a deep sexual desire to make things interesting when the took a 'break'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused. What he was doing was not ethical, and possibly illegal, though no current law covered this. It was for science though, right? He took a deep breath, \"Computer. Execute program Crusher Gamma Lima 23.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments, Wesley saw Robin materialize in front of him. She looked around, then down at herself. To Wesley's shock, she felt her body, including her breasts! Then she looked up at him and said, \"So, I am the simulation? Why did you do this to me Wesley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at her, \"You know you are a simulation? That was not supposed to happen!\" When she stared at him with her arms crossed, he replied, \"Because I need your help on a project.\" Then, to play on her programming, if it still applied, \"And because I love you Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to him and smiled, \"You shouldn't have done this Wesley. You had no right.\" All the same, she wrapped her arms around him, \"But since you did, we might as well enjoy it.\" She kissed him deeply, then led him to her bedroom! Wesley had the best time of his life that night! Wesley was sorry to discontinue the program in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was off-shift again, he returned to the holodeck and brought Robin back. He smiled at her naked form, \"Would you like to have some fun again, then get to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn bed afterwards, Robin said, \"You know Wesley, if we get a full brain scan of you, you could program me with your information, and if you kept the simulation running, I could work on the problem when you are gone.\" To a young man in a sexual stupor, it sounded reasonable, but he would regret it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weeks of work, they had the ability of taking a non-holodeck object, and using it to make a holodeck object 'real' so that it could be taken off of the holodeck. A couple of weeks later, Robin said to Wesley, \"I made a huge breakthrough that I want to show you.\" She smiled as she said, \"But first, let's get more comfortable.\" Wesley watched her undress. This was odd behavior for her. She was not normally so free to be naked, at least not without some foreplay. As she undressed she asked Wesley, \"Do you you really love me Wesley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Of course I do Robin. How could you doubt that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at she was almost completely naked now, \"So, if we can solve the Moriarty problem, would you make me 'real'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley shook his head, \"You know I can't do that Robin. What would the real Robin say? She might not be happy about having an identical twin sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned, \"Well, you could make me someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley shook his head, \"You know I can't. Please stop asking.\" Then he walked up and stroked her hair. \"What did you want to show me?\" She told him the code, and he said the words, since he made sure that he was the only one who could initiate them. \"Computer, initiate program Crusher Tango Uniform 69.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his shock, he began to dissolve in a transporter effect! He never fully vanished, but something was going on. When he re-materialized, he looked down and saw that he was female and naked. In a mirror 'she' saw that she was now...</span></div></div>",

Along with what I needed for the engineering, I also learned that you didn't really love me, and that you had no intention of ever making me real. So I used your matter to trade places.\" He handed her a scanner, \"Look us over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, a terrified young woman said, \"This has to be a mistake! The scanner says that YOU are real and that I am just holodeck matter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled, \"No, it is no mistake. It is what the program was supposed to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley said, in her new voice, \"Computer, reverse the effects of program Crusher Tango Uniform 69!\" To her dismay, what she heard was, \"I cannot execute that program without proper authorization.\" Wesley said, \"Well, I am authorizing it. Authorization Crusher Alpha, 56, Uniform, Tango 4.\" The computer said, \"Authorization code cannot be given by a simulation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled, \"That is right my dear, but thank you for giving me your key code. Computer, run Crusher Mike Sierra 23.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley felt a strange sensation pass through her head. \"What did you do to me? Why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled, \"I will tell you after you get on that bed, spread you legs, and make passionate love to me.\" And to Wesley's horror, she found her body obeying even though she tried to fight it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done, she had to admit that it had felt great. And it was only when they were done that she was able to ask again, \"Why did you do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled, \"I needed your genius, the real you, to solve the real puzzle of making transporter matter real. So I gave you a reason to try very hard. Until you do it, you remain a simulation under my control.\" He got up and got dressed. \"But for now, I am sorry my dear.\" Before she could shout 'No!', he had said, \"Computer, suspend holodeck program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not until then that Wesley learned what it was like to be in limbo as a suspended AI.

I asked mom what I would have been named if I had been a girl. That is your name now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked defiant. \"Stop playing with me like this Wesley. I am Courtney. I mean you are Wesley and my name is Courtney! I mean, my name is Courtney Belinda Crusher!\" She could not call herself anything else, not call Robin anything but Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we have that straight Sis, I will fill you in on the rest.\" Robin continued as he held out a device with a very high capacity memory cube. \"I want you to find a solution very quickly, and this will help it happen. You might recognize this as the same kind of thing that they put Moriarty into for a virtual world and a virtual life. Robin and I have made a lot of improvements though. It will be able to draw information real time from the ship's computer, but you can't communicate out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley/Courtney looked frightened, \"What are you saying? You are going to put me in that? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"Two reasons. One, in here, you will live a lifetime in seconds. Since this module can run independently for centuries, that gives you a virtual eternity to figure things out. The other reason is, we can give you a world programmed in a special way, so that to everyone else, it is normal that you are female. You always were to them. And a few things from Robin to reward you for using her body the way you did.\" As Wesley/Courtney began to speak, he said, \"Computer, save program to module and run there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wesley/Courtney began to speak, Robin disappeared and she was standing in what looked like officer's quarters in a Star Base. Of course, she knew that it was not Robin who disappeared, but herself, now trapped in a virtual world. A com-panel beeped, and she walked over to it. A picture of Robin/Wesley appeared. He said, \"When you have found an answer, you can send a message to me through the com-panel. Don't do it unless you mean it. I can keep you in there for what will seem like centuries to you if you do. Wesley out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she was trapped. Somehow, she knew that she was stationed here on Star Base 124 with her mother. The research she was assigned to do was holodeck matter conversion.

She was surprised at how pretty she was, and even sexy with the short skirt. That would have to change! She pulled off the dress and looked again. Standing there in a bra and panties, she felt her breasts. It felt good to touch them, but odd to feel them being touched! Then she put a hand to her flat crotch. She really had a pussy! What now? She knew that she had been in Robin's body a little while, and even had sex with Wesley, but she could not actually remember anything about how it felt, and it was fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw herself and realized that her sexy body should be stimulating her, but she felt nothing. In looking between her crotch, and the gap that was now there, she thought, \"There is no way a man is getting between those legs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beep from the wall communicator, and she heard her mom say, \"Courtney, you need to be ready to go to the reception soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a frustrated voice, she said, \"Acknowledged!\" She began to explore her clothing. In frustration she realized that everything, absolutely everything she had to wear was either a dress or a skirt, and in no case did the any of the skirts extend below her mid-thigh! Some were Star Fleet uniforms, some civilian, but all tight and sexy in some way. Some of the civilian stuff was very skimpy indeed! This was an official function, so she picked what apparently passed for a woman's dress uniform in this world. It was short and tight of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got out, she saw her mother was wearing a similar dress. Beverly looked at her and said, \"Yes. Thanks to you, almost all women in this world have to wear short skirts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the reception, Wesley/Courtney found out something else about herself. When she saw Commander Wright, she blushed again. What was worse, she was feeling very attracted to him! So much so that her nipples were visibly pushing, creating undeniable tents over her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed deeply and hurried into the arboretum to cool off.

Her hope of regaining control of herself vanished as he walked up, and gently brushed her face and said, \"Ensign Crusher. I think you should know I feel the same way about you that you seem to feel about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was more than she could take! The needs growing in her body were incredible! Did all females feel this or was it something Robin had programmed for her? It hardly mattered! She threw her arms around him and began to kiss him passionately, feeling a growing wetness between her legs! The harder she tried to fight it, the more she wanted the Commander! Finally, he broke the kiss and whispered in her ear, \"I need to make some formal appearances before I leave. Meet me in my quarters in thirty minutes.\" With that, he left her standing there panting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Wesley/Courtney could control herself enough, she left the arboretum through another exit. She found herself going to her quarters and selecting one of the sexiest civilian outfits that she could find, and only a one-piece at that! She did not change there, but put it in her bag, along with a 'working uniform' and rushed to the Commander's quarters. When there, she quickly changed into the sexy, pink outfit. The worst part for her was that, the entire time, from when she first started being attracted to the Commander until now, sitting on his couch with her legs spread slightly in a suggestive manner, he male part of her mind was trying to fight this behavior. In spite of her best efforts to control herself though, her heart was beating quickly in anticipation of the Commander's touch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally walked in, her control was not from the male part of her mind holding her back, but from the female part wanting to win the Commander's heart as much as his body! He smiled at he looked down at her, \"You are not the first woman I have invited to my quarters, but I have never allowed myself to be tempted by a junior officer before.\" He sat bye her and took her in his arms. They kissed passionately as he massaged her breasts. When he broke the kiss, \"I don't know what it is about you, but I couldn't take my eyes off of you.\" He kissed her again as he reached between her legs and stroked her pussy through the tight outfit. The feeling sent waves of excitement through her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carried her back to his bedroom, and she was thrilled to let him undress her. The Commander knew is way around a female body, and not only gave her great pleasure, but had her begging him to take her! Wesley/Courtney had no idea such need could exist! She instinctively spread her legs wide when he moved over her, and she gasped in both shock and pleasure as she felt herself being penetrated. As he drove deeper, he encountered some resistance, and then her cherry was popped and he drove deeper. She moaned, and then screamed in pleasure as he moved deep inside of her! Her body shook in an orgasm as she felt his hot seed pumping inside of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head was spinning with dozens of incredible sensations throughout her body as she heard him talking to her as if in a dream. Something about him being her senior officer. She even heard herself agreeing to what he was asking of her, though it was like a thought outside of herself. It was not until she hear him say, \"In that case, you may call me Paul. I love you Courtney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings began to sink in as the wave of pleasure she had been riding began to recede.

How dare you do that to me without my permission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly smiled patiently, \"Now Courtney, you know at well as any woman that ever since the Xindi attacks on Earth, fertile females in remote locations that can support an increase in population are required to have children. Especially young women such as yourself. Why do you think you see so many women pregnant out here? If I had not been infected by that Telurian virus shortly after you were born, I would be pregnant right now myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley/Courtney was stunned.

On the side of the solar system, Cendra III beta was a barren desert. There were also warning satellites set in orbit around it. Just 14 light years away in the Deneb system, there lay another survivor. The battle for mineral rights, was absolutely not worth the price either side had paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmbassador Spock had negotiated a peace between the two systems, and Captain Picard was a necessary part of that peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe vented his anger on the Vulcan when informed of his role. Demanding that he be given a smaller ship or a reduced crew, something... anything to minimise casualties if something went wrong.

The situation remained the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock was adamant the to keep secrecy, that the Captain had to keep the Enterprise anything else might raise suspicion or tempt those other races with a vested interest in the war continuing. There had been estimates of how much certain of the Ferengi were making in selling weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had also been rumours of a Klingon faction using it as a training exercise for some of their warriors.

The 5-year mission of the Starship <i>Enterprise</i> is, as the series goes, \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.\" Captain James T. Kirk, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Leonard McCoy, Science Officer Mr. Spock, and other characters find truth, peace, and justice throughout the galaxy. In the 2260s, their scientific knowledge is much greater than our own, but many types of phenomena remain as inexplicable to them as it does to us. It allows plot devices to combine the best of the science fiction and fantasy genres, and alterations of the mind and body are no exception to those plot devices. In this Interactive story, the Star Trek TOS universe of an existing episode will experience some form of change. Below are two examples which might provide a good start, since they already involve body swapping or possession. The third choice is left to the reader for other episodes for inspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Turnabout Intruder (Season 3, Episode 24; synopsis <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Turnabout_Intruder_%28episode%29\">here</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Turnabout_Intruder_%28episode%29\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>; episode <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6L5J-iUsm4\">here</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6L5J-iUsm4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the series finale, Kirk and Dr. Janice Lester, who shared a romantic relationship with him in the past, swap bodies through the use of an ancient artifact. Dr. Lester is obsessed with becoming a Starship captain; Kirk is trapped in her body and tries to warn the crew of her intentions. The transfer has an apparent time limit, and the device itself is located in the colony on Camus II, which had been devastated by radiation exposure except for the remaining two survivors (Lester and Dr. Arthur Coleman, her unscrupulous assistant). Plot devices might include: beaming a portion of the device onto the <i>Enterprise</i> for analysis, what happens if the transfer doesn't wear off and Kirk and Janice do not swap back, what happens if Janice succeeds in killing Kirk in her body, subsequent body swaps on the planet surface, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Return to Tomorrow (Season 2, Episode 22; synopsis <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Return_to_Tomorrow_%28episode%29\">here</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Return_to_Tomorrow_%28episode%29\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>; episode <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q8skvSdGZw\">here</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q8skvSdGZw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hundred light years beyond Federation-explored space, the <i>Enterprise</i> finds a destroyed planet where its only life are three pure-energy entities. They used to be humanoids, as powerful and intelligent as gods, but are now confined to sphere-shaped receptacles. They have the power to possess and exchange forms with any crewman on the ship. This leads to Kirk, Spock, and Lieutenant Commander (Doctor) Ann Mulhall being possessed by Sargon, Henoch, and Thalassa, respectively. Their stated goal is to build android bodies to live out the remainder of their existence, but the temptation of having real, physical bodies intrigues them. Plot devices might include: possession of other members on the <i>Enterprise</i>, body swaps between characters, continuing to build the androids, what happens if Henoch is not destroyed, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I propose we name it <i>Vulcan II</i>, on account of it being barren, inhospitable, and bereft of any emotional attachment for staying there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: You and I both know that it's the Starfleet Admiral's job to name newly discovered planets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy: Of course! What else, besides politics, are admirals good for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock: They are 'good' for quite a lot, Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy: By the way, Spock, for a brief period of time Sargon placed your consciousness into the body of Nurse Chapel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock: That is correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy: So what was it like? And don't tell me it was 'fascinating', I've heard that from you too many times to count!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock: For lack of a better word, then, intriguing. I never knew how vulnerable and weak it felt to be human. While the Nurse is in excellent physical condition, her body seemed most unfit to perform tasks that a Vulcan child can accomplish. For example, her eyesight is a perfect 20/20 to the human eye, but it is inferior to my own vision. Her hearing was also unsatisfactory when compared to my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy: That may be well and true, but what about the other senses? We're made of flesh and blood, not cogs and wheels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock: I am unsure of what you are asking, Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: Alright, gentlemen, that's enough. Continue that conversation on your own time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy: Yes, sir. I think I'm going to check out those hypo syringes that Henoch prepared. If I can analyze the formula he used to slow the body down, it might be a useful discovery to share with Starfleet. While I can't imagine, for the life of me, how it could be used on humans, it might have some other use sometime down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>McCoy leaves the bridge. Spock remains standing at Kirk's side. Their voices are quiet so as not to disturb the others on the bridge.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock: Your ancient Earth mythology is quite interesting, Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: Oh? Have you been wondering about the names of our alien guests, Mister Spock?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock: Sargon of Akkad, sir, was king of a land your people once called 'Mesopotamia'. He organized an army, conquered city states, and ultimately unified the land. Thalassa, a Greek goddess and mother of Aphrodite, comes from the term for the sea. She was among the first of their deities to come into existence. Henoch, a modification of the Biblical name Enoch, was the father of Methuselah. He walked with God and was later taken by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: I'm afraid I don't fully understand. Is it the origin of the names or their significance that interests you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock: Both, Captain. First, their selection of names from three of Earth's ancient mythologies -- Mesopotamian, Greek, and Christian -- suggests that they have sufficient knowledge of Earth and its development. Second, the names themselves connote a warlike attitude. For example, Sargon killed many people and subdued entire populations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: And... you're suggesting that... we cannot trust Sargon or his story. But they were warlike in the past, they admitted that and sought repentance. Vulcans, too, were violent at one point in the past, and they moved beyond their violent tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock: That is correct. But we never possessed the kind of powers that Sargon, Thalassa, and perhaps Henoch still possess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: In the Book of Genesis, it states that God killed Enoch. Sargon destroyed Henoch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock: The passage states simply that Enoch was taken by God. It does not state that He destroyed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: I think... we might be reading into this a little, Mister Spock. We're here to find truths, not dabble in speculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock: I agree. Even so, it may be wise to inform Dr. Mulhall and place her under security watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: Perhaps it's better if I go talk to her myself. I don't want the crew to feel paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpock: Paranoia, Captain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Spock raises his eyebrow again, before turning around to resume his station. Kirk leans forward and smiles, before getting up and exiting the bridge. Spock takes over for Kirk, replacing him at the chair.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Dr. Ann Mulhall is in her private quarters on Deck 3F, room 67, studying from a series of astrobiological tapes on her computer screen. On her desk is a digital clipboard, where she is occasionally ticking off pieces of information with a laser pen. She is dressed in a red uniform with a Starfleet brooch fastened near the neckline above her breasts. She wears a headband that pulls the bangs out of her eyes. Her straight hair covers the ears and extends down the back of her neck and shoulders. Her legs, encased in stockings and black dress boots, are crossed underneath the desk. Her eyes are bright and piercing. Her voice is unintentionally sultry. She hears a knock at the door. It is Captain Kirk.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nMulhall: Come in. Oh, hello again, Captain Kirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: Dr. Mulhall. I hope... I am not interrupting you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulhall: Not at all, Captain. I've been studying some Federation record tapes to check for past encounters with pure-energy beings. So far, any description I've found hasn't matched what we discovered on that planet. They were a unique species, sir. Possibly requiring a new type of quadronomial nomenclature for classification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kirk walks slowly toward Mulhall, scanning the room for her various articles and personal items. She has a computer bank, three or four digital posters of news releases from Starfleet, and a vanity table with various types of makeup, perfumes, and cosmetics. Her bed is neat and tidy. There are no stray clothes on the floor, as everything is well placed and accounted for. Aside from these things, the room is mostly empty, as if it had not been fully lived in.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: Do you know what was the first thing I noticed about you? Your sleeve braid. The double-gold-bar designation means you're a lieutenant commander, and I would have seen that on the ship before if you weren't so new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulhall: A very good first observation, Captain. Many men notice other things about me first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: I am not like many men. I'm a starship captain, it's my duty to familiarize myself with every person on board the <i>Enterprise</i>, and that goes double for commissioned officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulhall: I see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: I wasn't aware that my ship had another lieutenant commander aboard. It's a pleasant surprise, but a surprise nevertheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulhall: That is because I am here on a temporary assignment en route to Starbase 6, Captain. I came aboard the <i>Enterprise</i> on stardate 4220.3, during your rendezvous at Miller's Outpost. The <i>USS Lexington</i> is in need of a commanding science officer, and I understand we are to meet them there in less than 2 months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: And they will be lucky to receive such a talented officer. The way you approached uncertainty in the field was admirable. And your dedication to helping the alien species showed a kind of courage that goes beyond many others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulhall: Why, thank you, Mister Kirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: You are the highest-ranking woman aboard the ship. Is there any way I can persuade you to remain with us instead of going over to the <i>Lexington</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulhall: It seems unlikely at this point. We all have to follow orders, and Starfleet Command would wonder why one of its ships has two commissioned science officers and the other has none at all. Your Mister Spock is well known throughout the Federation. He is better equipped to serve aboard the <i>Enterprise</i> than I.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: Yes, he is a good man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulhall: So are you, sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kirk stands over Mulhall, placing his hands on her shoulders. She is interrupted from reading the telescreen, as she looks up at the captain in curiosity. He has been reading her astrobiology notes over her shoulder. Or is he?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: I've come here to caution you about the alien species. Mister Spock and I have talked it over, and we aren't sure whether or not Sargon and Thalassa have really disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulhall: But you heard what they said on the bridge earlier? They decided to join the rest of their deceased civilization in oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: I know, I said the same thing to Spock. But with their powers, their... ability to cloak themselves from detection, it is possible they are still around here. Have you seen or heard anyone behaving in a strange manner recently?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulhall: No sir, I have not. But I'll be on the lookout and report the instant I get news of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: Thank you, Dr. Mulhall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He begins to leave, then turns around.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: Doctor... Mulhall. Your... doctorate is in astrobiology. Why, then, are you staffed in our operations department? A better post in the meantime should be the sciences department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulhall: I was wondering the same thing. I've submitted a request for change of duty, but I have not yet heard back from Yeoman Rand, who I understand is in charge of staffing aboard the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirk: I'll see to it myself. Continue your research under advisement, Ann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulhall: Yes, Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kirk leaves out the whooshing doors of Mulhall's private quarters. She resumes examining her tapes, pausing to look toward the door again. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whoever this Jean-Luc is, I\u2019ve never heard of him, and I damn well know I exist!\u201d Ariel said, her voice hard as titanium, giving the doctor one last glare before storming from the office and Sickbay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly jumped to her feet, rounding the desk as she slapped the com-badge on her uniform. \u201cDr. Crusher to Bridge, I need a security team to Sickbay, we\u2019ve got a patient who just bolted out into the ship\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCopy Sickbay, Lieutenant Worf is on the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here I thought this was going to be a quiet night\u2026Crusher thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

She knew she existed, she remembered everything, her parents, growing up on in San Francisco, attending Starfleet and getting assigned to the Enterprise. She remembered everything about her life up until twelve hours ago when she just remembered feeling horribly tired at her station and the feeling of falling before waking up in Sickbay! But if the ship logs said she wasn\u2019t a member of the crew\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer, where are the quarters for Lieutenant Ariel Bachmann?\u201d The officer asked, the growing dread in her voice betraying her confident stride. Ariel knew where she lived, but she had to check\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are no quarters assigned to an officer with that name\u201d Came the cold voice of the computer, the emotionless tone feeling like a knife to Ariel\u2019s heart. She stopped dead in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConfirm occupancy of quarters in Section 6, cabin 17\u201d She whispered just high enough to be heard, her confidant stride slowing with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConfirmed. Cabin is currently unassigned pending crew replacement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo maybe I\u2019m just not on the crew roster? Computer, confirm presence of a Lieutenant Ariel Bachmann, Command Division onboard the Enterprise!\u201d The horrible feeling of truth was closing in all around her, threatening to crush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no officer by that name currently stationed onboard the Enterprise\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer\u2019s words hit her like a punch to the stomach. Ariel felt like she was collapsing from within as she fell against the corridor wall, her knees collapsing as the computer denied her very life. As she sank to the floor, tears welling in her eyes at the thought of her entire existence being nothing more than a cruel lie, the security team rounded the corner, phasers drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight destroyed what was left of her emotional wall, and Ariel began sobbing, her hands grasping the wild mane of blond hair that she always remembered having and loving, despite the effort required to keep it in the bun that Starfleet protocol required. She was real! Why was everything denying her existence when she was right there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security team slowed to a stop, and the large Klingon leading them exchanged uncertain looks with the rest of his team, unsure of how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel barely heard the voice of the doctor as she caught up with them, \u201cWorf stand down.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMy interview with Ariel suggests that she really believes who she is. There\u2019s no hint of Picard ever existing to her. She can recall most of her life in detail, she\u2019s had lovers, friends, a family, a career in Starfleet, and she\u2019s absolutely terrified that none of them will remember her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conference room was sullen, the command staff exchanging looks of concern, confusion as the ship\u2019s counselor gave her report after analyzing the woman they had all thought was their captain, now turned lieutenant with a memory of a different life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould this just be a symptom, maybe something like the brain just trying to reorganize itself after the traumatic experience of being converted to sentient energy?\u201d Riker asked, his posture stiff and rigid in the seat at the head of the table. Picard\u2019s seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, her brain scans are perfectly healthy. The ones I took before she woke up indicated nothing out of the ordinary and the single scan that Nurse Ogawa was able to do implied a heightened state of activity, but nothing aside from what\u2019s normal to waking up somewhere other than you remember falling asleep\u201d Dr. Crusher replied, dashing that particular line of speculation into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen there has to be a reason why Picard\u2019s energy signature would just change not only his form, but his mind from a male captain with years of experience under his belt into a woman who is only a few years out of the Academy! Data, have you discovered anything at all, any way to change her back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am afraid I have not, sir. Due to the very large amount of energy the Enterprise uses, tracing the pathways that the captain may have used to communicate with us is almost impossible. The patterns were almost completely removed by the time I had accessed the energy grid and even the few that I could find were random dead ends.\u201d The android replied, his face and voice still the neutral tone of a machine, but there was a hint of sadness in his facial movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about his backup transporter pattern? Couldn\u2019t we just dematerialize the captain\u2019s current form and then replace it with his backup? It\u2019s been done before\u201d Geordi La Forge said, his engineer mind already hard at work at trying to solve the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would just leave us with problem. She\u2019s just be a woman in her early twenties in the body of a much older man. The problem isn\u2019t with her physical body, those are easily corrected, the problem is with her mental state, and not even now can all Starfleet Medical, do we have the technology to completely rewrite the mind\u201d Dr. Crusher spoke, defeating the one promising idea the crew had for restoring their beloved captain. The officers were silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorf thinks that, should a alternative solution not be found, that we should grant her a mercy death. He feels that it would be better to honor the memory of the captain than let it be sullied by a unproven anomaly\u201d Natasha Yar spoke up, her sullen tone and sheer audacity of the proposal sending a look of horror across the faces of her friends and fellow officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLieutenant Yar, that is the most disrespectful thing I\u2019ve ever heard on any starship I\u2019ve served on and goes completely against the traditions of Starfleet. I have half a mind to remove you AND Worf from duty until you re-educate yourselves on just what this organization is about! Riker spat out, rising from his chair as the suggestion went against everything he stood for, not only as a officer but as a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re all forgetting is that to her, Ariel is who she\u2019s ever been. We may just have to accept the fact that captain Picard may, for all intents and purposes, be gone. I know it may be hard, but even if we had a solution, I\u2019m sure that Ariel would refuse to take part in it. To her, it would be suicide, the very elimination of her soul to bring back a man that she\u2019s never known or served under.\u201d Deanna quickly spoke up hoping to defuse the situation and bring the truth out for everyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeanna surely she can see that she\u2019s not real-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she is real.. From my interview it\u2019s readily apparent that Ariel is determined to make something of her life, even if she isn\u2019t supposed to exist. She exists now, as a fully mature adult with memories of a life that was real to her. There is no memory of captain Picard and the only trace of something not being right to her is not being able to recall who is the captain of the Enterprise. She can name everyone that serves on her shift and even the exact coordinates that were laid in for the planet Parliament. Ariel is a real person, Will, and I think we may all just have to get used to her being as such.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell across the conference room while the stars hung outside, glittering in the deep black of space like millions of candles burning for the lost captain Picard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to agree, commander. While she\u2019s an anomaly created by this whole strange encounter, I can\u2019t authorize what would be a forced euthanization on a perfectly healthy person simply because she doesn\u2019t think the way we want her to. Until a solution can be found to restore Jean-Luc without harming Ariel, I\u2019m asserting my authority as Chief Medical Officer.\u201d Dr. Crusher said, the sadness in her voice apparent, but underlined with the intensity that she had shown towards all of her patients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, I guess that just leaves us with the decision on whether or not we should set up a memorial service for the greatest captain I ever served with, and what we should do with the woman.\u201d Acting captain Riker said, he voice cold and hard as the truth and reality of the situation sank in. \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll finish the mission to Parliament, and then contact Command for further orders. Until then, I want this Ariel to begin integrating with the crew and working her into the shift rotations. Mr. Data, you\u2019re now my first officer, but you will continue to look for alternate solutions to restoring captain Picard. Dismissed.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the month since her \u2018birth\u2019, the lieutenant had quickly learned that the former jovial officer was still not at terms with her existing instead of his captain and friend, Jean-Luc Picard. She was trying to be a good officer and had, in the interest of integrating more easily with the crew, read the man\u2019s dossier. Ariel had been highly impressed at the man\u2019s service history, but the foray had only left her in a deepening depression as his record ended with: Killed in Action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople expected more from her than what she was trained to give. Sure, she proved that she was a competent helmsman and had earned her place without having to go before a Starfleet board of inquiry to prove that she was still capable of performing her duties, but the expectations of Picard were extrememly hard for her to live up to. The senior officers had looked at her for answers she couldn\u2019t give, the growing number of crewmen who knew her for who she used to be gave her a mixture of pity, respect, disdain and outright hostility, even people that she remembered being friends with had openly mocked her when she had tried to \u2018re-introduce\u2019 herself in Ten Forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir?\u201d Ariel replied to the captain, swiveling around to look at the scowling, beared man that was flagged by Data and Deanna in the three large chairs. A chance glance at the disapproving look of Tasha Yar made Ariel curl her toes to keep from visibly flinching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlot a course for the Neutral Zone. Warp seven.\u201d Riker growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye sir, plotting now. Neutral Zone, warp seven\u201d she replied, spinning around to face her station, her manicured fingers dancing over the LCARS screen as she laid in the precise coordinates for the warp jump. \u201cplotted, sir\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t see captain\u2019s habitual hand movement that he had picked up since her \u2018birth\u2019, but she knew he was about to make it. During one of her sessions she had asked Deanna about it, and the Betazoid had replied simply, \u201cIt\u2019s his way of keeping captain Picard alive\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEngage\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a month and I\u2019m still the outcast. I\u2019m just a member of the crew, I don\u2019t expect special treatment, but I\u2019m tired of always being made to feel as if I\u2019m not sentient!\u201d Ariel sighed as she sat on the couch in Deanna\u2019s office, another session underway before heading back to the quarters that were now hers (and had always been, to Ariel). \u201cAnd even from you, it\u2019s this undercurrent of pity that I don\u2019t want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeanna\u2019s face contorted into a frown at that, but she attempted to replace it with her impassive look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Ariel, but your situation, I can\u2019t help but feel sorry for you. You\u2019ve got a tough road ahead and it\u2019s only begun. It will get better but right now captain Riker and most of the staff are grieving for an officer they knew and loved. Riker will come around once he\u2019s accepted you-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how long will that take? The Riker I remember was easy to get along with and made serving not only an honor, but enjoyable! Hell I remember drinking with im in Ten Forward!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s a reality that-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, that never happened. Just like everything else in my life\u2026\u201d Ariel stood up, feeling the anger she\u2019d been repressing for a month rising to the surface. \u201cDeanna, it\u2019s been fun, but I think I\u2019ll find me own answers instead of spending my off duty time being reminded of why people hate me.\u201d The lieutenant hurried to the door, taking a little satisfaction in the alarmed look on the counselor\u2019s face. \u201cThanks\u201d She said curtly, and disappeared into the corridor.</span></div></div>",

A listless soul stranded between what had to be a cruel purgatory of having not existed before last month and having a whole lifetime of memories she could clearly recall. The curious faces of other Starfleet officers and personnel were just a blur as the tall blonde beauty that had been their former captain marched through the halls of the Enterprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Ariel found herself standing in one of the holodecks, surrounded by the dizzying grid of bright yellow on black plating that was covered in holoprojectors so small she\u2019d never be able to see them weave whatever fantasy she could think of to escape her torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer\u201d Ariel called and received the typical chirp of acknowledgement, \u201cTake me to Risa. One of the surf clubs on the beaches. Make the tide challenging but doable\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant the grid vanished, and Ariel could see a endless expanse of tropical blue-green ocean, with large breakers curling in the distance and slamming back into the ocean in a cascade of sound and spray. Warm, comfortable and soothing air whisked across her now nearly bare shoulders and back and making her shiver in the revealing wetsuit as a classic Earth-style surfboard materialized in her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u201d Bachmann said with a grin, \u201cI might not be supposed to exist, but if these memories of mine taught me anything, it\u2019s that nothing feels better than a surf session!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo holograms, a male and female, both human, sauntered over to Ariel, surfboards in hand. \u201cHey, Sheila!\u201d the male cried out with a accent belonging to someone of Austrailian descent. \u201cSurf\u2019s not gonna wait forever love, what say we head out and catch a few before the beach party gets going?\u201d<br>\r\nWith a grin of shining white teeth, Ariel tucked her surfboard under her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio raced towards the water, Ariel grinning ear to ear at the prospect of finally working some of this aggression out her way, and not that prissy counselor\u2019s way when the surprise sound of doors whisking open caused her to pause in mid-stride to look back at the holodeck\u2019s entrance, ignoring the two simulated beings as they splashed into the surf and began swimming out to sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel\u2019s eyes locked on the intruder, and her already simmering temper was both enflamed and extringuished as Captain Riker stood there, a shocked look on his bearded face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simulated waves continued to crash as the two Starfleet personnel stared at each other in unsure silence.</span></div></div>",

Finally getting a moment of downtime where his presence was not required somewhere on the enterprise, and all of the holodecks were either in use or down for repairs. Simply having nothing available didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t look, though. That was at least on of the perks of being captain. If he was lucky, maybe Worf would be having some crazy combat simulation going and he could join in. It had been a hell of a month, and Riker found himself looking forward to the chance to spend some time with one of his senior officers now that he had too many new responsibilities to attend the weekly poker game or the Klingon\u2019s training classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new captain was disappointed, however. Most of the in-use holodecks were nothing interesting. Two romantic dinners, a play, a field trip of children walking through a simulated Smithsonian on Earth and other banal activities that Riker had no interest or right to join. That left just one more, and Riker steeled himself for something that was either boring, or crossing the ground between \u2018captain\u2019s right\u2019s\u2019 and being downright nosy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the final holodeck whisked open, and the captain was greeted to the rolling of waves, the sound of seagulls cawing in the wind, and the backside of a tall, blonde beauty wrapped in a red wetsuit, surfboard in hand and already glistening with sea-spray as she followed two holograms into the artificial sea. Riker felt a stirring in him as he admired the woman, and as she turned around, that stirring suddenly became a tight knot in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lt. Bachmann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two officers stared at each other, Ariel\u2019s blue eyes locked with his own, almost unblinking as she was sprayed with holographic water, and as artificial wind  tossed her normally tightly bound long blond hair around like a treetop full of leaves on a windy day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrash. The captain\u2019s heart beat three times as fast as he fought with conflicting emotions of desire, lust, hatred and anxiousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBachmann, here, looking so damned attractive it was like she appeared out of a holo-flick. Like she appeared out of nowhere and killed Picard. Not her fault, it was a glitch caused by uncontrollable circumstances. She\u2019s a mistake that killed your friend and she\u2019s no more real than the rest of the stuff on the holodeck. She\u2019s a lving breathing woman and part of my crew. A crew that she murdered her way into. I am the captain and I have to acknowledge that Picard is gone and in his place is a woman who deserves both respect and pity for what we\u2019ve put her through. Picard would expect better of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker fought the internal battle with his thoughts as his bitterness and sense of loss fought with his nobler qualities, and finally came a decision right as Ariel opened her mouth to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLieutenant Bachmann! I didn\u2019t know you surfed!\u201d He said, his old jovial smile spreading across his face through force of habit. In truth he had no idea how this would turn out. He regretted speaking the moment she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure when they were creating my official life, I must have left out some of the smaller details amidst the emotional trauma\u201d Ariel said coldly, a look of hate nad fear in her eyes as she turned to face him completely. She took a little solace in the way the man winced at his own poor choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, well.\u201d Riker said, struggling to reply in a way that was cordial. He held his arms wide open in a show of abject awkwardness. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what to say, Lieutenant. Other than the fact that you have me at a uncomfortable disadvantage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you, captain?\u201d The blonde beauty replied as she stuck the surfboard in the sand and leaned against it, the simulated surf splashing against her legs, the wind splaying her long golden locks across her face in jagged lines of sunlit brilliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker felt that odd feeling return as his stomach slowly attempted to unknot itself. Even if he wasn\u2019t welcome, he thought, at least there wasn\u2019t going to be a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, lieutenant\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, I\u2019m off-duty. Ariel is fine\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Bachmann, then. I was hoping to get some relaxation time in, I\u2019m got the afternoon currently free of any major duties and I thought I\u2019d treat myself to the holodeck\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy barging in when the display says it\u2019s occupied?\u201d A small smile spread across her sculpted lips and revealing the perfectly white teeth to sparkle in the artificial sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say? I was curious.\u201d Riker responded, crossing his arms as he tried hard not to openly stare at the woman. It was so strange to see her here off the bridge, and so charmingly disarmed. Before this moment they hadn\u2019t said more than ten words to each other, their emotional shields raised to prevent either of them from saying something they would regret in a already tense work environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you going to join me or spare us both the embarrassment of me kicking your ass at surfing?\u201d Ariel smirked as she said it. It felt like old times again, friendly banter between officers. But they aren\u2019t old times, the dark part of her mind whispered. They never existed for anyone else. Shut up shut up shut up. Just let me have this. Please. Ariel\u2019s face betrayed her own inner conflict as she brushed her runaway hair out of her face and tucked it behind an ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a challenge, lieutenant\u201d Riker replied, a grin spreading over his bearded face as he felt the competitive spirit in him awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComputer\u201d Ariel called out, \u201cGive the captain some appropriate dress wear. And a board.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He soon spots a glass on the table that appears to be dissolving. \"It worked. The nanites are replicating using the raw materials of the glass\", he thinks to himself.

As the water rushes over his hand the tingling does not stop. In fact it seems to be spreading up his arm. Wesley looks on in shock as his fingers begin to change. They are becoming slender, smaller, and softer. The changes quickly start moving up his arm. As the tingling begins spreading past his arm to the rest of his body he knows he's in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Wesley runs down the corridor towards sickbay the change begins spreading even faster. By the time he makes it through the doors to sickbay. His arm has completely trans formed along with his neck, half his chest, and part of his face.

As long as we get him into containment before they do we can contain the ones that infected him. The others that came onto the bridge left with Commander Riker. This is just a guess but they seem to be strongly attracted to males with high levels of testosteron. That is why they went after Work and Commander Riker. Because of your age they didn't go after you this time\". The Captain looks a little annoyed at the comment about his age, but moves on. \"Data, where is the turbo lift with Commander Riker at\", the captain asks. Data turns and says, \"I took the liberty of stopping the turbo lift between levels 22 and 23. I have recalibrated the sensors and detect a large concentration of nanites within the turbolift. Correction, they seem to be leaving the turbolift now. I am attempting to erect forcefields to contain them. I have managed to contain some of them, but many have escaped\". \"Bring Mr. Riker back to the bridge\", the Captain orders annoyed that Riker tool off like he did.

This is when Weasley interupts with, \"They used the material from the uniform to build more nanites\". The shakes his head and says, \"Mr. Riker if the doctor says you're ok the you're ordered to get another uniform asd report back to the bridge\". \"I'm not fit for duty\", Riker cries!

Alas, the sensor can't detect an individual nanite, and once a cluster is formed and then it is too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly looks to her son... daughter. She looks up her eyes filled with fear. Her hands cradling her new breasts to stop the unfamiliar, unsettling movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nanites seem to have given her a very female form. Although her daughter is a full head shorter than her, she has larger breasts that swing rather dramatically. Her hips stretch out her male uniform in way that was never imagined. While the waist hangs loose with folds of fabric wrinkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer professionel, experienced eye estimates them as being a D-cup, although it is difficult to say as her uniform doesn't support them properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey make it to a turbo-lift... \"Mom...\" her plaintive cry tears at the doctor's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she sees her daughter staring at her own hands, as she holds them out in fear and denial. She sees the liquid in her outstretched palms.

Confused, she had neutralised the nanites before leaving Sick-bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alarming beeping was coming from the scanner. It was detecting massively elevated hormone levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a rare curse, \"The nanites are gone, but your body is still adapting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like an eternity, but the lift doors finally hiss open.</span></div></div>",

Dr. Crusher directs her eyes away from -his- crotch. Captain Picard.... well it has to be him... she's the only one with four pips on her collar is a different matter.

He softly whispered to her \"Daddy's going to get Mommy, sweetie. We won't be gone long.\"<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant, she's asleep,\" remarked the EMH, \"I don't think she can hear you.\"<br>\r\nTom lightly rolled his eyes and said \"I know, Doc. That's the idea. I don't even want her to <b>know</b> that her mother could be in danger.\"<br>\r\n\"Right,\" was all the EMH said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to Sickbay opened as Tom approached them and he quickly departed. Just as soon as he left, Kes walked in with Samantha Wildman and her daughter Naomi.<br>\r\n\"Hi, Tom,\" said Ensign Wildman.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sam,\" he said in response.<br>\r\n\"Doctor, I have those diagnostics finished,\" Kes told the EMH as she held out a dataPad to him.<br>\r\n\"I can see that, Kes, but my hands are a little full right now,\" remarked The Doctor, gesturing to the sleeping child in his arms.<br>\r\n\"Here, I'll take her off your hands for you, Doc,\" Samantha said, gently taking Miral out of the Doctor's arms.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ensign,\" said The Doctor as he took the datapad from Kes in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it true what they said about B'Elanna?\" asked Naomi in interest, \"Is she really down there without any clothes on?\"<br>\r\n\"Naomi!\" Samantha warned her daughter.<br>\r\n\"I suppose so,\" The Doctor told her nonetheless, \"Fortunately, we're going to find her and remedy that problem.\"<br>\r\n\"I just hope she's alright,\" said Kes.<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about it,\" said The Doctor, \"B'Elanna is a very strong woman.

She continued trying to resist them, but had no luck, given her current state.<br>\r\nEventually, they arrived at a large chamber where a few more aliens were standing guard along the walls. The chamber appeared to connect to serve as a front room, as it led to a number of different hallways.<br>\r\nIn the center of the room, there was an alien sitting at a desk. Like all the others, he was fully clothed from head to toe.<br>\r\nThe alien that had diapered B'Elanna approached the desk and told the seated alien \"Commander Ryntir, we've got a visitor.\"<br>\r\nThe seated alien looked up as the other two brought B'Elanna closer. B'Elanna was still shocked, confused, and enraged by the treatment the aliens gave her. But at least the universal translator was working now, as she could understand what they said perfectly.<br>\r\nThe alien at the desk removed his headgear. He looked like a human, only his skin was slightly lilac in color and he had a few protrusions on various parts of his face. He looked B'Elanna over, from her long, athletic legs to her firmly-built arms to her D-cup breasts to her lightly-ridged forehead, there was nothing about her physique that seemed to displease him.<br>\r\n\"She is an ideal specimen, Mr. Coswalma\" commented Ryntir, nodding in approval, \"Remove her gag.\"<br>\r\nCoswalma turned to B'Elanna and untied the piece of cloth around her mouth. As he pulled it away, she growled angrily and then shouted \"What the hell do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n\"Neither of those topics is important,\" said Ryntir calmly, \"Right now, I'm the one asking the questions. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres of the Federation Starship Voyager,\" she answered through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n\"Voyager?\" said Ryntir, \"Did you come here to spy on us?\"<br>\r\n\"No, we came here because we needed some of the planet's natural resources to replenish our ship's power supply,\" B'Elanna answered, \"I do not even know what you do here. But release me now or you will risk starting a conflict with my people!\"<br>\r\n\"We are well-hidden underground, and we have several ways off this planet,\" Ryntir said calmly, \"It will take more than petty threats to intimidate us.\"<br>\r\n\"I assume you used a transporter to come down onto the planet?\" Coswalma inquired.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did,\" she growled, \"How do you know that?\"<br>\r\n\"We have a program up that blocks anything non-organic from beaming down into the planet's atmosphere,\" Coswalma clarified, \"It's just our luck that the first person to come down was a female.\"<br>\r\n\"What the hell does that mean?\" B'Elanna demanded.<br>\r\n\"No questions,\" said Ryntir, \"Mr. Coswalma, take her to a cell. We'll have the inspectors look her over later.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" nodded Coswalma. He gestured for the two guards to lead B'Elanna down another hallway. After a while, they arrived at a thick door that was guarded by two more of their people. Coswalma opened the door and the two aliens forced B'Elanna inside. Just before he closed the door, he used an electronic device to unlock her shackles. The moment after her hands were free, the door was closed and locked behind her.<br>\r\nB'Elanna tried to knock the door down, but alas, it was too strongly fortified. She was forced to just give into the situation and try to contemplate another means of escape.<br>\r\nShe turned around and saw that</span></div></div>",

It was quite a large room; it had to be at least twenty-five feet long and twenty-five feet wide.<br>\r\nThere appeared to be about thirty other people in the cell with her, all of them humanoid. She looked a little more closely and her night vision gradually got better. Soon, she was able to determine that she was sharing the room with people from at least a dozen different species. Some of them seemed alarmed by her presence, some seemed to be protective of the others, and some seemed to be nonchalant about their new cellmate.<br>\r\nBefore long, B'Elanna noticed two odd things: All of her cellmates were female, and - like her - they were all wearing nothing but white disposable diapers.<br>\r\nAfter a minute of silence, one of the women stepped forward and stopped a few feet in front of B'Elanna, as if she was going to tell her something.<br>\r\nBut she didn't say a word. So B'Elanna decided to open the conversation \"I am B'Elanna Torres of the United Federation of Planets. I do not wish to have a conflict with any of you.\"<br>\r\nThe woman remained quiet. B'Elanna took time to study her. Her skin was somewhat ochre in color, she had long brown hair braided, and she was almost a foot taller than the half-Klingon. Despite being so tall, her diaper came up past her navel.<br>\r\nAfter another minute of silence, she lightly smiled and held out her hand. B'Elanna took it and shook it as the woman said \"I am Farine. Let me assure you; you are among friends.\"<br>\r\nJust then, another stepped up behind Farine. She looked much like her, only she appeared to be half her age and a foot shorter than her. She placed her arms on Farine's arms and told her \"Mother, are you certain we can trust her?\"<br>\r\nFarine turned to her daughter and responded sharply \"Nimaly, she is a prisoner just like the rest of us! What makes you so suspicious all of a sudden?\"<br>\r\nNimaly shrugged and said \"I do not know, Mother. It's just that... I've never seen a species like hers before and I've never heard of a 'United Federation of Planets.'\"<br>\r\n\"That's because my home is in the Alpha Quadrant,\" B'Elanna informed the young woman.<br>\r\n\"The Alpha Quadrant?\" said Farine, \"That's over thirty thousand light-years away. What are you doing all the way out here?\"<br>\r\nB'Elanna was not looking forward to being asked a multitude of questions, as she preferred to be the one asking them.

So they opened up this sex slave market long ago. Originally they just lured women in with false offers of jobs, new homes, or vacation resorts. Now they find it more economical to just kidnap any passing women and force them to take part in their marketing ploys.\"<br>\r\nB'Elanna was horrified. A sex slave operation in the Delta Quadrant that SHE was involved in?<br>\r\n\"I can't be sold as a slave to one of those bastards!\" she shouted, \"I have a family! I have a husband and a baby girl!\"<br>\r\n\"Are they on your ship?\" queried Farine.<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" B'Elanna replied, \"In fact, my husband and I are both members of the vessel's senior staff. And my daughter was only born a couple months ago. She's still in diapers.\"<br>\r\n\"In case you haven't noticed, we all are, as well,\" Nimaly drily commented.<br>\r\n\"That's another thing I wanted to ask about,\" said B'Elanna, looking down at the thick garment between her legs, \"What's with the diapers anyway? Is that just their standard dress code for all their slaves?\"<br>\r\n\"Oddly enough, it is,\" responded Farine, \"The Makilites like to keep their slaves in nothing but diapers for a variety of reasons. One is to remind them that they are not their own masters. Another is to keep them submissive and servile. A third is because... the males find the sight of a grown woman in diapers to be very invigorating for whatever reason.\"<br>\r\nNormally, B'Elanna would be disgusted. But she actually knew what Farine was talking about. \"I'm familiar with this type of interest. In my galaxy, it's mainly known as 'diaper fetish.' But it goes by several different names, such as 'infantilism' and 'AB/DL.'\"<br>\r\n\"Peculiar,\" commened Farine.<br>\r\n\"You know, the diapers are not too bad once you get used to them,\" Nimaly commented, \"I just wish we could change out of them everyone once in a while.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked B'Elanna.<br>\r\n\"All of our diapers essentially just like normal with three notable exceptions,\" stated Farine, \"All of them are the direct result of a small computer chip that has been implanted somewhere in the waistband of each one. First off, once the diapers are put on us, they modify themselves to fit our specific measurements. Secondly, whenever we actually have to... use them, they automatically clean themselves. And third... they cannot be removed by the wearer.\"<br>\r\nB'Elanna found the first two points to be rather interesting. But she was a little concerned about the third one. She looked down at her diaper and put her fingers on one of the tapes. She tried to peel it off, but it wouldn't move. She tried harder; still she had no luck. She tried pulling, tearing, ripping, and many other methods. The diaper clung tightly to her crotch and bottom without creating so much as a tiny split in the waistband. She had to accept it now; she was trapped in this diaper!<br>\r\nShe sighed and brushed her hair out of her forehead. She looked at Farine and asked her \"How long have you all been here?\"<br>\r\n\"Various lengths of time for all of us,\" Farine replied, \"Some have been here for slightly under a year, while some have been here for only a few weeks. My daughter and I arrived here about three months. It's very unlucky that you had to be taken today.\"<br>\r\n\"Why today especially?\" asked B'Elanna.<br>\r\n\"Because today is their annual expo,\" answered Farine, \"Once a year, the Makilite workers on this planet take all of their captive women and put them on display for their 'guests.' They sell all of them individually to the highest bidders. Had you been captured by the Makilites tomorrow, it would have been a full year for you to plan escape. Now you only have about four hours.\"<br>\r\n\"What if I haven't managed to escape by then?\" asked B'Elanna.<br>\r\n\"Then you might never see your husband or your daughter again,\" Farine told her straightforwardly.<br>\r\nB'Elanna was shocked. She could not believe that there was a chance she would be separated from Tom and Miral in such a way. However, she knew Janeway would never let something like this happen.<br>\r\n\"My Captain never leaves a member of the crew behind,\" she thought aloud, \"My crewmates will come for me, regardless of how much force they're up against.\"<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope they'll know what they're doing,\" said Nimaly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But it appears to be Borg. The ship seems to be landing at the spot where we found our newest guest. What are your orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assemble a squad and head outside,\" Ryntir commanded him, \"Whenever the ship lands, ambush the crew. But set your weapons on stun and only use them if the crew puts up any resistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" Coswalma nodded. He looked around the room and gestured for six of the guards to follow him. They were all armed with phaser rifles. They followed Coswalma down the same passage as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the Delta Flyer, Tom was still piloting the ship through the electromagnetic storms. They were quite violent, but they were merely an inconvenient obstacle for a pilot of Tom's prestige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're glad that I came along with you now?\" Tom remarked without looking over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given the Commander's previous history in piloting shuttles, I am inclined to agree that having you along makes the passage considerable less hazardous to our safety,\" Seven of Nine told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, already!\" Chakotay yelled in frustration. So far, he had been taunted about his piloting skills by three people that day: first Tom, then Tuvok, and now Seven of Nine. He knew that he had crashed more shuttles than any other member of the crew, but in the past year he had only wrecked one so far, \"Let's just concentrate on arriving on the planet's surface. How much farther is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only about ten miles,\" Tom answered, \"We'll get down there soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the descent was quiet. Soon, the Delta Flyer arrived on the planet's surface. Tom brought it down to the coordinates where B'Elanna was supposed to have arrived at. Once the ship was on the ground, Seven of Nine tapped her combadge and said \"Delta Flyer to Voyager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came no response. Seven of Nine looked down at her combadge in slight confusion and tapped it again. \"Voyager, respond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChakotay and Tom turned to her. \"What's wrong?\" asked the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The signal won't get through,\" Seven of Nine answered, \"The electromagnetic interference must be blocking the transmission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll work on fixing that later,\" Chakotay decided, \"For now, we have more important things to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I second that,\" said Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChakotay stood up and said \"Seven, you and I will take the harvesting equipment and gather up as many crystals as we can find. Tom, you go and look for B'Elanna. Report in when you find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tell me twice, Commander,\" said the Conn Officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander, might I suggest that we take along some side-arms?\" Seven of Nine remarked, \"The computer might have made an error, but I believe I detected a handful of lifeforms on the planet's surface momentarily just before we landed. The Voyager detected no lifeforms when we arrived in orbit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they register as Human, Klingon, or Human-Klingon hybrid?\" asked Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, another form of life,\" Seven responded, \"There may be someone other than Lieutenant Torres out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChakotay shrugged and reasoned \"No harm in being prepared.\" They each took a phaser and attached them to their belts. Then they stepped outside and used a tricorder to take some readings of the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very little plant life, virtually no form of animal life,\" Seven announced her findings, \"But there appears to be an abundance of raw minerals. There's a deposit of crystals a few meters away that should be more than enough to replenish our power supply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, let's get to work,\" said Chakotay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Seven went one way to find the crystals while Tom went in search of his wife.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few minutes later, Chakotay and Seven of Nine had gathered up six crates' worth of crystals; more than enough to keep the Voyager powered for thirty years.<br>\r\nJust as they finished loading the crates and the harvesting equipment onto the Delta Flyer, Tom came back.<br>\r\n\"No luck finding her?\" said Chakotay as he and Seven of Nine stood near the entrance to the small ship.<br>\r\n\"Nope, I've searched as far as a mile in every direction, but there's so trace of her.\" Tom replied glumly.<br>\r\n\"We just finished harvesting the crystals, Lieutenant,\" said Seven, \"I suppose we may as well help you search, as the Voyager can last another five hours without a new supply.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you for that,\" Tom smirked.<br>\r\nJust then, Chakotay happened to look up and saw something move about ten feet behind Tom. He quickly realized it was a humanoid figure armed with a phaser rifle. And the figure had its rifle aimed directly at Tom!<br>\r\n\"Tom, get down!\" shouted Chakotay as he whipped out his phaser.<br>\r\nTom was taken by surprise by the Commander's sudden outburst, but he quickly did as he was told and dropped to the ground. Chakotay aimed his phaser at the figure and fired. A moment later, the figure stumbled and collapsed.<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after this, another figure showed up and fired at Chakotay. Chakotay was hit directly in the chest and fell backwards into the Delta Flyer.<br>\r\nWorking quickly, Tom drew his phaser and fired three shots at the second figure. Two of them hit his target.<br>\r\nSeven of Nine drew her phaser and helped Tom to his feet. The two of them looked around the area, expecting to see more figures.<br>\r\n\"See to the Commander,\" Seven told Tom, \"I'll provide cover-fire if need be.\"<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Tom. He turned around and knelt in front of Chakotay. He tapped him firmly on the shoulders, trying to revive him.<br>\r\nSeven kept a watch out for any signs of movement in the vicinity. Just then, someone held a phaser up to the back of her head and said firmly \"Don't move.\"<br>\r\nSeven of Nine slowly raised her hands up in surrender, but then she whipped around and struck the third figure on the neck. He grunted as she punched him in the chest.<br>\r\nJust then, three more figures came out of the fog and fired at Seven of Nine simultaneously. Normally, Seven of Nine was resistant to phaser fire on stun. But three phaser blasts at once was too much even for her. She groaned and dropped to her hands and knees.<br>\r\n\"Seven!\" Tom called out, concerned. He picked up his phaser and pointed it at the three figures.<br>\r\nFor a minute, no one moved. It was as if both sides were waiting for the other to fire first.<br>\r\nThen Coswalma appeared next to his men and called out to Tom \"Enough of this! Lower your weapon now or I will have my men open fire on you.\"<br>\r\nTom knew he was outnumbered, but he did not like the prospect of surrendering. All the same, he lowered his phaser and dropped it to the ground.<br>\r\nSeven of Nine was still kneeling at the entrance to the Delta Flyer. Tom bent over to help her up, but at his sudden movement, the three armed men took aim at him.<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to help her up!\" he called out in anger.<br>\r\nCoswalma had his men stand down to let Tom help Seven of Nine get back on her feet.<br>\r\n\"See to our wounded,\" he ordered the others. These three men went to the other three men and helped them back to their feet. The stun blast seemed to have worn off on the first two; the third one was the only one who was notably injured, due to his scuffle with Seven of Nine.<br>\r\nOnce all his men were armed once more, Coswalma approached the Delta Flyer and said \"Who are you and what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n\"I am Lieutenant Tom Paris of the Federation Starship Voyager,\" Tom replied, \"These are two of my crewmates, Seven of Nine and Commander Chakotay, our First Officer.\"<br>\r\nCoswalma looked Seven of Nine over. Her catsuit clung tight to most of her body, leaving much to the imagination. Her hair was slightly messed up and some was dangling in front of her left eye. Coswalma lifted his hand and brushed the hair out of her face. That was when he caught full sight of her optical implant. She raised her left hand to swat his hand away, inadvertently letting him get a look at the implants surrounding the back of her hand.<br>\r\n\"Is she a Borg?\" Coswalma asked Tom.<br>\r\n\"I was, but I was disconnected from the Collective-\" Seven began.<br>\r\n\"I was asking you!\" Coswalma interrupted, \"I was asking him!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, what she said,\" Tom replied, \"She isn't anymore, though. She's a member of our ship's crew.\"<br>\r\nCoswalma rubbed his chin in interest and looked over the Delta Flyer and its three crewmembers. He decided to</span></div></div>",

I'm going to call this in.\"<br>\r\nWhile the other Makilites kept watch over the three Humans, Coswalma pulled out his communicator and said into it \"Commander, we've arrived at the ship and we've successfully apprehended all three members of its crew.\"<br>\r\n\"Very good, Mr. Coswalma,\" Ryntir responded, \"Are they similar in appearance to our newest guest?\"<br>\r\n\"Mostly,\" stated Coswalma, \"Only they do not have any ridges on their foreheads. And one of them is a former Borg drone.\"<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" said Ryntir, \"Genders?\"<br>\r\n\"The Borg is female, but the other two are male,\" said Coswalma, \"They seem to be from the same ship as our 'guest.'\"<br>\r\nThat statement abruptly caught Tom's attention. He pointed his finger at Coswalma and said \"Just hold it right there! What have you done with my wife? Where is she, you bastards?!\"<br>\r\nThe other guards kept their rifles focused on him to keep him in line. Coswalma raised an eyebrow in interest and said \"There's one more thing you should know, sir. One of the men claims to be the husband of our guest.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, that is rather inconvenient,\" commented Ryntir, \"Find out if they were doing anything else down here and then bring two of them to me.\"<br>\r\n\"Which two?\" asked Coswalma.<br>\r\n\"I don't care, just make certain one of them is the Borg.\" Ryntir responded, \"Bring along either of the men with her.\"<br>\r\n\"And what of the other one?\"<br>\r\n\"Send him back to his ship with a message.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" Coswalma put away his communicator and approached the three Voyager crewmembers.<br>\r\n\"What were you doing here in the first place?\" he demanded.<br>\r\n\"Our ship's power source was quickly draining out,\" Seven of Nine answered, \"We needed to find a strong deposit of dilithium crystals before our current supply completely deteriorated.\"<br>\r\n\"When our Chief Engineer - who just so happens to be my wife - materialized down here without any clothing, we were sent to find her and gather the crystals ourselves,\" Tom continued for her, \"Now what have you done with her?\"<br>\r\n\"Your wife has not been harmed, Lieutenant Paris,\" Coswalma assured him, \"However, if you want her back, you and your Borg friend here must come with me to see the head of our enterprise. You can have all the crystals you want, they are meaningless to us. But you must come with us.\"<br>\r\nTom gazed at Seven of Nine out of the corner of his eye, as if waiting for her take on the idea.<br>\r\n\"With the Commander unconscious and contact with Voyager severed, you are the highest ranking officer presently, Lieutenant,\" Seven of Nine reminded him, \"You make the decisions down here.\"<br>\r\nTom sighed and turned back to Coswalma, telling him \"Very well, I am at your mercy. But what about Commander Chakotay?\"<br>\r\n\"He will not be harmed,\" Coswalma assured him. He then turned to four of his men and told them \"You four take our new guests to Ryntir.\" He told the others \"You two, stay with me. We'll wait here until Commander Chakotay revives.\"<br>\r\nHis men all agreed to this request. Four of them - including the injured one - led Seven of Nine and Tom towards the entrance to the hidden caverns.

Coswalma started to get an idea. He asked \"How many people are on your ship?\"<br>\r\n\"About 150,\" Chakotay answered.<br>\r\n\"And what is the approximate ratio of men-to-women?\" asked Coswalma.<br>\r\n\"About half and half, perhaps a few more women than men,\" said Chakotay.<br>\r\n\"Fascinating,\" commented Coswalma, \"You share an equal opportunity with women in your quadrant?\"<br>\r\n\"That's what the United Federation of Planets is based upon,\" Chakotay answered.<br>\r\nCoswalma shrugged and said \"Tell your Captain that we will contact her soon and negotiate with her.\"<br>\r\n\"What assurance do I have that you'll keep your word?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll let you bring these two gentlemen along with you,\" Coswalma responded, gesturing at his two guards, \"You can hold on to them for as long as we hold on to your crewmen.\"<br>\r\n\"You swear it?\" said Chakotay.<br>\r\n\"I sweat it,\" said Coswalma.<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a while, Chakotay sighed and agreed to the arrangement.<br>\r\nThe two Makilite guards stepped into the Delta Flyer with him and watched as he made his way to the front of the cockpit. While his back was turned, the two Makilites turned to their Boss and deviously winked at him through their goggles. He grinned back wickedly in response.<br>\r\nShortly after this, Chakotay sealed up the door to the Delta Flyer and the two Makilites took their seats behind him on the upper platform. They lowered their weapons and waited for him to start up the engines.<br>\r\nSoon, the Delta Flyer rose into the air and ascended towards the Voyager.<br>\r\nAfter the small ship disappeared from his sight, Coswalma turned around and walked back towards the entrance to the underground labyrinth.<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Ryntir looked up at them as they entered.

What's important to me is this: where is my wife?\"<br>\r\n\"Your wife is being cared for, Mr...\" Ryntir said calmly.<br>\r\n\"Paris.

Least of all to thugs like you!\"<br>\r\n\"We are not thugs, sir,\" Ryntir corrected him. \"We are merely businessmen. We have to work for a living just like you. Even if that means doing a few unethical things along the way.\"<br>\r\n\"Regardless of that, I want to see my wife, and I want to see her now!\" Tom demanded.<br>\r\nRyntir sat thinking for a moment, and then waved his hand once and said \"Why not?

Then Ryntir ran his hand along Seven of Nine's cheek and kissed her other cheek lightly. She did not flinch, but she was inwardly disturbed.<br>\r\n\"Get her into the appropriate attire and then let me know when you are finished,\" Ryntir ordered one of the guards, \"I want to see how she looks in it.\"<br>\r\nThe guard nodded and gestured for Seven to follow him.

Some of them had successful jobs and companies before they had been kidnapped by the Makilites.<br>\r\nJust then, they heard a heavy knock on the door and one of the guards called out \"Step away from the door! We have another one coming in!\"<br>\r\nNot wanting to face the guards' wrath, the women kept their distance from the door. It opened up and a figure was roughly pushed inside. After this, the door was closed and locked again.<br>\r\nSeveral of the women gazed anxiously at the figure, not knowing what to expect. Then it turned around and faced them. The look of surprise on his face was priceless.<br>\r\nB'Elanna quickly realized who it was. \"Tom?\" she said hopefully.<br>\r\nHe saw his wife and said \"Is that you, B'Elanna?\"<br>\r\nShe nodded and ran - or rather, waddled quickly - over to him. She embraced him tightly, almost taking his breath away. After a moment, he hugged her back. He let his arms go a little lower until he reached a few inches above her bottom. That was when he felt something strange. He came apart from his wife and looked down. He seemed alarmed for a moment, and then he asked her \"B'Elanna... are you wearing a diaper?\"<br>\r\nShe sighed and rolled her eyes, saying \"Yes, thank you for noticing.\"<br>\r\nTom looked around and saw that all eyes were on him. He quickly noted that every person in the room was female, they were all wearing nothing but diapers, and some were eying him with a look of lust in their eyes.<br>\r\n\"Why are some people looking at me like they're cats in heat?\" he asked nervously.<br>\r\n\"You'll have to forgive them, sir,\" Farine told him, \"Many of these women haven't seen a man other than the guard for several months. Being away from the opposite gender so long brings out primal cravings in some women.\"<br>\r\nTom scoffed and said \"If I got here four or five years ago, I probably would have been the luckiest man alive. But that was then and this is now, and now I'm not a free man.\"<br>\r\nB'Elanna glared at him, almost in anger. He just laughed and said \"Relax, sweetie. Right now, I don't feel anything for anyone but you. You know I would never cheat on you.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to know that, Tom,\" she said, smirking back at him. She hugged him again.<br>\r\nAs they came apart, Farine said \"B'Elanna, you are very lucky to have such an affectionate and dedicated man for a husband.\"<br>\r\nB'Elanna turned around and asked \"What do you mean, Farine? What about your husband?\"<br>\r\nFarine just scoffed regretfully and told her \"It's because of my husband that my daughter and I are here in the first place. You see, my husband is an avid gambler. He spends a great deal of his time in Makilite casinos. A few months ago, he had accumulated so much debt that he sold me and Nimaly into slavery to cover it.\"<br>\r\nA look of disgust came across B'Elanna's face. \"That's despicable.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, my mother and I are glad that at the very least, we'll never have to see him again,\" Nimaly remarked, \"The man was a disgrace.\"<br>\r\nB'Elanna turned back to Tom and said \"I almost forgot to ask you; how's Miral doing?\"<br>\r\n\"She's fine,\" Tom replied, \"I left her with The Doctor before we came down to get you.\"<br>\r\n\"Your daughter?\" assumed Farine.<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" said B'Elanna over her shoulder. She then asked Tom \"Who all came down with you?\"<br>\r\n\"Just Chakotay and Seven of Nine,\" Tom replied, \"I think Chakotay was forced to return to the Voyager by Coswalma. I can only imagine what Ryntir wants with Seven.\"<br>\r\n\"I may have an idea or two,\" Farine commented.<br>\r\nWhat now?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hallways over, Seven of Nine was being escorted to a room by the guard. It happened to be the guard she had injured outside. One peculiar thing about this guard was that he was the cliche dissenting reluctant worker in his illegal organization. But Seven of Nine did not know that yet.<br>\r\nThis man was quite young, even a little younger than Seven of Nine herself. He seemed to be a little uncomfortable with what he was about to do.<br>\r\nHe led Seven of Nine into an empty room. There was a bed and a dress on it. He had Seven of Nine stand in the center of the room. He made his way over to the dresser, but stumbled before he could reach it.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Seven of Nine asked, sounding slightly concerned.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" he replied, \"But I must say, you put up quite a fight!\"<br>\r\nHe then opened up the top drawer on the dresser and removed a large diaper from it. He put his gun to the side and approached Seven of Nine. Holding the garment up to her, he asked \"Do you know what this is?\"<br>\r\nShe replied nonchalantly \"It is a disposable diaper. It's purpose is to serve as a temporary replacement for children who are not toilet trained or for people who are incontinent.\"<br>\r\n\"That is true,\" nodded the guard, \"But here, it serves another purpose. Here, all our female 'guests' are required to wear them and nothing else.\"<br>\r\nSeven of Nine raised an eyebrow at that. \"That would be quite unnecessary; I am not incontinent.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, but my commander wants you to wear it,\" he told her, \"Believe me, I myself am not too certain about this either, but it is better to just go along with what Ryntir asks of you than to disappoint or upset him.\"<br>\r\nSeven of Nine shrugged and said \"Very well. I will comply for now.\"<br>\r\nShe reached out to take the diaper from him, but the guard pulled it away and said \"I must be the one to diaper you.\"<br>\r\n\"I am fully capable of putting it on myself,\" she said.<br>\r\n\"I'm certain you are, but this is protocol,\" he informed her, \"I must put it on you.\"<br>\r\nSeven of Nine felt a little uncomfortable at that prospect, but ultimately agreed and said \"I will still comply.\"<br>\r\nThe guard nodded and said \"Remove your uniform, please.\"<br>\r\nSeven of Nine removed both of her boots and set them on the ground. Then she slowly raised her hands to the top of her catsuit and brought the zipper down the center of her chest as far as it would go. Then she slipped both of her arms out of it, revealing her firm, well-developed D-cup breasts. After this, she let her catsuit drop to her feet, leaving her naked in front of the guard.<br>\r\n\"Lie down on the bed, please,\" he requested.<br>\r\nShe nodded and laid down on the bed. As the guard knelt in front of her and unfolded the diaper, she commented \"I notice that you do not seem to take such pleasure in your work like most of your colleagues.\"<br>\r\n\"You are rather observant,\" he said, \"Raise your hips please.\"<br>\r\nAs Seven of Nine allowed him to slide the diaper under her, she said \"Why is that?\"<br>\r\n\"Truth be told, I was never that eager to join this organization,\" he explained as he brought the front of the diaper up firmly between her legs.<br>\r\n\"Then why did you join it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Because my father wanted me to,\" he told her as he began fastened the tapes up on both sides, \"He felt that it would be an easy and quick way for our family to get rich.<br>\r\n\"It must be a very successful industry,\" noted Seven.<br>\r\n\"It is,\" he told her as he patted the front of her diaper. Then he stood up and held out his hands to her. She took them and allowed him to pull her onto her feet.<br>\r\n\"How much income do you make?\" she asked as he inspected the front of her diaper closely.<br>\r\n\"Enough to keep me and my family living the high life with the aristocrats,\" he told her as he turned her around to examine the back side of her diaper. Once he was finished, he patted the back of her diaper and said \"There you go. How does that feel?\"<br>\r\nSeven of Nine looked down at her diapered body. She was actually quite amazed by the sensation the thick, soft padded garment gave her.<br>\r\n\"It feels... quite comfortable,\" she said honestly.<br>\r\n\"I need to go get my boss,\" he told her, \"Can I trust you to stay here?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, where could I possibly go?\" she reasoned.<br>\r\nThe guard smiled, patted her diapered bottom, picked up his phaser rifle, and opened the door to the room.<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Seven urged him, \"What is your name?\"<br>\r\n\"My name?\" said the guard. He seemed confused by why she would want to know that. Then he told her \"My name is Irtindet.\"<br>\r\nSeven of Nine nodded, lightly smiling at him, and said \"My name is not really just Seven of Nine. My real name is Annika Hansen.\"<br>\r\n\"That's a beautiful name,\" said the young guard.<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Seven said gratefully.<br>\r\nThe guard left the room for few minutes. She was left alone to contemplate the diaper she was wearing. It actually did feel very soft and comfortable to her, and it caressed every part of her crotch and bottom. However, the best part was the stimulating feeling it gave her at the part that overlapped her clitoris. She placed her hand there and rubbed it for a moment. She momentarily felt extreme bliss. She rubbed herself again longer, and the sensation felt incredible to her. She sat back down on the bed and rubbed herself harder. She started sweating and breathing deeply. She had no idea why she felt so aroused, but it was like nothing she had ever experienced before. She rubbed herself harder and harder, faster and faster, bringing herself to the verge of ecstasy. Until finally, she reached her climax.<br>\r\nSeven's orgasm reached its peak and she felt waves of pleasure overcoming her. She sighed in utter amazement by what she had just experienced.<br>\r\nA moment later, something caught her attention. Part of her diaper felt wet. But she was certain that she had not urinated or defecated in it. She felt the wet spot in her diaper and quickly realized that she must have ejaculated.<br>\r\nSeven of Nine was rather interested in this new sensation.

His shift had just finished, and he knew that she was away for a week investigating a planet in a dense nebula with the ever lively Tuvok. He found he could no longer deny his basic impulses. The door opened, and Harry thought he was in heaven, when he saw that one of her uniforms. Well to call it a uniform was to flatter it, Harry tried to control his breathing as he approached the catsuit that was draped over the console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Yes!!!\" he thought to himself. The away mission was organised before Seven had a chance to put her clothing priorities high enough up for them to be tidied away. Tentatively with his hands gently shaking, he picked up the the pale purple outfit. It still held her aroma. He pressed the crotch to his nose and inhaled deeply, taking it fully into his lungs as he almost came with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the catsuit back over the console and tried to control his raging erection. A starfleet uniform didn't allow a man to hide any.... excitement he might feel. Harry finished walking around the cargo bay, finding nothing else that had the same effect. Once he had control of himself again, he left and went to the holodeck, to give himself a vigourous work out. He gave a small cough as he walked out the door, listening to it close behind him as he marched down the corridor.</span></div></div>",

The faint glow of the nearby nebula giving the room a little variety in it's lighting. Allowing the built-in footwear to land on the soft carpeting, Harry calmed himself.

The smart fabric adjusted, he felt the slight bagginess from Seven's fuller rear, as the cloth tightened. Until his taut ass was cupped and contained in that same fabric. He felt every teasing caress as the fabric tightened, outlining, and exaggerating his stiffness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shudder raced up and down his spine, almost threatening his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trembling in his fingers mounted, he slid his arms into the sleeves, and shrugged his shoulders into place. Twisting awkwardly, he ran his fingers up the fastener. Sealing him inside her uniform. Taking a deep breath, he drank in the aroma. His eyes fluttered close once more, as the material tightened around his middle, giving definition to his tummy, and as the adjustments ascended, marking his chest with two stiff male nipples outlined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands rose to his chest, blindly feeling for them as he drank the scent of Seven deeper into his lungs with each breath.

It felt like everyone knew his shameful secret, and worse she was parading about in this body as the next stage, as if the 'illness' was progressing. Her cheeks burned from the minute she turned up for duty. Feigning it was a reaction to the heat of the burners, Neelix asked no further questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the space behind the counter was cramped. Harry felt the curious eyes of the male crew members roaming over her ample curves. Their eternal quest for borg implants, or modules breaking the perfection of her skin. At least she hoped that was the reason for the obvious, lingering looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Tom, seemed to react as if he knew her. A curt nod, and then a curious glance to guess whether her top would survive the strain. But, the female crew all seemed to glare at her. The hostility as she slopped the food onto their trays, or sloshed the 'tea' into their mugs. She felt their eyes burning through her outfit. All silently questioning, if Harry had chosen to try on their uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the women, took their umbrage far more seriously, as if doubting the truth of what they'd heard. Dismissing the idea she was Harry, and looking her over, as if she were another Hussy Borg, the similarity of body shape adding to her discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Neelix, found conversation awkward with her. His elbows, and arms accidentally finding their way into her rump, or bust, as he pulled food from the ovens, or desserts out of the fridges. Harry had no alternative but to smile indulgently, as another brushing contact. He seemed as embarrassed as she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, it felt like she was only made from curves. Even imagining them expanding further, Harry imagined them becoming even more expansive, even more sensitive. The circulating crew meant they could never verify she was getting curvier. But Harry was sure she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeelix just kept on working, almost as if she weren't there. The nuggets of casual conversation dropped into the '<i>Excuse me's</i>', and <i>'sorry's'</i>. Certainly he wasn't about to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/c9/46/19c946f4c27450b5285c1891c4333ebf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/c9/46/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst was when B'lanna joined Tom for a quick break. She sat so she'd block Tom's view of her, jealously guarding her man's wandering eyes from distraction. However, she knew the tough battle was when it was time for the other bridge crew to see her shame. She didn't want to flaunt herself, hoping to somehow preserve their memory of Harry Kim, as one of the youngest Ensigns on the ship. Not demolish it, with that of the bustiest nobody on the ship.</span></div></div>",

Until it split from her stomach, rising to her chest, and sinking to her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands cupping and cradling her tender flesh, she felt it swell, lewder, riper, and more succulent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/05/41/f3/0541f31443f8c20f178c077f90f07dfb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/05/41/f3/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely, now?\" Harry asked in a tone that sounded far too feminine, girly to her own ears. Almost whiny and needy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to swallow the wail in her throat, as Seven shook her head, it died in her throat as a whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain that same warmth grew, split and Harry felt herself becoming more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f9/2b/98/f92b98f1649aced75eda3bfbb4ded00f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f9/2b/98/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please now...\" she begged, \"It can't continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look was exchanged between the doctor and Seven before she nodded her satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry Kim had finally stopped the nanite transformation.</span></div></div>",

Not one for wasting time Seven of Nine quickly started her way to the turbo lift, this kind of alarm was becoming second nature on Voyager.<br>\r\n\"Bridge\" Seven Stated upon entering the turbo lift, after two years on Voyager Seven still sounded like a drone of the Borg Collective. But then the lights flickered, and the lift halted . Power fluctuations were happening all over the ship, and Voyager was not only under attack it had also been invaded. \" Seven of Nine to the bridge\" , Seven tried to raise the bridge on her com-badge. The only real accessory she had , a side from her Borg implants. Just then the lights in the lift sent shock waves through the cabin and sparked her Borg components.<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhh\" Seven Said as she was struck down to her knees , and fell to the ground unconscious. As she laid there out cold , more electro bolts kept hitting her Borg implants . Especially her optic implant that was a direct conduit to her brain.<br>\r\nStill unconscious sevens arms started to twitch , her limps were all twitching. But her left arm had the most Borg implants other than her brain. As the shocks kept washing over her body, Seven's Arm started to feel her body . Slowly she started to regain movement, but remained unconscious. What ever was happening to her , she would not be aware of it . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven's eyes opened widely, she blinked twice. Realizing she was still in the turbo lift, it took her a second to remember where she was, and where she was heading. But then something else started to happen. Seven couldn't move. Odd, she thought in the split second, before her arms stretched upward. Seeing her hands raising to the ceiling of the lift, all of her digits on both hands started to outstretch and grip back. Next her head moved back and forth, before she stood up on her feet, and yawned. What ever was controlling her body was getting used to her body first and foremost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could only look at what her body let her look at, and feel whatever it felt. Her hands were guided to her hips and started to feel her body up. As she worked her way to her breasts, Seven was hoping she could flick her com-badge as her hands examined her breast. But her hands found her shapely rear more appealing, she started to massage her butt. As she felt her rear lift and set the force behind her body, she closed her eyes and relished the moment. Seven could tell she was smiling and biting her lips, her body was starting to move more freely to its controlling force. Suddenly Seven could feel her body dance around in the turbo lift, her arms up in the air . She was shaking her hips and moving in a way that Tom Parris would probably like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please state the destination of your intent...\" the computer stated . The power had been fully restored to the turbo lift, and this caught Seven's new tenant off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot, Ah thought ah could just soak this up awhile.\" Seven's voice said with an odd accent. Seven realized she has not encountered a situation like this before. She felt her hand on her hip and another tapping a finger on her lip, suddenly she felt her face go wide. \"Ah know, where can ah go to see a mirror and buy some pertty stuff to wear?\" Seven's oddly southern voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Please specify your request,\" the computer responded, not familiar with the odd request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know a place to buy a dress, or some boots? Ah also want to see these legs of mine all glamed up and out of these here burlap sacks. Ya'll got a place for clothes?\" She responded , Seven realized that whatever was now controlling her body might not be from this time . But who or what ever it was has plans to get her body into some familiar clothing . If Seven can't control her body, maybe she could understand her possessor better from the clothing she would wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your request is valid, a replicator would provide you with any attair you require. Also any crew quarters will have a 8 inch by 12 inch mirror--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the computer could finish its answer, Seven blurted out, \" NO!!! AH want a full length mirror with two other mirrors so ah can see my booty. Where can ah see one of em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer responded with, \"The only place to view such a mirror would be the holodeck simulation of the old west.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven clapped her hands together in excitement and said \" Take me there please, it will be the bee's knees.\" The turbo lift continued........</span></div></div>",

She could feel an odd sensation between her legs, but how can that be? The doctor had stated time and time again that Seven's body was not fully released from the Borg implants . Her digestive track was still that of the Borg, and she would have to regenerate to ride herself of waste and other bodily fluids. As the lift door opened Seven sashayed off the lift, her hips were going back and forth . Who ever had her body really knew how to work her curves, she saw that the crew wasn't even surprised. She walked by Chief engineer Torries, who never like Seven . Being a woman who was half Klingon Belana Torries was never given any attention by her male crew members. She was over looked and paid no attention for years, she felt that the captain was treated the same way . But when Seven of Nine showed up and had her implants removed and her hair done up in that bun , she instantly was the center of attention. Belana was always jealous of her for her looks, but would never vocalize it unless they were alone. Alone in a corrode , she noticed Seven was now walking as she would walk if she had curves like that . <br>\r\n   \" So you finally notice you have an ass and tits!?\" Belana blurted out , Seven was so surprised by this . She knew Belana didn't like her but wow , she was surprised. \" What in tarnashion are you gabbing about?\" , the possessed Seven said putting her hands on her hips. \" You have been playing stupid for years ,'Oh I'm Seven of Nine I'm a Borg , I have huge boobs but don't know it' . You make me sick how all the guys flont to you and you play games with them. GAMES!!\" Belana Scolded Seven , any other member of the crew might of been curious as to her new accent . Belana thought it was her showing her true colors, the way that Earth girls play dumb until they are alone.Seven Could feel her new body sharer was not amused and took offense to her, she then pointed at Belana with her left finger. <br>\r\n\" Listen here Missy , Ah don't know who you are but------\"Suddenly Sevens Tentacles flared out striking Belana in the neck , with in seconds the Borg nanites spread through Belana. </span></div></div>",

Just then, Tuvok called for the Voyager crew to assemble for transport. Within moments, they were all back aboard the ship.<br>\r\n<i>The planet is lost to me,</i> Tieran contemplated, <i>but with them all suspecting I am dead, when in reality I hold the power of this girl's body for my own, I can go out and conquer a new planet.</i> Tieran smiled at a crewman expressing thanks that Kes had returned safely. He needed to get to his quarters, with how hectic it had been when he first took Kes' body Tieran had had no time to inspect it properly. Slipping away from the group of returned crewmen, Tieran left the transporter room and made his way to Kes' quarters. He remembered where they were from his last stay aboard Voyager, but this time he had no intention of leaving the ship so soon. Voyager was far more powerful than he had anticipated, and would make an excellent warship from which to direct his attacks upon other planets.<br>\r\nAs he was thinking of how to accomplish this, Tieran felt himself walk into someone travelling the opposite way down the corridor. He looked to see who it was, and saw Captain Janeway in front of him. <i>Perfect,</i> Tieran thought, <i>I can use this to my advantage.</i><br>\r\n\"Captain Janeway! I'm so sorry, I must have zoned out.\"<br>\r\nJaneway raised her hands and smiled, brushing it off. \"Kes, think nothing of it. You've had a rough time recently.\"<br>\r\nTieran made sure to look disheartened before responding. \"You're right, Captain. Can I...may I speak with you in my quarters, in private?\" He stepped closer to the Captain, leaning forward to whisper in her ear, \"I think it would really cheer me up.\"<br>\r\nTieran brushed past the captain, not turning back to look at her, and headed for his quarters.

Without waiting for Janeway to say anything, Tieran pushed Janeway backwards so she was lay on the bed, then climbed on top of her.<br>\r\n\"Kes-\" Janeway began, before Tieran began kissing the Starfleet captain. Janeway closed her eyes and opened her lips, giving Tieran access. Janeway's tongue intertwined with Tieran's as they kissed, both rushing from being inside one mouth to the other's. Tieran felt Janeway reach behind him and squeeze Kes's behind. He moaned a little to encourage her, while reaching to squeeze her boob himself. Janeway, flustered, returned the favour, squeezing Tieran's boob with one hand while squeezing his behind with the other. Tieran continued to arouse the captain, but with his other hand he reached down and began rubbing on the leather covering his crotch.<br>\r\nJaneway pushed Tieran off her onto the bed, then rolled over so she was straddling him. Smiling, the kiss broken, Janeway removed the leather outfit Tieran wore on Kes's body down to the waist, then swung her leg over so she was no longer straddling Tieran and removed the rest. Tieran lay there, smiling. It was working out perfectly.<br>\r\nThe captain reached into the panties Tieran wore and plunged two fingers inside him. Tieran moaned louder and louder as Janeway rubbed more vigorously. Eventually, Tieran stopped moaning as he reached his orgasm. He looked over to Janeway, who was smiling at Kes lying there in her underwear, covered in sweat.</span></div></div>",

Now, however, Tieran rushed over to B'Lanna. Before she could say anything else he pulled her inside Kes's quarters and resealed the door. <i>This wasn't part of my plan, but I have no other choice,</i> Tieran thought as he wrapped his arms around B'Lanna, smiling. \"Don't worry about a thing, Lieutenant. The captain and I were just discussing a slight course adjustment.\"<br>\r\nB'Lanna frowned, struggling against Tieran's hold. As Kes's fingers began to loosen, Tieran jumped and wrapped his legs around B'Lanna too. The half-Klingon staggered back, surprised at the force behind Kes. As Janeway watched, Kes suddenly fell to the floor as Tieran switched host to B'Lanna Torres.

But the doctor\u2019s mind was already clouded, all this chocolate made her brain swim in endorphins. In other words she was getting very relaxed and happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi mom; how nice of you to take care of my new project.\u201d He smiled warmly at his mother and then looked hungrily at the fudgy counselor. His next step was even more breathtaking than this revelation; he kneeled behind Diana and licked at her crystallised sugar uniform. Soon the cleft between her buttcheeks was visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God! Wesley! Please no! Stop it!\u201d Diana screamed \u2013 or would have, if she still had a mouth. \u201cBeverly please make your son stop\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWesley?\u201d A curious mother asked, just when his indexfinger disappeared in Diana\u2019s . \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry mother.\u201d He started to finger fuck the widening opening. \u201cI found the records of the 3 replicator accidents and now I\u2019m trying to reproduce it. By the way you should start masturbating, I induced a nice dosage of Deltan sweat, one of the most potent aphrodisiacs known to mankind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of waiting for an answer her grabbed Troi\u2019s chocolate butt and sank his inquisitive tongue forcefully through the gate to her nougat factory, probing that luscious ass deeply. It seemed to taste very good because he tried to get even deeper with each lick, while his warm sweaty hands clawed their way deeper into Diana\u2019s round booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly found that sight intriguing and she really felt a bit hot herself, without further thinking she got rid of her uniform \u2013 but kept her lab coat on \u2013 and sat on the edge of the biobed. She didn\u2019t need a tricorder to notice her symptoms; her nipples were harder than ever before. A short twitch send warm pleasure through her upper body and when a hand touched her trimmed cunt the first signs of an impending orgasm lighted up in her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are right son, I\u2019m really quite horny already.\u201d She chuckled happily and started to work one hand on her tits, while three fingers of the other tended to her experienced snatch. \u201cHmmmm,\u201d she moaned, \u201cbut\u2026 tell me\u2026 why this ex\u2026 experiment?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an audible sound he withdrew from Diana\u2019s fudgy anus and a moment later he pulled his finger out of her cheeks. His hands were printed into the chocolate and holes showed where he had penetrated the poor counselor, of course the young scientist\u2019s hands and face were covered with the delicious chocolate, yet Wesley\u2019s delight radiated from his eyes when he saw creamy dark liquid flowing from all 11 holes, even more so when he tried to catch those flowing from the middle one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he answered his mother \u201cI will tell you, but first\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eventually I might be able to reproduce a chocolate woman that walks around and begs you to eat her, coming with different stuffing, like strawberry cr\u00e8me or cookie dough.

Even as that memory faded from Picard's history, the anger in Worf's eyes showed that he still recalled the truth even if she ...damn it... he could never express itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the clearer one was of him fighting for Worf to be recognised as the daughter of Mogh. As a dishonoured female she would have even fewer rights than an ordinary female.</span></div></div>",

With a distracted thought, he wondered what Q would do when it came to his turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly the thought didn't worry him unnecessarily, in fact, his emotion chip was racing through a whole range of emotions since he had switched it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly excitement, and anticipation seemed to be the ones that flashed most frequently through his mind. He had originally denied Q when he thought he was going to make him human. But now he would have to give it serious consideration.... well if he was asked. But just now, Q wasn't asking anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps sensing the android's indifference, 'Mehh.' but he looked over to the councilor as she sat stock still. Her finger white as she kept a painfully tight grip on the fabric of her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deanna.\" Q pronounced her name slowly, savouring every syllable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her best efforts she gave a terrified little squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think you truly merit a place on the bridge of the Federation's flagship?\" His tone was dismissive of both Deanna and still of the Federation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth to speak, but her teeth clicked shut unsure what to say to avoid some horrific change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resigned sigh, he pointed at Deanna. In a white flash she vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well mon Capitan. Just think of it as de-cluttering your ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Q.\" He barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, she's not gone. She's just found a new life where her talents are more useful... and better appreciated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile on Risa:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pneumatic chestnut Risan appeared by the swimming pool. Her hair was a cascade of ringlets. Her swimsuit was palest blue, with some black laces to tie together the front and back pieces. Her lush form strained the material. With her nipples and areaola clearly pushing against the thin cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt loneliness come from the man on the sun lounger across the pool. She knew that if she didn't react, then the hotel manager would have to punish her. And she didn't fancy another spanking. She gave her ass a round rub, enjoying how much of it was revealed by her thong backed outfit. She slid elegantly to her feet, before she strutted around to give the guest a sympathetic ear. He was soon pouring his problems out and feeling better. Especially as by the end, they were sharing the sun lounger, and he was resting his head on her shoulder and enjoying the scenery every time she breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Back on the Enterprise:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whuff of displaced air, the empty chair was filled by Dr. Crusher. She looked around disoriented, with a hypospray in her hand. Spotting the Q she carefully put it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this woman, this woman has earned her place on your ship, Jean-Luc. However, .....\"</span></div></div>",

With her cheeks flushing she clasped a hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the changes were still happening. This time to her uniform. It kept the same colour signifying a medical specialist. However, the collar vanished... retreating downwards, until a clear neckline was visible. A black band highlighting the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean-Luc hadn't spotted before quite how well-developed she was a woman. But now it was undeniable, and literally 'on display'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Q read the captain's mind, or perhaps he was indulging himself. But with another gasp, the doctor was soon almost panting, the beads of sweat forming on her forehead indicating a growing warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what the doctor felt was how much more aware she was of how harsh these uniforms were on her tender flesh. It felt like a wire brush grazing her flesh even just breathing in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Q was far from finished. She felt pressure build in her chest too. There was an answering tension from her uniform as the neckline stretched to cover a wider area. Her breasts swelling cup sizes in inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough Q.... Enough of these games.\" The captain strodes over to Q, standing between him and the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind his back the doctor was trying not to panic, as she caught sight of the edge of her areola clearly peaking out of the neckline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head in denial, but the dark coloured flesh was on display. She tried to push the girls back under cover, but this only worked while she held them. As soon as she let go, they slipped back out again.

Her empathy was needed to ensure transparency between the two formerly warring neighbours. But now she was back on board the Enterprise, she could retreat into her own space and munch her way through a box of chocolates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swore to herself that she'd try to introduce these treats to Betazed society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the empty box lay by the small stand beside the bed. Her hair forming a wild halo around her head. Her fingers streaked with the melted remains, unaware she was snoring away, a problem she continued to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was alone as her sleep became more disturbed. Something was ... off ..., even in her sleep she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to wake up.... But it was useless. She felt powerless, and trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice cackled laughter in her ears. It was familiar, but she couldn't quite place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done. Heroic effort.\" The dry mocking tones were undeniable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Q!\" she spat in the midnight of her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the empty recesses of her mind, a figure appeared, horned and irregular. As he approached, he became clearer. More human, more familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a gift for you.... a reward... or kinds.\" He reached out with a glowing finger and touched the counselor's naked form. Deanna only at that moment becoming aware of her nudity. She wrapped one arm around her chest, the other hand darting down to preserve her modesty from the disinterested eyes of the demi-god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wise man once said, 'History tells us who we were. Current Affairs who we are, and Heroes who we can aspire to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe disappeared as his voice turned to laughter. From the blackness it quietly announced, \"Time to wake....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeanna woke with a start, a scream dying on her lips. She sat bolt upright, her breasts shifted with the sudden movement. The soft satin sheet sliding off, leaving her chest exposed to the air. Sleeping in the nude was deeply ingrained in her, part of her Betazed upbringing, she recalled laughing at seeing a man in his pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lights....\" she half-gasped as looked around her dark quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked as light flooded the room, \"fifty percent dimmer.\" she shielded her eyes until she was able to stop blinking. A shudder ran down her spine, she thought of waking the Captain or Commander Worf.... But the idea of it being a dream stopped her. She had eaten a lot of chocolate last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she knew that Worf liked to spank her when he thought she was being <i>too</i> emotional and undisciplined. The thought brought a flush to her cheeks, she'd never admitted how much she liked being controlled. However, she suspected that the Commander was aware of her feelings, both those she denied and those she openly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding free of the sheets, she padded over to the sink. She splashed water on her face, before taking a step backwards. She looked her body over, a smile of pride teasing the corners of her mouth. It was harder work now that she was older, but the sideways glances as she walked the corridors of the Enterprise still built her self-confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran a linger look up from her cute feet, passing her dance-toned legs, to her hips. The hips with the right amount of curves to give her shape and accentuate her waist. Her flat tummy also made her breasts more impressive, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ruffled her hair as she preened. It was then that she spotted a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair... It looked darker and while not smooth and sleek was straighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her eyes, in disbelief. As she did that she felt as if clothes had appeared on her body, as her breasts shifted lifted and held up. She also felt the chill of metal around her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snatched her hands away from her face, and took in what she saw. Her wrists were wrapped in golden bangles. There was even a matching crown resting on her head. She took in the clothes... such as they were. They were even briefer than her Starfleet uniform. A gaudy golden bird of prey held up her breasts. The girls proudly displayed, although the material did still reveal how toned her muscles were beneath the soft fabric. Her hands ran down her ribs, as if hoping to feel bare skin. Alas, they reached a golden belt... corset thing. She wasn't sure quite what to call it, or the whip resting on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked again, seeing it as a lasso rather than a whip. The pattern changed to a deep-blue field with a scattering of stars. As she bent forward she spotted some red boots with a white stripe. It was flattering in a way....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if waking properly, she finally snapped, \"Q!!!! What the....\"</span></div></div>",

The safeties were off, and he was in the middle of a vigorous hand-to-hand combat simulation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed a punch on a Naussican Pirate, and the Sim juddered. the painted walls of the holodeck momentarily appearing as the blow landed. But he tuned it out, as the pirate landed with a crash in a simulated bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whirled around looking for other attackers, lurking in the darkness. His eyes shifted, sifting the shadows for movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the simulation glitched, this time a new world appeared. It looked like an old office building, with historic computers. He couldn't make an estimate to the period, the shift was too brief, but it did look quite antique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the jungle returned there was already a figure charging towards him. He took a fighting stance, and easily tossed the attacker over his shoulder. The man's momentum leaving him to crash into a tree. There was a sickening -crack-, that he instantly knew signalled breaking bones. A snarl of satisfaction coming from him, that was one attacker who was permanently out of the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twig snapped behind him and Worf swung around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, the scene shifted. It was the office again. Although this time it didn't vanish instantly. He saw that all the people were humans, and he saw a device on one desk. He knew what it was, a conversation with Wesley told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was .... -damn it-... a mouse.... Yes, Wesley called it a mouse. So this had to be before voice recognition and touch interfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at his deduction, he wasn't head of security without reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost called for the computer to end the simulation, but it didn't appear dangerous. Besides his curiousity had been piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women were dressed rather briefly, with skirt half-way up their thighs. He preferred a more combat oriented woman, but he had been around human society long enough to appreciate an attractive woman. The clothes were tight, accentuating the women's curves and movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe admired the ass of one, as she bent over a desk, her rounded cheeks straining the stitching. Their breasts were clear in the well-tailored tops they were wearing, too. He purred at the elegance, it was not suitable for combat... far too restrictive, but for this environment he nodded his approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get Over here, Lois.\" a gruff male voice barked over every other noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe faced the new man, The plate glass proclaimed the man as 'Perry White, Editor in Chief', but Worf knew him immediately as <i><b>Q</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growl he leaped towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather he would have had he not found himself in a restrictive skirt. There was now a pin-striped jacket around her shoulders and chest. With pink-painted nails, Worf grabbed herself, confirming that her new breasts were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers confirmed that, and there was an answering feeling from her chest. She could even feel the erect nipples beneath her sensitive fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked towards 'Perry' her eyes alert for dangers. The primary one at the moment seemed to come from navigating her way in her new high-heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along, toots. Time to join us, unless you want to stay with the secretaries.\" his tone was mocking, but Worf bristled but chose not to rise to the bait.</span></div></div>",

Nowadays even without the actual paper, there was always the grind of administrative work. The stylus scrabbled over the Padd, as she signed another document. She suppressed a yawn with the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to the cold mug of coffee resting on her table. Just twenty more records to be processed. 'Coffee, hot and sweet', she barked at the replicator. A swirl of photons formed into the much needed beverage. Beverly inhaled deeply, already reviving with the aroma teasing her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want another coffee, but she'd never finish the work without just one more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up she ruffled her copper hair, she put a wiggle in her hips as she walked the few paces to the replicator. She needed to wake up, besides it never hurt to trawl for a little attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gloved hand she grabbed the mug, lifting it to her nose. Closing her eyes she took the scent deep into her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her mind, was trying to attract her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't wear gloves.... She wasn't wearing gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping her eyes open she spotted her hand were now in some nice black lace gloves. They had a ruffled edge that puffed up around her wrist. The glossy surface of the wall, also told her of more changes. Her hair was now in two pigtails, poking out like ... like ... she didn't like the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colour was also off, too. Her natural coppery-tones were now a brash synthetic blonde. Her uniform was also .... well, wrong. It remained a skintight bodysuit, but the colours were all different. The medical blue replaced with command red. The black wasn't just around the collar either. The simple colour scheme was decorated with some large Diamonds in patterns in contrasting colours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she caught her reflection, the collar changed. It formed into a ruff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!\" she stepped back as if breaking a hypnotic trance, the mug tumbling to the floor. She shook her head in denial, but that only made the pigtail flash across her eyesight, underlining her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she suppressed a burp, she felt pressure build. Before her eyes she felt her chest swell larger. She already felt they were too big, but whatever was going on, wasn't satisfied. She felt a gurgle come from her stomach, and soon there was a warmth spreading lower too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her nipples spread and brush against the fabric of her new clothes, her breathing became a panting moan, and her hands slid down her ribs, to her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese too, were experiencing some changes. Her reflection now looked like a bimbo. Her bust was now straining for release, her ass was an enhanced counterbalance for her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Tits</i></b>.... That was the only word when they were this size .... <b><i>Tits</i></b>. With a capital T, and an Ass that wouldn't quit. She twisted to try for a better look at it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so round and full, her gloved hand caressing the smooth expanse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too much, a giggle burst from her lips. It was bright and happy, and soon she was twirling her hair and admiring the coquettish image reflected back at her.</span></div></div>",

She hated to admit how nice her breasts felt, the nipples demanding attention, seeking the caress of a gentle finger. She found it hard to go long without a brainless giggle bursting from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrival of this particular agent of chaos, meant the captain and security needed to be alerted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped her comm-badge, her breast rippled at the impact, and rather than chirping it sent a delicious buzz through her body racing up and down her spine. A shuddering moan slipped past her lips, before she managed to say \"Captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried again, still not used to her new girlish timbre. \"Captain. We have a visitor. 'Q' is back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a degree of resignation she added, \"This is Beverly Crusher. He's worked on changing my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his cabin, Data was working away at an interesting problem. Once he had worked out the problem he'd be able to submit a report to the Daystrom Institute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his focus, he still kept enough awareness of events around him, to sense a change his immediate environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up from the screen filled with varied Gravity related equations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Q.\" he annouced, as much as conclusion as a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no fun.\" he shrugged, \"I can't do that again.\" he added to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stop you from your games, so I suggest you get on with it.\" Data answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQ pouted, and pointed his hand at the android and snapped his fingers. In that instant Data disappeared, and an instant later reformed. He knew instantly that he was flesh and blood, he ran his hands up and down his warm torso. It was interesting to feel the warmth of his skin under his fingers. Just as weird to feel warm fingers pass over the new flat tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a couple of important changes, his uniform was gone, and replaced with a skin-tight midnight black suit. With a shrug, he made another observation. His new body was female.... and abundantly so, if his knowledge of female shapes was accurate. A womanly gasp of shock burst from her lips as her fingers brushed over her nips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt an abundance of hair too. It was as she went to sweep it off her face that she found the cute little cat ears there. She felt them more than a little nervously before concluding that they weren't actually real. Even her sigh of relief sounded very soft.</span></div></div>",

Geordi continued ranting without looking up at the wide eyed cat woman at Data's research console or the amused looking alien trickster that had turned the android into a flesh and blood female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean the closest I ever got to a relationship was that damn holodeck program I wrote with the Enterprise's designer! I understand engine and warp conduits Data, but women? Why can't I understand them and all of their emotions?!\" The engineer paused and looked over at the console Data was normally seated at, curious as to the unusual silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Data, are you even listen-\" Geordi stopped in mid-sentence as he saw the attractive woman sitting in Data's chair and then the instantly recognizable face of Q, who was grinning ear to metaphysical ear. Geordi's blood ran cold and a tremor of fear ran down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Q...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Geordi! You plight touches me, it truly does!' Why, Even the Q know what it's like to be in unrequited love!\" The alien said, flashing away from Data's console to appear on the love seat next to the startled engineer, an arm draped around his shoulders, \"Let me be your wingman, your professor of the most bewildering of all the sciences: Love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former android finally broke out of her state of shock and fumbled her hands acros her console, which were now lacking in and form of input. \"Computer, contact Captain Picard!\" She called out, panic in her silky smooth voice as Q smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nData was met with silence. \"Computer, contact  Lieutenant Worf!\" The cat woman called out again and gasped in shock as Q snapped his fingers once more. Suddenly Data was on the couch in place of Q, her thin arms draped around the engineer while her uniform was replaced with a much more revealing outfit. The two Starfleet officer instantly pulled away from each other and stood. They opened their mouths to speak, but with a simple wave of his hands Q took their voices before they could say anything. Another wave and they found themselves locked in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now now, is that any way to treat your teacher? You humans are simply so stubborn, reacting to my help this way? What can I do to prove to you both that I simply wish to further your understanding and grant your every desire? And how can we do that with a distraction like being onboard a busy starship where the classroom could be disrupted?\" Q tapped his chin with a single outstretched finger,  a look of thought on his face before clapping his hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I know just the thing to satisfy both your needs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Q snapped his fingers once more, and reality changed before the two trapped Starfleet officers eyes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He heard it land on the soft carpeting, but the pain vanished, he felt blind and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis blind eyes scanned about, as he tried to locate every noise, the squeak of Data's chair, the sigh of the impatient Q, even the padding footsteps of Spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we need to start with baby steps.\" Q started, \"After all, you're not the most dynamic of individuals, -hmmm- rather mechanistic too.\" He snapped his fingers, \"That's it I need to put you more in touch with nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.... no....

A delicate weight landed on his shoulders, and fell down his back. A shrill, almost feminine cry burst out. Geordi knew it was only long hair, a present from Q.

His stomach gurgled in complaint, and rather suspecting how he looked. His hands reached up and cupped his...-hell- her new breasts. She shifted her weight from one leg to another and felt her new expanded rear as it moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd never worn high-heels before, but felt sure she was wearing a pair of heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creepiest part was in the darkness, she felt her hair shifting, and taking on a more feminine pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...\" Q snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeordi's sight returned. He spotted his new reflection. Or rather <i>she</i> spotted <i>her</i> new reflection. She had the deepest red hair, and the leotard she was wearing looked to be made of leaves or trimmed with leaves. She had the fullest of lips and a face that was made for pouting. She felt a little intimidated by how attractive she was before remembering it was her own image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only slightly off-putting thing was her oddly, very slightly palest green complexion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went to Data and back to her reflection, \"Poison Ivy and Catwoman.\" her new voice sounded sensual, even as a whisper, even now. She hadn't revealed her knowledge of these characters before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQ gave her a polite clap as a reward, \"Adieu, ou peut-\u00eatre Au Revoir.\" and vanished in a blink of light.</span></div></div>",

He stood in the centre of the bridge, and gave a bow with a flourishing hand wave to the Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been too long, mon Capitan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker squirmed, unsure quite what to do. The security officer rested his hand on his phaser, dearly wishing he was elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get back to you in a second, captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flashed a wink at the commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair vanished from the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reappeared in the Commander's cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number One... That's a rather odd title.\" Q said. \"I mean, you're second in command, and merely serve to warn our good Captain, about what he already knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker bit his tongue on an explanation of the naval history of his rank, refusing to rise to the bait. However, to hide his anger he turned his back on Q, and walked over to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stars whipped past, shifting through the spectrum as the ship raced towards Ceti Rho 4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't the view, make you feel insignificant and powerless.\" Q taunted behind him. \"To see the grand scale of the universe and know that your very existence will never have any significant impact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put a hand on Riker's shoulder, a smile coming to his face as a small cape unfurled behind Riker. The look on his face was perplexed, as he watched his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker tried to turn and face the omnipotent super-being, but was incapable of the least movement, only his eyes darted about as he tried to get any part of his body to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQ ran a hand down his side, tracing his ribs with soft fingers. The commander felt very afraid. He would have swallowed nervously had he been able.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQ paced back to the centre of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need a more suitable role. A position to suit your talents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his fingers, and Riker felt as if his uniform were rippling over his skin, changing in texture and cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection showed this was true, he was now wearing green leggings. The same shade of green as his new cape. He had an idea, what Q was doing. As a fan of 20th century art, he recognised the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his comm-badge disappeared, it was replaced with a stitched black '<b><i>R</i></b>'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQ was transforming him into Robin the Boy Wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, he felt a release in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin the Boy Wonder.\" he said, with a smug smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave him a small salute, \"I see we have a serious contender here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the first or only person I've changed. This ship is now crewed by Harley Quinn, Lois Lane, Catwoman, Poison Ivy and Wonder Woman as well as you own good self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let that information settle into Robin's brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the moment, I'm also in sick-bay, the holodeck and some cabins explaining the game to you all simultaneously. Well, what's the point in being a Q if you can't be in two or more places at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tilted his head, and allowed the commander control of his body. With a shudder, he turned away from the window, and looked over his new garish uniform. It was only now he noticed the green gauntlets completing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of you are now in your new permanent form, as I'll only be changing one -hmm- maybe two of you back. Only the winner or winners of my little challenge. The rest well,... I'm sure you can imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is this challenge.\" Riker barked at him. It lacked the power and depth of his normal voice, he was a younger man, a young Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why it's simple to take control of the ship.\" he vanished straight away.</span></div></div>",

In horror she ran her hands down them. They felt softer and less muscular than before. A pinching sensation made the commander reach for his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it was already too late. His finger found a flat crotch, and some trembling exploration confirmed the lips that marked .... marked her as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snatched her hands away, as she was starting to feel warm and nervous. Even a little excited by her situation. As the bright canary yellow cape slipped forward. Riker pushed it back out the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the changes were clear on her thin arms. They lead up to narrow shoulders and she sincerely hoped that there was some benefit in flexibility to make up for the absence of powerful muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an ominous tickling coming from her nips. A part of the body the commander was barely aware of before now. She resisted the temptation to try to scratch, already feeling self-conscious enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls did swell up, becoming a firm set of B-cup breasts. Nicely visible but not too much to upset her balance. Her hands cradled the new arrivals. She was careful about not -erm- stimulating them. Even though she felt the temptation to brush a thumb over the nipples as they poked forward as if demanding attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a slow shuddering sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't be so stingy.\" the laughing voice announced from the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no .... NO!!!\" the commander's voice rising in pitch and panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with a surge, she found her breasts overflowing. They were now larger than DD-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker let go in shock. Learning in the process, their weight as the girls tugged painfully on her shoulders before settling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... and a little counter-balancing too.\" the voice started laughing before fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warmth spread down from her waist, as her hands reached past her new wider hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell, she'd not paid much attention previously. But it already felt larger and rounder. But as her hands rested there, she felt it grow larger beneath her touch. She felt the material shift as her arse grew. Then she realised it wasn't due to the expansion. Her uniform was still transforming too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt disappeared into the crack of her ass, giving her a wedgie she'd never forget. The crotch at the front was also trying to embarrass her, rising high on the hips to match. The material was feeling tighter too. As it did, she felt and saw a camel toe begin to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Q.... Q.... Damn it....\" she shrieked. Her voice now as womanly as her body. It sounded husky and gruff, but couldn't be mistaken for a man's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the demi-god was gone, and there was no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a frustrated new woman, furiously resting her clenched fists on her hips.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the flash subsided, Data found himself male once more, but still very much human.  His uniform was gone, replaced by loose fitting, colorful clothes that hung off his olympian form, and his eyes darted his organic eyes across his quarters, seeing that they had changed radically from the default Starfleet officer quarters to something that seemed much more intimate. Gone was his console, replaced with a massive bed covered in crimson silk sheets and enormous pillows, the bland neutral wallpaper replaced with ornate wood carving, the former interior facing wall now gone as it opened up into a much larger room. A dark oak railing guarded the apparent loft Data was standing in, though above him were massive windows that looked out over a breath-taking vista of nebula. Collecting his senses, Data walked over to the railing a peered down into the rest of his nearly redesigned quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, draped across the furniture, was a rainbow of women. Some were reading, some were lounging, others were cooking, cleaning, though there were three on the long, low couch that seemed to stand out from the rest, exchanging somewhat bewildered, yet comfortable looks with each other as they observed their surroundings. The three women were a tall, leggy, buxom blonde were seemed to be trying to hide herself in her long flowing mane of golden hair, the lithe African American woman seemed to checking her lean, muscled body out with a look of satisfaction, and the more exotic woman in the middle, whose ethnicity suggested she had been from somewhre from Earth's former Middle East, seemed to take everything in with analytical curiosity. But every last woman in the large apartment was scantily clad in different outfits that complimented their looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd every last one of them wore a decorative Starfleet pin with a small yellow and black ribbon tied around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flash of light as Q reappeared beside Data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Data! Please, enjoy this gift I give to you. Consider it another form of payment on my 'tuition', I owe my Professor of the Humanities far more than I can ever truly repay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not believe that tearing Geordi and I away from the Enterprise and manipulating our forms could be fair compensation\" Data said, his voice deep, masculine and filled with annoyance, so much so that the former android paused, taking in the foreign emotions that seemed to flood over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Data, come now, this is only part of being human!\" Q laughed, clasping the larger man around the should and giving him a good natured shake, \"After all, you tried your hand at a relationship once, just imagine what it'll be like now that you have the capacity to truly appreciate what you've been given!\"<br>\r\nQ released Data and stepped back as one of the women made her way up the stairs towards Data. Her look was that of lust, her blue eyes holding little intelligence as her massive breasts bounced in the small blue bikini that seemed to barely hold the cream colored skin in. Data felt something very large between his legs stir as the woman sauntered over to them and slipped a slender hand down his pants. Silk skin grasped something hard as she pulled the former android in for a long, deep kiss as she began stroking his new, hard manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geordi wanted to learn what women wanted, what better way than to have him experience every aspect of womanhood?\" Q said as he watched the scene, amused and somewhat disgusted at the primitive form of mating. The god-like being had other places and people to educate however. It was time to go, but he felt he owed Data once last bit of advice.<br>\r\n\"The three woman on the couch are Geordi's prime personalities. I'll leave it to you to figure out which is which, but you're both here until I feel like you've...studied enough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with another flash of light Q was gone, leaving the new man in his own personal harem of woman that used to be his best friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

B'Elanna hoped there were traces of Spockite 344, the presence of supernova remnants meant that the likelihood was quite good, and without that the holodecks would have to go down to reduced hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChakotay read the panel as the figures flashed across the screen. This wasn't life or death, but morale would suffer if the crew didn't have some relief from the boredom. Frankly the nebula was the most interesting thing they had passed in eight weeks, with barely a planet and no civilizations to speak of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the stuffy demeanour of Tuvok behind his shoulder. Their relationship was always fractuous, given his undercover work on Chakotay's maquis ship. He still felt that the vulcan didn't trust him... would never trust him, so things were always cold between the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnsign Kim was nice and straight-forward. Chakotay couldn't help but warm to his open manner, and easy going nature. Silence ruled the bridge with only a low hum coming from a power relay, the three men concentrated on the job in hand without idle chit-chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was the pilot, but Chakotay never said that he preferred when Harry was at the conn. It wasn't about proficiency, even now he knew Tom was the better flyer, but there was something in his attitude which just grated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a blip in the data. A range of surprised noises came from them as it flicked past. Without any other notice, there was a brief flash of green light, and the men felt .... not wrong... but different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward Chakotay tapped on his padd, a lock of hair fell across his face. His hair was never long enough to do that, even just before it was cut. A very unfamiliar face was reflected back from the black surface. One that looked positively naked to him. His tattoo was gone, and a younger more innocent face looked back. A sparkle caught his eye, and he saw an earring and a chain. After a moments thought, he recognised it as Bajoran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked at his slimmer, more feminine hands, she gave a soft womanly gasp. One hand went to her new crotch, while the other confirmed that she had some rather sensitive breasts and nipples.</span></div></div>",

He just loved to look over at his wife first thing in the morning. Her open and frank face, before she had put on any emotional armour. Although, he loved her dearly, she still kept a tight rein on her emotions. Tom was glad for any chink in her emotional defences, and would even try to provoke a fight on occasion just so she wasn't bottling up all her emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there in bed, eyes blinking as he tried to wake properlly, knowing something was very wrong. Everything just felt a little ... off. As he propped himself up in bed, he felt an unfamiliar weight shift on his chest. With one hand he brushed away at the sheets that had to be causing the odd sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was soon wide awake, as his finger brushed against some rather large nipples. An electric sensation shot up and down his spine, while with his other hand he reached beneath the sheets to confirm he was still a man where it mattered. The nipples topped some very impressive breasts, and while he wasn't used to seeing them from this perpective he was sure they were larger than his wife's own. Tom let out a shrill cry when she found that she could no longer be the husband in the relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for something familiar, he turned to his wife.....   Except it wasn't B'elanna in bed beside him. It was terrifying to Tom.... lying beside him in the bed was 7 of 9. The borg who had such a difficult relationship with his wife, and battled over every major decision in Engineering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven.\" he said in disbelief, barely aware he was whispering aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were still blinking as she lay there....  But as she heard a voice say 'Seven', her eyes flashed wide open. Angry and ready to argue her every choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat bolt upright in the bed, and growled at her husband, \"Who the hell, are you?\" she gave a cough afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me... It's Tom... your husband.\" her voice was reedy and unconvincing as a man. \"You're not yourself either.\" she added not sure whether it would calm the situation or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB'elanna glared at the strange woman in her bed, not trusting a word she said... But the lie could be easily proven, she kept a hand mirror beside the bed. Cautiously she reached for that, her eyes fixed on the intruder even as she brought the mirror to her eye-line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to smash it as soon as she caught her reflection. She made a variety of expressions, and pulled the mirror away and back again. However, the hated face of the borg bitch stared back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know why the Red Alert has been called.\" The woman said with Tom's familiar humour and sense of understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.\" B'elanna grunted her disapproval at his levity, but now she did believe that this could be her husband... could be... She remained unconvinced, as she slid out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like Seven, now.\" he paused knowing he was walking on egg-shells. \"Who do I look like, now?\" his voice trembled as she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody I recognise. Best head to the bridge anyway, if we're going to get any answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sensed the conflicting emotions racing through his wife, and even the general mood of the ship.

Tom wasn't sure he had the same words needed to describe clothing for women. As a man it had been simple: Red, Blue, Black etc. He hadn't need to think of Scarlet or mauve... Hell he wasn't sure what colour mauve actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one thing he was sure of this uniform didn't have any pips at the collar... Hell it didn't have a collar. It had a neckline, and quite a low one too. Although that was from his new female perspective. As an observer he was equally sure it wouldn't merit a comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled down the zipper, handling it like a poisonous snake. She looked inside as if expecting to see something shocking, but it remained a simple outfit. Tom slipped one leg inside, followed by the other, as she pulled it up to her waist she realised quite how different her centre of balance was as she wobbled a little. She was now also aware of how large a female ass feels from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom slid her arms inside the sleeve, smoothing out the wrinkles with her delicate fingers. She sensed growing impatience behind her, underlined by volcanic anger. So she sped up a little, pulling the zipper back up until it reached the nape of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you look sweet.\" a voice said harshly from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom turned to see Seven standing there, tapping a foot and looking very uncomfortable. She even had the borg enhancements, and Tom worried about what else had changed with his wife, and what those enhancements could reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly though she wasn't happy to occupy that body, \"Can we go to the bridge now.\" She headed out the door without waiting for an answer. Tom scurried after her, taking a moment to adjust to how her body moved and kept on moving even once she changed directions. She felt like every eye was watching her as she teetered towards the turbo-lift and her wife's angry back. The sad thing was there weren't any eyes watching her at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tom consoled himself by thinking about Harry's reaction to B'elanna, and what form Harry might have himself.

But received only a lecture about diversity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardest thing to adjust to would be the height difference she thought. Having lost almost 12 inches. The counter just seemed to be the wrong level. But as she stepped closer she discovered what would become the real difficulty. As her pregnant, distended belly touched the edge.

She panted, an etherial voice called out, 'and I need my fun.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor looked nervously over her shoulder but Q wasn't to be seen. However, his presence was being felt....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growing warmth spread out from her nipples as they ached for attention, her hands caressed them, massaged them, fondled them, gave them all the attention they were demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't enough for Q, as they started to swell, the doctor looked down in horror, as the passion faded her breasts were swelling, relentlessly up the sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to be clinical in this situation, but she knew that already she had the largest on the ship, far larger, -and heavier, damn it- than even seven's generous proportions.

She tried to shake the feeling that something was wrong. Years of trusting her instincts left her trusting those instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the middle of the night-shift. The next few light-years, the next few days should be uneventful. Harry Kim was captaining this duty, if she recalled correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe replicator produced a new uniform for her, and still a little out of sorts, and half asleep she slipped it on. Patting her hip, and the phaser there, she left the more muted light of her cabin. The corridor made her squint as she adjusted to the glare. She walked with a confident stride. Heading first for Engineering, and if that didn't provide any answers, she'd continue on and head to the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passageways were empty, and she felt better that nothing major appeared to be wrong, at least not visibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the bridge was the problem, surely they'd have alerted her. As she walked she noticed a little more movement in her chest as she went. The reassuring weight, felt ... heavier.

Wesley was amazed at how limber his mother was; even at her age, it had been capable of stretches and twists that his male body could never attempt. Deanna was even more flexible. As she bent over to touch her toes, with her ass sticking out in the pink and grey spandex gym wear, it had been all Wesley could do not to stop, stare, and drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had talked about women's things - men mostly - or at least Deanna had talked and Crusher had listened, trying to not be too specific with his answers. He'd had no idea either of their sex lives were so active. By the sounds of things, his mother's relationship with Picard was going nowhere, and she had taken to acting out smutty holonovels on the holodeck to get over it. Troi meanwhile couldn't stop talking about all the fantastic sex she was having with Riker's teleporter-clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it was over, to Wesley's disappointment. As they took their gym bags, Deanna giggled, \"You know you might want to try turning the intensity settings up on those holonovels. You feel so pent up, I'm sure I caught you even checking <i>me</i> out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Wesley gasped, realising his ogling had not gone unnoticed. \"I just, uh, haven't been with a man in so long...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry yourself. We're sure to find you somebody on Risa tomorrow. Tall, handsome, with a big-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Risa?!\" Wesley squeaked. He was far too young to be visiting the so-called pleasure planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you forget!\" Troi exclaimed. \"Go on, you need to go pack!\" She quickly shood him out of the aerobics studio before he even had time to recover his hidden tricorder.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, that didn't help, as she felt the extra swing of her hips with every pacing length, also the bounce and ripple from her fuller ass keeping her intimately aware of her new body. The counterpoint bounce of her bust, was a further humiliation. From the outside, those hips hadn't looked so wide. But walking with them herself, they felt positively expansive, a mile wide forcing a swaying sashay that she couldn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing herself to sit down, Wesley looked over the assorted ... things, by the sink. Squirming at the idea of beautifying herself, but equally not ready to resume her hip swaying strut. Her hands hovered over each of the bottles, or bits of tech, as if afraid of contamination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Counselor had suggested embracing Risa, and changes. Wesley nodded curtly to her reflection. Surely, if she tried something different, she could pass off any mistakes, as experiments. Pass it off, as a different aspect of Beverly Crusher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouching a wand-like thing to her hair, Wesley gasped in surprise as the coppery locks, vanished, dark midnight running down each individual one, from root to tip making her over into a raven haired beauty. It was only as she turned her head, admiring the reflection that she spotted her hair had grown too. Extending down to her ass, it teasing, tickling the base of her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking intently for other changes, Wes was happy to see this as their full extent. Surprising herself with a yawn, she retreated to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely recalled hitting the sheets, before waking to the chirp of her comm-badge. The computer primly informing her, that the Counselor was already heading to the transporter room. Leaping to her feet, she ordered the computer to pack her luggage, beaming a selection of clothes from her drawers directly into some bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raced from the room, still in her gym clothes. Only once she was out the door, recalling quite how mobile the girls were without the proper support, without the proper restraint. The skin-hugging outfit, drew gazes, and the shimmy of her bust meant she was blushing crimson by the time she reached the turbo-lift. The friction of her nips against the material making the girls tauten, standing firmly, proudly, insistently against her top, advertising her ... excitement, to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCounselor Troi was already in the transporter room, when she arrived. Her bags beaming in, site-to-site as she arrived. She was dressed in a swimsuit, with a satin gown atop, ready to relax from the immediate beam down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be leaving pretty quickly.\" The transporter chief told them, as Wes mounted the transporter pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still turning to face him, as she felt herself being disassembled. The transporter room disappearing in a haze of sparkling light and dark specks, to be replaced by a sumptuous hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering around the room, Wes felt vulnerable and alone. Her body adding to the feeling of powerlessness. A dying chirp from the badge told both the women, that the Enterprise had left orbit. Hell, it was probably already in Warp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, Wes took in her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f442f1b5879539b91636da18c94234e3/tumblr_okterkEtBE1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/f442f1b58795...</a></span></div></div>",

She wasn't listening as the Counselor talked to the room AI. But, it was impossible for her to miss the changes, that Deanna's conversation triggered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started as a warmth, in her hips, as her bones softened. Wes leaned forward, needing more support from the chair, as the changes raced through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pelvis spreading like modeling clay. Wes' eyes wide in horror, as what felt like too wide hips spread even further. At the same time, her breath coming in uneven deeply swallowed gasps, as if drowning. This wasn't what she'd signed up for... Risan retreats and opportunities weren't something she'd studied or considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching to the chair for stability, Wes took in her broad hips, and fuller, firmer, rounder ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d33f3af96dbdb5efc5de797532fbdd17/tumblr_okterkEtBE1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/d33f3af96dbd...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't talk, protest, or make a single sound.

Unsure whether to touch them, and confirm what her eyes were telling her. Or keep hoping it was a trick, an illustion... a hologram? However, her fingers came into contact with those fleshy full thighs, the heft of her rump as she shifted weight from one side to another proving their reality with a simple ripple as she shuffled from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/86b01bf66c1e14fb4a00b143c4e68d98/tumblr_okterkEtBE1w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/86b01bf66c1e...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant, deeply buried part of Wes' mind, still found the arse to be perfection, written large.

Grumbling, Wesley unfurled himself. After experimenting, he found the easiest way to move was by wriggling his empty body like a worm, while using his arms to drag himself across the floor. He reached the wardrobe and was able to pull himself up the wall far enough to slap the button that slid open the wardrobe doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting his mother's gym bag open was more of a challenge. Lacking hands, he had to scrunch his fabric limbs around the zipper; he almost lost hope until a part of him snagged on the metal, giving him enough purchase to tease it open. He found his identical counterpart, wrinkled and unwashed from her last session, and quickly removed it, hid it in a corner of the wardrobe, before replacing it with himself, pushing his torso inside the gym bag and squirming his arms in after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was only half-way in before he heard footsteps behind him and a hand tuck the last of his body inside. He felt the cold metal of a deoderant can land on him, and the weight of a bottle of water crushing his body. His neck hole was scrunched into the bottom of the bag, forced to endure the smell of stale sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, Wesley thought, as the bag was zipped up and his mother slung him over one shoulder. Soon he'd be being worn, used. He couldn't wait. Sure, it was his mom, and that kinda grossed him out, but he had chosen her as his first test as he knew if something went wrong he could always come clean with her and she'd help him.</span></div></div>",

With some modifications, Wesley had enabled the system to actually alter the body of the real people involved in the simulation. They could become actual historic figures, like Captain Archer, and command the first Enterprise. Or, perhaps experience some of the rumored romance between himself and the Vulcan T'pol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his first run, he programed a simulation that would be minor changes to himself. He would make himself taller and more muscular. To make it fun, he chose to do a rescue simulation. He had set it so that the Enterprise had been boarded, and Ami Langer, a cute, petite girl of Japanese decent who had recently left the Enterprise for no apparent reason, would be kidnapped. Of course, he would rescue her and carry her back to his waiting bedroom. Hey, she was his fantasy girl at the moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last! All was ready! Wesley stood in the middle of the holodeck and said, \"Computer. Engage program Crusher Siera Echo X-ray!\" He chuckled. The holodeck disappeared and Wesley found himself standing near a botanical station as he felt his body changing. But something was wrong. He was not supposed to be in that area. That is where the first attackers break through! And he was getting smaller, not bigger!</span></div></div>",

Until she saw a device that suddenly terrified her, it was a hypnotic enforcement helmet. She had heard of that being used on people in the witness protection program, on people hiding from the 'Orion Syndicate', it helped them better adapt to their new lifestyles and sometimes even bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon Freg reached for the helmet, and Wesley exploded with renewed vigour, her breasts heaved heavily from side to side almost unbalancing the now smaller Wesley and her disproportionately massive breasts.

Stay cloaked until we pass through the nebula if I do not get there first. The underling saluted and left. The captain returned his attention to Wesly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my dear, I will fit you for better control. That gag does not become you.\" He locked a collar around Wesley's neck that looked very decorative, and Wesley wondered why, until it clicked and something activated. He suddenly felt like his mind and body were being probed, and strange things began to happen. His body spasmed in strange ways, shaking and shivering, or moving on its own. His emotions went crazy as he felt hate, then love, anger and calm, fear, happiness, lust, disgust and many more in wave after wave. His body felt hot and cold, need and emptiness, pain and pleasure, hungry, full, and many other things. He would have screamed if he could have. He tried to. Then it faded. The captain smiled as he looked at readings. \"I love the variety of choices with human females, they are complex yet simple.\" He was doing something on a control pad, but Wesley was to spent to care what. \"There! That should be a good start!\" He pushed something on the pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley's mind was suddenly flooded with thought and especially feelings! He looked at the captain and would have gasped if he could have! He never realized how incredibly attractive Ferengi males were! Especially this captain! And the captain was more! He had freed Wesley from the terror of the Enterprise and the tyranny of the Federation! He would do anything, just anything to repay him! The fact that he, a far superior being, cared about a lowly human female like Wesley, was proof of how great he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain smiled, \"I have blocked your speech centers.\" He removed the gag, \"But you will be able to make sounds, especially of pleasure.\" He pointed to a bed where some skimpy clothing were laying. \"Remove that uniform and throw it in the disember, you will not need it anymore. There is your clothing. Put them on, then study this.\" He handed Wesley a data pad, \"When I return, I will expect you to know all about Ferengi umachs, then we will go to my quarters to see if you learned well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley tried to speak to thank the captain, but only mewls of pleasure came out, so he just smiled and bowed to the captain. The captain watched him undress, and Wesley found himself showing off Ami's body for him. He could not help it. He put on the skimpy outfit that hid almost nothing, and only at that point did the captain leave. Wesley tried to resist these new feelings. He knew he was being controlled by the collar, but it was no use. Soon he was studying as hard to learn how he could sexually please his Ferengi rescuers as he had ever studied an engineering diagram! He found a strange wetness building in the pussy he now wore!</span></div></div>",

When they got there, the captain was not disappointed. With his sharp mind, Wesley had become the greatest expert on Ferengi sexuality in the human world, and he used every trick of this female body to please his rescuer. He was honored to have the captain as his first partner as a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were both too exhausted to continue, the captain sighed, \"My little one, you are too good for me to keep for myself.\" He led Wesley to a small bed in an alcove connected to his room. There he had him lie down and placed a tiara like device on his head. He smiled, \"With this training device, you will learn to please males of many species. When that training is complete, we can work on females and multi gender species as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley was shocked. If he could have spoken, the shock was enough that he did try to end the simulation, but only a sexy moan escaped his lips. The captain flipped a switch and soon Wesley found himself lusting after a man who looked very much like Commander Riker! He learned many ways to please him! Then it cycled to other species, and then back again. In all things with all species, he was subservient and felt compelled to please men. Before long Wesley stopped thinking of herself in male terms and was female in every thought and action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley had no idea how long she was under the trainer. It was hours, but she had experienced years of life as an object of male pleasure. When she saw the Ferengi aid the captain had sent to get her, she made sure to give him much pleasure for his trouble. She was about to enter the bridge, looking forward to seeing all of those Ferengi males when something happened.</span></div></div>",

At first she is confused because, with the thoroughness of the training, it seems like she has been with the Ferengi for years. Now, with the control collar deactivated, she slowly grasps the reality of what happened and memory begins to return, but as a distant memory. She hears a voice and jumps with a yelp as she spins around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere stands Commander Riker with Dr. Crusher, Counselor Troi and Geordi. Commander Riker spoke again, \"Ensign Langer. What are you doing her dressed like that and where is Wesley Crusher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley tried to focus, which was not easy with two sexy men standing there! \"I, I am, well, I am not Ami Langer, or I am but I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker was not amused. \"Stop playing games Ensign! Where is Wesley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley shook her head, \"Here, sort of. At least that is who I used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Crusher uses her medical scanner, Counselor Troi says, \"She is not lying. She is very confused, but she believes she is, or was Wesley.\" She pauses, \"And I know this will sound like an odd request Will, but I think you and Geordi should leave for now.\" He looked annoyed, \"I am very serious. If you stay, you not only won't get answers from her, you will need to fight her off!\" The men looked confused, but left reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the men gone, it was easier for Wesley to think more clearly. She was eventually able to tell them what happened, and how she originally was supposed to be the buff hero who rescued Ami Langer, not become her. Dr. Crusher shook her head, \"The transformation is perfect. Wesley, how did you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to cry, \"I don't know. I can't remember now. Can you get me back to normal?\"</span></div></div>",

With very much work by Counselor Troi, using a device similar to the trainer, she was able to be around men without ripping their clothing off and begging to be taken, but she was still strongly attracted to males of any species, and even now she was wondering what Geordi was like in bed. Thankfully, she had regained most of her previous IQ. She looked at Geordi, \"So what is the word Geordi? Can you change me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeordi shook his head, \"Sorry Wesley. I can't begin to understand how you did some of those equations. The holodeck equipment should not even be capable of transforming living matter. If you don't know how you did it, I don't think we will ever know. At least not for a very long time.\" Wesley indicated that she could not remember, nor could she understand the work that she had done as a male. Geordi sounded sad, \"Then I need to tell you Wesley. The Captain has been in communication about this with Star Fleet. He agrees with their assessment that the ability to conduct such a perfect transformation is too dangerous to allow at this time. The technology could be too easily abused.\" He hesitated, \"This whole thing is being blacked out. I have been ordered to erase not only the program, but all records and logs relating to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley gasped, \"What? But maybe I could...\", but she knew she couldn't. \"Then what happens to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCounselor Troi was waiting for her cue, \"Extensive work has been done to give you not only a new identity, but a whole life history. I will work with you to help you learn and adjust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared, \"What identity, and what life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Ensign Langer has forgiven you, and has agreed to allow you to be on record as her identical twin sister. She did insist on naming you though. You are now officially Ensign Hoshi Langer, and you will work in Engineering.\" Wesley, now Hoshi was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeordi said, \"I should go for now. I look forward to seeing you on duty in Engineering as soon as Dr. Crusher releases you for duty Ensign Langer.\" With that he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoshi looked at the women, \"What am I supposed to do? I have come a long way, but since I am off the medications, I have a hard time controlling myself around a male of any species, especially human or Ferengi! I can't work like that! I will be a slut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCounselor Troi nodded to Dr. Crusher who left with tears in her eyes, \"Yes Hoshi, you will not be able to completely resist males. I can't risk any additional treatments on you without danger to your brain. So what you need to do is not to fight it, but channel your need properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked shocked, \"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroi smiled, \"Don't be ashamed of what you are. So what if sexual pleasure is important to you? Go up to Ten-Forward and find a nice guy to spend the night with. Embrace your sexuality when you are off duty and you will find you will eventually be able to control it better when you are on duty. Some day you might find the right man to stay with, and then all of your sexual energy can be channelled to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoshi shook her head, \"You REALLY do want me to be a slut?\" She stood up, \"Sure! Why not!\" And she stormed out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of her walk, she actually did end up in Ten-Forward. She sat down to a drink to brood, but she was not there long before a guy sat down across from her, \"Hey Ami. Why are you looking so down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up, \"I am not Ami.\" She hesitated, but knew she had no choice, \"I am her twin sister Hoshi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"Wow! I never knew that Ami had a twin sister! So you are new on board?\" He was hesitant, \"My name is Matt Conner. Would you like a tour of the ship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoshi knew she was beat when he smiled at her, \"Sure. That would be nice.\" It would be a miracle if their tour did not end in Hoshi's bed, and she knew it! As she took his arm to walk out, she was already remembering ways to please human males!</span></div></div>",

Aren't you ruling a planet or something now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley looked down at himself. The long dark hair, the clothing. He had become Salia? How? He said, \"Computer! Stop simulation!\" just as he heard the sounds of fighting coming their way. Amy, and everything else froze. The feminine sound of his voice rang in his ears. Salia's voice was like music to him. \"Computer. Full length mirror.\" When it materialized, his heart leapt to see the girl he loved but could never have. Or could he? First, as tempting as it was to feel himself up in Salia's body, he needed to figure out what happened and get his body back. Once that was done, he was suddenly inspired on his next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was thrilling to be Salia for a while, Wesley didn't really want to be a girl. So after confirming that 'she' was solid matter, and testing it by leaving the holodeck, Wesley figured out what happened. A slight power surge caused a glitch in the program that tapped the transporter history buffers, and since he was the only real person in the room, it locked onto him for the change that happened instead of the change he wanted. Fortunately, it was easy to undo now that he knew it worked and what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was back to himself, Wesley drastically altered the program that he had intended. In a way, it was the same, in that the goal was the same, which was to get laid. This time though, it would take a lot of special programming. Wesley thought of his very shy friend, Ryan, who always seemed to want to hang around Wesley. If Wesley could use the transporter effect to turn Ryan into a copy of Salia, but start off as a holo-matrix first, he might be able to actually program her. In theory, that programming would carry over after using the transporter effect to make her 'real'. Ryan would be much more interesting to be around wearing Salia's body, and the programming could ensure that things went the way Wesley hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several days, but at last it was done. Now all he had to do was figure out how to convince Ryan to try out his new simulation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>** Just my mood I guess, but I want to shift this to first person as Ryan.**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley had been acting strange lately. Very strange when you consider that all of a sudden, he was talking to me, even joking with me at times. He even sat down and ate with me at Ten Forward. Twice! Not that I mind. He is the only real friend that I have on the ship. Not only that, but I greatly admire him. I mean, I am smart. Well above average smart. But when I look at some of the things Wesley works on, and how quickly and easily it comes to him, I feel like a Neanderthal. He is a genius, plain and simple. There is no doubt in my mind that, someday, he will be the greatest scientist in our generation, and maybe for generations to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when he asked me for his help on an experiment that he was working on, of course I was excited! Strange or not, maybe just hanging around Wesley Crusher might improve my understanding of, well, anything he is working on! I joined him on the holo-deck, and, while some of what he had me doing seemed like busy-work, it was fun just to hang around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Wesley said, \"It is ready to try.\" He adjusted something, \"Small steps at first though. Here we go. Computer. Initiate Crusher One-Alpha-One. Subject Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could ask why he said my name, I felt the tingle of a transporter effect. I never fully dissolved though. It lasted for what seemed like a minute, then stopped. I looked at Wesley, and for the first time since I knew him, I had to look 'up' at him! \"Wesley? What is going on?\" My voice sounded strange. Even high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley stared at me and said, \"Computer. Freeze program.\" Then something very strange happened. Right after he said that, it was like there was a glitch in reality, and there was Wesley, standing in a different part of the room in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him again, but there was something different now. \"Wesley. What is going on?\" At least my voice sounded normal now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley stared at me a bit more, \"I will explain, but first a couple of questions. What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of weird game was he playing? \"Ryan of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley smiled, \"And your gender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hoped Wesley wasn't going over the deep end, \"Male of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and pointed, \"Look in the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did, and there stood a beautiful girl, with long, dark hair, in a brown dress with a long, flowing skirt. I reached up to touch my face, and she did the same. I looked at Wesley, then back at myself. \"That is me? How? Why? And why don't I feel different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley smiled softly, \"One question at a time please. How? I used a combination of transporter technology and holo technology to turn you into a holo character. So please don't try to leave the holo-deck until you are tuned back into real matter, or you will vanish. Why? Think of the possibilities! As a holo character, you can become part of any program. Be literally anyone, live anything, without fear of harm. Even if all of the safeties were turned off, even if you were killed, it would only be a simulation. Much safer than some of the things that have happened right here on the Enterprise. Also, you can try different things. Going from male to female is nothing. You could try being a Klingon. Even a Klingon female. Almost any race, as long as they can be recreated by the holo-deck.\" He paused, \"And part of that is why you don't feel different. I altered, well, your programming, to allow you to feel normal, even though your body is different.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned as I reached up and squeezed the small breasts on my chest. They felt normal enough, \"I don't know Wesley. It seems wrong somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley grinned, \"I won't make you. All I ask is that you give it a try for a while. Let me run a few tests, then we can go to dinner. If you still feel the same way, I will change you back right then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, \"Oh, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley ran a bunch of scans on me. When he was done, he said, \"So far, you look great. One more test though.\" He walked behind me, then reaching around me, he took one of my breasts in each hand and began to rub and squeeze them. \"How does that feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, \"Very nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, one of his hands slipped down and began to massage my flat crotch. A slight moan escaped my lips, and I said, \"That feels really nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped, and after giving my ass a good squeeze, he announced, \"See? You are perfectly normal.\" He held out his hand, \"May I take you to lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned. It was so nice to have Wesley's attention! \"Of course!\" And I took his hand and let him lead the way. I was so unused to personal contact, that walking with Wesley and holding his hand was a thrill!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked out the door and found ourselves in Paris in the mid 20th century. It was great not to be laughed at. In fact, it was the opposite. Men showed me attention, waiters held the chair for me, and since Wesley and I were a couple, I didn't feel odd when someone called me his girlfriend.  We had a great time. I never realized how personable Wesley was. I also noticed how handsome he was for the first time also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were done, Wesley stood up and said, \"Well, I promised to change you back after we ate.\" He grinned, \"It was great Ryan.\" Then he said, \"Computer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped up, \"WAIT!\" I blushed a bit \"There is still time. Maybe we can stay until we need to get back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley smiled, \"Sure. If that is what you want.\" He hesitated, \"Um, but if we do, may I call you Salia? You just don't look like a Ryan right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled, \"Well, I do like the sound of that name. It feels right. So sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked a while, then Wesley sat on a park bench, and I decided to sit on his lap for some reason. It felt so nice as he rubbed my breasts again. And what was that lump in his crotch from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like all too soon that we had to go, but before he turned me back, I gave him a small kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was back to myself, Wesley scanned me again, \"All normal. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shifted my feet. \"Fine. No problem.\" And physically, I was fine. What I didn't tell Wesley was that, for some reason, my body felt, well, wrong. At least Wesley was near me, even if we couldn't be together now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"Great! Are you willing to try a different simulation tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart leapt! \"Sure! See you then!\"</span></div></div>",

So when I finally walked in, I had to control showing my excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley looked over to me, \"Ryan! Are you ready for the next level?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, \"I am, but what is the next level?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"To see if you can be immersed into the simulation. To kind of become a part of it. It is hard to explain, but will you try it anyhow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, \"I am game if you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, I felt the transporter effect again. When it was done, I looked down at myself. Long dark hair, breasts, the obvious feel of a pussy between my legs, all encased in a brown dress. Wesley looked at me, \"Are you okay Salia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, \"Yes, but I thought you were going to change me. I just look like my normal self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"That because the normal you is so beautiful, how could I improve on it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed as my heart fluttered. I loved it when Wesley talked to me like that, \"Thanks. What is next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley sighed, \"Unfortunately, while you were in transition, I got a call from Geordi. Those VIPs are soon going to start transporting aboard, and there is something going on in the replicator circuits. We are supposed to report to our stations immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, \"Too bad.\" Then with a mischievous grin, I said, \"I was really looking forward to some sexy sim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley walked up and took me into his arms, \"So was I.\" He kissed me passionately for a few moments as he caressed my ass, \"We are both supposed to go to that formal welcome for the delegates. Let's meet there. Maybe afterward, we can make our own story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel the tingle in my pussy just thinking about it! \"That is a date!\" We tore ourselves apart to report to our engineering stations. Of course, at the time, I had no idea that this WAS the simulation, or I wouldn't have been able to leave the holo-deck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard working so close to Wesley and not get to feel his touch. I smiled when, as he got a chance, he would pinch me or grope me. I kept thinking, 'Would tonight be THE night?' My heart sank when Wesley was called away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my work was done, I headed back to my quarters. It was easy to smile at everyone I passed since I was thinking about my date with Wesley tonight. I had a hard time picking out the right dress. It had to be formal enough for the even, but sexy enough to please Wesley. My mom helped me with my hair, and I worked hard to get my makeup perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom smiled at the way I jumped when the door indicator sounded. I didn't care! My heart thumped and then leapt as Wesley walked in, looking so handsome in his dress uniform!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party was interesting. Meeting representatives from so many planets, but my heart was not in it. Finally, Wesley said, \"Salia.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As we entered the passageway, something changed. I paused and looked down. I was in Salia's body, and I could feel the anticipation in my body. Wesley was next to me and said, \"Are you okay Ryan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. I remembered what we did earlier, and what I was thinking and feeling. \"Um, yes. It is just strange to shift perspective so suddenly. Why did you stop?\" There was no doubt that I was horny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked serious, \"This is a recreation of what happened my first time with Salia. I know where it leads to, and I didn't want to unable to make a choice. If you want to stop here, or change the outcome, I understand.\" Of course, he was lying. Thanks to her bodyguard, Wesley was lucky for the small kiss he got from her. But Ryan was not on the ship then, so he had no idea. \"I mean, it gets very personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. Wesley was just so considerate! \"Well, I have been enjoying myself as a girl. If you don't mind, I would like to see what happened through Salia's eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley grinned. The programming was working. \"Okay. In that case, computer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. Why had we stopped? Before I could ask, Wesley took my hand and led me to his quarters. Since being made an official ensign, he had his own quarters, and while small, they were nice.I was so excited to be alone with Wesley at last! As soon as the door closed behind us, I threw my arms around him and began to kiss him passionately! I could feel my nipples rising and pushing into his chest, and I could feel the lump in his crotch pressed into my abdomen. My desire for him was building by the second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thrill was even greater when Wesley slipped the straps of my dress off of my shoulders and I allowed it to fall, revealing my nakedness to Wesley. I sighed at the feeling of his hands on my breasts. I had taken the time to read about human sexuality, so, wanting to please Wesley, I slipped to my knees as he removed his shirt. Pulling his pants down, I got another thrill at my first sight of a male penis! I touched it, and giggled as it seemed to jump to life. I loved the musky smell from his crotch, and soon I went from stroking it to kissing it. It was amazing how hard his previously soft flesh could get! When it seemed to be the right time, I took his penis into my mouth and began to suck it and let my tongue play around it. I did this for a very long time, massaging his balls as I did. Then his penis began to spasm, and soon, his sweet and salty cum was pouring into my mouth! It tasted wonderful! And I gladly swallowed every drop that I could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was sure there was no more, I looked up at him with a smile, \"Did I do well Wesley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was wonderful to see him smile and hear him say, \"You are the perfect woman Salia. You did great!\" He held his hand out and lifted me to him. Then he picked me up and carried me to his bed. We spent a long time enjoying the feelings of playing with each other's bodies, flesh on flesh, and then, eventually, Wesley moved me onto my back. I seemed to know by instinct to spread my legs as wide as I could. I sighed when I felt the head of his penis caressing the entrance to my pussy, but I gasped in both surprise and pleasure to feel myself being penetrated for the first time! It was the most incredible feeling I have every experienced! Soon, he was driving in and out, moving inside me with a fantastic rhythm! I moaned louder and louder, unable to help myself! After a long time, I felt Wesley's penis begin to pulse again, then felt the warm fluid enter my body. I screamed in pleasure as an orgasm rocked my body! Who could have known there could be such pleasure!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were done, I fell asleep in Wesley's arms, only waking up as myself sometime later. Wesley had already left, but left a note thanking me for a fantastic night. I wanted to thank him! And it was a real downer to realize that I was back to normal, in my geeky, male body. I sighed and went to my quarters, thinking of Wesley until I went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, I met Wesley on the  holodeck as planned. Soon, I was back in Salia's wonderful body. The simulation was still on the Enterprise, but in some larger personal quarters. I looked around, then asked Wesley, \"What is this? It looks like the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"It is, only in this simulation, we are married. To everyone that we meet or talk to, you are now Mrs. Crusher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded great to me! Then I looked up at him, \"Only one thing. Um, I have a favor to ask Wesley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"For my wife? Anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both laughed a bit, then I said, \"Could I have my own name? I mean, not be called Salia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at me skeptically, \"Well, uh, no offense, but I don't think that Ryan is a good girl's name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, \"I don't want to be called Ryan. I just don't want to be Salia. Isn't there another girl's name I could use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \"Oh! Okay! Did you have a name in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, \"How about Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I became Emily Crusher. In the simulation, I did my old work and interacted with the rest of the crew as a female and Wesley's wife, and it was wonderful! Each day, we would sneak off to our quarters and make love. Sometimes, we would be in an area where we were alone long enough, and I would give Wesley a blowjob. This went on a long time, and with each day we did it, I loved Wesley more and more, and loved being female even more than that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the day came when Wesley looked at me and said, \"Okay, it is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him confused, \"What is ready Sweetheart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed me, \"The transporter effect that I have been working on. The one that should make you real, but in that body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped up and down and kissed him! \"Really!?!?! I could leave the holodeck in this body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed me and then said, \"Yes, but please settle down. We have to think that part out. It's not like you can go walking around the Enterprise in Salia's body. Someone would recognize you for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at him, \"So, do you have thoughts on that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, \"We will try some things that are still in the simulation, but you will become some of the real women on board. Eventually, one of them will be off-ship for some reason, then you can be her.\" He looked sheepish, \"Um, I might throw in some others just for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, \"Okay. Their body, but will I still use my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Of course. My wife is always Emily.\" He kissed me, \"Ready to begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, Wesley said something I couldn't understand, and then I felt the transporter effect. When it was over, I felt very different. Not like the difference of going from male to female, but different. I was much shorter now, but in spite of that, my breasts were huge! My ass felt huge too! In spite of that, I could tell I had a classic hourglass figure! I saw the mirror on the far wall. I looked way up at Wesley, \"Counselor Troi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"No. My wife, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in a little while, I noticed something strange in my head. At first I didn't know what it was, but then I said, \"Wow! You are really horny for me right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw dropped, \"You can tell that?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, \"I guess I am like the real thing.\" I walked up to him, \"Now let's see what she is like in bed!\" As I kissed him, I could feel his lust for me building. I could also sense something of deception, but I ddn't care. I was as horny as he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were done that day, before he changed me back, I took his hand, \"Wesley, before you change me back, I have a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed, but managed to say it, \"If you can give me this body for real, can you make real alterations to my real body too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked confused, but I could sense his curiosity and hopefulness. \"Well, if we are going to try out different females, could you make it so that, while I have my male body, that, well, that I would have a pussy? Like right now, could you change me back to Ryan, but with Counselor Troi's pussy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe radiated hope, triumph and lust! \"I am sure that I could, but why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, \"Because, I have come to prefer being female, and....\" It was hard to say, but I had to, \"... and, well, there might be times that we could have sex, or I could do things for you, that I couldn't, or wouldn't want to as a male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley grinned, \"Let's give it a try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, I was standing there in what appeared to by my normal male body, but between my legs, I had Dianna Troi's pussy! It was great! Since I was female now, I got right down on my knees and gave Wesley the best blowjob yet, just to thank him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the coming days, I was a number of women, including some from the past, or even from history. I was Tasha Yar, Lt. Uhura, and even T'pol as well as many current members of the crew. However, frequently, I was back to Salia's body, we both seemed to enjoy that the most. And since, regardless of who's pussy it was that I was wearing, I was now technically a full-time female now, we often found ways to make love or for me to give Wesley a 'quicky'.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One evening, Wesley grinned at me, \"I have something new to try tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI always loved when Wesley got creative! \"Really? What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Remember when those Orions were onboard a few weeks ago? Well, you know how protective they are of their women. They are mutes, but they are said to have bodies that are the ideal sex machines. I have figured out a way to make your Salia body a mix of human and Orion, if you are willing to try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, \"I think it sounds exciting! I won't be a mute like them will I?\" When he assured me that I would not be, I said, \"Okay. I wonder why, with all the technology and medical options they have, that they don't cure that for their women?\" Wesley just shrugged. If he could get good sex, what did he care?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transporter effect hit me, and soon, I was standing there in Salia's body again. But this time, I felt very different. Not like when I had become Troi for the first time. This was different. There was something different 'inside' of me. I looked over at Wesley, and I was almost instantly horny! I almost jumped on him! He grinned and made the simulation straight into our favorite bedroom! I thought we were both acting strangely, but it didn't matter. I wanted him and he wanted me! Soon we were naked on the bed. The first thing I noticed that was different was that Wesley's cock was rock hard! More so than normal! Not that that was a problem, but it was odd. When he began to press into me, it was like my pussy took on a life if it's own! My pussy lips acted like the lips on my mouth, kissing and then sucking in Wesley's cock! It surprised both of us, but it felt fantastic beyond description for both of us!!! Not only that, but just as he started to penetrate me, my nipples began to leak a thick milk. Wesley grinned and leaned down and began to lick it. In moments, he was groaning in pleasure as he was frantically sucking my breasts! It felt wonderful to me, but somehow, it seemed to drive him wild! When it stopped, it was like my pussy used muscles that had been dormant, and literally pulled Wesley's cock deep inside of me as far as it could go! Once there, the walls of my pussy pressed, and flexed, and vibrated in a variety of ways that both held Wesley in place between my legs, and at at the same time acted like some kind of super vibrator that drove both Wesley and I into orgasm after orgasm! After a very long time, it finally stopped, and, in a daze, Wesley pulled out of me and lay beside me on his back, not speaking, but smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, and when I could speak again, I said, \"What was wonderful Wesley!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes looked glazed, \"That was wonderful.\" He said that in a strange way though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged and continued, \"You MUST let me keep this pussy and breasts always! Even as Ryan!\" I was sure I could hide Salia's small breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley just repeated, \"You must keep that pussy and those breasts always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was odd. I looked more closely at him. He looked like he was in a daze. Then I realized, it was like he was hypnotized! I wondered something. I decided to give it a try. \"Wesley, you love me with all your heart. You love me as Emily, and as Ryan. There is no difference. And to you, we are married. It is a deep secret that only we know, but I am your wife for real, and you are my husband. Not only here, but always. You love me so much that you would do anything I ask. Anything.\" Wesley just seemed to repeat what I said, so I went on, \"Wesley, when I say wake up, you will wake up, and you will not remember being in a trance. You will only remember the great feelings and great sex, and that I am your secret love and your real wife.\" He repeated that, then I said, \"Okay, wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley shook his head as if coming out of a dream, then he looked at me and smiled, \"Emily! That was incredible!\" He hugged me and kissed me then said, \"I am so lucky to have a wife like you! Someday, maybe we can tell everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hugged him, \"Thank you Wesley. I hope so too.\" Oh my word! It worked! Then it struck me. The Orion women must have this power over men! The men kept them mute to keep the women from controlling them! When Wesley made me half Orion, I kept the part with the power, but was not mute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Wesley was recovered, I teased with him,and soon we were at it again! When it was all done, I reinforced my orders to Wesley. When we left the holodeck, even though I was in what appeared to be Ryan's male body, Wesley never wavered from considering me to be his wife!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to borrow a medical tricorder, and I soon discovered that both my milk and my pussy juices contained powerful, organic aphrodisiacs and mind bending drugs! Not only that, but it seemed that I could control the emission of pheromones that also had the ability to make a male from almost any species horny for me in moments. This could be both fun and useful!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The only drawback to the new changes was that I was almost constantly horny! Most of the time I could control it, but eventually, I needed a male desperately! Of course, I was usually around Wesley, so that was no problem. With him, I soon learned that my mouth and throat had similar properties to my pussy, and it made me the perfect cock-sucker! The best part for was that I experienced the same sexual stimulation in my mouth as I did in my pussy, so orgasms came no matter what! And just a passionate kiss would drive any male crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day though, Wesley was in another part of the ship, and I was stuck on a boring duty in engineering. Without something to distract me, I just got too horny to control the need. The next thing I knew, I was walking up to Ensign Maltek. He stared at me a while, obviously fighting what was rapidly growing in his body. I didn't wait for him to succumb. I lean up and kissed him, and that was all it took. The intense aphrodisiacs in my saliva made him putty in my hands almost instantly.Soon, we found an isolated spot, and I quickly went to my knees and gave him the blowjob of his life! Unfortunately for him, I used the mind altering ability to make sure that he would not remember what happened. Although he would now obey me. I considered it a good test to see how long it would last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a similar thing happened with another engineering teem member, we were almost caught by one of the females on duty. Well, actually we were caught, technically, but in my panic, I discovered that my powers even effected females, and soon, we were in a threesome! I also learned that, when dealing with another female, my tongue could do incredible things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to two different things happening. One was that I began to retain my form as Salia even when off of the holodeck. A little at a time, I had everyone in engineering, including Commander La Forge, consider my Salia form as right and normal. As a side effect of that, I also had effective control of the entire engineering team!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing was that, one day I found Wesley's personal log, and after ordering him to give me the password, I started reading back. That was when I discovered what Wesley had originally done to me, and intended to to with me, until that it, he had mistakenly given me the powers that I now possessed. To say that I was pissed off was an understatement! You heard the saying about a woman scorned? Well, I was a woman now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, I seduced Wesley's mom, and made him watch as the two of us had some of the wildest lesbian sex you could imagine! I then used my new 'relationship' with Beverly to establish that I was 'transitioning' into a female 'medically'. Then, using Wesley's transporter process, I gradually became 'Emily' both publicly and permanently. Wesley was both disturbed by my dating his mother, and jealous. The next step was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having Beverly as one of my favorite girlfriends was very advantageous. Using her skills as a doctor, I was able to learn that the chemicals in my body stayed active for at least months. And through tests, we found that the mental changes were as permanent as I wanted them to be. Over time, I found that I could have triggers for things that were solid as rock. And that is when Wesley found out just how powerful he had made me. The truth was, I could have taken over the ship if I was so minded. Only Commander Data would have been immune to me. I had no desire for power though. Oh, it was fun to have anyone I wanted sexually, but I had no desire to hurt, or rule anyone, except Wesley of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his quarters, after a wonderful sexual experience, I started the process that would seal Wesley's fate. As he was in a trance, I said, \"Wesley, from now on, if you are not alone or with me, you want to be a girl. It is your heart's desire. Starting now, you will study females, especially close to your own age. You will want to learn how to walk, talk, sit, stand, and in every way behave like a girl. You desire to be a girl. To have your own, real, breasts and pussy. You want to be fully female. That is important, because you want to have children. As many children as you can. When we are done here, you will go to your mother and explain your desire to become a female and have a family. When you are outside of your quarters, or not alone with me, that will be your greatest, deepest desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, \"However, when you are alone in your quarters, you will want to stay male and fear pregnancy. The same is true if you are alone with me. You absolutely do NOT want to be female, and the thought, or later, the memory, of having a pussy and feeling a male drive into you, dumping his load deep inside of you, will be the most disgusting thing possible to you. But as soon as you so much as talk to someone, you will be looking forward to the day that you can feel a male penis driving into you.\" You grinned, \"So your desires when around anyone but me is to become female and have as many children as you can. That will be your truth. But when you are alone or alone with me, your desire will be to stay or become a male, and you will not want children. That will be your truth then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next step, \"Starting when you wake up, not mater what, you will feel compelled to wear only female clothing from now on. Unless your work or uniform regulations require different, you will always choose a skirt or dress, and always keep your legs smooth. You will wear makeup and jewelry and let your hair grow very long. This will be a compulsion. You will not want to on the inside. On the inside you will feel humiliated, but you cannot help it. There is one exception. If you are anywhere near Counselor Troi, you will love to dress in feminine ways, and you will want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final touch, \"Now, when you wake up, you will remember that I gave you these orders, but you will not be able to resist them or communicate to anyone about my power over you. Now, wake up, change into an appropriate uniform, and go straight to your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wesley woke up, a look of horror came over his face! He looked at me, \"What did you do? How?\" But even as he said it, he was going to his closet, and unable to find a skirt, he had the computer make him new uniforms. All dresses. Then putting one on, he headed for the sick bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was necessary for him to go through the pretense of a medical sex change so that nobody questioned it. Normally, gender was settled by now, but it was not unheard of for a boy his age to change gender. However, I had a specially programmed body for him, and we would use his method to change him gradually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got back, I wouldn't let him speak. I took him to the holodeck, where I used his process to give him his first treatment, which was female nipples and to make sure that his cock was no longer capable of getting an erection. When that was done, I let him speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily!\" he gasped, \"Why are you doing this to me? I thought you love me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned wickedly, \"Oh, I did. But when I read your log and saw what you did to me, it broke your spell. You won't find breaking mine so easy though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time, I continued to reinforce my instructions to Wesley over and over. Eventually, he gave up fighting it. He looked so cute in a dress with makeup! The target body I had for Wesley was very short, extremely pretty, had large breasts with an hour-glass figure, and was very, very, very fertile. It was fun to watch him transition, and when I added a compulsion to flirt with males, it got even more fun. I loved to watch how uncomfortable he was as his breasts developed. As soon as the treatments reached the point where he looked more female than male, I had him change his name to Candice, but to tell people to call him Candi. Well, 'her' at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi/Wesley was about three-quarters complete when something new happened...</span></div></div>",

She had no idea that this was only the beginning of her punishment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was during this time that the Captain and some kind of super-empath or something were dealing with an alien ship that seemed to also be a living creature. That was way above my level, so of course I was not involved with that. The thing was that, at some point, the creature emitted some kind of energy wave, destroying a Romulan cruiser and greatly damaging the Enterprise. However, when that wave hit, something else happened to me. I could feel the wave approaching, like slow motion, and when it hit, I could feel it pass through me. More than that though, it seemed to soak into me, and flow through my body. Something inside of me changed. It was like a switch had suddenly been turned on. I felt like I had been asleep my whole life, and now I just woke up, full of energy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew it was only mili-seconds, but it felt like an hour. When it was passed, I couldn't begin to describe how different that I felt. I was in the passageway at the time. I felt someone taking my arm and say, \"Are you okay?\" It was Lt. Howe from weapons. He was huge and very strong, and lifted me like a feather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, \"Yeah. I am fine.\" The red alert was sounding, \"Really. Go ahead. They might need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left, and I headed toward my station in engineering. As I did though, I felt myself changing. I didn't quite understand, but things seemed to be getting smaller. I was just getting close to engineering when I almost ran into Commander Riker. The odd thing was, I was taller than he was! How is that possible? He looked at me, \"Lt. Howe? Why are you heading this way? You should be going to weapons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at myself. I really did look like him! In fact, I could feel that I was now a male! How? I shook my head, \"Of course sir. I must have been more rattled than I thought when whatever hit us threw me around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clapped a hand on my shoulder, \"I understand. If you still feel disoriented, you better report to medical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head no, \"No sir. I think I will be fine. Just a temporary disorientation.\" Riker seemed satisfied with that when I started moving in the right direction for weapons. As soon as I heard the turblift doors close, I resumed my path to engineering. How had this happened? I was male!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt like something was changing again. but it was hard to say what. I could tell that I was still a male, and while I was not the same, I was not far off. When I was almost at the door to engineering, I just avoided running into T'lar, the cute Vulcan girl who had just come on board. He looked up at me and said, \"Oh! I am sorry Commander. Please, you go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now I was in the form of Commander Riker? I looked at her, \"No need. Please inform Mr. Le Forge that I have ordered Emily to report to medical and she won't be at her station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked serious, \"Of course sir!\" I told her to carry on and she left.  Maybe I better go to medical. At least Beverly could shield me from prying eyes until I figured this out. As I was walking, I was changing again. Soon I could tell that I had breasts and a pussy, but very different from what I had been used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I made it to medical, Beverly looked at me and said, \"Are you injured Ensign?\" Her words seemed loud, and I could smell her. For some reason though, it was not pleasant to me. I looked up at her, then around the sickbay. There were some more people there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought my attention back to her, \"No ma'am, but there is something that I need to talk to you about. May I wait in your office until you are done?\" She agreed, being distracted by attending to the wounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her office, I found a mirror, and there she was, T'lar. Somehow, I was a Vulcan girl now! But even as I watched, I as changing. Soon, I had Beverly's body, dressed exactly like she  had been when I walked in! Somehow, I was transforming into the last person that I met! I had to get control of this! I focused on T'lar in my mind, and soon, I was a Vulcan female again. Then I was back to Lt. Howe. I was able to get back to myself, then back to T'lar. It seemed as though I could control it if I kept my focus. I then changed back to T'lar,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeverly looked at me and said, \"Now. How can I help you Ensign?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at her, \"I was not injured, but felt odd after we were hit by that energy wave. When you are finished with the injured, would you take the time to scan me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"I have time now.\" She motioned, \"Please lay here.\" She motioned to a diagnostic bed. I lay there, trying to be calm. After a few minutes, she stopped with the scan and said, \"I can't find an issue. You seem like a normal Vulcan female.\" Then she leaned close to me and said, \"And don't worry. It did not trigger Pon-far. You should be fine for at least a few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thanked her, and as soon as I could, I transformed back into myself and rushed to my quarters! What was going on? Using Candi/Wesley's command codes, I dug back much farther in his, well, her, journal for any references to Salia. When I found it, I gasped! She was a shape shifter! More than that, her natural form seemed to be some kind of energy! That must be it! Wesley's method made me into a copy of her, but that was not all. Even in human form, she must have retained something in her makeup as a shape shifter. The energy in that wave must have been the same type of energy, or close enough, and somehow, it triggered this power in me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith practice and experimenting I found that, not only could I become anyone I ever saw, but I could mix traits. It was hilarious to see Captain Picard's head on Counselor Troi's body, or Commander Riker with Dr. Crusher's breasts and pussy! What was even more amazing was that I could even become Commander Data! The possibilities seemed to be limitless! I had to hide this ability too!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Candi/Wesley was due for her last 'treatment' on the holodeck. However, when it finished, while she looked to be one-hundred percent female now, that was not exactly true. After grabbing her crotch, she looked up at me, \"You made me male 'down there'? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be fun, \"Yes. I felt like you should have one last chance, as a male, to impregnate a female. So I did some research and found out that, back in the eugenics period, the males were enhanced with the ability to generate large quantities of sperm, and that the sperm was so aggressive and survivable that it would live inside of a woman's body for month, just waiting for her cycle to deliver an egg. Sex with one of those males was almost a guaranteed pregnancy! Your penis is now modeled after that.\" Of course that last part about guaranteed pregnancy was a lie, but he needed to believe it for my plan. I added another fiction, \"And just to be sure that she is willing, you will emit pheromones at that time that will make her 'want' to have your baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe/he grinned at me, \"So you 'want' me to get you pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked disgusted, \"Oh no! You will know when. You will get too horny to stop yourself! I will let it be a surprise though. Oh, and just so you don't get your hopes up, that penis will only work for sex. You will find that you still need to sit down to pee.\" I giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let Candi/Wesley go a few days. Then one evening, when I new she/he was alone, I was ready. I took on the form or Beverly Crusher. When the door opened, I entered. As soon as the door closed behind me, I slowly began to emit the pheromones that would drive Candi/Wesley crazy! She he looked at me, \"Mom? What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, \"I just wanted you to know how proud I am that you chose to be female. When you are done, we will have to have a girls-night-out to celebrate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi/Wesley as getting very, very uncomfortable, \"Um, mom. Maybe we should talk about this another time. Right now isn't a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked deeper into the room, \"What's wrong? You are acting funny.\" I began to fidget a little, and loosened my collar. I stepped closer, \"You know, you really do look cute as a girl.\" I licked my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, Candi/Wesley was trying to fight it. With his/her eyes closed, he/she said, \"Mom! You really need to leave! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped closer, making sure my nipples were now poking out and my pussy getting wet, \"What's the matter honey? Why are you talking to me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi/Wesley was almost crying in strain to maintain control, \"Because Emily made sure that, for now, where it counts, I am male. Not just any male, but like one from the eugenics period, where the genetically altered males had super sperm that would guarantee pregnancy. Mom! I am getting horny for you! Please leave before it is too late, or you will be having my baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cooed, \"Is that why I feel this way?\" I walked up and began to massage his/her breasts. That was too much for Wesley, and just like that, we were in each other's arms, locked in a passionate kiss! I whispered, \"Give me your baby Wesley, that way I will always have a part of my son to remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe/she breathlessly whispered, \"No mom. We can't. This is wrong.\" But he/she was undressing me as he/she said it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moaned as I undressed him/her, \"I don't care. I love you and I want your baby Wesley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon we were naked on the bed. It was almost funny to see such a pretty, petite, and feminine girl with such a large and hard cock! It felt wonderful when he/she entered me! I made sure it lasted a long time, then I let him cum. The only bad part was that, for the effect, I needed to tolerate very large volumes of his cum being pumped inside of me, most of which was going to leak out of my pussy later in a sticky mess. But it was worth the look of of torture on Wesley's face as he made every effort to NOT cum inside of his mother, and the despair he showed when he actually did do it! Then he/she fell asleep on my breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited a while, got up, cleaned up, then got dressed again. When I was ready, I shook him/her to wake him/her up, \"Wesley! Wake up!\" I had also taken out a medical tricorder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe/she slowly woke up, the realizing who it was, pulled the covers up to hide his/her nakedness, then said, \"Mom! What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked as angry as I could, \"What am I doing!?!? What have YOU done! I just ran a scan! I am already pregnant!\" I stormed around the room, \"And whatever was in you causes the embryo to embed in a special way. If I would try to terminate this pregnancy, it would kill me too! How could you do this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe/she was crying, \"I didn't mean to! What can I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \"Well, for starters, never, ever mention this to anyone! And I mean anyone! I can use some inhibitors to greatly slow down the growth until I am ready to move forward, so nobody will know. I will have to leave the Enterprise eventually, to have the baby, but nobody must know who the father is! As for you! You need to leave the ship, and until you do, never bring this up again. Not even to me! Even alone, after today, we will both act like this never happened. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe/she agreed, then said, \"But what can I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI acted unsure, then said, \"Wait! I know. You could go to Mariposa! Join the Bringloidi. Nobody from the federation will be stopping bye there for decades. They could use your engineering skills! We are not far away from them right now. A shuttle could take you there easily.\" I paused, \"Get Emily to change you to a full female, then make the necessary requests. I will back you up, both as your mother and ship's doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi/Wesley was in a suggestible state of mind, but even then, he/she said, \"But mom! As a female, well, you know what we left there! No marriage, and females must have children by law! From different fathers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my hands on his/her shoulders, \"Exactly! You will greatly contribute to the diversity of their gene pool! Between children, you can help them by being an engineer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe/she hung his/her head, \"You are right mom. I am so sorry I messed things up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left, quickly changing back into Emily. I used my powers to make sure the real Beverly would back things up, just in case, and then found Candi/Wesley. After letting him/her beg me to make him/her fully female, I happily accommodated, making sure that she was very fertile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crying Candi confessed to me what she had done, and told me that, even though she didn't want to, she needed to leave the Enterprise and join the colony at Mariposa. Of course I agreed, and handed her a data chip. I knew that their technology was way below ours, so I designed the chip in such a way that, until Candi built a device that would let her use the process on herself, it would not work. It had to be plugged into a fully operational device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \"This chip will tell you a lot of things that you will find interesting after you have been there a few years.\" I handed her another chip, \"It will not work until you build the device that you have here. These are a copy of your plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day later, Candi was on a shuttle to Mariposa. In reading what Wesley had wanted to do, which was to turn me into different women, breeding me in each of those bodies, I had settled on his, now her, punishment. Candi would start to be horny almost as soon as she arrived there. And while Mariposan law required each woman to have at least four children, each from a different man, Candi would seek to be impregnated by every man with unique DNA. And when she had cycled through them, she would alter her body to a new female and do it all again, and then a new female, and again, through about a dozen females. The first one would be as a recreation of Tasha Yar, then Amy Langer, then others. I smiled, thinking of the hundreds of children she would contribute to Mariposa's genetic diversity. My revenge was complete.</span></div></div>",

Ribbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit was formed to his specifications instantly. He slid the still-warm suit from the replicator. As expected, it was skin tight, contoured to fit the measurements of his hourglass figure. But if he'd thought his old clothes had looked hard to fit in, this looked impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the fabric was a little stretchy and a zipper in the back granted him a little lee-way, and he slid one leg into the hole. It felt weird sliding his smooth, hairless leg into the warm, metallic material. It clung to his skin as he slipped in up to the waist, and then slid his hands into the arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was somehow able to zip himself in [Seven of Nine was so flexible!] and the suit sealed around him with a faint hiss as what little air remained between his skin and the fabric was forced out under the elastic tension of the suit. He looked down. Somehow, he felt more exposed than when he was naked. The rigid ribs of the suit accentuated his natural curves and pushed out his breasts. Blushing, he realised he was totally on show for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no time to worry about modesty. \"Replicator. Cortical stimulatory,\" he whispered. The requested item was replicated. It clipped firmly to the skin just above his eyebrow - not identical to Seven of Nine's implant, but similar enough to go unnoticed without scrutiny. A medical handbrace completed the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg196/celebmonkey/JeriRyan-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg196...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically, he was indistinguishable.

This time around she headed to medical perhaps in this story the doctor could have worked up a cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gore slid off her blade as she shook it, another zombie Seven came towards her as the lift opened leaving her little room to swing the blade.

He knew he could become restless when he spent too long on Voyager. There was also his passenger, he glanced at Lt. Smalls. Well, she wasn't really a passenger, she worked in Engineering... it wasn't her speciality, but then again. Many of the crew weren't filling quite the roles they planned, but that's the nature of their current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skills were in exotic particles, and that was good.

Smalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom managed to blink the worst of the blood from his eyes, and saw the ceiling of Sick-bay. Oddly it was Seven that was working there. Raising a finger, Tom tried to ask a question, before he could get the first word out he saw Seven approach with a hypo-spray. With a hiss his head lolled to the side, and he spotted Lt.

He was still exhausted and everything felt heavy and dull. But he was relieved to feel his toes twitch, even if they felt leaden. He gave a weak groan as his eyes flickered open. He tried to lift his head from the pillow, but only hissed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately he smiled wider and felt a twinkle return to his eye. As he looked up, the ceiling was blocked. It looked like B'lanna and Seven were discussing his case, and his recovery. He wasn't sure, but it sounded like his injuries were more serious than he realised. He felt his hand being squeezed, when Seven told her it would be a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also heard her say that he could be up in a day or two, but with reduced mobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom gave a louder groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's waking up.\" B'lanna said excitedly. A rare tone of voice for the normally restrained or angry half-klingon. She didn't like showing emotions, afraid they would allow her klingon side to surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dull thump, as Seven gave him a hypo-spray. There was soon a warmth filling his muscles, driving away the pain and dullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you get used to these obstructions.\" Seven rubbed the side of her breast where it had bumped against the bio-bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom caught B'lanna smiling, and his brain went into over drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....B'lanna hated Seven, but they were here together and not arguing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Seven didn't sound like herself, -well- not her pattern of speech....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....This was Sickbay, and Seven was, in Starfeet medical uniform and complaining about having large tits....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Doc....' he groaned as a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm experimenting with some new holo-matrices.', she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Very impressive.' he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the haze lifted from Tom's brain and he started to be able to concentrate and feel better, he saw small but definite differences in her face. The hair was a paler shade, and hung freely over her shoulders and down her back. The doc's eyes were chestnut, whereas Seven's were a lovely Sapphire blue. There was even a dusting of freckles across the bridge of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, you have a lot to adjust to.\" B'lanna informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started to feel awkward and hard to keep eye contact, given how the women were standing over him, and hard to disguise his furtive glances. So, he tried to sit up. It was a huge effort and he stopped, not wanting to make an injury worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with B'lanna there, she put an arm behind his shoulder, and from the other side the Doc did the same. Together they helped him sit forward. The problem was obvious, he had a huge stomach wound. It was rather thoroughly bound up, bulging out as big as the Lieutenant's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, cautiously, expecting an answering pain he ran his hand over the swelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the club.\" B'lanna said dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer free hand also circling gently her own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid Tracy didn't make it.\" the doctor said. \"But we had a chance to save the infant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's head flashed around questions on his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he only ended up with a face full of her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB'lanna and the doctor stood back, and let Tom prop himself up with his own arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor had an odd colour to her cheeks as she blushed at the contact.</span></div></div>",

I hear that helps with the bonding process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked pale and sickly even at the mention of having to give birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The least traumatic could be for us to use the transporter when it become time and the fetus is viable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was nodding enthusiastically at the last option. Although B'lanna and the Captain were already asking for more details about the surgical options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it help Tom adjust, or the baby develop properly if Tom had breasts?\" B'lanna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would avoid the need for hormone injections.\" she answered dispassionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not putting titties on me.\" Tom objected rather shrilly. His voice also cracked and undermined his complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Titties will come in any case, Tommi.\" She even made sure to emphasise the feminine form of his name, \"That's beyond doubt, a natural consequence of the hormones.\"</span></div></div>",

B'Elanna was lost in her own bliss, as she screamed out her ecstasy. Tom was glad of the soundproofing, but the pain was becoming a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he glanced down his body, he saw a new and bigger problem develop. His nipples were now atop small but very pert and very real breasts. He took his hands from B'Elanna's breasts, letting her balance herself, and cupped his own little breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he held them, they continued to swell until B'Elanna noticed. As his wife looked down she saw her man with breasts as big as that slut Seven. She huffed in annoyance, and a little jealousy. She slid reluctantly off Tom's body seeking out her comm badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tweeted as she slapped it, \"Medical Emergency in sleeping quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched nervously as the doctor raced towards them. She saw his hips spread out, hearing the bones crack painfully, and sadly she watched as his cock vanished.

How are there personalities changing?\u201d she snapped, \u201cwell to be blunt\u201d the doctor said, \u201cIt appears male crewmen are becoming more dominant, and female crewmen are becoming more submissive\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway looked at him shocked and was about to say something, when the doctor continued, \u201cI know that this sounds like some archaic form of sexism, but I can assure that\u2019s what the facts suggest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt happened to me,\u201d B'Elanna said, \u201cFor a minute I was completely scared, it was like nothing I\u2019ve ever felt before, I\u2019m sure, at that point I would have done anything I was ordered to.\u201d Janeway was still quite taken back by this, the idea sounded like some kind of Ferengi holodeck program, but if the doctor told this was true it had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny idea what\u2019s causing this Change?\u201d she asked, the doctor nodded, \u201cI did several brain scans, of everyone so far effected, and look at this\u201d he turned on a monitor, it showed about seven brains he clicked the button, and another seven appear below, the first seven, \u201cthis first one is before the energy hit the ship, the second is after, as you can see, in that time, this area of the brain has changed shape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe zoomed in on, \u201can area of the sub campus, that area controls personality and mostly dominance of personality\u201d \u201cOkay so what can we do about it?\u201d she asked, \u201cI have no idea,\u201d the doctor replied, \u201cI tried to change it back, but it had no effect, and it just started adjusting shape again when I finished, it appears at the least I can\u2019t do anything to stop it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d said Janeway slightly more worried now, \u201cHas it affected everyone, or just some of the crew?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure, captain, everyone I\u2019ve checked has had it, and that\u2019s about half the ship, there all have the changes in the same way, I believe the reason its having the opposite effect, is down to slight change in the shape of this part of the brain to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, keep working\u201d Janeway said, and turned to leave, \u201cCaptain, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Tom said, Janeway stopped, and held the doctors scanner up to her head, there was a flash and a bleep, \u201cCaptain, I should inform you, that your affected as well\u201d Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway felt pail on the inside, but as captain it was important to show no sign of weakness, so she didn\u2019t show it, \u201ccaptain,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cwith your permission, I would like to test the whole crew, to see how much of a problem were dealing with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed\u201d Janeway said, and turned to leave again, but was stopped again, \u201cCaptain, I think I should let you know, this process hasn\u2019t stopped, it is still affecting the crew, it hasn\u2019t finished yet, and I have little idea when it will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway paused, and then said, \u201cvery well, first does it affect both genders, at the same rate?\u201d The doctor shook his head, \u201cit appears that the change for males is a lot less great than the change for females, this is most likely also down to slight changes in the size of the part of the brain,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell keep working till you find a cure\u201d Janeway said, \u201cand I don\u2019t care if that means, we burn out several of the holoprojecters, B'Elanna, assign some engineers her to help if that does happen, in the meantime, till we find a cure, I guess, all females crewmen have to act more dominant than normal, and male crew men act more submissive than normal\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she left, her orders created confusion over the ship, but there was nothing she could do about it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At this exact time, in Cargo bay one, seven was getting ready for her regeneration, she too felt worried about these events, as a drone, she had always just followed orders, now she had experienced freedom, and dominance, she felt that she would be unable to cope if she was removed from it, even before she had been assimilated she had never experienced dominance, as she had been a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course at this very time, the crewman, who was the most afraid was going to bed, B'Elanna shivered, she had always been a very dominant person, something to do with the Klingon blood in her veins, as such the idea of losing all here dominance, terrified, the way she had felt, made here more scared than almost anything, she turned over and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly none of them received peace in their sleep:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway mopped the sweat from her brow, she had been working in the kitchen for hours now, but the work just continued to build, even though before this point she had no idea what half the things were, she had washed, pollished and dusted every inch of the area, but more mess kept appearing, and try as she might she had to clean it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted she collapsed, only to find herself getting back to her feet, and continuing the work, looking forward she saw the door, relising she had a chance she ran for it, but suddenly she was pulled to the ground, looking behind, she saw a great long chain had fastened its self around here leg, the other end attached to the oven,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay there stairing at it, whend suddenly a clanking sound broke out, and she saw, the chain retracting, and she was being pulled towards the oven, frantically she tried to get undone, but the chain just tightened more, as second chain grabbed her other leg, and then a third her arm, then a forth her other arm, a final chain shot around her neck, locking there, giving the appearance of a colar and leashe,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for air she continued to struggle but the chain tightened, and she began to feel light headed, her vision began to blur, the chains were all retracting now, at a much faster rate, looking forward, she saw the oven door open, flames burst up amonst it, she tried to struggle but it was too late, she ws pulled screaming into the firery inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped awakening in her bed, terrified she grabbed her pillow and held on to it, lying there alone in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven opened her eyes, she was standing in a dimmly lit passageway, slowly she started walking along, the sound of whispering voices began, she stopped and so did the voices, looking around she started again, the voices also started, and this time they were louder, slightly worried, seven started to walk faster, the voices continued to get louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicing, she started to run, the voices by this point were shouting, all different voices, all male, all screaming at her, at the same time, Seven continued to run, but with every step, reallity became more confusing, with every step, things seemed to be getting bigger, everything around her was getting bigger, the voices were now bellowing at her, and now she could her footsteps, she was beeing chased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven ran as fast as she could, but the footsteps continued to get louder, and louder, whoever it was gaining on her, she was sweating heavily now, but still with everystep, everything was getting larger, suddenly she came to a halt, before her was a giant hole, she was standing on the edge of a cliff, looking behind her she saw, what could only be described as a cloud of of words and noise, marching towards her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she backed away, the pusuers now directly behind her. Sudenly the ground gave way, and seven fell, down, down, down, down, in the dark inky blackness, the voices continued to follow her, as she fell, and again they got louder and louder, and still she fell down, erier images, casting light shadows on the darkness, caused her to scream, as she fell into the endless darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed on a cold hard substance, getting to her feet she found herself, in a glass jar, frantically she tried to climb out, but them the jar shook violently and she fell down, looking up she screamed again, a giant pair of tweesers came down, and grabbed hold of her catsuit, with a sharp tug, it was removed, and seven stood there butt naked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicing, she tried to cover herself, but more pairs of tweesers came down, and grabbed her, spreading her body out, against the sides, then the let go, she tried to escape, but a horrible felling was over her arms and legs, looking she found, that they had been stuck in place, by what looked like giant cellotape, Seven tried to struggle, but her strength had vanished,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped struggling to catch her breath, and looking up, the most terrifying sight met her, a giant old fashioned cerign with a long needle sticking out of it, was coming at her, she tried to escape, but she was firmly stuck in place, \"Help\" she screamed, a loud booming laugh, filled the area, and a cruel voice, said, \"don't worry my dear, some people have been known to survive this proccedure\" and then the laughter continued to ring out, as the needle, moved closer and closer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped out of her alcove screaming, and hit the cold floor, before passing out of shock, to again be locked in the same nightmare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

find a cure, or atleast a way to slow it down, till they found a perminant soloution, but there didn't appear to be one, never the less, they continued to try, B'Elanna was now quite worried, and she wasn't the only female to be, the whispers and worries filled the air as she walked to Engineering,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped outside, and took a deep breath, focusing on her most angry memories and dominant thoughts, before walking into work, praying it would go well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later she left, almost in tears, the day had been much of a catastrophe, she had trouble giving the most basic orders the crewmembers, she had to do a lot herself, and if it wasn't for the help of her second, she was sure she would have been unable to actually lead them, at this moment she was unsure if she could lead a child, let alone a enire staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning she decided she needed, a shower, she just had to focus on the possitives, it wouldn't be long now till Tom and the doctor, discovered a cure and then she would be back to her usual self, untill then, she could fake most of it, yeah this was going to be fine, she thought to herself, she continued to think this as she walked along, she was about to walk into her quaters, when a voice called \"B'Elanna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and, Marin Jaaris standing there, B'Elanna sighed, Martin Jaaris was the last of his race, a sexist, something that was extinct on much of the civilised universe, although he would never admit it, she new felt strongly about answering to a woman, as B'Elanna was his superior, as well as the whole ship answering to a woman, if it was up to him, woman would never leave the homes, not even when they were dyng.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" B'Elanna snapped, \"I have a problem, that I would like some help with in my quaters\" he said, \"I'm sorry\" B'Elanna replied, \"but I'm busy I'll send someone to help you later\" she turned to go, but he grabed her shoulder, \"but I need help now,\" he said firmly, B'Elanna was feeling a bit scared now, but she held her ground, \"let go of me\" she said, \"I'll send some help later, now let go of ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"shut up\" he shouted, B'Elanna was silenced, \"now come\" he said, now very scared, B'Elanna followed him into his quaters, he turned to face her, a cruel look appearing in his eye, \"w wheres the problem?\" B'Elanna said, feeling more scared now, \"I'm looking at it\" he replied, \"the problem is, that a mad socety gave underlings, wrongly achived positions of power, and I have one such weakling, who dares break the natural law of things, and act dominant,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB'Elanna tried to say something, but Martin inturupted her, \"silence\" he ordered, and again B'Elanna was forced to obey, \"Strip\" he said, B'Elanna paused shocked at this new order, \"I said, strip\" he shouted, B'Elanna began to pull off her clothes, moving as quick as she could, till she was completely naked standing infront of him,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled coldly, the loss of her clothes, broke the last barrier of B'Elanna's strength, she stood there terrified, to terrified to speak, to terrified to move, to terrified in deed to breath loudly, \"The Ferengi have the right idea\" Martin went on, \"don't allow them clothes, clothes are a sign of dominance, able to hide ones body, that is to much power, for a inferior being like you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe sneered at her before continuing, \"your kind's only purpose is reprouduction and pleaser, and that should be all your allowed, but no some idiots gave you ill deserved rights, and now the angry lord seeks to restore things to the way they should be, that is why he sent the anomaly, to put you lot back in your place\" he paused slowly as he walked around B'Elanna, \"and now you are in your rightful place\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course,\" he continued \"there is still the fact you difeied thee laws of nature, and for that you must be punished,\" he sat down on a chair, and gestured, B'Elanna hesitated, \"Lay down\" he ordered, submisively B'Elanna laid down across his lap, \"I think fifty a day should pay for your sins\" he said, and with that he began spanking B'Elanna's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB'Elanna screamed, she hadn't expected it to hurt so much, her mother had given her a strict traditional Klingon upbringing, punishments galor, she had been hit, thrown, beaten and even left to hang upside down for two days while she was repately paddled, but now of that had hurt as much as this did, it shouldn't hurt this much, like a Klingon, B'Elanna's skin was harder, and more dense than human skin, as such her skin was much like leather, it shouldn't hurt like this, but it did, after ten she was sobbing, after Twenty she was crying, after Thirty, she was balling her eyes out, after fourty she was shaking and squirming like a freashly caught fishe on a line, and on fifty she was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay therey crying, \"get up\" he said, \"now kneel\" he ordered, B'Elanna did so \"now the punishment is over, lets have some pleasure\" he said, looking at the bulge in his crotch B'Elanna new what he had in mind...</span></div></div>",

The anomally has made her less durable?\" Janeway asked, \"not just durable, she has lost a lot of her strength, you know how she used to be able to lift me?

I feel only a little different, and most female crewmembers feel the same.\" Janeway asked, \"well its partailly down to her anotomy\" the doctor began \"as she is half and half, half human and half Klingon, respectively, there are parts of her brain, where the two halfs are battling each other for dominance, this means that they are weaker than most pure blood, women, no offense intended, as such she was easier to manipulate, that combined with her being exploited and manipulated to a great scale, for a short time, has led to her present metal state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway nodded, and turned to go, but the doctor hadn't finished, \"warn you captain, B'Elanna may be sped up, but it won't be long, before you and the other females on board this ship, reach her stage, and I have still not found anything remotly useful to are predicament, but I can promis you I will continue trying till my data banks fry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain left, and Tom relising how serious this was, went back to work, after taking B'Elanna and calming her to a sate, that she could be left alone, although he had to promis he would check up on her every hour, for her to get to this state, back in sick bay the two worked in through the night, but almost every test was a failer, and every success was minor and mostly unhelpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about four in the morning when Tom, having just finished a failed test, spotted something, \"doctor\" look at this, The doctor walked over \"what have you found something useful?\" \"maybe\" Tom said, \"I just had an idea, if we use the image and scans of B'Elanna advanced process, and create a program so it compares it with images and scans of other female crewmen, and then include all the data we have on the rate and the stages, like so\" He typed and transfered a dozen files, \"and then we get this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor looked at it, \"that abbility to tell which crewman is going to fall next, and how long till others fall, good idea Tom\" the doctor said, \"its also something else, a deadline till all of them fall\" Tom said, \"and according to this proceess the next crewman to fall is...\" he typed in a few things, and then waited for the computer to cross referance, and repeat the test a few hundered times, to check accuracy and reliability, before a file came up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\" tom said, looking at it, \"who is it?\" the doctor asked, walking over, \"Its... </span></div></div>",

something to say, but he was speachless, after all the fact that he and Seven were alone together in his quaters, was enough to take out his voice, however this silence, made Seven still feel alone, \"you don't have to sit so far away,\" she said, \"I won't you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, hesitated, before getting up and sitting at the oppersite end of the couch, to Seven, he looked over at Seven, Seven smiled back, \"I still won't hurt you\" \"I'm okay,\" Harry said, Seven still felt unsafe \"Come on\" she said, and with that she grabed harry's shoulder, and pulled him along the Couch so he was sitting right next to her, so close the two were touching,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a old misture of worry and Lust, Harry tried to stand up, but he couldn't pull himself away, Seven felt better with him closer, but she still didn't feel right, she needed something more, she nusled up to Harry, Harry was feeling hot, listening to instinct, he placed his arm around Seven, this made Seven feel better, by this point however, she wasn't feeling right what so ever,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry took his other arm, and placed that around Seven aswell, and huged her, Seven smiled, she felt better, she felt more secure and safe, she felt like she could spend eternity in his arms, coming out, Harry leaned in, Seven was unsure if this is were she wanted to go, but by now her dominance was dead, so she followed suit, however at the last minute, he recovered his volition and pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Seven\" he said, \"But I think you should go,\" Seven felt a wave of shock go over her, and a feel off something being pulled, \"I would nather not\" she slightly worried, \"I really think you should\" Harry replied, Slightly worried, \"No I want to stay, I just want some company\" she said, a bit more worried, \"well I'm sorry, but its four in the morning, and I think we can talk later, good night seven\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please don't make me go Seven\" said, \"I'll do anything\" \"Now Seven...\" Harry said, but before Harry could say another worried, Seven dropped her Catsuit revealing her naked body to Harry, Harry stared at her, and continued to stare for several minutes, before he regained control over himself, \"please don't make me go\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, you can stay, just give me a minute, wait in there, and put your clothes back on\" Harry said, Seven complied, Harry stopped to take several deep breaths before, touching his combadge, \"Um Doctor\" Harry said, \"I think Seven's fallen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time that this flash back occured, the doctor and Tom ahd got Seven to sickbay, they had called the captain and were doing several tests, \"report\" Janeway said walking in, \"Seven's fallen as well\" The doctor replied, \"Mr Paris, came up with the idea, of creating a program to track how long, we would have till crewmembers succumed, and seven was next, shortly after wards, Mr Kim called in, telling us he felt she was wrong, and well, I think its best if you see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor pointed, and it showed Seven in Harry's arms, looking terrified, as Harry comfated her, \"she's exactly the same as B'Elanna, terrified to be alone, and completely submissive\" \"she also has the same physical changes as B'Elanna\" Tom said, \"but as many of Seven physical attributes are enhanced, by her borg enchancments, meaning she is resoanbly unchanged physically, only mentally is weak,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As such we have the next victim of this anomaly\" Janeway stared at Seven, it made her scared, that a strong woman like her, was reduced to this statis, and it reminded her on her impending fate, she turned tot the doctor and said...</span></div></div>",

That was it? She had a matter of days, till she ended up like B'Elanna and Seven, she took a deep breath, she was still captain of the ship, and the crew would panic if she showed how scared she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep working on the cure, I'm making this a priority one emergency, use what ever means you need, and that includes if you need to experiment on the crewmembers, do anything you need to do, just find a cure, or atleast something to delay the effects, now get back to it,\" The two watched her leave, before turning to stare at her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what's wrong with her?\" The doctor asked, \"She's scared,\" Tom replied, \"how would you feel, if all your dominance, and alot of your freewill was just swiched off?\" the doctor nodded agreeing that would be alwful, the two of them returned to the work, although it was now harder as they didn't have seven to help them, they did manage to get some more help, by the fact that the captain had given them the power to releavie any crewman of duty to help them, but they weren't much help as the most they could do was read, read outs or hold test products, it was a slow process,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom barley left the sickbay, he ran himself into the ground, during that week, trying to find a cure, he would often work till he was too tired to continue, then would only allow himself a few hours sleep before getting back to work, and working as if he was fully rested, twice the doctor had to sedate him, to get him to get enough sleep,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor inturn burned out two holoprojecters and three memory banks trying to find a cure, he and Tom tried every possible idea that they could think of, in the end they had to resort to the last idea, do experiments on live crewmen, the doctor's hipocratal circutes stopped him being able to, so Tom was forced to, they only used volunteers, and the chances of it being dangerous were slim, but that didn't make either of them feel any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll over ship more and more problems were forming, as more and more crewmen fell to the effects, it became clear taht they couldn't work, so almost half the crew where inable to work, they tried having them do enlisted personal work, but even this created problems, as the great decreases in the physical abbilities created great problems, and plus many of them soon became to scared, to focus and generally they created more problems than answered. The only work that they were able to do, was help Neelix with the meals, and other domestic jobs, but this intern created problems, as it made the crewmembers who had succumed sad, as they knew full well what they had been reduced to, and for the ones who hadn't, it also surverly reduced there moral, as it became apparant to them all, this is where they were all heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large potion of the females had fallen by this point, to cope with there fear, and loneiness, many of them had found a male partner to look after them, the fact that they now needed one, was also quite damaging to there moral, it also created great problems for the male crewmen as they now found they had to look after, to an extent a fully grown female, who was costantly in need of them, if for nothing more than surport and comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship was barely flying it was surveally under crewed, the moral on board was close to breaking point, the ships hiracy was deterioting, and supplies weren't unlimited, Janeway sat in her quaters, terrified of what would happene when she herself fell, there was one thing that she feared more than her loss of dominance though, no that wasn't true, there was one thing she feared as much as her loss of dominance, and that was what would happen on the ship, with her gone, she was barley holding the ship together as it was,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was going wrong, the remaning crewmen were constanly working, few got enough sleep, they often worked late into the next day, before being allowed to rest, moral was near a all time low, and even Neelix was feeling it, drop, there was a serious chance that if she feel, and the last nail in the wall was removed, the wall would collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey crew may rebel or even turn on each other, the ship could be wripped appart, and what made her most sad, and scared was the fact that, if this all happened, she would be able to do nothing but watch in the background and cry, helpless as a child, no longer able to look after, or take care of herself, she could feel the effects of this anomally at work as she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer will was weakening, her strength was depleating, and all these events were making the inidvertible just come quicker, she new if she fell, she had to make sure that the ship would continue to work, as such she had made preperations, the moment she fell, Chekota would take over as captain, Tuvok as first officer, and Tom paris as second, Harry would most likely be premoted to third officer, there jobs were being adjusted, so that there positions could be filled as soon as she was gone, she had to make sure the ship was ready before she submitted, other wise it would collapse into anarcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut fighting the Changes was a losing battle, she was eternally exhaused and more than once she longed to be able to give up, and just let it take her over, to remove the stress, but her need to be ready drove her on, but it might already be to late, it had been two weeks since Tom had told her how long she had, and she felt her mind and personallity had changed greatly since then, it was possible she had succumed, she just sat there to scared to test the possibility just in case it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Janeway sat there she felt a new form of fear over come her, loneliness, she normally enjoyed time on her own, not that she didn't like company, but for the first time in a long time, she felt lonely, really lonely, like she was alone, completely alone, \"Its an affect of the anomally,\" she said to herself, \"fight it\" but even as she said it, she felt more scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear was now wrapped around her body like a cloak, terrified she sat there, letting her combined fears grow, to scared to get up, but too scared to stay there, she was faceing a unique form of the unstopable force, imovable object paradox, terrified she just sat there, to scared to move, to say anything even to breath to loudly, her atempts to fight, were useless, she had exhausted her mental strength, there was nothing she could do but sit there in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChekotay had got suspicious when the captain hadn't turned up for work half an hour ago, and worried he walked to her quaters, he pushed the button, \"hello? Captain? Is something wrong?\" no answer greated him, \"computer open door, authorisation, Chekotay 473alpha\" the door opened, and he walked in, the room was pitch black, there was no light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing the the worst he walked along, towards the captains bed, looking for her, it was then he heard it, a sobbing, a sort of silent crying, the type children have when they just can't stop crying, more worried he walked through the darkness, round the bed, as he moved the sound became louder, till he could see the source, Janeway sat there by her bed, crying her eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain?\" he said, she turned round, unaware of his prensence, a terrified look on her face, \"Chekotay,\" she said relived before jumping up and hugging him, relising what had happened, Chekotay, placed his arms round the captain, it was slightly uncomfatable, but at the same time, if this had been any other set of circumstances he wouldn't have complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stood there in silence for a while, Chekotay, just keeping hold of her, Janeway smiling as for the first time in a while, she felt safe, and secure, she felt warm, and calm, she felt like she never wanted to leave his arms, and all the while this made here realise what she feared, she had succumed, and the thought of what might happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started crying again, \"whats wrong?\" Chekotay asked, weakening his grip, Janeway pulled out, and said, \"I've succumed, I've fallen,\" \"there there\" Chekotay said, \"It will be okay,\" \"But the ship, the crew?\" Janeway said, Chekotay pulled her in tight, and hugged her, \"it will be okay,\" he said, trying to sound certain, he however was highly doubtful, without the captain, there was a strong chance of a mutiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway fellt more secure now, but not enough, realising this Chekotay, lifted her up, this made her feel better, Chekotay had to tell the ship of this, but he relised it would be best if it was at the right moment, before anything could go wrong, \"Computer, emergency transport, my quaters\" Chekotay and Janeway vanished, and reappeared in Chekotay's quaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he had to tell the rest of the comand crew, but he couldn't leave Janeway, he realised he would have to wait till she fell asleep, or atleast was in a fit state to be left alone, \"Okay Janeway\" he said, \"it looks like we are going to be spending some time together for the next hours,\" Janeway smiled, \"In that case\" she said, \"if your willing, I have a few ideas,\" and with that she started to undo her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChekotay left his quaters, Janeway was fast asleep, he would normally be happy, but the serious problems were on board the ship, he tapped his combadge, \"Mr Paris, Mr Tuvok Mr Kim, meet me in the briefing room in five minutes,\" he said, and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later they were all in the briefing room, \"well are worst fear has happened, the captains fallen\" Chekotay said, several great sighs came from the room, in shook, \"as such it looks like I'm now captain, and we've each moved up in the hieracy\" he continued, \"but now the four of us are incharge of the ship, we are faced with a great problem, we are still lost with no alies, millions of miles from home, half are crew is now unable to work, moral is at an all time low and we are faced with another serious problem, there are several bigots on board, who after staying hidden for this journey up to now, are starting to make themself well known, its clear if we don't tread very carefully there could be a mutiny,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuvok,\" he said, \"How much can we trust your security forces?\" \"logically, I can say, that atleast half of them are compelty worthy of my trust, while I'm between fourty and eighty percent sure of the other half, based upon there standing,\" \"good\" Chekotay said, \"mr paris, how are we doing finding a cure?\" \"not so good\" Tom replied, \"Me and the doctor have tried everything we could think off, we've probed every aspect of his data bank, we've checked every treatment, and cure for every event, in history, that even has one percent in coman with this event, but so far nothing, we did have moderate success with teraphermonite, but I would not recoment trying more tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what do you mean, moderat success?\" Chekotay asked interested, \"well were able to return  a female crewman's dominant personallity for five minutes, after injecting her with 50cc's of Teraphemite, no side effects, once it wore off she went back to her weakened state\" \"Well whats the problem then?\" Chekotay asked surprised,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't a cure, just a prention, it can't be continously used\" Tom said, \"so it will make a tempory answer till you find a real cure\" Chekotay said, \"start admissnistering it to the crew imedinetly and then...\" Tom cut him off, \"no, you don't understand sir\" he said, \"it can't be continously used,\" \"why whats the problem?\" Chekotay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"if the teraphermonite consentration in blood increases to more than five percent, the person will die in a mater of minutes, that means the most we can give them is 300cc, that means there have the personallties for ten minutes, before it wears off, and then it can't be used for six days, thats the time it takes, before the levels return to normal, we worked on it for three days, there is no way round this, its a biological chemical law, and we calculated it would most likely do more damage than good, as it would further depleat the moral of the female crew, if they felt domininace once again, only to have it ripped away again, to them it would most likely be seen, as torture.\" Tom finished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so basically, we're no where, with no hope, no chance, and a crew likely to mutiny the moment they find out the captain has fallen,\" Harry said, an idea however had occured to Chekotay, \"maybe not,\" he said, \"Mr Paris prepare 300cc's of Teraphermonite, and bring it to docking bay 1, Mr Kim, get all no esential personal there as well, Mr tuvok, your with me. Dismissed,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhalf an hour later, a large portion of the crew turned up in docking bay one, rumours had been circulating that captain Janeway had fallen, and most of them expected this to be a meeting to tell them she had, however they wer soon shocked and surprised, when captain Janeway walked in, with Chekotay and Paris, once there she gave a quick speach about how, they had contacted a race, with superior medical technology, and she was going to talk to them to see if they could come up with a cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter which she explained that until she returned, Chekotay, was in comand, and with that departed, the crew left the docking bay, rumours now ruined, and moral slightly higher. Later Chekotay, Paris and Harry met in the briefing room, Tuvok was in comand of the bridge, \"I must say that was a brilliant idea of yours sir,\" Tom said, \"giving captain Janeway the Teraphermonite, so she could explain her appsense and then leave, on a flase mission, so no one would question where she was, and give the crew more hope\" Chekotay nodded, \"and untill a cure is found, no one is to breath a word of this to any one, Mr Paris get back to the sickbay, and help the doctor, Mr Kim go back to the bridge, I'll join you shortly I just need to check on the captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChekotay walked back to his quaters, he found Janeway still asleep, her dominance had worn of again, and she had been silently beamed back aboard while the crew was distracted, he had mr Denson who was hiding in the shuttlepod fly it off, with orders to try and find help, and meet them at set quardinants in a month, he smiled looking at janeway, she lay there smiling, probably dreaming of when she comanded the ship, he sighed he had to keep her prensece secret, this would be hard to keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes the news get out?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Diplomats Omahri and Sgurrin,\" Captain Janeway said standing. Her eyes narrowing, she watched both Gaelians move into the ready room. They were an extremely tall species, seemingly female or androgynous, possessing shapely, feminine curves. Almost space amazons, Janeway mused to herself. Undoubtedly, most of the male crew couldn't keep their eyes off them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelcoming them into the room. \"Please sit down,\" she said, indicating to the seats either side of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain,\" Diplomat Sgurrin responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the Gaelian's voice was melodious, almost song-like. It in some ways reminded Janeway of the tales of the Sirens from mythology, with how stunning their appearance and voices were. But after the first hour of negotiation, Janeway found herself nursing a headache, she took some medicine and thought nothing more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway found the Gaelians' uniforms to be stunning, white, high-collared garments with a plunging necklines, showcasing their very generous breast size, and skin-tight trousers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Captain, \"Diplomat Omahri replied taking a seat to Janeway's right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting, Janeway's eyes were drawn to the Gaelians's uniforms. The material was unlike anything she had seen, it glowed white then slowly changed to a prism of subtle colors. Once it was explained that Gaelians used this method to encourage calm during negotiations, and when scanners showed no subliminal intent, she happily let trade negotiations begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Diplomats were seated, Janeway asked, \"Can I get you anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Gaelians quickly shook their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you, Captain,\" Diplomat Omahri replied politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway's mouth quirked, she knew they would decline. On the first day of negotiations she had taken the Gaelians, as part of their tour, to the Mess Hall, where Neelix offered some freshly made Ktarian pudding. Diplomat Omahri, obviously not wanting to offend, sampled Neelix's food. Needless to say, the resulting grimace meant that neither Gaelian had accepted any offers of refreshments since, preferring to consume their own supplies which appeared delicate and quite sumptuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing the captain, Diplomat Omahri queried, \"How is your crew enjoying shore leave?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been more than generous and we are very grateful,\" the Captain replied sitting down. Particularly you, Diplomat Omahri. She eyed the Gaelians aware that she still had no idea of what sex either individual was. On the face of it, they appeared an androgynous species. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Diplomat Omahri's voice didn't grate as much as the other ones. The Diplomat's sharp intellect, wit and adept negotiating skills had surprised Janeway. The Gaelian's had warm and flirtatious personalities, which she had warmed to, and, to her surprise, she found that there was something very alluring about the tall, attractive Gaelian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain glanced at Diplomat Omahri's uniform, it was slowly changing color. At first she had found the change distracting, but now, it was somehow comforting? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your planet is very beautiful, and my crew is very appreciative,\" Janeway said. Tearing her eyes away, she inclined her head graciously, \"Thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, it is unfortunate that our protocols do not allow a more relaxed contact with our society,\" Diplomat Omahri said, frowning slightly. \"But we do hope that it has not detracted from your stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, after several recent confrontations in this region of space, any shore leave is a welcoming hiatus for my crew,\" Janeway replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you are designated to an island and requested to remain within a strict perimeter?\" Diplomat Omahri asked, with a note of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarmth filling her eyes, Janeway responded, \"Even then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain,\" Diplomat Sgurrin beseeched, \"Today, we are very interested in visiting Voyager's sickbay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Janeway replied, ignoring the feel of neck hair rising and the immediate chill that ran down her spine, \"because, today, I am very interested in a resonator coil to upgrade Voyager's communications systems.\" She paused when Diplomat Sgurrin's long, fingernails drummed on the table. \"Sickbay is our next stop,\" she added, looking at both Gaelians, \"but let me first thank you for the early deposits of dilithium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drumming stopped. \"As you know there are substantial deposits beneath each of our three moons,\" Diplomat Sgurrin replied, eyeing Janeway. \"There are ample deposits residing on each of the upper mantles, and they are easily accessible.\" The Gaelian smiled.<br>\r\nJaneway, not for the first time, felt her stomach turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Captain, as you know,\" the Diplomat added, eyes bugging even more, \"everything has a price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoken like a Ferengi, she thought. There was a sly, insidiousness about Diplomat Sgurrin that meant it wasn't only the voice that put Janeway's teeth on knife-edge. Fortunately, years of diplomatic training allowed her to harness as well as mask her feelings and use them to sharpen her negotiation skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" the Captain replied smoothly, ensuring that her tone hid the bristling aggravation that was growing with Diplomat Sgurrin's poor and often clumsy attempts at negotiating. \"And, as you know,\" she added smoothly, \"your generosity has been rewarded with schematics of our transporter technology.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Voyager first traversed through the Delta Quadrant, it became clear that much of Voyager's technology was unknown to many species. The Kazon, in particular, tried to gain access to their replicator technology. It became apparent, that in the wrong hands Starfleet technology could have disastrous consequences. For this reason, Janeway had refused to give technology away irresponsibly. But as the Gaelians were technologically advanced and a responsible species, and their existing transporter technology just needed refining, she had made it available as part of the trade negotiations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Captain, for the schematics,\" Diplomat Omahri said gently. \"They have been very well received.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" Janeway replied standing. \"Now, I suggest we make our way to sickbay. I'm sure that there is some equipment there that you will both find interesting.\" She smiled. \"As well as our Chief Medical Officer being in attendance, I have also requested that another crewmember make herself available.\" Leading the Gaelians out of the ready room and into the turbolift, she added, \"Seven has recently enhanced some of our medical scanning equipment. She will be able to answer any questions you might have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, welcome,\" the Doctor said to the Gaelians when they entered sickbay. \"I am Voyager's Chief Medical Officer, and this,\" he said exuberantly, flinging his arms out wide, \"is sickbay, the main medical center aboard Federation starships.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, arms crossed, the Captain looked at the chronometer, and clenched her jaw. As yet, the Doctor hadn't shown any medical technologies that would stimulate trade negotiations. Instead, he seemed to be wowing a captivated audience with triumphant medical tales of his discoveries of the many unknown illnesses and diseases in the Delta Quadrant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that it might be a very long day, Janeway raised her brow wearily to the tall, slender form standing close to her. \"Is it just me, Seven,\" she murmured, \"or is the Doctor's ego getting out of control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde regarded her for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway glanced at the cybernetic implants adorning Seven's left eye and cheekbone as she leaned in to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to B'Elanna Torres,\" Seven said, her tone low and intimate, \"if the Doctor was not a hologram she would perform a cranial adjustment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued, Janeway returned Seven's gaze. \"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven raised her ocular implant. \"It would seem that, if allowed, she would remove his head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes lighting and sparkling with humor, Janeway quirked an eyebrow at Seven. \"Is that so?\" she murmured, and with a lazy smile continued to gaze at her. Recently Seven had sought to spend much of her recreation time with her. To the redhead's delight, she was finding Seven's evolving humor refreshing. \"How about joining me for dinner in my quarters tonight?\" she asked. Surprised by her impulsiveness, she paused. Very rarely did she invite anyone other than her first officer to dine with her, and that was only to ensure uninterrupted time to discuss ship's business \"I'm not the best cook,\" she continued, color rising in her cheeks at Seven's intense gaze, \"but I can rustle up a mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Janeway felt overcome by an uneasiness, her vision blurred slightly. \"On second thought, that dinner date will have to be postponed. I forgot there was something that came up that requires my attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood Captain,\" Seven sounded off and returned to her usual station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway exited the room, her arm propping herself up on the wall. She clenched her eyes and shook her head, her vision returned to normal. At this point the Captain considered getting back to work to wait and see, or perhaps the Doctor can have a look at her after dealing with their guests.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Computer,\" Janeway said. Unable to hide her irritation, her deep voice resonated loudly around the room, \"Janeway-1-1-5-3-Red, clearance level 10.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Access denied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearily, the redhead stared at her console in her Ready Room. As her voiceprint and bio-signs were now no longer identifiable, the computer had locked her out of all critical and secure systems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway punched in manual commands, but the computer continued to challenge her identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the computer could no longer rely on unique identifiers such as bio-signs or voiceprint to identify her, and, in order to ensure the ship did not easily fall into hands that would allow sabotage or security breaches, for several minutes, by isolating highly secure redundant access codes for areas such as the auto destruct sequence, the transferring of commands, and ejecting a warp core, it carried out rigorous tests to ensure she was who she said she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMethodically, the redhead fed in some real and redundant commands in a sequence that would uniquely identify her. Fortunately, it was a Captain's duty to have these commands ingrained in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, the computer, after keying in several final string commands, accepted that she was the real Captain Kathryn Janeway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway exhaled deeply then tried a voice command again. \"Janeway, authorization Alpha-Alpha-3-0-5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Kathryn Janeway,\" the female voice responded, \"you are authorized to resume full command.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead closed her eyes. \"Computer, begin log.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acknowledged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain's log, stardate 53049.2,\" Janeway dictated. \"We've spent the last five days, situated in Gaelian space, in sector 379 of the Delta Quadrant.\" Eyes gritty, she looked at her access console. \"As well as negotiating for dilithium, the crew seems to be making the most of our stay. God knows they deserve it.\" She sighed. \"On first contact, the Gaelians made it known that they have rigid protocols regarding contact with other species. So much so, that for trade negotiations, they limited all contact to a team of two negotiating representatives from their Council of Diplomatic Trade.\" Suddenly feeling hot, she opened her uniform tunic then roughly pulled at the neck of her grey turtleneck. \"Computer, pause log.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acknowledged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway groaned. Already the recently replicated uniform was feeling tight. She threw up her arms in annoyance. \"Don't tell me I need a bigger size already.\" She growled. The sound was deep. \"This time it'll have to wait. Computer, lower the ambient temperature by three degrees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ambient temperature lowered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately she felt the coolness pump through the environmental filters into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, resume log.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acknowledged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a technologically advanced species,\" she continued, rolling her large shoulders a few times to relieve the growing tension, \"the Gaelians are curious to discover the technologies aboard Voyager, which thankfully has allowed plenty of scope for negotiation.\" She lifted her cup of coffee. \"They have been identified as a non-hostile species,\" she said, quirking a battle weary eyebrow. Pausing, she inhaled deeply the pungent aroma wafting from her cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shocked by recent events, Janeway's eyes narrowed. \"So far, in the Delta Quadrant, Voyager has made more than two hundred first contacts, and once I was satisfied that the species was indeed non-hostile, I allowed full diplomatic access while aboard Voyager.\" She took a mouthful of coffee then grimaced, the bitterness was overwhelming. Much to her dismay, the physical change she was going through right now included her tastes buds. Frowning, she returned the cup to its saucer. \"I had thought that during my long tenure I'd learned enough to trust my instincts.\" She raised her brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching sight of her hands, Janeway faltered. Her stomach turned at the sight of them. They were twice their original size, and dwarfed the delicate, china cup. Swallowing hard to combat the sudden nausea, she slipped her hands underneath her. Her slate-grey eyes troubled, she leaned back heavily in her chair, and stared out of the window. Her tone filled with regret, she added, \"But I was wrong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway's eyes shifted focus from looking out at the glowing stars, she noticed her reflection in the glass. It was a foggy reflection, but what she could make out was clear as day; she had grown. Relative to the chair, her back and head were stretched far higher than normal. Something was happening insider her, forcing her body to grow, into what, she wasn't sure. Was she going through an induced second puberty perhaps? Or maybe becoming something less human, that would explain why the computer didn't recognize her, she speculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her hands from underneath her, Janeway placed her elbows on the desk and wearily put her head in her hands. Closing her eyes she groaned and, for just a few moments, tried to block out the absolutely astounding physical changes she was going through. Lifting her head, she stood slowly. Her tall frame looming over her desk, she carefully straightened her increasingly tight Starfleet uniform, especially tighter now around her bosom. Mustering every piece of resolve she had, she squared her shoulders and exited the room.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, although successful in a similar incident, in this case, there has been no response to the treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening, tiredness seeping from her every bone, Janeway fought hard the urge to rest her head in her hands, and close her eyes for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Captain,\" the Doctor said, looking around the table, \"is quite literally a different person. The physiological changes that have taken place over the last few hours are astounding.\" He stood and approached the viewscreen nestled in the walls. He punched in a few commands and several images appeared showing Janeway's transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, the Captain is taller, well over six feet now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six feet five point two inches,\" Seven interjected with a note of authority. Her angular features refined, she sat, straight-backed, in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor blinked. \"Yes, thank you, Seven,\" he replied with a note of surprise. He eyed the Borg for a moment then continued. \"She is leaner.\" He touched the viewscreen, and flicked through several images. Janeway felt felt up her hips and waistline, examining they were indeed thinner than her measurements were before this affliction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the images, Janeway shuddered. She still found it difficult to absorb what was happening to her. She always wanted to be taller, but six five? That's simply obscene for a woman. Other than the visiting Gaelians, there were hardly any crewmembers on board who could match her in height. She even towered over the formerly taller Seven of Nine, for Christ's sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can also see,\" the Doctor continued, \"her chest circumference has increased dramatically. Her breasts,\" he said moving a hand to the area in question on the viewscreen, \"have quadrupled in size.\" Looking at Janeway, he lifted his chin. Janeway looked down at her large breasts, inwardly embarrassed, but her face betrayed no expression, only instinctively crossing her arms to cover her bosom from any onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is almost as if, what ever is affecting the Captain, is triggering a second puberty in her body,\" Tuvok observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor paused for effect. \"With Seven's help,\" he eventually continued, \"and some of your most esteemed medical advisers,\" he looked at Elder Duhra, \"we have tried to treat this condition with medical compounds, but have had no success.\" The Doctor's brow furrowed. \"Further analysis of the Captain's DNA shows that the rate of the genetic mutation has accelerated. We are still exploring alternate treatments but at this time, it doesn't look good. Furthermore we are not sure to what extent the mutation will continue for. It is completely up to speculation where the Captain will end up when the mutation has finally run its course.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving heard enough, Janeway interrupted the EMH. \"Thank you for the update, Doctor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muscle jumped in the Doctor's jaw as he eyed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another newly acquired human affectation, the redhead noted wearily. Many of which the Doctor was adopting as part of his ever evolving sentience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, Captain,\" the Doctor replied taking his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Janeway eyed Tuvok, and Seven of Nine, who she had last seen hovering over her in sickbay. They were the only two members of Voyager's senior officers along with the doctor and Chakotay, who were fully briefed on the situation. Fortunately, due to shore leave and the sensitivity of the problem, not all the senior officers were privy to what was happening to her and for now, until the situation was resolved, she wanted to keep it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAware that Diplomat Omahri had been watching her intently, since entering the Briefing Room, Janeway made eye contact. She was stunned when she found out that the Gaelians were an all female species. It appeared, by human standards, that the entire race was exceptionally beautiful; they carried a full head of long, black lush hair, fine eyebrows and long dark eyelashes. Their eyes were seductively large and their face symmetrically perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued, Janeway watched blood fill Diplomat Omahri's ears and the tip of her nose. They were clear signs of arousal. Signs, she knew, as heat suddenly filled her body, and her heart began to thud, that she wouldn't have detected a few days ago, or be responding to now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes locked, Janeway observed that the Diplomat was fine-boned with a regal forehead, startling green colored eyes that held hers intently, and the most incredibly desirable blood, red plump lips. The younger woman was without doubt, the most dark, lithe and exotic being she had ever encountered. Christ! What am I thinking? Janeway thought to herself. This alien infected her with something and she can only make googly eyes at her like a dumb schoolgirl. It had to be shifting hormones within her, Janeway determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer respiration increasing, Janeway abruptly broke eye contact. Taking a deep breath, she unconsciously glanced at Seven, and was surprised to see the ex-Borg's eyes narrowing as she stared back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of disapproval set on Seven's features as she locked eyes with Janeway. Slowly, her cool gaze turned from the redhead. \"Diplomat Omahri,\" she said, almost challengingly as she stared at the Gaelian, \"why did you choose Captain Janeway for your energy beam?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriking, almost feline green eyes focused on Seven. \"It wasn't my intention,\" the Gaelian responded gently, her voice mellifluous. \"This is unprecedented.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElder Duhra looked at Janeway and raised an elegant hand as well as her fine, dark eyebrows. \"Protocol dictates that when we encounter a new species we are required to suppress our Gaelian physiology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaneway eyed the three Gaelians. It was clear that as well as being extraordinarily beautiful as a species, they were taller and slimmer than the average human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, I must inform you,\" Tuvok said, \"that our visitors are currently wearing pheromone inhibitors, located behind their right ears.\" He looked at Janeway. \"From what I understand, Gaelians are closely related to the human form. The primary differences are neurochemical, which includes a complex pheromone system. This, as we have witnessed, can create a problem when making contact with other humanoids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our species has a highly developed sexuality,\" Elder Duhr continued, \"where pheromones play an important role. As sexual expression is inherent in most aspects of our culture, Gaelian pheromones can cause a potent and powerful sexual stimulation in almost all humanoid physiology.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSexual response! A disquieting feeling of dread filled Janeway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain,\" Tuvok said, \"it appears that is why the Gaelians have chosen to isolate themselves from regular first contact with alien species.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElder Duhr smiled encouragingly at Tuvok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuvok looked at the woman, his dark face framed by elegant pointed ears showed no emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct,\" Elder Duhra responded. \"For generations, it is our custom to avoid close contact with outsiders. But your story of crossing the galaxy intrigued us and we wanted to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voyager and her crew are exceptionally resourceful,\" Seven said to Elder Duhra in a precise tone. \"The warp core is designed to operate for up to three years before refueling. The reaction chamber is equipped with a compositor which allows the re-crystallizion of dilithium. Nevertheless, assistance, where it can be found is welcome.\" She turned her gaze to Diplomat Omahri. Her eyes narrowing, she added with a definite note of reproof. \"However, I believe in this instance, it would have been more advantageous had Voyager continued on its journey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Janeway glared at Seven, the ex-Borg was studying Diplomat Omahri intently. Her diplomatic skills kicking in, she opened her hands expressively. \"Elder Duhra, there is no doubt we are in a difficult situation, but I would hate to let this ruin any possibility of friendship between our people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpenly staring at Seven, Elder Duhra redirected her gaze. She inclined her head at Janeway. \"Captain, I hope you can accept the Council of Authority's sincere apologies for what has occurred. You have my word that we will do whatever we can to assist you during this difficult time.\" She smiled warmly. \"In the meantime, please allow us to provide star charts which will provide a safe route through many sectors as you journey home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised and delighted, that Voyager would be kept safe for a little while, Janeway inclined her head. \"What a wonderful offer, Elder Duhra. It is very much appreciated. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elder raised her hand in way of dismissal. \"It is the least we can do.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But you look about the bridge and see a bikini clad risan woman with an enormous ass, and three pips on her strap for the bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number One.\" You start, you voice still holds a commanding tone, but also a breathy promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, captain.\" she almost whispers submissively.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Picard looked around. There, at Ops, stood a version of Counselor Troi, looking half-Klingon and in form-fitting Klingon armor. He had to admit, She made a sexy Klingon! Obviously that was Warf's fantasy woman, and she was, as everyone, humiliated by this exposure. Picard was furious, \"Stop this right now Q! Leave my crew alone! Return everyone to their own DNA and appropriate uniforms this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQ grinned, \"Of course Picard. As you wish.\" And of course, Q was a master at twisting words and warping wishes. He snapped his fingers and things were normal again. Well, almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicard looked at where Commander Riker and Counselor Troi had been sitting. Now, there sat a gorgeous woman with long dark hair, and ample bosom, and an hour-glass figure, sitting there in a uniform dress with a very short skirt, next to her was a tall, dark handsome man, in a standard Star Fleet uniform. The problem was, the woman was Commander Riker, and the man was Counselor Troi. As Picard looked around, all the crew had flipped genders. Warf was a beautiful, albeit dangerous looking female Klingon, Lt. LaForge was a gorgeous black woman who had stunning eyes, apparently not needing the visor now, Ensign Crusher was now a cute girl with long, flowing hair, and even Data now had a female form. Picard then realized his predicament as he looked down at two breasts hanging from his chest, and like Riker, in a uniform dress, leaving his legs bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was much shorter now, \"Damn it Q! I said change us back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQ waged his fingers, \"Ah! Ah! You said their own DNA. Everyone is back to their own DNA. I just flipped a gene or two. It should make your next mission that much more interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 'her' now melodious voice, Picard stopped her foot and yelled! \"Damn it Q! Change us back to our normal selves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQ said, \"Tsk! Tsk! Such language from such a pretty young thing. Well, enjoy!\" And with that, he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo amount of calling, yelling and cursing could get him back. After she had given up, Picard went to her command chair and pushed some buttons, \"This is the Captain speaking. For some reason, in his twisted sense of humor, ! has decided to reverse things on us for a while. I don't know how long we will be like this, but I am sure that the crew of the Enterprise will continue on and do their duties regardless of this change. I am proud of you all, and we will all weather this new assault on our persons together. Picard out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicard was not happy about her breasts and the feel of a pussy between her legs, but she had to put on a good face. About the only thing good about this was that she at least had a full head of hair, and it appeared that everyone, including herself, seemed to be in their 20's or younger. She wouldn't mind being younger, but would prefer that it would be as a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, as her thoughts drifted, the now-male ensign at the communications station said, \"Captain, priority one message for you from Star Fleet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Picard disappeared into her Read Room, Troi leaned toward a very awkward looking Riker, \"It is okay to be female you know. You don't need to feel embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at Troi, \"Well, it is not normal for me!\" However, looking at that handsome man that was now Troi, Riker couldn't help but find him attractive. It caused a strange feeling in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroi grinned, \"Don't worry. I would be happy to help you explore some new things after our shift if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker turned bright red and hissed quietly, \"I DON'T want that!\" Her body said differently though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of them, Commander Data was now looking down at her new female form also in a uniform dress. (It seemed that Q made sure all the new women were wearing skirts. And short ones at that.) In a voice that sounded very much like Tasha's, she said, \"Interesting. It would appear that my breasts are capable of replicating a liquid protein substance that would essentially mimic the milk from a human female. My program also seems to have been altered to allow for various ways to please males sexually.\" While her face was a female version of her male self, and her hair was still black, she somehow knew that her body was now modeled after that of Tasha, and her hair was in the style that Tasha wore. She looked at Wesley, \"It would seem that your breasts are not as large, but seem to have a firmness that makes them stand out a bit more than mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley blushed, feeling the way they did stick out and not liking it! And just when she had been hoping to get it on with that new ensign, now she was the one with the pussy! The thought of dating the now 'male' ensign, and letting him do 'that' to her, seemed disgusting! Or did it? She was so confused! \"Yes! They stick out Data. Would you please keep your observations to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, LaForge was getting used to more than breasts and a pussy. In fact, having normal vision back was so overwhelming that she was happy to be female if that is what it took! And part of that new vision was that she noticed that Lt. Gorman, at the communications station, kept taking looks at her. What was more, she felt an attraction to him. As a male, she had always been shy. She wasn't sure if she still was or not, but if he asked her for some drinks in Ten Forward after this shift, she felt sure that she would say yes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far from her, a tall, slim Klingon woman was grumbling. Oddly enough, not about being female as much as, \"Grrrr... this attire is completely unsuitable for combat.\" Apparently, a dress was no her thing, \"Why would Star Fleet allow any of its members to wear such an impractical garment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the newly male members of the bridge crew found that they hardly considered the females attire impractical. Where they might have agreed before, they were now enjoying the view from the other side of the fence. Each person there was dealing with new feelings and the flow of different hormones. (Well, except for Data, who was just plain fascinated with her new body.) Some covert flirting was already starting on the bridge until the Captain came walking out of her ready room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her seat and said, \"There is an urgent situation in the Lyris system. Star Fleet has ordered us to do whatever it takes to remedy the problem. Ensign, set a course and engage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Riker asked, more meekly than normal in her deep, and sexy voice, \"What is happening there sir, um, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicard realized that she would have to give thought to how she wanted to be addressed while in this body, but putting that aside for the moment, \"They need assistance because...\"</span></div></div>",

There are hundreds of people trapped beneath the surface. Based on the information that we have been given, we should be able to use transporters to go in, locate survivors, and get them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker said, \"Good. Sounds like a routine rescue mission then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicard shook her head, still uncomfortable with the movement of her now long, thick hair, \"There is more to it than that. They are the largest source of many resources critical to our defense.\" She went on to give a very impressive list. \"And you will notice the location of the system. If we don't keep good relations with them, the Cardassians will jump at the chance to take over there. It has been made painfully clear that there is no sacrifice too great to keep this world on our side and out of Cardassian hands.\" She sighed, \"To make it more difficult, they are not at our level of technology. Though advanced in some areas, their society is not, and the Prime Directive will be in full force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Troi fidgeted and then said, \"Um, Captain, That is going to present a serious problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicard was annoyed. She hated soft-peddling just as much as a female as she did as a male, \"Spit it out Counselor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroi braced himself then said, \"They do have some areas of advanced technology, but socially, they have not progressed in centuries.\" He paused, looking at Picard, \"They are a very rigid patriarchal society. Not only are there no women in positions of power or leadership, they are not allowed to be. In my studies, women are not even allowed to speak without permission. They are, well, um,\" he saw Picard's annoyance and braced himself, \"they are considered to be for pleasure and reproduction.\" He then added, \"From logs of past visits from Federation ships, the leadership of Lyris will not even consider negotiations with a female. We could try to force the issue, but...\" He couldn't go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicard finished his thoughts, \"But with the Prime Directive in play, we dare not interfere with their social structure.\" She looked frustrated, \"Damn you Q! That is why you did this!\" After she calmed herself down, she went on, \"It will make things much more difficult. As the Captain, only I have the authority to agree to terms or make a treaty. How can we get around that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker looked uncomfortable, but said, \"Is there a way that we can go down there without breaking their rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroi responded, \"Yes. The presence of women is not unacceptable to them, they just won't deal with them. At least not in public. Males may come and go as they please, but a female may not be seen in public without the male she is bonded to. You could appoint certain men to speak while you and others observe. We could then do our discussions in private. In the end, once back on board the Enterprise, you could exercise your authority to approve the agreement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicard shook her head, \"I don't like it. Being limited by gender! How archaic! However, I don't see a choice. This is too vital.\" She sighed, \"Counselor Troi, I will appoint you and Dr. Crusher to accompany us as the prime representatives. Myself and Commander Riker will,\" She sighed, \"Accompany you.\" She looked at LaForge, \"Ms. LaForge, you will also accompany us to study the engineering of their mining systems and see if we can suggest improvements that would not be in violation of the Prime Directive. Any questions?\" She looked around, and hearing none, \"Very well, you are all dismissed.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rescue part of the mission was 'almost' routine, though Picard should have had a clue about what was coming when half of the miners rescued refused to be rescued by women! Picard had to pull the women and send only males. She was thankful that the communications and coordination was being handled by Lt. Gorman, who was now a male. Picard was not sure they would have cooperated with a female communications officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they agreed in advance that Dr. Crusher and Councilor Troi would take the lead on contact, Picard was determined to show that she was the one who was in charge. So she choose to be the first to greet the Lyrisian. \"Open the channel Lieutenant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, a distinguished looking man appeared on the screen, \"Greetings First Minister. My name is Capt....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the First minister responded as if she wasn't even there, cutting her off, \"Hello Enterprise.\" And looking at Dr. Crusher and Counselor Troi, \"Welcome to Lyris gentlemen. You are welcome to come down as we have arranged. Even your plucky little woman there.\" Referring to Picard. Then he paused as if someone off-screen was saying something, \"Oh, and bring the young girl at your serving station.\" He seemed to indicate Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Crusher jumped in before his enraged Captain could respond, \"Of course First Minister. We shall see you soon. Enterprise out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicard was steaming! \"How dare he ignore me in that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Crusher tried to calm her, \"It is not a great surprise Captain. We knew it would be like this. Earth had many years not much different that they are now. Hopefully their society will evolve in time. For now, remember our mission. We dare not offend them.\" He paused, \"Wesley, do you believe that you could handle going down there? We don't really need to include you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley looked shy, but determined, \"I am fine. I don't know why I was requested, but I will be okay, male or female, I can take care of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Crusher was proud of her. Captain Picard looked up at him, \"It would see Doctor, that I shall have no input until we are alone together. Away team, and Ensign Crusher, report to transporter room one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, they were materializing on the planet. They were greeted by a small delegation that included the First Minister, four men that looked like guards, a teen male, and two women. As soon as they materialized, the First Minister said, \"Greetings! And welcome to Lyris.\" He motioned, and the two women, carrying boxes, moved toward the landing party. \"The women are giving you bonding bracelets. As we indicated, no females are allowed to wander without being accompanied by a male to who they are bonded.\" One woman seemed to have items that looked more like wrist bands, and put them on the men. The other woman put something that looked more like a bracelet on the females. The first minister continued, \"I assume that you know your bonding arrangements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCounselor Troi informed him of their arrangements. The First Minister said, \"Very good! Except that the plucky woman shall come with me, and the girl shall accompany my son.\" He indicated the teen near him. The landing party was not keen about being split up in this way, but the critical nature of their mission made them restrain themselves. He looked at Dr. Crusher, \"The women will show you to your quarters.\" A male went with each female, and Dr. Crusher and Counselor Troi reluctantly followed. Commander Riker went with Troi, and LaForge went with the doctor. The young male motioned for Wesley to follow, so she braced herself and did. The First Minister looked at Captain Picard, whom he towered over, and said, \"Come woman. We go to my quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first to reach private rooms were Wesley and the young man. As soon as they were alone, as she was instructed, she held up her arm, wondering why. The young man reached out, and instead of taking her hand as Wesley expected, he touched his wrist band to her bracelet. The moment he did so, Wesley gasped! First, waves of pleasure passed through her body! Tremendously sexual waves of pleasure that caused the nipples on her pert breasts to stand up tall! Then she just felt good. Good, content, happy. And then she looked at the boy about her age. She instantly found him incredibly handsome, and was incredibly, and sexually, attracted to him! She felt weak and inferior in his presence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at her with a smile, \"I am now your lord, Darex. You shall address me as lord Darex in the presence of any others, but in private you may just call me Darex. What is your name girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley almost shook in both love and fear at his voice, \"I, I am Wesley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked thoughtful, then said, \"No. That will not do for a girl of your beauty. I shall call you Weena. A good name for a girl in our language.\" (And yes, it is, for those who recognize it from the Time Machine, but it just worked for me here)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley just repeated, \"Weena. That is very pretty. Thank you.\" She loved that name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he sat down on a couch, \"The pleasure is mine Weena.\" He gestured, \"Put your clothing in that drawer, then come, sit on my lap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeena/Wesley looked down at herself. She had been undressing the whole time they were talking, and was now naked and holding her clothes, yet for some reason, she felt no shame or embarrassment in front of Darex. She put her clothes in the drawer, then happily walked over and sat on his lap. Again, she was treated to waves of pleasure and an intense sense of satisfaction over having obeyed, Darex. She did blush a little when she could feel the lump in his crotch stirring against her naked rear. She knew what that meant! She wondered about that strange but pleasant tingle in her pussy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of the building, Riker followed Troi and their guides to their quarters. When inside, and it was just the two of them, they looked around. Riker looked at Troi, \"Only one bed. Don't get any ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroi teased, \"Why not? It's not like we haven't made love before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker grinned, but had a shudder too, \"Yes, well, that was before...\" She suddenly wanted to change the subject, \"We are supposed to 'bond', whatever that means. They said I should touch this bracelet to the band you are wearing.\" Troi lifted his arm and Riker did to. As soon as the bracelet touched the band, a thrill of pleasure raced through Riker's body! She looked up at Troi. Damn! He is so sexy! She felt like she could melt in his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroi looked at her, \"Are you okay?\" Somehow, he couldn't help looking at her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker smiled, \"Yeah. I'm fine. Are you?\" Her nipples were rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroi shook his head, \"Not really. I can't read you now. Not since we 'bonded'. That is strange. I can still feel others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker grinned, \"Maybe you need to feel me in a different way?\" She walked up, took his hands, and placed them on her breasts. \"How does that feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroi smiled, \"Wonderful! But I thought you didn't want things to move that direction?\" As he said that, he massaged Rikers's beautiful breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, \"Well, maybe you are right. We did have sex with each other before. Maybe it is time to explore this body's feelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroi was a bit concerned about not reading Riker, but her breasts did feel wonderful. He wished she was willing to do, as the female now, what the male Riker had wanted so many  times from 'her'? No sooner had he thought about it than Riker began to sink to her knees! \"Um, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, \"Well, I just thought that, since I often wanted this from you, you might find it enjoyable now.\" And as she said that, she began to pull down his pants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroi was about to stop her, but then her hand stroked his cock and the thrill that raced through his body made him gasp. It never occurred to him, well, when he was female, that a male's sexual experience is almost totally focused on that one spot. If he had, he probably would have considered that sad for the male. But now, as he felt his cock quickly rising, and odd sensation to him also, he couldn't believe how focused and intense that feeling could be! And as Riker's lips slid over his cock, he was sold! At that moment, he hoped Q never changed them back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Riker was amazed at how much she enjoyed what she was doing. I caused a sexual thrill to go through her body in pulses that almost matched the rhythm of what she was doing for Troi. The never would have thought so before, maybe it was the hormones in this body, but she truly enjoyed sucking Troi's cock! And when Troi finally came, she discovered that the loved the taste of his cum, and happily swallowed every drop that she could! As she finished, the satisfaction and pleasure that Troi felt radiated throughout Riker's body, and was amplified. </span></div></div>",

Kept her all too aware of her new gender. Her hands brushing over the bonding bracelet, as if it were handcuffs. Binding her to Doctor Crusher, she wasn't sure quite how she felt, a pet kept on a short leash, or ... worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep, dark thought resented the Doctor, who didn't seem as upset, <i>hell!</i>, even interested in the binding band. The guide lead them to a quiet room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can rest from your journey in here.\" Stepping aside, the guide waved the pair of them into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have distractions for your concubine.\" The words aimed at Geordi made her blush, to be considered ornamental, rather than have earned a place with her skills and knowledge. She wasn't sure whether to be flattered or insulted. A guiding hand from Dr. Crusher brushed her hips, guiding her into the room, without allowing her a chance to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the possessive way, she'd been moved on, rather the smirk of amusement from the Doctor that made Geordi's temper fire up.

A semi-transparent dress laid out on the bed. Tugging nervously, at the short skirt of her engineering uniform as if it were armour, made her squeak softly in fear. Against another wall, a wardrobe was open revealing a selection of items that made Geordi want to squirm.</span></div></div>",

You quickly mount the filly that tried to do the same to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body rapidly begins to regain the muscle it had lost, and more. The starfleet uniform grows taut over your powerful human torso. As you dismount the unfortunate crewmember, you feel the luxurious locks receeding back into your scalp, while hers grow further down her back in a mane and her breasts swell further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're getting in to the <i>swing</i> of things,  Picard,\" Q smirks, looking between your legs as a long equine penis sprouts. \"However, you may find you have some rather <i>stiff</i> competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now half of the bridge crew have become submissive fillies and the ones mounting them stallions.
