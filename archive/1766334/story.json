No, although that was not a bad goal for yourself, it turned out that the real story of your life involved something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntirely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all began the day that you finally graduated from Pokemon school. It was a happy day, as much as you tried to be unsentimental. You were done with school for the rest of your life, as you had decided to take the trainer's path and skip college. You were busy celebrating with friends, counting down the hours until you would receive your first pokemon as a gift from your parents for all your hard work in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronic. Heh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very thing that you were dying to get was actually going to become the worst plummet your life would ever take. If only you had known then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned home that evening--that fateful evening--to find your parents waiting excitedly for you in the living room. Your mom had the most delighted, wide smile you had ever seen. Your dad simply nodded at you, gently caressing the stubble on his jaw. Out on the table before you was a small, gray box. Inside of it, as you soon discovered, was the pokeball containing your future. You were still trying to act like it wasn't a big deal, that this entire day was overrated and blown out of proportion, at that point. As such, you told your parents thank you and said you would officially start tomorrow morning. They were a little disappointed, which was to be expected, but they wizened up to your convincing. Pokeball in hand, you quietly went up to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it all began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you laid on your bed, you smiled to yourself, secretly knowing your true intentions. This was, of course, not something you were willing to put off until tomorrow. You wanted to see your pokemon now! You held it in both hands, looking down at it, and then reached to press the release button on the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, it\u2019s still hard to believe what really happened just then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only faintly remember that the beam from the ball struck you, paralyzing your body in an instant. You do remember that sudden fear you had the moment you realized that your parents had made a mistake. This pokeball did not contain a Pokemon at all! In fact--little did you know--this specific pokeball was an experiment that had accidentally found its way into the public\u2019s hands. The researchers had not wanted it to get out to anyone, but a mix-up had now put you into the way of this strange poke ball\u2019s new effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall blacking out very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you woke up, and nothing was the same. You were strangely soaked, out in the dark, and and beside you was a discarded soda can, taller than you. At first, you thought you were dreaming. This had to be a mistake! But then, you began to find out for yourself about your new life. There had been a change of plans for you, leaving you shrunken and powerless to every human and pokemon around you. It was no longer about winning it big and becoming wealthy, famous, and incredible. No, now it was all just about survival, all about getting to the next day while trying to return to your normal life before ending up in the gut of a pokemon or on the bottom of a human\u2019s shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm\u2026 It feels like it\u2019s been a long time. Where exactly did you find out that you were, again?</span></div></div>",

Either your dad or mom would be the best choice for help, but they would be hard to get to with their busy schedules and quick paces. One of your sisters, sixteen-year-old Laynee or ten-year-old Haley, could suffice if you could not get your parents' help. Then again, they had never showed any interest in you. They didn't even go to your graduation. You had never gotten along very well with them, but this kind of a situation could change that around. Unfortunately, it could also tilt the relationship even further the other way, leaving you vulnerable in the hands of one of your own sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, with the consideration of every option available, you could always attempt to get help from one of the family pokemon. They had usually been friendly with you, but that could've easily been a front from pokemon that were angry at being reduced to simple pets. Also, it would be much easier to have a little snack on you rather than help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's all up to you.</span></div></div>",

Your mom and dad probably would be too busy to notice you and Haley might not realize the full extent of the danger in your situation. Laynee was a good balance between the two extremes, which made her the most favorable to your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as you started moving towards the house, you noticed that something was up. The lights were still on in the house, plus the dim sound of loud music being played came from within. High above you was the moon and the stars, obviously nighttime, yet your family was up partying this late?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached the sliding glass door on the back porch, you peered in and confirmed your suspicions. They seemed to be having an extravaganza, despite all what had happened to you. The place was packed with punch bowls, empty cups laying scattered on the floor, plates of food on various surfaces... They were really enjoying themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you saw your family come into view. There was your mom, the girl-woman who would never let herself fall into the stereotypical housewife and mother type of person. She was dancing away, flaunting her remarkably trim body and curvy appeals. With her was Laynee, who seemed to be competing with Mom on who had the better body and moves. Laynee had your mom's long, dark hair and the curls that came along with it. Haley, on the other hand, was a bold blonde. She stood beside Dad, who had given her the blonde hair, and shouted at Laynee and Mom excitedly. Haley was always trying to be older than she really was, which always came off as obvious faking, especially when she forgot to act her way and allowed her inner child to push through. You and Dad had never really talked much. He was the silent type that seemed only to nod to you when you did something correct or watch you menacingly when you screwed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt lonely for you, standing out with a barrier blocking you from your family. Plus, with your current size, things just didn't seem like they would ever return to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced around for an entrance into the house and noticed that they had left the sliding door open, just a crack. You ran over and squeezed inside, returning to your own home. Now, though, your stomach churned and butterflies flounced inside of you. You were nervous. What would happen if you got stepped on? Obviously, it wouldn't be good, but would it be enough to actually kill you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you received your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom walked into the kitchen (which was the room you were in, also the room just beside the living room where they were at) and she collected some punch from the table. She was far enough away that you didn't need to worry--at least, not yet--but you witnessed for the first time the true horror that creatures your size had in the company of giantesses like her. An unfortunate little beetle got caught up trying to get through the kitchen. As your mom turned to head back to the living room, she unknowingly walked right on top of the helpless beetle. You heard the crunch of its body being broken beneath the sole of her foot, the snap of its exoskeleton, and the smoosh that its insides gave upon being smashed. The beetle was annihilated. And, Mom didn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could be you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to do something, or it <i></i>would<i></i> be you!</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, her white-socked foot landed down on top of you and almost instantly caused you to explode across the sole of her foot. She walked right over you, but stopped and looked back at the end of the hallway. She gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I really just see my cousin there on the floor?\" she asked herself.

She got \"right foot, yellow.\" She was wearing short white socks with gray toes and gray heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Alexis. \"Right foot, red.\" Alex was barefoot, toenails half painted blue. You were unsure why only half of each nail was blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather got \"right foot, blue.\" Everyone's right foot was now on the mat. Heather no longer wore her pink and white socks. Now she had on a white sock and a red sock. The red sock was on her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany got \"right foot, red,\" so she spun again. This time she got \"right hand, blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were all above you, just waiting to collapse. Alexis smiled at you, giggling at your horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got \"left hand, red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were very lucky. Nobody had gotten green yet. But, that might not matter with the forms their bodies were twisting into. You gulped as Heather spun again.</span></div></div>",

It smelled faintly of strawberries underneath her, the last thing you noticed before all of the girls collapsed and every possible ounce of their weight went into Heather's left foot. You were utterly smashed underneath you cousin's foot. And, she didn't feel a morsel of regret.

Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather placed you down on the trampoline and the three girls headed separate ways. They were going to trample you to death, hopping and jumping until one of them randomly caught you underneath their feet. All were barefoot. There was not a chance that you would survive being jumped on even once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One,\" they all said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, trying to see, but it was no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning around in a random direction, you tried to find a small hole or some way to get off the trampoline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your size, it was hard to get very far per second counted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing, nothing, nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap.

In a few seconds, three sophomore girls would be maniacally jumping around over you. Any of of them could catch you under their feet, causing your demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was going numb. There seemed to be no chance of survival. It was impossible to even see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped trying to escape and looked around, trying to spot the girls. Now what you needed to do was avoid them, as best as you could. Who knows how long they would jump, or how long you would last, but that was for the future to worry about.</span></div></div>",

You found yourself lying on Delcaty's tongue as you became drenched in saliva. Then Delcatty started licking you against the roof of her mouth and rolling you around on her tongue. You then started to hear Delcatty purring. Apperently she found you to be tasty. Delcatty savored the delicious flavor of her midnight snack that was you for a few more minutes. Eventually the tongue settled down and began pushing towards the back of the throat as you began to struggle. Then Delcatty tilted her head back and swallowed you whole with a loud gulp. You continued to struggle as you slowly traveled down the esophagus. Eventually, you landed in the stomach with a plop. Fortunately you passed out from a lack of air just as the digestive jucies began to flow.

The Trio of Pokemon arrived at the house and when inside into the bedroom. There, Eevee went near your bed and gave you a chance to climb down yourself. Eevee then stood up and began to talk to the other Pokemon about something that you were not at all able to understand. Then they are started to briefly look at you, then they talked some more. After their little discussion, Eevee and Delcatty began to walk outside the bedroom while Mightyena stayed in the bedroom with you. It began to look at you contently, like something a guard Pokemon would. Perhaps if Mightyena was happy and playful with you at your small size in its backyard, it seemed like Eevee and Delcatty trusted Mightyena to watch you while they did what ever they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed rather creepy with you and Mightyena just staring at each other and doing nothing. You think maybe you should do something fun perhaps while the other Pok\u00e9mon are away. You call Mightyena to come closer to you and it does rather slowly just to give you piece of mind and not cause a \u201cearthquake\u201d with its massive paws. It approaches then lays down next to you in a cuddly type of fashion. You brainstorm about what you want to play with Mightyena and suddenly remember the games you played with the Pokemon at your normal size. One game first comes to mind which was a form of hide and seek. Mightyena had an amazing keen eye and was always able to find every hider no matter where they were. Perhaps hide and seek at your tiny size may make it more interesting to find you. Then another game came to mind that was really more of playing with Pokemon such as scratching, tickling and wrestling. Though it may be entirely different than before, perhaps you could make Mightyena a happy Pokemon again by scratching in the spots it likes.</span></div></div>",

You Pok\u00e9mon had lifted its head, having you fall head first down into its esophagus, unlike when Mightyen had eaten you before, Sylveon anatomy was much smaller, it squizzed you down its throat, the pressure its esophagus forced on you, only make you try to struggle more in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found that Sylveon would swallow you in lumps, each lump was followed by loud swallowing sound, you didn\u2019t count them yourself, but it took your Pok\u00e9mon only five attempts, before completely consuming you.

For the next few moments, you could see nothing, but felt your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s crushing organ force you along a path you always dream of taking, each time you had given your Pok\u00e9mon something to eat. Its heart beat was lost to your eats, but easily felt by your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you felt your head press into the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s closed muscle, the sphincter as its known. It stretched open as your body pasted through into the chamber leading off from its esophagus.<br>\r\nAt first you sit up, but find it hard to keep yourself up right, as the fleshy chamber bludges and squeezes around you. For now you remain frozen, taking in the random movements of its stomach and the sounds, a light heart beating light heart beating sound, and just under that, you could hear and feel through your hands and feet, its voice. Sylveon had been saying something, you didn't know to who, but it was talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, you were tossed about inside its belly. It felt as if you\u2019re Pok\u00e9mon was moving around while talking to another Pok\u00e9mon, you guessed it was Mightyena, but who or whatever it was, Sylveon wasn't standing still.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of a sudden, your head was no longer under the water, still everything was pitch black. But you weren't out of the water, your head and shoulders had been thrust into its esophagus, it was then you felt waves of muscle ripping down your back and over your chest. But that wasn\u2019t the strangest thing to happen, without warning a loud thud echoed through the tunnel, while throwing you about. A sudden surge forced you deeper into the Vaporeon\u2019s throat, along with some river water. Another sudden thud seemed to throw things about a second time, it was now that you felt the waves of flesh with your legs and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the sudden movements had stopped, you were left with the constricting muscles that guided you deeper into the water Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s anatomy, you recalled before getting your Eevee, a family friend living nearby, had evolved their Eevee into a Vaporeon, the two of you were really good friends and just last week, the three of you played together for a day, and now your nothing but food for such a Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head jammed into its sphincter, the closed muscle stretched around your body, depositing you into the water Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s stomach. As you lay in its moving chamber, the water level doesn\u2019t pass much higher than your waistline. You breathed out and then back in again, the air had a strong acid taste, giving you a little bit of a chest pain. As the stomach sounds filled your ears, you could feel a tremble coming from the Vaporeon, it didn\u2019t hit you until yet another thud, tossed you about inside the water Pokemon\u2019s stomach, you hate to admit it, but it was almost like something was hitting the Vaporeon that just ate you, another powerful whack tossed you about, before you really felt the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s trembling body and what felt like it limping away. Even being food for this Vaporeon, you felt sorry for it, you recall watching a Pok\u00e9mon battle on the television and how after getting beaten up, how much a Vaporeon would shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour predator seem to stop limping and came to a stop, its stomach however kept moving as you lay on it. You felt like trying to fight your way out from its gut, but you knew that wasn't going to be possible. You were about to cry, when you felt the Vaporeon swallow something, you paused until whatever it had eaten dropped into its stomach with you. It was some kind of berry, you could tell since it lay between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremors seem to have come to a stop, when the stomach suddenly pushed your forward, forcing you into its stomach wall. Pushing your hands into the moving wall, you felt the stomach walls close in on you again, this time your head was plunged into what felt like its esophagus. Everything around you, pressed firmly into your body, pushing you back into the Vaporeon\u2019s esophagus, just as before the smooth fleshy walls griped into your body; pulling you deeper into the wavy tunnel. To you it felt that this was talking longer then last time, with each press into your chest the air was forced from your lungs, and replaced with a foul tasting air, you still had an acidy taste, but nothing are strong as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were beginning to believe, that this would you trapped here forever, until a loud gulp rang in your ears and your eyes where blinded by light.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By now the Pokemon had taken a number of steps and had not eaten you again. Making you think, this time it didn\u2019t intend to swallow you again.

But then it hit you, it might now be the sink its was after, but could it want water?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d you asked.

You want to go swimming?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pok\u00e8mon responded with a call, which to you pretty much confirming your second guess, right off hand you guessed the best place for Vaporeon to get a swim, would be the bath tub, it would just need to be filled first. Not wanting to keep Vaporeon waiting, you directed it to leave, \u201cOkay, lets head back out and keep going, I\u2019ll tell you the right room\u201d with that said Vaporeon turned around and exited through the same door, back into the hallway.<br>\r\nSince the bathroom was at the other end of the house, and Vaporeon taking its time, it was a good ling while before you made it to the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

With each step this Pok\u00e8mon took, you felt as if your hand might slip and you would fall off its head. While you where laying on Sylveon\u2019s head, you had a nice bow to hold onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you came up to the bathroom door, you pointed towards the door, saying, \u201cIts this one, here\u201d you forgot that Vaporeon might not be able to see what direction you were pointing. Without failure, your Pok\u00e8mon companion turned into the bathroom\u2019s open door, leaving you as awestruck as with the kitchen. It seemed that this blue Pok\u00e8mon wasn\u2019t so estranged towards what a bathroom was, as it silly walked towards the fixed bathtub and prepared to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO\u2026 WAI\u2026\u201d was all you could get off, as Vaporeon leaped into the air, jumping over the bathtub\u2019s tiled wall. Once it had reached the highest point of its leap, you found yourself airborne, all you could do is scream as the distance between you and Vaporeon grew wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you couldn\u2019t see is that Vaporeon had already began moving to intercept your fall, the moment its forelegs touched the base of the bathtub, it had swung its whole body around. All you could see was the white of the bathtub and tiled wall, before this massive blue fluke swept in front of you. Feeling yourself hit a massive pound of flesh, a feeling you were now well familiar with, forced you to come to a sudden stop, with a loud thud, everything came to a stop,leaving you at the base of Vaporeon\u2019s tail. With your heart racing,and breathing heavily, you manager to muster a thank you, while Vaporeon breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had calmed down, from this last ordeal, and while still standing on all fours, you looked up at Vaporeon, asking it, \u201cCan you put me up there?\u201d you pointed towards the mixer tap for the bathtub. This time Vaporeon rated its tail up high toward the rim of the bathtub, giving you easy access to the rim. With a simple jump, you found yourself back on firm ground. The blue Pok\u00e8mon wasn\u2019t able to stand next to you, however it stood up on its hind legs, nearby waiting for its next instructions. Posing your hand into the same position, as the taps handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPush it like this\u201d showing the Pok\u00e8mon, as you pushed your fingers up with your other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the Vaporeon used it paw to lift the tap handle up, allowing water to rush out of the spout, only now it seem like a giant water pipe has burst, no longer a simple little tap. Vaporeon however, wasn\u2019t prepared for the gush of water and leapt backwards, its shock soon worn off and it waded through the now shallow water, back towards were you stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon stood back up on its hide legs, giving you an unhappy stare as its head now sat above the bathtubs rim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, about that, I didn\u2019t think the water would be like that\u201d as you apologised, Vaporeon\u2019s right eye twitched, you followed on by saying, \u201cUm, you\u2019ll need to turn off the tap, once the tap is full\u201d reluctantly Vaporeon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather an awkward situation, waiting for the bathtub to fill with water and having an unhappy Vaporeon in front of you. All you could think of doing, was to give it a pat, to try and ease things over with it. Carefully you walk right to the edge of the bathtubs rim, reaching out to the blue Pok\u00e8mon, hoping it would lean forward.</span></div></div>",

Out of no where it suddenly raised its head into the air, while turning to look back at you, lucky it hadn\u2019t knocked you over. As Vaporeon stared down at with with rather said eyes, you reached up trying to touch its head, which was out of reach. <br>\r\nGiving this sad Pokemon a soft stare, you say, \u201cIts alright Vaporeon, I want to come back with you, its just we where in the middle of something, and besides you can come along with us if you like\u201d<br>\r\nVaporeon cuddly lowers its muzzle down to you, it turns it nose away, before softly rubbing your whole body, with its cheek, something similar to how it would rub your hand, when you would reach out to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Vaporeon pulled away, it began to stand itself up off the cave floor, the Vaporeon quickly lapped its soft tongue out from its muzzle, and whipped it straight over the front of your body, once again hiding you in-between its teeth and tongue\u2026</span></div></div>",

As its tongue relaxes, you can hear the muffed sounds of Sylveon talking. As you do the tongue begins to shift, along with the feeling of the Vaporeon\u2019s mouth shifting. You wonder if Vaporeon is becoming nervous, as you hope that it is approaching your party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shortly feel your elevation drop and turn upwards, while being almost stuck to the Pokemon\u2019s tongue. Suddenly in a blinding flash, you fall for only a moment and land on a rocky ground, as your vision clears up you at first see the Sylveon you had been riding before all of this, along with the less interested Delcatty and the still concerned Mightyena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have any chance to respond, one of Sylveon\u2019s ribbons reaches behind your back, it wraps around your body with a firm grip, lifting you of the ground and towards the waiting pink and white Pokemon. Sylveon brings you right up to its own muzzle, before loosing its grip on you and licking the whole front of your body, making you giggles as its tongue licks up your body a small number of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sylveon has done licking you, it stars back at you with a relieved expression. Mightyena who\u2019s head hovers above Sylveon\u2019s head, seems to also be relieved at seeing you safe and sound.<br>\r\nSpeaking up you say, \u201cVaporeon saved me, and I want it to say with us\u201d<br>\r\nYou could hear the Vaporeon\u2019s voice, it seemed a little surprised.

It was much larger than you had thought and its steam reached your face even from as high above as you were. But, in the water were four people. One you instantly recognized as the Lavaridge gym leader Flannery. You felt an odd sensation at seeing her below, getting a view straight down on her. She was submerged in the water, though, so you couldn't see much. You couldn't even tell if she was bathing nude or wearing a bikini. Either way, she was very hot, and you had an incredible opportunity if you chose to risk your own life for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you thought it over, you looked at the other three, which were all girls. One was a gorgeous blonde, probably around twenty-five, who school had taught you to classify as a \"Beauty.\" The second was called a \"Lass.\" She was a pretty girl about your own age with straight brown hair. She playfully wiggled her toes at the surface of the water, showing off her smooth feet and pink toenails. The third girl was a \"Cooltrainer.\" She had shoulder-length blonde hair with a slight curl at the ends. You also saw that she was relaxing near her red boots. You noticed that there were two black socks near them, but they were at a short distance away so you weren't sure if they were hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdeas floated through your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, would you try any of them?</span></div></div>",

It has long, pointy ears with black tips, black eyes and red cheeks. A little, black nose rests in the middle of the creature's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze travels down and you notice that the creature has short paws, and a long tail behind itself. Curiously enough, this tail has a heart-shaped tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few steps back as you recognize this huge creature as a Pikachu. And a female one, judging from the shape of her tail, which is usually thunderbolt-shaped for the males of the species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also confirmed you something else: you really shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few steps back, unable to believe this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't real, this can't be real. It must be a dream, a really vivid dream! That's it, this is just a dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you look up at the giant rodent, who, unaware of your presence, lets herself fall back on all fours, making the ground beneath you quake lightly while also making you fall on your own behind. You feel a light ache and, with horror, you realize that this is no dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're really shrunken and helpless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and carefully, you try to sneak away from the giant Pikachu, deciding that you need to find help as soon as possible. You won't last too much alone like this, so your only hope is to find someone to help you with this dire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't get too far before the Pikachu suddenly moves a step, her right forepaw stopping right in front of you. As a result, you end up bumping straight into it, before ungracefully falling on your back on the hard floor of the 'forest'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, the Pikachu seems to have felt your small body bumping into her paw and slowly rises it upwards, letting her face once again fill your whole point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow giantess seems to spot you on the ground as she moves her head down, her nose stopping near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay still, not quite sure about how to react, whether try to run or simply let the Pikachu do whatever she has in store for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opt for the choice you believe the safest and lay still. Maybe the giant rodent didn't notice you yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your hypothesis is reduced to nothing as you feel a strong suction power coming from the Pikachu's nostrils as the giantess sniffs your tiny body, telling you that she effectively noticed a tiny human laying before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Pi?</span>\" you hear her cry as her nose is removed from your body, the black eyes of the rodent fixing a gaze of genuine curiosity on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... hi?\" you try to remain calm, not wanting the Pikachu to be startled by a sudden movement of yours, which would be surely followed by a giant paw slamming on you, smashing you into paste as you were a common bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Cha?</span>\" the giantess cries again, moving a paw towards you. Although, against your predictions, the giant paw wraps itself around your body as the Pikachu picks you up while she moves on her hind legs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are roughly brought in front of the rodent's face. It would have been adorable in other circumstances, but right now, from your new perspective, it looks terrific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Chu!</span>\" the rodent cries for the third time upon noticing that she's holding onto a tiny human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu lets out a few more cries of excitation, before you notice the paw holding you moving you forward, towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly wonder what she's up to, but you soon find out as the Pikachu...</span></div></div>",

It took you spotting a nearby berry, the side of Celebi's breakfast, to realize where you were. Even then, you could barely believe it. And, it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi had moved around again later in the night, removing its head from your body. You had stirred a bit in your sleep, sore from being her pillow, but remained asleep. A few more hours passed before Celebi woke up completely. This was while you were in the middle of your own deep rest. Unfortunately, whatever misconceptions you'd had about Celebi proved to be false as she flew up, plucked a berry from a tree, and returned to the trunk that you were sleeping beside. She sat down again beside you, yawning as she chewed and swallowed the berry. Then, she reached over to the main part of her breakfast and raised you up to her mouth. You were still snoring as she laid you between her lips and onto her tongue. She disliked the taste of blood, so she had merely tossed you around within her mouth--tasting you and savoring her chance to eat a human, shrunken or not--and then sent you into her stomach. Somehow through it all you remained asleep, during the only time when you could've affected your slim chance for survival. Now, though, you were already decidedly chosen to be melted down inside Celebi's stomach as her early morning breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burning continued and continued. Then, it ceased. But, by then, you had also ceased.</span></div></div>",

You quickly open your eyes and notice that Celebi has moved once again, removing her head from your body. You hardly stand up and push on your own back, getting a 'crack' out of it. You notice that the grass type pokemon is now standing with her head against the tree trunk. You look up in the sky; it's still dark, it must be around 3 or 4 AM. You go sit down next Celebi, with you arms behind your head. You don't want to go to sleep yet. You just sit there, thinking about this heck of a day. You were supposed to start your journey as a pokemon trainer and you end up mysteriously shrinking and in this forest, completely helpless. You then wake up in the night and find a mythical pokemon sleeping before you. At this point, you look up at Celebi. She is still asleep, you barely see her  black eyelids closed in the darkness of the night. But is just a moment, before Celebi moves again in her previous position. But this time, you aren't there to cushion her head, so she hits the ground. Celebi opens her eyes and looks around; she eventually looks down in your direction and spots you tiny figure. She barely sees you due to the darkness, but she still can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi is in utter confusion. She just found a tiny human before her. Weren't humans supposed bigger?  Maybe she was mistaking, maybe it's just some bug. No, it can't be. A bug couldn't possibly have hands, hair or clothes. It's indeed a human. Maybe Celebi is just dreaming. She moves a hand to touch herself. Nope, she's fully awake. She really found a tiny human! Slowly, she extends a arm to pick you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare ar the legendary pokemon and she stares back at you, maybe trying to find out what are you, when you see her extend her arm. You don't even try to dodge, as you know that running would be useless. You stand still as Celebi's hand closes around your body and lifts you to her face and opens her mouth...</span></div></div>",

And though remarkably unusual, this human would be no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no stoooop!\" you yell as Celebi callously shifts your location from her fist to the insides of her mouth. She did not pay any mind to your request, overthinking things was a quality few time-travelers retained. Reality was a paper and Celebi was both the eraser and the pencil, things really only happened when she willed them to. Truly there was no harm in indulging herself if it later turned out to have never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough mother nature's work is admired by many, she is rather a cruel and unfair matron. Ask any Luvdisc or Unown. Or as things would have it, any shrunken human. You are currently subjected to a view normally reserved for unlucky ants or very careless spiders - The dark insides of a living being. Teeth that could crush airplanes and grind bones to dust! A black hole in the back from which not even light can escape! And your only foothold, a giant tongue that's constantly wiggling, <i>-tasting-</i> your very being to decide your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME OUT!\" you scream at the top of your lungs, slipping to and fro on the massive red muscle. Your screams of terror made Celebi feel a little uncomfortable. She wasn't going to keep it this way after all, she was just having a little fun. To her, anyway, but in the end that was all that mattered if she decided to change the past. And she was definitively curious enough about this tiny little thing to give it another go later, or more accurately, earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEscape seemed like a futile effort, your foothold was very wet, the kind of tongue which doesn't do much talking. Not much eating tiny humans either probably, but you had a bad feeling that was not going to be an issue. Using your mighty intellect, you hastily come up with any excuse to leave this beast intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no bug, I'm human! I'll make a spear out of saliva and cut you open from inside!\" you shout in the hopes that she would hear you. Suddenly the mouth shook as Celebi stifled a giggle, which had little effect as you were practically on the edge of her vocal chords. Damn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled though she felt even more uncomfortable. She located the feeling to somewhere south of her stomach, like a feeling of guilt in the pit of her stomach. Though less guilty in its characteristics and more... Needy. Feeling a little sheepish she spread her legs and swiped a paw over her sex - Ah. A sharp inhale made your sweating body go freezing cold in an instant as Celebi relished in the now very very comfortable feeling washing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some very, VERY powerful friends! Bug-Types! If they find out anything happened to m-\" you continue with your threats as you're once again interrupted by Celebi's voice, less of a shaking giggle this time and more of a deafening moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi covered her mouth with one hand while the other continued its ministrations - Why did it feel so good!? Her heart was racing, her crotch was pulsing and her mind overcome with lewd desires - Granted, she didn't have much experience when it came to toying around with shrunken humans, but to live her life thus far without this had to be criminal! She closed her eyes and focused on the little motions inside of her, since she was going to reset the timeline she might as well go all out. Not that she cared if anyone saw her risqu\u00e9 actions, in fact the small visitor in her mouth was almost certainly aware of what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unaware of what was happening, but things were moving. A lot. You feel yourself falling all over the place and finally coming to a stop near the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No...! Please...!\" you stammer fearfully in one last attempt, \"Not like this...! Why can't we be friends instead!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stopped for a moment. Yes, she was definitively going to explore the nature of this little creature closer now. Go back in time and undo all of this, treat you nicely. Perhaps in another branch of this story you would be friends. You would be happy. You would be in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in this one, you are her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe throat grips a hold of your body and pulls you down, deeper into the digestive system of the mythical Celebi where you will surely meet your end inside a bag of acid...</span></div></div>",

On the outside world, Celebi is relaxing, sun's first rays filtering through the night's darkness, when she feels that the struggles inside her quitted. Instead she hears something coming from within her stomach... crying? Is the tiny human crying, knowing what awaits him? This saddens Celebi, as she smiles sadly and puts a hand on her belly, before starting to rub it, trying to comfort you in your last moments. Back in the inside, you feel the wall moving from the other side and realize Celebi must be rubbing her belly, maybe satisfied after eating you. You keep crying as you sit down, the acid rising to your neck. The liquid burns your skin as you stop crying: you would at least live your last with dignity. These are your thoughts, before you dissolve in her acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside world, Celebi hears nothing more coming from her belly, deducing that her tiny friend was now gone. Even though this, she smiles. She's going to bring you back to life. Maybe after a nap, it's still early. So she leans back and relaxes, falling asleep after a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of sound sleeping, Celebi wakes up, and it's fully morning. After stirring for a bit, she stands up; now or never. She flies up in the sky as a greenish white light envelops her. After a moment, she's gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last night, past Celebi is about to swallow you, when a green light appears next to her.  The grass pokemon recognizes it as Time Travel as another version of Celebi comes out of the portal. Present Celebi smiles at her past counterpart, before telling her, in their own language, to not swallow you, because she would decide to keep you then. Past Celebi nods as she spits you out, in her open hands \"Free at last\" you say, dripping with drool, before turning to Celebi \"Please, don't do that aga...\" you notice something is not right. There are two Celebi?! You are shocked at them as present Celebi looks at you with a smile, glad to see you again. She then cups her hands together. You stare at her confused, while past Celebi smiles, as she know what her counterpart is doing; she undid the timeline where she ate you, so you should be revived in about... now. In fact, a second later, a bright light appears in her hands. When it dies down, an unconscious you is laying on them. Past you looks even more confused as present Celebi prepares to go back to her timeline. She did what she had to do, so it is time to leave. She waves her and your past counterparts as she is once again engulfed in green light.  Past you closes his eyes, blinded by the light. When he opens them, the other Celebi is gone \"What the hell was that?\" he asks to himself as last Celebi encloses him in a hug.</span></div></div>",

You had the scariest dream ever: you dreamt that you were somehow shrunk, then the legendary pokemon Celebi found you and ate you. In the end you died in her stomach. You really can't remember what happened then. You slowly and painfully open your eyes. The first thing you see is something dark green colored. Weird, you don't remember having any object inside your house. You feel that your feet are on the cold ground, while your head is laying on this green, soft object. It emanates a comforting warmth. You try to get up, but something keeps you from moving. Looking up you see a light green face, two blue eyes staring down at you. You fully shut your eyes open and see Celebi staring right at you with a concerned expression. She sighs a sigh of relief when she sees you awake, then she smiles kindly. You notice that the green surface you are laying on is actually her belly, and her hands are on your back, keeping you still. Wait. If she's not a dream... she really ate and digested you! And you really died...weird..if you really died you shouldn't be seeing Celebi...or anybody else right now... and why can't you remember nothing about after you died? Your head is killing you, you need to stop thinking. Celebi moves a hand and places in on your head, covering it. She seems to be inviting you to not struggle to rest some more. But you want answers, now. So you use use your hands to try and lift her hand. You obviously cannot even move it, but Celebi does herself and looks at you. You look back at her, finding the right words to speak \"How?\" is the only thing that comes out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighs. She knows that her little friend wants answers, but how can she tell you that she revived you by going back in time and preventing you from getting eaten, when you can't understand her? She groans in frustration, why can't she learn telepathy? So she has no other choice, but try and make you understand her. So, she first points to herself, the she starts glowing. You think for a minute, before realizing: Time Travel. Celebi continues. She then points to herself again, then to her mouth, before shaking her head. She then points to the sky and then to you. You think, trying to translate her moves. After a while, you realize and look up to her \"You are saying that you went back in time to stop your past you from eating the past me. You've done it and I was revived?\" you ask. Celebi nods smiling, glad that you managed to understand. That was getting pretty awkward. \"But why you saved me after eating me?\" you ask, confused. Celebi smiles as she closes your body in a hug \"You felt guilty because you care about me?\" you ask, getting another nod from her. The legendary pokemon then settles you on the ground and stands up, towering over you. You are completely obscured by her shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi knows that now she has brought you back, she has to treat you nicely and become friends with you like she promised to herself. Maybe after that you two could even... that is still far. For now, the first thing to do if she wants to become your friend is...</span></div></div>",

And she wants to feel it again. So she snatches you from the ground and moves you towards her open mouth. Again, your fears of being eaten awake \"Not again! Please don't do it!\" you yell. Celebi stops to give you a warm smile, before moving you in her mouth and closing her lips, trapping you in darkness once again. Her tongue starts to lick you all over \"Please don't!\" you yell again. On the outside world, Celebi spreads her legs and slides a hand towards her waiting sex. She starts fingering herself once again. Your squirming inside her mouth, your pleads for life, your fear, it all gives her a sense of... power. A great sense of power, and she loves it. But this time would be different. She won't swallow you. Back in her mouth, her tongue is still sloshing you around the cavernous mouth, each movement of it causing you to slide a little deeper. Your fear grows each time you get closer to the throat \"Please let me out!!\" you tell at top of your lungs. You don't want to experience death again. Celebi, half giggling and half moaning, moves you closer to her throat with her tongue. She doesn't want to eat you, she's just pushing the line to the extreme. But you are unaware of her true intentions. So you couldn't help but feel horrified. And why in the world is her mouth shaking? What she's doing? You achieve these facts as secondary, because right now your first thought is about not being eaten by the legendary pokemon. Celebi just moves you a little closer, you almost fall again in the dark abyss that caused your death just last night. So, in a desperate attempt, you yell \"Please! I thought you cared about me! Weren't we friends?\". Celebi stops at this. It's just like last night: the human is pleading for his life while she was busy with her own business. But this time is different. In this branch of story you are NOT her food. You are her friend. You are her possibly lover. Lover. That word sticks to Celebi's mind, making her smile. Sure, that would be a bit difficult, as human - pokemon love is forbidden under Arceus' laws, and sure she will have to do a lot of talking with Mew and Arceus himself. But she has made up her mind. Sooner or later, the tiny, cute human will be hers, no matter what. And nobody will stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Celebi is doing, she stops and opens her mouth, letting you slide out of your dark prison, right in her open hands. Free at last. You are covered in a thick coat of saliva \"Why'd you do that?\" you ask, while Celebi cleans your face from her drool with a hand. After that, she proceeds to clean your body. After cleaning you completely, she tightens you in a tight hug. You are still unable to get why in the world she did that. After a few minutes, Celebi releases you from her grasp and holds you close to her face. You see a smile spread across her face as she puts you on her head and turns around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the human on her head, Celebi prepares to fly off.</span></div></div>",

Within a minute, Celebi is out of Ilex Forest, and she starts flying towards east. She can't wait any longer, she has to talk her about her feelings about you. She knows that Mew is for sure at the Tree of Beginning. Or at least, that is where she should be. In fact, Mew is known as the most cheerful of all the legendaries, and she often left the tree in search of something fun to do. Celebi remembers that the Tree is at Kanto's confines, so she will have to fly for a while to get there. So she makes sure that you are holding on tightly, before increasing her speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so of flying, Celebi finally was out of Johto. You are curious about where she wants to bring you. After a little while of flying, she spots some crystals on the ground. Looking up, you see a gigantic structure completely made out of crystals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard about the Tree of Beginning at school. That is supposed to be Mew's home. But why Celebi wants you to see Mew? Maybe she wants to talk to her and possibly get you back to your normal size? That would be great. Little you know is that Celebi brought you here because she wants you to be hers. But first, she needs Mew's approval. Celebi smiles; Mew would for sure give her approval. The two were always great friends, and Mew always said that humans are nice after all. So she shouldn't be much contraire with Celebi's new love. Getting Mew's approval would be a great headstart with Arceus. He, on the other hand, will be surely pissed with this. These are Celebi's thoughts as she uses psychic to move you in between her wings. You hang on for dear life to her skin as she touches the crystal of the Tree. Immediately, the two of you are engulfed in light as the Tree takes you to its core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew is resting, when a light shines. She opens her eyes and looks to see that the Tree is letting someone to its core. Who could that be? She wasn't expecting anyone. So she moves closer as the light dies down, revealing Celebi. Mew instantly flies to her to give her a hug. Celebi gladly returns it.<br>\r\n*Momentarily pokemon speaking*<br>\r\n\"Hi Celebi!\" Mew beams, waving her short paw \"What brings you here?\". Celebi gives a small blush, looking at the ground. Mew stares curiously at her as the grass pokemon decides to speak \" Mew, I came here because I'm... in love \" she says. As expected, Mew explodes in cheering \"Who's the lucky pokemon?\" she asks, a huge smile on her face. Celebi blushes even more: this is going to be awkward \"Well... it's not... actually... a pokemon\" she admits. Mew stares at her confused \"He's actually a.... he's a human\" she says. Mew tilts her head. Has she really heard Celebi saying that she fell for a human? Nonetheless, she still is happy for her friend \"And what does this guy have for you to fall for him?\" \"Well... you see...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still between Celebi's wings. You hear her talking with a Mew, judging by what you hear. Suddenly, Celebi picks you from her wings and  shows you to a Mew. The car like pokemon is shorter than Celebi, but still huge to you. The pink pokemon stares at you for a but, before speaking \" Quite the catch you got there. He's a cutie!\" Mew says, giggling. Celebi nods \"Listen, I wanted to know if you ...\" \"I do\" \"... approve my love. What?\" Celebi asks, not sure of having heard good \"I said I approve. Who am I to judge love? And again, this human is one of the cutest things I've ever seen\" Mew replies, smiling \"But...\" she then says \"Arceus had to be informed about this. Can't wait to see his face when we tell him\" she giggles. Celebi nods as Mew grabs her arm and uses teleport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash of light, you are staring at a golden ladder, which, looking up, leads to a marble platform. The Hall of Origin. Celebi looks at Mew, who nods. The two fly up to the platform. Standing there, a majestic equine figure. It has white fur, golden hooves, a golden wheel around its waist, adorned by four gems. Arceus. The god of pokemon. You are staring at the strongest of all legendary. He's apparently resting, judging by his closed eyes. But he probably feels you as he opens his green and red eyes. Celebi quickly hides you behind herself as Arceus speaks \"Mew, Celebi, what are you doing here? And why do I feel there's a fourth presence here?\" he asks. Mew giggles \"It's about our Celebi. She found love!\" she beams. Arceus looks surprised \"I'm happy for you my girl. His he the fourth presence I feel? If that's so, why can't I see him?\" Arceus asks. Celebi blushes again as she reaches for you. She picks you from behind herself and shows you to the Alpha pokemon \"I'm in love... with this human... And... I wanted to know... if you... approved...\" Celebi admits. Arceus stares at you silently, before talking...</span></div></div>",

Arceus looks at her sadly: he couldn't bear the sight of his children sad, so he continues \"But... If you truly do love this human, may he be your special other\" he says. Celebi's eyes widen.

You look more confused than ever. What in the world is happening? Arceus seems to notice your confusion, so he speaks up \"Celebi, I need to ask you something\" he says \"What is it?\" she asks \"Does this human return your love?\". Celebi sweat drops.

Arceus sighs 'May as well tell him' he thinks \"Put him down Celebi\" he says. Celebi does as commanded and gently puts you on the ground. Arceus lowers himself to talk to the human.<br>\r\n*Human speaking*<br>\r\nYou stand there, not daring to speak as the three legendaries speak; you know that a wrong step could cause your end, when Celebi puts you on the ground and Arceus lowers himself so he is almost eye level with you \"Hi there\" he says \"H-hi\" you reply, shocked that he just spoke human \"Listen, it seems that Celebi has developed a strong feeling for you. Practically, she fell for you\" he says. You stand there, your mouth wide open. Celebi has what?! How come a legendary pokemon could fall for you?! These are your thoughts as the Alpha pokemon goes on \"Me and Mew there...\" \"Hi there!\" the cat pokemon waves you giggling \"... we accept her love for you. We just need to know: do you return her feelings?\" he asks. You don't know what to think. You just discovered that Celebi is in love with you, and the Alpha pokemon is asking you if you love her back. You look at the three pokemon; Celebi is staring at you, a strong hope in her eyes. Mew is also staring at you with a hoping expression. Arceus is staring at you with an amused expression. You carefully think what to do; if you reject Celebi's love, her heart will shatter for sure. And probably Mew would make you pay for making her friend suffer. In the end, Arceus would probably erase you from existence. And this time, no Celebi to bring you back with Time Travel. You shiver at the thought. Plus Celebi is an adorable and sweet pokemon, no doubt about that. And being chosen by a legendary pokemon to be her other half, you should feel honored. Also, you owe her from when she brought you back after you died. So you take your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it's not really what you want \"I... I do return her feelings\" you say. You're not sure if this is the best decision, but it's too late now. You already spoke. In a second, Celebi snatches you from the ground and encloses your whole body in a tight hug. She is happier than she has never been.<br>\r\n*Pokemon speaking*<br>\r\nCelebi is literally squeezing the air out of you, when she puckers her lips and kisses your cheek \"Awwwwww\" New says, giggling. She is happy that one if her best friends is happy. After all, she's always happy when someone around her is happy. Arceus just rolls his eyes. You meanwhile blush wildly; a pokemon just kissed you, can this day be weirder?! You try to shake your blush off. Well, you guess, even if it isn't the right choice, you'll learn to love Celebi. Arceus stares at the scene for a bit, before speaking again \"Wouldn't you want him normal sized?\" he asks Celebi. The grass type pokemon thinks to this \"No\" she then says, taking that Alpha pokemon by surprise \"I want him to remain this size so I can protect him better. Also, he is already cute as he is\". Arceus nods in understanding as Mew grabs Celebi's arm \"Come on Celebi, we're done here. Let's go!\" she says, before turning around \"Bye Arceus\" she says \"Thank you for everything\" Celebi adds. Arceus waves a hoof dismissively as the two pokemon and the tiny human disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all return back to the Tree of Beginning in a flash if light. Celebi has a huge smile painted on her face: she just achieved her goal, the tiny human is finally hers. Forever. She just can't wait to get back to her forest with you. From now on, she will have to protect not just Ilex Forest, but also you from the dangers. So Celebi turns to Mew \"Thank you for everything Mew. I think I'll get going now\" she says. Mew, on the other hand, wants you two to stay here some more. It was boring around here and she was completely alone. You two are her only company right now. And plus she wants to explore the little guy's nature, make sure she won't hurt Celebi in any way \"Wait, guys. What do you say of staying here for a while? It gets really boring around here. Would you like to stay?\". Celebi thinks to this. She really wanted to get back to Ilex Forest, but staying here she could have some fun with her friend and her tiny, new lover. So she decides to leave the choice to you.<br>\r\n*Human speaking*<br>\r\nYou don't have any idea of what is happening, but you don't pay much attention to it: you are trying to collect the memories of the past two days: First, you wake up one day to find yourself shrunk and in Ilex Forest. After avoiding the dangers for the whole day, you finally fall asleep and then wake up and find the legendary Celebi sleeping on top of you. Then, she wakes up and eats you, killing you. Then she goes back in time to prevent her past self from eating you and so save your life. This morning, after threatening to eat you again for some reason, she spits you out and brings you to Mew, then to Arceus. And here she confessed her feelings for you. Then she kisses you. And here you are \"Little guy?\" a voice snaps you out of your thoughts. You look to see Mew staring at you. Wait, did she just speak to you? Then you remember that she can use telepathy \"Yes?\" you ask \"Would you like to remain here for some time, before going back in the forest?\" she asks. You look at Celebi, she shrugs, so you get that she's leaving this decision up to you. You think about what to do. Going back to the forest would mean staying alone with Celebi. Or you could have a chance to run away. Seriously, you don't know if this was the right choice. Or you could stay here, and thanks to Mew, you could understand her and perhaps making you feel sure about your choice of accepting her as your lover. In the end you decide to...</span></div></div>",

Escaping through the woods was tempting, but in your reduced state it would be inviting danger from the forest's critters and its patron deity who was currently busy speaking gibberish with Mew. No doubt Celebi was prettier on the outside than inside, but you had a feeling you might be seeing more of both in the near future unless you thought of something very smart very fast. Perhaps you two could reconcile later, when you were a lot bigger and a lot less fragile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention towards the pink legendary. You knew absolutely nothing about her, except that you can speak with her through telepathy and so far she hadn't tried to eat you. The way she and Celebi were chatting it up suggested a close friendship, but your chances of survival would increase dramatically if you manage to somehow make her sympathize with your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mew... Can you hear me?' you think loudly. Aside from a light shift in posture, Mew gave no signs of responding. So she can't read your thoughts. Good to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how come you two know each other?\" you ask, trying to make casual conversation, \"We flew pretty far from Ilex Forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them stop talking turn their attention towards you. You feel like an ant under a magnifying glass, pronounced by the fact that their eyes were absolutely gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly, we've known each other for ages!\" Celebi said with a giggle, though you can't understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi only just moved to Ilex Forest last year,\" Mew spoke inside your head before looking a little dejected, \"Why do you think I'm so bored?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's rough,\" you lie, having been forced to redefine 'rough' since passing through someone's digestive system, \"What do you do when you're all by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Mew responded before the communication of your minds suddenly cut off for a moment, and Mew's gaze moved off to the side as a faint blush spread across her cheeks, \"... Things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What things?\" you press on, despite Mew's flustered behavior. Things were going swimmingly - If the two of you had some common interests then you might be able to find out a bit more about this new hope of yours. However, Celebi was getting a little annoyed by this one-sided conversation, especially with her mind full of all the nice things you could be doing together in private. Soon you find her elongated verdant arm reaching down towards you. Fighting the urge to cower, you stand tall as she picks you up like a household object, the force of her most gentle grip threatening to pop your lungs out of your ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go back home!\" Celebi chimed excitedly before looking at the somewhat embarrassed Mew, \"I've been away too long, you never know what might happen! But thanks for the help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already?\" Mew asked with a not-so-subtle hint of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait!\" you shout, struggling to catch a glimpse of the gentle giant from the perch of another, \"You said you were bored, right!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew looked at you with those pleading sapphire eyes ten times the size of your body, before nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...\"</span></div></div>",

Are you kidding? That would be great!\" Mew says excitedly at the idea of having someone to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighs. She's unaware of the true intentions of her little boy, so she simply assumes he really want to keep Mew company. So, even though very reluctantly, she decides to agree.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUpon hearing her friend affirmative response, Mew explodes in cheering.

You just need an excuse or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Hey, are you alright?</i>\u2019 Mew's telepathic voice interrupts your thoughts. You nod.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I asked you what you want to do. You didn't answer</i>.\u2019 a slight hint of concern could be heard in her tone.<br>\r\n\"Um... don't really know...

Mew smiles brightly.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Let's play!</i>\u2019 she cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, one pouting legendary flies above the sea at supersonic speed, her tiny, yet long arms crossed, while her face shifted from her previous, loving smile to a noticeable unhappy look. And Celebi has more than just one reason to be pissed.<br>\r\n\"Why did he want to keep Mew company? He barely knows her!\" the annoyed time traveler keeps repeating to herself as she flies in direction of the forest she calls home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a sudden thought makes her stop in mid air.<br>\r\n\"Maybe... maybe he's mad at me for eating him last night?\" she questions to nobody in particular.<br>\r\n\u2018Of course he's mad at you! You literally killed him!\u2019 a voice, deep inside her mind, shouts.<br>\r\n\"But I did revive him! And he said that he loves me back!\" Celebi says to herself as she resumes flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a sunny day, the sky is clear and there's a small breeze. The grass type sighs. At least, she can enjoy a nice flight on the way back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play what?\" you ask to the now excited pokemon.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Cat and mouse! Cat and mouse!</i>\u2019 she cheers<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>It's like hide and seek, only better. There's a time limit, and, if you can escape me for the whole time, you win. But, If I find and catch you, I win.</i>\u2019 she explains, before flashing you a smile, her eyes gleaming with her hardly-contained excitement.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>So, are you in or not?</i>\u2019 she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. What other choice do you have? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Alright then, you have an hour to escape me. Go hide, you!</i>\u2019 the titaness giggles, before settling you down on the grass. She then turns around, brings her paws to her eyes and starts giving out incomprehensible cries, meaning that the countdown has just started. Without thinking, you start running away from Mew, trying to get as far as possible before hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Celebi finally reaches her destination, her beloved Ilex Forest. Flying deep into the forest, she stops to sit on the roots of a huge tree, giving out a deep, annoyed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlucking a berry from a nearby bush to fulfill her missed breakfast, she tosses it into her mouth, chewing and swallowing. In the process, images of what she's done not even eight hours ago come to her mind. The tiny human's screams, his struggles to get out of her mouth, the intense pleasure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shakes her head. Fantasizing about 'her' little one won't help her dealing with his absence. But she can't help but wonder what him and Mew are doing right now. Yet, she's sure of one thing: until Mew brought you back, she was going to die of boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from some fights for food of the forest's inhabitants, Ilex Forest was known as a quiet place. But that just worked to her disadvantage right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head one more time, Celebi leans back, deciding to take a nice nap. The events of last night left her still tired, and she hasn't had much time to sleep afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, giving a yawn, she closes her eyes, her baby blue eyes disappearing behind her black eyelids as she soon starts snoring quietly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek through the leaves of a bush you hid in. This wasn't your first hiding place, and, almost certainly, it won't be the last. You decided to hide around, as you would never be able to go further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to avoid Mew for quite some time now. You're pretty sure that the hour is about to run out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're now aware of why the pink legendary wanted to play this one game. She's simply <i>formidable</i> at it. She found (and almost got) you, like, three times. And you practically had to do the impossible to escape her. Last time, you almost got caught in her tail while running. Luckily, you managed to dodge it and ran. It wasn't any easy task, as there are crystals coming out of the grass that could reveal your position to Mew at any moment. But, in the end, you managed to make her lose your tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, you're hiding in this bush, waiting for the time to run out. But you're unaware of a certain pink pokemon approaching from behind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiles. She's sure that Celebi's newfound little one is hiding in the bush in front of her. It's the only one she hasn't checked yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she glances into the bush. A smile spreads on her face as she notices the little human standing there. Giggling silently, Mew uses her ability to become invisible and slowly slips into the bush, careful to not make any noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops right behind you as her tail slides near you and wraps tightly around your waist.<br>\r\n\"Hey... What...?!\" you exclaim as Mew pulls you off the ground and becomes visible again.<br>\r\n'<i>Waiting for someone?</i>\" she places her paws on her mouth as she giggles, floating out of the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flies over one of the many 'bubbles' that lead into the core of the Tree and sits next to it.<br>\r\n\"So... game over I guess...\" you say, making her giggle.<br>\r\n\"<i>Unfortunately. You're good at this!</i>\" she cheers, before continuing.<br>\r\n\"<i>You know, I have to thank you.</i>\" she says.<br>\r\n\"For what?\" she blushes a bit.<br>\r\n\"<i>It's been ages since I had a playmate. And good one, too. Thank you.</i>\" she says. The sudden declaration makes you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, really.\" she pulls you in a hug. You are smothered between her paws and her warm, pink fur as she displays affection for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that this is the best moment to take action, you call out for the pink giantess.<br>\r\n\"Hey Mew, may I ask you something?\" she nods slowly.<br>\r\n\"Well... what do you do when you're all alone here...?\" you ask curiously, as your previous question was rudely interrupted by a certain green pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Mew flushes red.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Didn't I answer to that question already...?</i>\u2019 she asks awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"No.\" you reply, flatly.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>... Things...</i>\u2019 she repeats her previous answer. And, before you could ask what she meant with 'things', she talks again.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Hey, now that I think about it, how did you got so small?</i>\u2019 she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I don't quite know. I just woke up yesterday, and I was like this, in Ilex Forest.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Dear. And how did you meet Celebi?</i>\u2019 she asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's now your turn to blush.<br>\r\n\"Uhm, you know... she found me... and she...\" you say, stopping at the memory of her gulping you down, sending you on a one way trip to your doom. You almost want to cry again just thinking about being in that fleshy hell full of liquid fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mew doesn't seem to notice your disease.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>... She...?</i>\u2019 she asks, tilting her head, motioning for you to go on. You recompose yourself.<br>\r\n\"She... brought me here...\" you say, voluntarily skipping your journey into Celebi's stomach and her trip through time to bring you back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew seems satisfied with your answer.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Hey, speaking of, I forgot I have to bring you back in Ilex Forest. Celebi must be worried.</i>\u2019 she observes. Your heart freezes at the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary looks at you.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Well then, little one,</i>\u2019 she says through telepathy.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Ready to go back?</i>\u2019 she asks.</span></div></div>",

And, before you can even react, it already has firmly coiled around your waist. The tail lifts you off ground, and brings up to the smiling face of Mew.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Ready for departure?</i>\u2019she places her paws on her mouth as she giggles.

If, by any chance, you had said something, the sudden acceleration would have thrown your words right back down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, Mew starts floating on the crystalline seawater, enjoying the warm sun hitting her back and the marine breeze through her fur; you, meanwhile, keep your gaze upwards, doing your best to try to not look down. The only sight of the height Mew is flying at, along with the increasing speed, would make you throw whatever you've eaten up. But Mew didn't seem to notice at all, as she keeps flying, her tail swaying up and down as she does so. You gulp. What would happen if she suddenly releases you for any reason? With these thoughts, you tightly grip her tail with your tiny hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been flying for an hour or so now. After a bit, Mew starts slowing down. You assume you're almost there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, since she's now merely floating, you decide to ask her something, hoping she would hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew,\" you call out, thinking she can't hear you.

Once again, you find yourself staring into those immense sapphire lakes that are her eyes.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Come again?</i>\u2019 she asks.<br>\r\n\"Well... do you know how can I return to my size? I mean... everything's frightening at this minuscule size...\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew gives you a sorrowful look.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Forgive me, but I really have no clue...</i>\u2019 she replies. And, seeing your head dropping, she hastily continues with a more cheerfully tone.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Hey, no need to be sad. Look at the bright side. Celebi will protect you!</i>\u2019 she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to tell her that it's mainly Celebi that scares you, but you keep that thought for yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like she's reading your mind, Mew continues with a soft voice.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Please, don't ever hurt her.</i>\u2019 she says.<br>\r\n\"... I don't think it is physically possible.\" you reply. Returning her normal self, Mew giggles.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>No, silly. I mean, be nice to her.</i>\u2019 she says. You nod. Obviously, being nice is the key two remain alive around Celebi. Giving a smile, Mew resumes floating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another while, Mew finally reaches her friend's home, Ilex Forest.<br>\r\n\"It's been awhile since I last saw this place...\" she says quietly as she ventures into the forest, you floating right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of searching Celebi, Mew finally spots the time traveler, quietly napping under a tree.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Look who I found.</i>\u2019 she says cheerfully as she moves you forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the sleeping pokemon. She looked adorable from this perspective, but still, this wasn't any reason to be less scared of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, Mew floats over Celebi. She lowers herself and gently starts to shake her.<br>\r\n\"Celebi...\" she whispers. The grass type moans out in her sleep, but she doesn't wake up.<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Celebi!\" Mew cries, louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden call succeeds in waking Celebi from her slumber. The time traveler starts stirring, and, slowly, her dark eyelids open up to reveal her bright blue eyes. She blinks a few times before recognizing the smiling face of her friend.<br>\r\n\"Mew?\" she asks, giving a yawn.<br>\r\n\"Exactly. And look who I brought.\" Mew says, moving her tail, and so you, in front of Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Celebi's full attention was on you. It takes her mind a second to process who you are.<br>\r\n\"Cutie!\" she chimes, her paws rushing to snatch you from Mew's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you are shoved into her her chest as she hugs you tightly, knocking all the air out of your lungs and threatening to pop your eyes out of your skull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mew!\" Celebi happily thanks her friend, who smiles in return.<br>\r\n\"No problem, really. It's been great to have a playmate!\" she replies. But Celebi isn't fully paying attention, more focused on the little guy tightly held in her paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew giggles.<br>\r\n\"Well, guess I'll be going now. See you soon!\" she says before looking at you, who are still enclosed in Celebi's hug.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Little one, I'll be leaving now.</i>\u2019 she says.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Bye!</i>\u2019 she adds.<br>\r\n\"Bye Mew!\" Celebi says cheerfully. And her cheerfulness comes from her imminent 'playtime'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait!\" you stammer. You expected her to stay longer. Mew is your hope right now. If she's around, Celebi wouldn't try anything weird... at least, that's what you hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew stops to look at you. Celebi's gaze also travels down to you.<br>\r\n\u2018What now?\u2019 the grass type thinks<br>\r\n\"Mew, w-why don't you stick with us?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\u2018What?\u2019 Celebi thinks to herself, unsure to have heard good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go on.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... you know... it's been fun... Why don't you stay here for a while?\" you hastily ask the confused-looking legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment full of tension follows. Celebi's annoyed gaze doesn't leave you, while Mew seems to be pondering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, she hasn't shown any malicious intent towards you, she would be a great help. You just hope you effectively managed to convince her to remain in the forest...</span></div></div>",

And, by the time she talks, you are already pretty sure about her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Alright!\u2019 she mentally cheers, slightly startling you. She repeats it in her own language.<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" although you can't understand this, the tone she used is the same, so it's pretty easy for you to get the meaning of the words that just came out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Celebi have different reactions; a slight smile takes place on your face, while she looks somewhat pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression gets Mew's attention.<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong Celebi?\" she asks with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the time traveler ignores her, focusing on you instead. Using her paws, she brings you upwards, right in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself staring into those huge blue eyes of hers. You can almost see your reflection in them.<br>\r\n\"Tell me the truth, little guy,\" Celebi says you.<br>\r\n\"You're mad at me, aren't you? Is that why you want Mew to stay?\" she asks with an extremely soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, without waiting for an answer, she encloses you in yet another hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to ask her what's going on, but you soon feel something hitting your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing upwards, you notice Celebi, her eyes lidded by her dark eyelids, tears pouring down her cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Celebi... what...?\" you mutter, before a familiar voice talks in your head.<br>\r\n\u2018Are you... mad at her for any reason?\u2019 you recognize it as Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly glance backwards, noticing the pink giantess looking at the scene with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her, you look right back at Celebi.<br>\r\n\"Celebi, I'm not mad at you. What you did to me was wrong, alright. But you fixed it. There is no reason for me to be mad.\" you reply. In fact, you're not mad at the giantess, you're just really afraid of her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing you, Celebi slightly opens up her eyes.<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry. You have every right to be angry. What I did to you was foolish...\" she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask what she just said, Mew translates her words for you.<br>\r\n\u2018What she did was foolish...\" she says, before cocking her head in a perplexed manner.<br>\r\n\u2018Is there... ehm... something I don't know...?\u2019 she asks you. She was curious about the reason of her friend's tears. Apparently, you had something to do with it, and she wants to find out what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. Sure, this new situation might not be the best you got into, but a rough start like this one won't help you.<br>\r\n\"Come on Celebi. I forgive you... just stop crying, alright?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words seem to have an effect on the green titaness, as her mouth slowly curls into a small smile; one of the two monolithic paws holding you releases you, leaving you fully grasped into the other as Celebi wipes her tears away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bi!\" she cheers down at you, before leaning down, pressing her lips into your forehead, which immediately starts burning hot; a fiery blush finds its place on your face as she pulls off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that the conversation between you and her friend stopped, Mew takes the moment to speak up.<br>\r\n\"Celebi, what happened? What is this story?\" she asks. She can't wait any longer, she wants to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Celebi just giggles.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mew! All forgotten!\" she cheers.<br>\r\n\"Please!\" Mew pleads.<br>\r\n\"Nope. It's a secret between me and little guy.\" Celebi replies, playfully shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew sighs at this last remark, before smiling again.<br>\r\n\"Remember, Celebi. I will get you for that. On the playground!\" she shouts. Celebi smiles as well.<br>\r\n\"You mean-\" Mew interrupts her.<br>\r\n\"Yep. Let's play!\" she shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's about to let out an excited cry, when she remembers about you; you had watched the two talk without understanding a single word, but now they suddenly look overexcited.<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment Mew,\" Celebi says, although you can't actually understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice her gaze traveling down to you.<br>\r\n\"Little guy, wanna play with us? Please?\" she asks. You blink a few times, making it clear that you didn't understand anything about what she said. Seriously, that is a problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your uneasiness, Mew acts up.<br>\r\n\u2018Come on, little buddy, let's play for a bit! It'll be fun!\u2019 she says you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's what Celebi wanted to tell you. The two want to play. With the small amount of time you spent with Mew, you got she's into childish, harmless fun. But Celebi's idea of 'fun' is still a mystery to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you notice the duo looking at you expectantly, clearly eager to start with whatever they've got planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it long and hard, but, in the end, you finally make a choice...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Also, you have to admit, you're pretty curious about the game they want you to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon your words come out of your mouth, their faces seem to brighten up. Both of them let out excited cries.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now, just to pick which game should we start with...</span>\" Mew says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's eyes start sparkling with excitement.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, I know!

Just as the thing starts to get annoying, you find Mew's gaze shifting on you, a cheerful smile on her face. Apparently, they're done talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Hey, little one, we just found the perfect game with can play together.</span></i>\" you nod your head, silently encouraging her to continue.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">It's called cat and mouse.</span></i>\" the title of the game is not unfamiliar to you.<br>\r\n\"Wait, the one where you have to hide while the others have to find you before the time runs out?\" Mew nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">And guess who is the mouse~</span></i>\" the legendary chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale, as you realize your role in their game. <br>\r\n\"C-can...

Damn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you find the arms of the time traveler lowering to gently letting you on the grassy forest floor.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Alright, now you'll have five minutes to run as far as you can and hide. If you avoid getting caught until...</span></i>\u2019 Mew abruptly stops to look at Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the two talking about something in their own language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey end the discussion with two excited squeals.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">... As I was saying, if you avoid getting caught until sunset, you win.</span></i>\u2019 you're not sure you heard good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil sunset?! How are you supposed to hide from them until then? You briefly glance at the sun, which is still shining high in the sky. For a moment, you wish it would settle down right now. But it obviously doesn't. There's no way out of this, you'll have to play their game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew continues.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Also, if you win, you'll get a reward from both of us...</span></i>\" Mew adds cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But if we catch you, you'll be all mine to deal with~</span>\" Celebi speaks up. You need no translation to understand her intentions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Five minutes starting...</span></i>\" Mew says. Celebi kneels down to give you a light peck on a cheek, which you interpret as a 'good luck'.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">...Now!</span></i>\u2019 as soon the telepathic shout echoes in your head, you see the two turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly look around, searching for an ideal hiding place. Judging by the position of the sun, it must be around 2 PM. Meaning that you'll have to hide for more or less six hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep looking around but, finding nothing like an hiding place (no surprise in a forest), you decide to dash away, looking for one, be it a large leaf or a puddle where you can avoid the gigantic eyes of the two legendaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run for a few minutes, until you stop, completely breathless. Pearly drops of sweat pour down your face while you pant, taking big breaths in order to fill up your lungs with air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you slowly regain your breath, you take a look around, searching for a place where you can easily hide without the risk of being discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes soon fix on a wooden structure, which looks like a shrine. Wait, didn't people build a shrine dedicated to Celebi? Apparently, it is the thing you're staring at. And, looking at its base, you see that it is held by four 'legs', leaving a slight space between itself and the grassy floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen. It seems that the space between the ground and the shrine is just large enough for you to fit completely beneath it. There you could hide undisturbed, waiting for the sun to piss off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what if that is the first place that Celebi and Mew will check? It surely wouldn't take long for them to find you underneath it. And it would even less difficult to catch you... You also consider finding another spot. Sure, the choice is pretty limited, but better safe than sorry, you guess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you hear two excited squeals, that you immediately recognize as Celebi and Mew. You urgently realize that the five minutes you had to hide are up, and they're coming for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unsure about what to do, you hastily think about the best choice, but you better hurry - the two aren't far!</span></div></div>",

You turn around, just to see a large, green paw making its way towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, in a desperate attempt to dodge it, you roll out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, luckily, you end up in a patch of tall grass, your minuscule form completely hidden by the two giantesses.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hey, where is he?</span>\" you hear Mew asking in poke-speech.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">He must be around here. Do you me, my little human? I'll find you, be it the last thing I do!</span>\" Celebi exclaims. Her voice is followed by Mew's signature giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, a green paw digs into the grass, missing you by mere centimeters. Your heart galloping in your chest, you take your chances, and start crawling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, after a while, the giggling and the cries of Mew and Celebi can't be heard anymore, meaning that you've gotten far from them. At least, far enough to come out of the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you poke your head out of the thick 'forest'. And, as expected, Celebi and Mew aren't there. They must have remained back to search for you, you judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, mercifully, now you can move freely. You have to search for a new hiding spot while you still can. So, glancing around, you start walking towards a casual direction - obviously, not the one you came from as there are two giantesses currently looking for you back there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I don't think he's around here, Celebi,</span>\" Mew says, rising herself from the grass. Both she and Celebi have been searching for the little human for at least fifteen minutes. But there was no trace of him in the tall grass.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Maybe you're right. He must have gotten away.</span>\" Celebi says with a hint of resignation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You sure picked a smart little guy. I almost envy you.</span>\" she remarks, sending Celebi into giggling as well.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're right, Mew. But the game is only just started.<br>\r\nCome on,</span>\" Celebi says, helping Mew up.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let's go find that cute little mouse of mine.</span>\" with that, the two laughing legendaries venture into the forest, searching for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like a lot of time passed when you finally stop to rest for a bit. At least an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, trying to find some kind of hiding place. And you seem to find one as you spot the uncovered roots of a big tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout second thinking, you slide in between them. Not the kind of place you'd call comfortable, but the roots are at least tall enough to completely hide your form from eyesight. You've picked the right place to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to recollect your thoughts. The sun has started its descent, but it is still high in the sky. You assume it must be around 4 PM. Meaning that it's been two hours since the game started. And you almost got caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you really escape Celebi and Mew until sunset?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden noise interrupts your train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze upwards, discovering two certain, mythical pokemon floating around.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Little one! Come out wherever you are~!</span>\" Celebi cries excitedly as she looks around, trying to spot you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We'll find you sooner or later!</span>\" Mew adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then split up. From your hiding place, you notice Mew checking some bushes, while Celebi... she's coming straight in your direction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of good ideas, you lay down, arms pinned to the sides and legs closed together. Maybe she'll mistake you for one of the roots and she'll leave. You nervously wait as Celebi checks the roots one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon, the giantess is upon you. You sweat drop as you see her staring right at you. And you notice her smirking.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey, I've never seen this kind of roots. It's almost kind of cute,</span>\" her paw travels down to you. She pokes your nose with a finger.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So cute in fact that I could just snatch it up and kiss it all day long~</span>\" her paw moves from your nose to your chest as she tries to pick you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't let her. You rise your legs and kick her open palm with both your feet, managing to push her paw back. And, much to the grass type's surprise, you stand up and sprint away.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mew!</span>\" Celebi cries, getting her friend's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo sapphire eyes fix on you as the pink pokemon turns around and spots you. A toothy grin appears on Mew's face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">There you are!</span>\" she cheers, floating towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you run faster. You dodge her swinging tail and turn around. Only to notice Celebi flying straight at you at ground level, her paw extended, ready to get you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, you leap up, avoiding Celebi's paw. You land on it and, with another leap, you are in the grass again. You dash forward, in direction of the forest, leaving two upset legendaries behind.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Almost got him...</span>\" Celebi says, lightly pounding the ground.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">There's still plenty of time. We'll catch him sooner or later!</span>\" Mew says cheerfully. Celebi smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You know what, Mew? I'm done playing nice.</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more hours pass. And now the sun is definitively about to settle down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost, hungry and tired, you walk aimlessly through the forest. You managed to avoid Celebi and Mew a couple more times, but you're too tired to do so again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hope that you'll manage to win this. You really don't want to know what Celebi has in store for you if you lose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are led to Celebi's shrine once again. Too tired to think of a better hiding place, you slide underneath it once again. After all, the two legendaries didn't actually find you the first time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay down, the grass concealing you from the world while providing you a soft surface to lay on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, soon, you hear two distinct cries. Celebi and Mew.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Where could he be? It's been hours now...</span>\" Celebi says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I really don't have any idea. Either he disappeared or...</span>\" Mew distractedly eyes the shrine. She suddenly remembers about earlier.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Or maybe...</span>\" she points at the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looks at it, then at Mew, and nods. Slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom beneath the wooden structure, you watch as the two get closer and kneel down. Before they can see you, you quickly lay down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, two pairs of gigantic eyes start scanning the area beneath the shrine... one single question echoes in your mind - what to do now?</span></div></div>",

There's just you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn several other times to make sure they aren't going to come out while you're not looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're completely sure that they left, you let out another relieved sigh. Only to take it back the next moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething just touched your back, and a light, familiar giggle could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you turn around. Your face is greeted by a pair of gigantic, blue eyes and a large mouth - which is inevitably smirking. Both belong to a green face you learned to fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fear is the only thing that keeps you from running right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi lets out a cute giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Finally.

Before your mind can process what just happened, you feel something wrapping around your body, immobilising you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to notice that it's grass! You look at the legendaries, and you discover Celebi glowing green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure that it makes sense. A grass type fairy could have nothing less up her sleeves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two joyful pokemon slowly approach your trapped body. The same grass that saved you earlier is now delivering you straight into the paws of the two giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you put your brain to work, thinking about a plan that can save you right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the grass keeping you still untangles front our body as you are picked up in a pair of large, green paws and you are brought up to the smiling faces of Celebi and Mew.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">As I was saying, you're the most skilled opponent I've ever had in this game,</span></i>\u2019 Mew telepathically says.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What a shame, I was having so much fun!

Celebi's grip softens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you take the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, you slide out of Celebi's grip and fall down to the ground, the grass (mercifully) softening your landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without losing anymore time, you once again dash away from the two. But it doesn't take long for them to discover that they've just been tricked.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're not getting away! Let's get him, Mew!</span>\" Celebi shouts cheerfully, happy that the game hasn't reached its end yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two legendaries start chasing you at their full speed. And, once again, Celebi tries to get you with her signature power. But you were expecting that, so you dodge the blades of grass that are trying to catch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you glance backwards at the two pokemon. They're incredibly close, shouting their names in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple more times, you dodge Celebi's paws, Mew's tail and a few plants suddenly coming out from beneath you. But, glancing at the two again, you don't notice you're running straight towards a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around again, you halt your run just in time to avoid bumping into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try running left. A pink wall of fur stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try running right A green mountain floats in front of you, blocking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try running in between them. Both form a living barrier to keep you from running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and Mew laugh hysterically.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Alright, I didn't have a so heated game in lot of time,</span>\" Mew compliments, though you can't understand her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Me neither. But now...</span>\" Celebi looks at you with grin.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">The game is up. And I want my reward~</span>\" she sings, extending her long paws towards you, ready to grab. Mew reaches out for you as well, her stubby, short fingers wiggling, eager to get a  hold of you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a defeated sigh. You lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat means Celebi is going to do Arceus knows what with you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resignedly glance at the sky, and you notice is very close to setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain suddenly intensifies its work. Without even thinking, you suddenly throw yourself aside, dodging Celebi's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you start running, but Celebi and Mew were clearly expecting this, as you soon find their shadows covering your form, their paws reaching out to get you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you were any smaller, you would be probably dead now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing merrily, Celebi rolls on the floor for several times, her catch solidly held in her paw.

Sneasel is more like it! Sneaky and swift just like one!</span>\" she compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, her smile shifts into a grin, her eyes no longer sparkle with excitement, but with mischief.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mew,</span>\" she says, still holding you in front of her face, so that you get to see the smirk she's giving you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Go get some berries, please. A LOT of berries.</span>\" you don't understand a word, but you hear Mew giggling behind you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Sure.</span>\" she replies, giving a big wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before you can say anything, the pink giantess leaves, disappearing into the depths of Ilex Forest.<br>\r\n\u2018What is going on?!\u2019 your mind screams.<br>\r\n\"W-What...\" your mouth says instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel something touching your head. Looking back, you discover Celebi staring down at you, her grin widening second by second.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So, it's only you and me now, cutie,</span>\" she says, inching you closer to her face, to the point that you can feel her warm, mint-smelling breath gently blowing into your own face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I caught you fair and square, and I want my reward now. I've been waiting for the whole day, you know,</span>\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow.<br>\r\n\"N-Now Celebi, don't do anything you would regret, l-like last night,\" you stammer, recalling your brief stay inside her stomach, which ended sadly for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile fades from the giantess' face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I already cried my tears for that, mind you. Wasn't that enough of an apology?</span>\" she asks, laying down on her back, while keeping you up in the air with both paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, not understanding a word, the only reply you can give is a flat:<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" Celebi sighs. To you, not understanding pokemon speech is normal; to her, it's stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the fairy smiling again. Not grinning, but smiling reassuringly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Relax, will you? I just want to have some fun~</span>\" she chirps, ending her sentence by rubbing your chin with the back of her paw. Very slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, sure that you understood the last part.<br>\r\n\"Isn't it a bit... early, Celebi?\" you say, choosing to remain calm and to try and talk your way out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint, red shade appears on her cheeks as well.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Maybe,</span>\" she replies, shrugging, making you fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land straight on her belly. The fairy rises her head and looks in your direction.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But after all, who says we can't spend some private time?</span>\" she adds, that mischievous glint returning in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Celebi-\" you're interrupted by one of her paws, which she places on your mouth, silencing you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Look, we have more or less ten minutes before Mew comes back. That's all I need.</span>\" she says, her paw removing from your mouth and wrapping around your waist instead. The other paw soon joins the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to fear, you watch as Celebi sits up and flaps her wings, starting to flutter.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now, just to find a more private place...</span>\" she mumbles, hovering upwards, you held in both of her paws for 'safekeeping'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world shakes as the fairy reaches the highest branch of a tall tree, roughly sitting down on it, making sure to spread her legs in the process. You catch a glimpse of her sex, and you hurry to look elsewhere. Celebi giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on, my shy little guy,</span>\" she sings.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Our playtime is about to begin~</span>\" that said, she brings you dangerously close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, to her lips. You watch them part as she talks again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ready?</span>\" she asks, softly pecking your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Celebi, don't do anything you might cry about later. It could end really bad for someone you really care about...\" you try. At least, you hope that she really cares about you. After all, she did declare her devotion towards you, didn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi grins.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't worry about it.</span>\" she simply responds. With Mew gone, you stuck with her and nobody around to ruin her plans, she can finally take out all of her repressed desires. And if something bad happens to you... she'll be sure to undo it with a quick leap back in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those happy thoughts, Celebi looks at you, grinning, as she gets ready to start...</span></div></div>",

Best friends, almost sisters, but you can surely understand that she couldn't satisfy my... physical needs,</span>\" her gaze becomes even sweeter, and you soon find her paw moving to your head, gently caressing you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And that's when you come in. Finally, I have someone. Someone I can talk to about...</span>\" her paw shifts position from your head to your chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... Intimate stuff.</span>\" she says seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't understand whatever Celebi just said. Seriously, what does \u2018Bi le bi\u2019 mean? But you felt the mischievousness in her tone. And it surely means nothing good for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Celebi enjoys her... quality time with her little human, Mew keeps herself busy with gathering berries for a decent dinner, deliberately plucking as much as possible. Just to give Celebi and her human some time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long passes before her short, pink paws are full of berries of all kinds. It isn't a particularly amusing task, but the real purpose behind it is enough for her to go on, now simply snatching berries with her psychic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hope those two are having fun,</span>\" she giggles to no one in particular.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I can't believe that Celebi found love before me.<br>\r\nAnd she found such a cute and smart little one, too.</span>\" she then says with a small, imperceptible sigh, which is followed by her signature giggle.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Who knows, I might just find my catch soon. Maybe I'll find my own shrunken human!</span>\" she starts laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hehehe, for now, I'll just find more berries, I guess,</span>\" she says cheerfully, more berries floating towards her from the nearby bushes, forming a large, hovering group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop! Stop!\" you stammer, as the barrage of kisses you have been put through dies down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you're on fire, and you're certain that you're really burning red while the green giantess in front of you giggles.<br>\r\nShe's been kissing you repeatedly for the past few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, since you were 'blinded' by her large lips, her free paw 'accidentally slipped' over her sex. Some good way to start off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Celebi isn't done with you just yet.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That was fun! But,</span>\" she grins at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm still really hungry...</span>\" for some reason, her belly growls in this exact moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at it. Then, she looks at you, smirking. She already knows what to do next. You know as well.<br>\r\n\"Cele-\" you don't get to finish; the grass type roughly moves you to her mouth, and opens wide.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">See you later, cutie~</span>\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she drops you inside of the dark cavern.<br>\r\n\"No-\" all the lights fade away as she shuts her mouth, sealing you inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you start to struggle to get out.<br>\r\n\"Come on, Celebi, let me out!\" you shout out. The only things you achieve are a mouthful of saliva and a giggle coming from the dark abyss behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant tongue beneath you throws you back and forth within the slippery, dark confines of the mouth. Mercifully, you don't get to have a close meeting with her teeth, but still, this is terrific.<br>\r\n\"Ce-Celebi, let me out! I-\" you lose your footing and fall face down on the slimy red mass. And you notice it dragging you extremely near the edge of the fairy's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi keeps licking you while moving you around in her mouth. In the meantime, one of her paws rubs her crotch. The human's taste, his screams, his struggles and his pleads for her mercy, all these things mix together, forming a huge wave of pleasure that expands within her, overwhelming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, she's not going to swallow. But, she decides, the human - no, <i>her</i> human - doesn't need to know that. His fear is the main part of this game of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggles and moans simultaneously escape the fairy's closed lips. She couldn't explain why it feels so good. It simply does. And she intends to enjoy every last bit of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA last, sharp moan coming from behind you marks the end of Celebi's game, though you're unaware of her activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour green host leans back, and lays her head against the trunk of the tree.<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"clgreen\">W-Wonderful...</span>\u2019 she thinks, unable to talk because of the little 'captive' in her mouth. She decides that you can surely endure another minute in her mouth while she recovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of her mouth, things stopped moving. Something you're grateful for. But you're still too near Celebi's throat, your legs already partially caught in the darkness below. You don't dare to move a muscle. One wrong movement, and you're going straight back in her stomach. Although that you're pretty sure that you're going there either way. Why would Celebi want to eat you again? Why did she say she loved you when she only considers you as food? Why-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no more time for questions. Lights pours inside the mouth as she opens it. The fairy digs her paw inside and gets a hold of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pulled back to the outside world, greeted by a full moon enlightening the sky. And, of course, by the face of a giant, time-traveling pokemon who just attempted to make a snack out of you again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Welcome back, little one~</span>\" she giggles, her free paw traveling to you, starting to wipe away the layer of drool covering your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep sigh.<br>\r\n\"Okay. Why?\" are the only two words you manage to say. The fairy laughs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Can't get enough of your taste~</span>\" she says. You decide to ignore her. You're just happy to be alive.<br>\r\n\"Where's Mew?\" you ask instead as the fairy floats off the tree and back to the clearing where her shrine is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess offers a shrug, suggesting that she has no clue about her friend's current location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">I'm closer that you might think,</span></i>\u2019 a familiar voice echoes in your mind. You turn to see the smiling face of a certain pink pokemon coming out of a nearby bush, paws full of fruit. A large amount of berries floats out as well, and is gently deposited on the grass.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hungry?</span>\" Mew playfully asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently eat your meal, which consists in a single berry - that, with your current size, isn't dinner. It's a feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the two legendaries are chatting merrily while they eat their own meal. Not understanding their speeches - which, judging by their laughs, are about nice stuff - you simply mind your own business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, you don't know how to feel about this day. About what you just went through. Celebi didn't eat you again, but she easily could. And that's the third time you visit her mouth in less than a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought is interrupted by a loud yawn. You look at the two, taking notice that all the berries are gone, while you're still finishing up yours. That only contributes to make you feel like a helpless bug, completely at the mercy of these two giantesses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're done eating, the two declare their intention to hit the hay. Mew helpfully translates for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reply, you notice two green paws getting a hold of you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bedtime, little one,</span>\" Celebi chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lay down, and you soon find yourself laying from the waist up on her belly, while your lower body slides past her pubic area and hangs a few inches from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">See you in the morning, Mew,</span>\" Celebi chimes.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">See you in the morning.</span>\" Mew replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy then turns you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Goodnight, you.</span>\" she says, leaning forward to plant a small peck on your head. You mumble something incomprehensible in response as she lays back down, one paw traveling to your back, pinning you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two are fast asleep. You, in the meantime, have some troubles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as you start to feel drowsy as well, it begins to dawn on you that this is the perfect opportunity to escape! After all, the two proved themselves unpredictable, you can't risk. You were almost eaten for the second time just one hour ago. Escaping seems really tempting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, on the other hand, Celebi and Mew are the only ones who offered their help so far. And escaping would mean giving up on their protection and face the forest and its critters. Alone. Plus, you wouldn't go too far at this size and the two would find you soon. And you're not sure how you're going to face an enraged Celebi, angered by your leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes, you do nothing but wonder what to do, wether to slip out of Celebi's grasp and leave while the two are asleep - and face the forest's dangers - or stay with them - and face whatever they've got in store for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain perfectly still (then again, you can't move too much because of the giant paw pinning you down), thinking and rethinking about your next decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, in the end, you pick what you think is the safest option...</span></div></div>",

Only then you dare to look. And your jaw shuts open at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide awake Celebi, fluttering there. Your gaze shifts on the surface you're laying on. You're still laying on Celebi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mind tries to process what is going on, the awake Celebi notices you awake and smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hi there.</span>\" you freeze, having heard someone talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rapidly look around, trying to spot whoever just spoke up. No one but the two Celebi and Mew. Though one Celebi and Mew are currently asleep, so that only leaves one alternative.<br>\r\n\"C-Celebi?\" you reluctantly ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your shock, the fairy nods, and gently moves the sleeping Celebi's arm off you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm sure you'd like answers,</span>\" she speaks perfectly, holding out a paw for you to climb on. How can this be? The Celebi you've known couldn't say nothing but her name since you met her!<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let's go for a walk.</span>\" the fairy says again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, er...\" you try to say something. In the past few minutes, the other Celebi, as you called her, brought you into the forest to talk... at least, you think she wants to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour suspicions soon fade as Celebi speaks:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">For starters, let me introduce myself. I am Celebi,<br>\r\nalright, but from another timeline. From an alternative timeline, as you may have guessed from my... talkativeness...</span>\" she says, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unaware of what she's talking about.<br>\r\n\"Alternative timeline?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yes. A timeline pretty similar to yours. Forgot that I'm a time traveler?</span>\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou vaguely blush.<br>\r\n\"So, why did you come here? I mean, if you're from an alternative timeline...\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Celebi suddenly stops laughing, and looks at you seriously.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Right. Listen, as I already told, my timeline is pretty similar to yours. That means I had 'my own' you,</span>\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drains from your face as one particular catches your attention.<br>\r\n\"H-Had?\" you ask. The blue eyed time traveler nods somewhat glumly.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">That's why I'm here. Just like the Celebi of this time,<br>\r\nI had you for the first day. We went to sleep, but the next morning...</span>\" her voice grows more and more sad as she talks, bringing her to the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to ask what happened, but she precedes you:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Y-You were gone.</span>\" she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spends the next minute crying silently, occasionally wiping tears away. You don't quite know how to comfort her. After all, you don't quite know what is going on, if this all a lucid dream or a lucid nightmare or if you're wide awake and Celebi is actually talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the grass type calms down a bit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">M-Me and Mew searched for your through the whole forest and outside of it. It was like you simply disappeared. I was worried sick about you. I thought you ran off because of what I did. I think both me and you know what I'm referring to,</span>\" she says. You nod, knowing she's referring to the fact she actually ate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sniffles a couple times.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">We kept searching and searching. Until, three days after your disappearing, Mew told me 'We should give up Celebi'. We... we cried for days, and we were sad for weeks...</span>\" she inhales deeply as she says the last phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But I didn't accept that. I didn't want to accept that.<br>\r\nI was going to have my little one back, no matter what. And so I traveled trough time... and here I am!</span>\" she says, smiling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her expression returns serious.<br>\r\n\"Uh... I...\" you try, but she places a finger over your mouth, silencing you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Now, I'm not here to bring you with me or something like that. I just want you to promise, to swear, that you're not going to leave the Celebi of this timeline. I... I beg you... cutie...</span>\" she pleads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to reply, but the sad sparkle in Celebi's blue eyes - along with the fact that you might just die out there - is enough to convince you.<br>\r\n\"I promise that I won't leave Celebi... er you... or Mew.\" you simply say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green giantess smiles, and places a small peck on your head. Suddenly, you notice, her body looses its normal green color.<br>\r\n\"Celebi... What's this?\" you ask. She smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It's the confirm of your promise. The timeline where... or when if you like... you left is being undone.</span>\" she explains.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll bring you back now,</span>\" she murmurs, floating into the forest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi float right back where the guardian of Ilex Forest of this timeline and Mew are still sleeping, unaware of what just happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Celebi gently places you back down on her counterpart.<br>\r\n\"What will happen to you now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't worry about it. Trust me, tomorrow you'll wake up and think of this like it all was a dream,</span>\" Celebi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then smiles at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'll return to my timeline now. Goodnight, you,</span>\" she then says, leaning down, placing a kiss on your forehead.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It was great to see you again cutie~</span>\" with these last words, Celebi glows green, and disappears in a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it dies down, you just lay there, dumbfounded about what just happened. The Celebi from an alternative timeline just came to tell you to not leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already knew that your chances of survival alone aren't exactly the best, so the least you could do was accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut everything, every word the other Celebi told you bounces back and forth within your head, leaving you incredulous of what happened tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, a time-traveling legendary pokemon shows up and talks to you, revealing you things from an alternative future. It is very hard to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big part of you wants to talk about it. And, you decide, maybe to should wake Celebi up, tell her about what happened while she slept peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you think, maybe you should keep this a secret. How would Celebi take it if you reveal her you wanted to leave? Sure, you could also not mention it, but she would find out anyway, judging by your tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you feel the urge to talk about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few moments to think, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

You're not sure of how Celebi would take it - or how she would take being awakened in the middle of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, sheepishly, you readjust your position on top of her, trying to get a few hours of shut-eye before going through another day as a shrunken human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out something between a deep sigh and a deep yawn. The events of the left you tired... and yet, you can't sleep. You just don't feel comfortable sleeping with a giant fairy who claimed you as hers. Sure, anyone would tell that you consented, but what other choice did you have? Either that or face the legendaries' wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if sensing your uneasiness, Celebi's arms lovingly wrap around you as she hugs you to her chest. A smile spreads on her face as she readjusts.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush with embarrassment... but you really can't deny that this actually feels very nice. The green skin of the fairy emanates a comforting warmth, and it's really smooth, while the beats of her heart provide a sweet, rhythmic lullaby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife surely changed a lot in the past hours... but you can tell that you could get used to this.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll give you that, Celebi: you make a wonderful bed.\" you mumble under your breath as you wiggle in her grasp, getting comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe, you lay your head on Celebi's chest, sighing loudly before closing your eyes. Soon enough, your consciousness fades away, replaced by sleep as your mind drifts off to a sweet, dreamless slumber...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun shines through Ilex Forest, enlightening the area around a certain shrine dedicated to the forest's patroness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid patroness is currently sleeping beneath a tall tree, her best friend Mew sleeping beside her while her little human is still caught in her long arms as she cuddles him to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was having great dreams. Maybe it was for the human's presence, or maybe because she was just excited about having what humans called a \u2018boyfriend\u2019, but her dreams are sure better than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, until fate decided to be cruel and let sunshine on her dark eyelids. Bothered by the sudden feeling, Celebi fidgets in her sleep as she tries to relegate her incoming consciousness in the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the resistance is for naught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a groan, the annoyed legendary gives out a yawn, before sitting up. Both her paws let go of whatever she was holding and they travel up to her eyes. While she rubs them, she feels a foreign weight dropping onto her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily, Celebi removes her paws from her eyes and shoots her lap a tired gaze, taking notice of a small human sleeping there, inches from her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patroness' eyes lit up as she remembers who the human is. Her precious little lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary's paws travel down to you as she gently gets a hold of you. The fairy brings you up to her face, whispering sweetly:<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Wake up, my little human,</span></u>\" the call goes completely unheard as you keep on sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Wake uuup~</span></u>\" Celebi repeats in a singsong voice that sadly doesn't manage to wake you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green fairy giggles.<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Someone's a sleepyhead... didn't know that~</span></u>\" she says to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the fairy brings you to her lips as she plants a kiss on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe action has the desired effect: your eyes shut open and a fiery shade of red appears on your cheeks as you find yourself face to lips with the fairy that 'caught' you yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid legendary pulls off, leaving you startled and blushing.<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, you're awake...</span></u>\" she sings cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the annoying language barrier, you can only assume what she just said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, good morning Celebi...\" you say, physically trying to rub the sleep out of your eyes.<br>\r\n\"What? Couldn't sleep?\" you then ask, still quite bothered by your early - forced - awakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy snickers<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Actually-</span></u>\" before she can say how you affected her dreams, she is interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Meeew...</span>\" both you and Celebi turn to see a familiar pink legendary rolling in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the fairy, noticing her with her eyes closed. A vague sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu comes to you as you watch her muttering some incomprehensible words:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi bi bi...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of last night flash across your mind. The talking Celebi from an alternative timeline, the heart-shattering tale she told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, you remain completely still, wondering what happened your future self after he ran from the two legendaries. Did he find help? Did he get back to his original size?... Did he even make it? Or did he-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted as something pokes your head. You look up, discovering a concerned looking Celebi staring down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Something wrong?</span></u>\" the fairy's voice fully snaps you back to reality.<br>\r\n\"Uh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi points at you, before tilting her head slightly, a clear sign of confusion.<br>\r\n\"Oh... I'm fine... just thinking...\" you say, quickly remembering to keep your mouth shut about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo change topic, you glance at Mew.<br>\r\n\"How long does she...?\" Celebi sighs.<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Let's just hope she's up by midday...</span></u>\" she mutters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, a small grin grows wide on her face.<br>\r\n\"<u><span class=\"clgreen\">Hey, it's just us two for now... why don't we play for a bit?</span></u>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Celebi, trying to decipher what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you struggle to understand, the green legendary sighs, before deciding express herself in body language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe points at you, then to herself, before eyeing you with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You wanna play?\" you assume. Celebi nods, shooting you an expectant look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause as you detect the problem. The giantess wants to play, you don't like her idea of 'fun'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could easily suggest some else to try and make her give up on whatever game she has planned... but, she DOES seem pretty eager. You fear that any attempt of refusal won't be accepted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What to do...?</i></span></div></div>",

Mine!</span>\" the pink giantess giggles loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring whatever she said, you shift your attention on a certain green pokemon that just flew closer, stopping in front of her friend.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hehehe, looks like you won, Mew. Like always,</span>\" Celebi laughs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And that makes two!</span>\" Mew chimes, recalling the first game she had with you earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiles before looking at the sun as well, only to discover that it's gone.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yep, it's official cutie, we cats win,</span>\" Celebi says, looking at you with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time traveler fairy then leans down, snatching you from Mew's paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Do you know what that means?</span>\" she cries, bringing you to her face. You can feel her purposely starting to breath heavily, her warm, mint-smelling breath blowing into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever she said, you don't like it one bit. You learned pretty  fast that Celebi using that mischievous voice is never a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, not for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate, you look back at Mew, silently asking for help. But she ignores you. In effect, Mew seems to be thinking about something as she has a paw over her mouth and her eyes staring at the now darkened sky intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mew?</span>\" Celebi calls out.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Mh?</span>\" Mew asks, snapped back to reality.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Me and this little guy here need a moment alone. Do you mind~?</span>\" Celebi chirps, sending shivers down your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Actually...</span>\" this word makes Celebi drop her smile, and makes you look back at the pink pokemon.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I was wondering... I did catch him... so wouldn't it be fair if I got the 'reward' after all?</span>\" Mew asks Celebi, a faint blush spreading across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come again?</span>\" the time traveler asks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yes... couldn't I... </span>\" Celebi looks at her friend with confusion.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">B-But...</span>\" <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Please?</span>\" Mew pleads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Celebi doesn't answer. She just floats there, trying to process what Mew just asked.<br>\r\n\"Uh... what is happening?\" you speak up, noticing the grass type's uneasiness. You've been silent, expecting her to want to... start with you right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Celebi and Mew just exchanged a few incomprehensible words. And now Celebi looks confused for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy looks at you, her beloved little one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is Mew planning to do with him...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi notices Mew floating closer and she shakes her head. She always could trust Mew, so she assumes that her friend hasn't any malicious intent towards the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Alright?</span>\" Celebi says, while holding you out.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">THANKS!</span>\" the pink legendary shouts happily, while picking you up from Celebi, closing you in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey... what...?\" you ask, taken aback by the sudden shift of position, from Celebi's open paws to Mew's tight hug. What the heck is happening? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Celebi is wondering the same thing.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What are you planning to do, Mew...?</span>\" she asks, worried. Mew giggles in response.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Relax, will you?</span>\" she cheers.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I won't steal this human from you... even if he's admittedly really cute...</span>\" she says. Celebi pouts at the last remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">No, I just want to get something to eat, and he's coming along, alright? No funny things!</span>\" Mew cheers again. Celebi stares at her friend for a moment, before nodding slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink legendary smiles, before turning to you, who are still staring at the two confused.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Hey, let's go get something to eat, me and you, alright?</span></i>\u2019 Mew telepathically asks, making her intentions clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Alright?\" you say, not really seeing anything bad with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling even brighter, Mew starts to fly off.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Later!</span>\" she cries before hovering into the forest that is Celebi's home, leaving said deity pokemon floating there, still dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she feels that she got far enough from her friend, Mew stops in the middle of the forest.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Hey,</span></i>\u2019 she says, slightly startling you.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">I know, we should be finding berries but... do me a favor...?</span></i>\u2019 she asks, her sapphire eyes sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What is it?\" you ask.</span></div></div>",

You look upwards, finding her bright blue eyes fixed on you, something between a warm smile and a wild grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she says. You gulp.<br>\r\n\"It's just you and me now,\" she lets out a giggle.<br>\r\n\"What. To. Do. First~?\" she sings excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring whatever Celebi just said, you focus on the excitement you heard in her voice. That can't be any good for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large, green paws wrapped tightly around your body start to move upwards, dragging you up to Celebi's face.

You look up.<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry. What I did to you is unforgivable. <i>I</i> am unforgivable.\" while you can't understand a word, you can definitely catch the sorrow in her voice. Is she apologizing to you for the events of last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming that she is, you stop shivering and look at her. She looks a lot less scary now, with her eyes closed, as if she's about to cry.<br>\r\n\"Uh... I forgive you...?\" you state, trying to sound calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi breaks her hug, and cups her paws beneath your legs, letting you sit on her palms.

And, without any warning, she lifts you up to her lips, smooching both your cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Cutie~\" she says, her voice returning to its cheerful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the massive blush on your cheeks, you caught yourself smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi continues.<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Today, I'll go easy on you.

Celebi gives you a brief break to let you catch your breath. You could notice a pink shade spread across her cheeks, though her blush was far less intense than yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've had enough of a break.\" she declares after a few moments, shoving you right into her lips yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to breath properly, you try to squirm out of her grip several times. But you have little success, as her paws are far too strong for your tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that struggling  isn't going to work, you stay still, enduring the barrage until the titaness pulls off. Not before giving you one last, long, wet smooch that almost pulls off your face along with her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before you could even inhale fresh air, Celebi's paws push you into her cheek.<br>\r\n\"Bi! Bi!\" she squeals as she nuzzles you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, she stops, bringing you back in front of her face. The blush on her face had widened, although not by much.<br>\r\n\"Bi~\" she chimes. Still burning bright red yourself, you give a deep sigh. This is going to be a <i>long</i> day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from Celebi's <i>relatively</i> harmless 'games', the day went on pretty uneventful. The warm sun of the day has been replaced by a full moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a dinner made out of berries, Celebi gives a small yawn.<br>\r\n\"Well, bedtime I guess.\" she mutters to herself. Her gaze travels down to you, who are sitting beside her.<br>\r\n\"Ready to go to sleep, <i>my</i> little one?\" she ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without waiting for an answer, she picks you up and lies down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding what the grass type giantess is up to, you start to struggle.<br>\r\n\"W-wait... I'll sleep on the ground...!\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggles.<br>\r\n\"Silly, the ground is hard and cold. I'll keep you warm. Why would you want to sleep on the ground anyway?\" that said, she gives a smile.<br>\r\n\"If you need anything, just wake me up,\" she says, letting a giggle escape her mouth.<br>\r\n\"And I do mean <i>anything</i>.\" while she says this, she slides a paw over her nether regions. You hurry to look elsewhere. You don't even <i><b>want</b></i> to know what her words meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi places you down on the dark green landscape of her belly. Her grassy skin is soft, and it carries a comforting warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's paws wrap around your form, closing you in a soft, yet firm, hug.<br>\r\n\"Sleep tight.\" you hear her indecipherable words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin five minutes, you hear the time traveler snoring softly, her belly rising up and falling down  along her breathing. From here, you can hear the noises coming from the inside of the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. There's no way you could possibly escape: Celebi is holding you in a solid hug, leaving you unable to even squirm. And you're too tired to even try to run anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving another sigh, you lie your head on the soft surface beneath you, trying to recollect the thoughts of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, Celebi hasn't shown any mischievous intention... or not <i>too</i> mischievous anyway. That left you feeling a bit more safe around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, you decide to catch some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, closing your eyes, you quickly fall asleep, tired out from the events of the day.</span></div></div>",

I bet it could tons of fun!\" you try, giving your best convincing smile. You are strongly hoping that she'd take your advice. You don't want to stay alone with Celebi just yet. Arceus knows what she could do with you, now that you are her actual other. Celebi stops her ascend and looks up at you with a weird expression. 'Why do you want to bring Mew along?' she thinks, annoyed by the fact that, if Mew accepts, goes her chance to remain alone with you. She then looks at her friend, she seems to be thinking, before giving smile \"Count me in!\" she beams. Celebi mentally groans. There goes her fun. But outside, she fakes her best smile. You meanwhile smile for real. Your plan worked! Mew accepted to come along! You sigh in relief as you grab one of Celebi's feelers; the grass type pokemon looks at you again 'Better for you to not have strange ideas cutie. Or else' she thinks, before flying off, Mew following close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of flying in between Kanto and Johto, you finally get back to Ilex Forest, aka your new home. Celebi stops to breath in the fresh air of the afternoon \"Home sweet home\" she says as you stop holding her feeler. You see that Celebi is heading to a wooden structure, that reveals to be a sanctuary. Her sanctuary. It was built by humans long time ago, when she first came here. From then on, Celebi was knows from humans as 'The voice of the forest'. Celebi smiles at her memories as she sits down on the wooden surface. Mew follows her and sits down as well. Celebi picks you from her head and sits you on her lap, before wrapping your body, except your head and legs, in her green, long arms. Your head is pressed against her soft, warm belly. You have to admit, this is pretty relaxing. Maybe this was not the wrong choice, you could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of staying like this, the two pokemon break the silence simultaneously...</span></div></div>",

You, who are still plucked in a hug to her belly, feel the shaking sensation from behind you. It's so loud that it threatens to break your eardrums. You can't understand what the two pokemon are saying, but for sure you can tell that Celebi is hungry. Your only hope is that she doesn't considers you as food again. She wouldn't est her actual boyfriend, right? The grass type pokemon seems to feel your fear and giggles, poking you with a hand \"That ugly monster scared you little one? You poor thing\" she says between giggles,  making Mew giggle as well \"What kind of beast lives in there girl?\" she playfully asks, with the only effect of making Celebi giggle harder. After a good two minutes, they finally stop laughing  \"Now, the thing to settle: who will go get food?\" Mew asks.

The time travel pokemon grins, while Mew lowers herself to talk to you \"Hey there. Listen, I'm going to get something to eat. Since we can't risk leaving you alone, Celebi will look after you, since she's your... how do you humans call that?\" \"Girlfriend?\" you ask \"Yeah, that. Later\" she says, lifting herself from the sanctuary \"Wait!\" you shout. You don't want to remain alone with Celebi. Surely enough, she was waiting for this to happen \"Bye\" Mew giggles, before disappearing through the forest. You groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi watches her friend leave, before giving a smile. Finally, she's alone with you. And nobody to disturb the both of you. She turns her attention to you. You sigh defeated as you sit back down on the grass - type pokemon's lap. But just after you sit down, Celebi's arms reach for you. Enclosing you in her three - fingered hands, she brings you to her face. She stares at you with those big baby blue eyes, a sweet smile on her face. She is absolutely gigantic to you, her mouth is about the lenght of your small body, her eyes are like two titanic mirrors. Her feelers are like trees to you. She could end your life with a single move, and you know that. You just hope that she really loves you, at least to spare your puny life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stares at you in her hands for a bit, deciding what to do with you. The tiny human doesn't move, he just stares at her silently, maybe wondering what she has in his for him. Her smile widens. This little guy 'trapped' in her hands was sure the cutest thing she has ever seen in her whole life. And she lived for ages. Noticing she is moving you closer to her mouth, you close your eyes, waiting, with great fear, for her to do anything. In fact, not even a second later, you feel a pair of lips being pressed on your cheek *smooch* Celebi kisses you. You open your eyes, finding the green giantess staring at you smiling, a faint blush on her face. She stares at you for a little bit, before...</span></div></div>",

Celebi stares at it curiously. Out of its hiding place comes a black creature, with long arms and legs, bloody red claws and a red and black mane. Two blue eyes shine, seeming to stare into your very soul. A Zoroark. It roars at your sight, a roar that you recognize as pure hunger. This pokemon was hunting for food, and surely enough, it believes that you'll make a more-than-good snack. It doesn't even bother thinking how a human could be so small, it's just too hungry right now. Celebi's expression shifts from an amused one to a angry one. Putting you down on the sanctuary, she lifts herself from the wooden structure \"Stay where you are. Don't move\" she says. Of course, you can't understand her, so you can just watch as the Zoroark roars once again and charges Celebi. The grass type prepares to hit, but the Zoroark suddenly disappears from her sigh. Celebi stares confused at the void. She knows that Zoroark is a pokemon that is capable to give illusions to its foes, so she has to be careful. Celebi flies back to the sanctuary and gets in front of you, shielding you with her body. She's not going to let that beast to hurt you, no matter what. She's too focused on what is on front of her, that she doesn't notice a red claw appearing out of nowhere behind her. Zoroark fully reveals itself and strikes Celebi with nigh slash, knocking her to the ground. Celebi can't move, a big slash mark on her back. She desperately tries to get up, but she can't. She yells in pain as the fox pokemon approaches you. You cower in fear as its black paw reaches for you.

You cover your ears and tremble as the Zoroark holds you close to her chest, swallowing hard before licking her chops. From your position you can see what appears to be blood dripping down her chin, which was strange because aside from two discomforted eardrums you were feeling quite alright. Even stranger is what happened next - The wall of fur you were being held by and up to tensed and began to change appearance, everything moving very quickly as you were carried far away from the screaming legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you come to a stop as your hostess dispels her illusion and holds you up to her massive face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human,\" she says, mostly to herself as you cannot understand her. You had a pretty good idea of what her intentions were, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now... Don't do anything hasty,\" you stammer in an attempt to calm down after the tumultuous trip, \"I'm not food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans aren't food,\" Zoroark states bluntly while examining you closer, \"Humans make stuff. Including food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious! If you eat me, I'll grow back to my original size and burst you open from inside!\" you insist as the giant fox suddenly flips her hand over, catching you between the tip of her two spiky fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans aren't the only ones who are tricky though,\" she mutters before raising her voice in an attempt to make herself understood, \"Listen.

This wish gained further ground as the giant Zoroark opened up her mouth and showed off her fangs, surprisingly enough gleaming white instead of dripping with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait! Stop!\" you shout in desperation as you try to tug your leg free, knowing from experiences that your chances in the wind were far better tahn your chances on a tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll it be, then?\" she continues while making sure to keep her mouth open between each syllable, \"Slave or food?\"</span></div></div>",

But the Zoroark has very little patience \"Pick one already human! Either a slave or food!\" she shouts, her teeth shining as she says the last word. You really don't want to pass through another pokemon's digestive system, so you force yourself to talk \"P- please! I'll do anything, j-just don't eat me!\" you shout out of fear. Zoroark's eyes widen, a smirk appearing on her face \"Very well, human, good choice\" she says, moving you towards her mane \"What are you-\" you can't finish that the fox buries you in her mane \"Better for you to hang on for dear life human\" she says, starting to walk away. You obey and grasp her fur as tight as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew is getting back to the sanctuary, with a large amount of berries in her paws - and a larger amount floating behind her- 'Who knows what did  those two do while I wasn't with them' she thinks giggling, when she hears something. Crying? Is someone crying? Curious to find out who's crying, Mew makes her way to Celebi's sanctuary. And what she sees makes her drop all the berries she's carrying. There on the ground is Celebi, crying desperately. A big slash mark is on her back, tears are pouring down her cheeks, her whole face is literally standing in a small lake of tears. Without losing any time, Mew rushes to her \"Celebi! What happened here?! How did you got hurt? Where is your-\" Celebi looks up, her eyes full of suffering. Painfully, the time travel pokemon stands up, sniffles a few times, before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't see anything due the fur covering your view, but you can tell that Zoroark is moving from the constant shaking. Suddenly the movement stops. And three red claws reach for you in the thick strands of fur. Grasping you tightly, they bring you face to face with the Zoroark again. You look around, she brought you to a cave \"Welcome home slave!\" the dark pokemon says \"Now, you begin your work. For starters, I had this itch on my back for a while, so you have to solve my problem\" she says, laying down on her belly. Reclutantly, you get on her back and start scratching through her fur \"Oh yeah, that's the spot... mhhmmmhhh\" Zoroark moans \"Keep up the good work slave\". It's a rather humiliating job, but you have to do it if you want to stay alive. You keep scratching her back, Zoroark moaning the whole time, when suddenly \"Hey Human\" she calls out \"W-what?\" you ask \"Answer. How did you manage to summon the legendary Celebi? She already barely shows up to pokemon, why show up to a shrunken human?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A-a Zoroark came out of nowhere, it attacked us and it-it-it ate my poor little guy!\" Celebi explains, bursting back into tears as she says the last part. Mew takes in all the facts, feeling sad and angry at the same time. She then focuses, maybe you are somehow still alive. She can't have her friend suffering, and she doesn't want you to die either. She's just making friends with you right now, why does they have to lose you? It's simply not fair. Focusing on the various auras of this forest, she tries to find yours. After a few moments, she spots an aura. A weak one, right next to a stronger one. Gotcha! \"Celebi! He's still alive!\" Mew shouts. Celebi looks at her, her eyes still watering \"How can you say?\" she asks \"I feel his aura. Focus, and you'll feel him as well!\" Mew explains. Celebi sniffles before focusing. Mew is right, she feels you. You're alive! Shouting in joy, that green pokemon floats into the air \"He's alive! He's alive!\" she shouts \"Yeah, but we still don't know where are they\" Mew says \"Trust me, I perfectly know where they are. I know this forest inch by inch\" Celebi says, starting to fly off. Mew looks at her confused, before flying behind her 'Don't worry my little guy' Celebi thinks 'I'm gonna bring you back to me, be it the last thing I do'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell the Zoroark your story, about how you woke up one day shrunken, and of how Celebi found you and became your girlfriend. Still, you aren't comfortable with using that word, you are still considering running away. You shake the thought off, Celebi and Mew would find you, and Mew would probably beat you up. And right now, you couldn't escape even if you wanted. This Zoroark is keeping you under surveillance \"So you're saying that Celebi feel for you and became your lover? And should I believe that?\" she asks \"Believe me or not, that's the truth\" you say \"Hmpm. Whatever you say human. Now, good job with the back\" the dark fox says, removing you from her back and placing you roughly on the ground, before standing up \"Now, time to rub my paws\" she says, sitting down, her paws right in front of you. The smell isn't bad, but it isn't good either. You sigh deeply.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You rest for a bit, sitting on the black, clawed paw, while Zoroark stares at you for some reason. She lets you rest for another minute, before declaring<br>\r\n\"Come on human, time to get back to work, you rested long enough.\" saying those words, Zoroark places you down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the dark fox lies belly down, arms crossed beneath her muzzle.<br>\r\n\"Climb on.\" she orders, extending one of her paws in front of you. You do as instructed and climb on the black, furry surface as she moves you on her mane. <br>\r\n\"Now, please me.\" she orders, her paw retreating to her muzzle. She talks again.<br>\r\n\"You have ten minutes, little one. Let's see what you can do.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub the back of your head. How the heck are you supposed to please her now?! Not really knowing what to do, you kneel down and start petting the bloody red fur of Zoroark's mane. Which seems to work as she lets out a pleased sigh.<br>\r\n\"That's good, keep going.\" she says, her eyes disappearing behind her eyelids. You sigh as you continue your work. This day doesn't seem to be getting any better. You just hope luck would turn to your side at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in the forest, two certain mythical pokemon are flying around rather fast, trying to spot the dark fox that took Celebi's little human.<br>\r\n\"I thought you knew where they were Celebi.\" Mew suddenly says. Celebi blushes. Telling the truth, she thought she knew where her newly found love and his host were, but the cave where she and Mew have been turned out to be the wrong place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, feeling auras isn't my thing! And I really don't understand how little guy is alive. That Zoroark ripped him in two. I saw it. I saw the blood. I...\" Celebi stops to bring her paws to her eyes, a couple tears falling down her cheeks. She can't bear to think about that scene again. It makes her suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding her friend's pain, Mew hugs her.<br>\r\n\"It didn't happen for real, I bet it was just an illusion. That's why I can feel little guy, because he's alive. And we'll find him, no matter what.\" she says calmly, comforting Celebi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass type sniffles, before nodding, a small smile forming on her lips.<br>\r\n\"You're right, we'll find him.\" she agrees with Mew, who smiles brightly.<br>\r\n\"Ready then?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Of course, let's go! ... But, you lead the way this time...\" Celebi says. Mew laughs as she start resumes flying, Celebi following close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grawr... Good job, human. Really. Keep up like this, and I might just reward you later.\" the dark fox growls in pleasure from beneath you. At least, your petting is pleasing her. \u2018Just what's wrong with this day?\u2019 you think, annoyed. Just two days ago you were a normal person, and now you're first bug-sized snack for a legendary pokemon, then a bug-sized pleasure slave for a Zoroark. How did you even got into this mess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub until your arms get sore, in which point you stop petting.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" comes the immediate protest from Zoroark.<br>\r\n\"Keep going, you lazy human!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n\"But my arms hurt!\" you retort.<br>\r\n\"Whoever said you have to use your arms? Show me your loyalty, go further!\" she growls. You groan. What can you do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacking good ideas, you simply decide to rub your whole body against Zoroark's fur, trying to please her.<br>\r\n\"Better.\" she says, relaxing again as you throw yourself against the black landscape. <br>\r\n\u2018Will this day come to an end?\u2019 you ask yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think they're in there.\" a certain pink, legendary pokemon says, stopping her flight a few meters from a well hidden cave. Celebi stops a little further from Mew, and peeks into the cavern. Her paws travel to her mouth as she keeps herself from gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Mew asks, her voice reducing to a whisper.<br>\r\n\"I saw my little guy on top of that Zoroark... he's rubbing himself on her!\" Celebi exclaims silently.<br>\r\n\"That's... not so bad...?\" Mew says, confused. Celebi facepalms.<br>\r\n\"Mew,\" she begins.<br>\r\n\"She's using him like a slave.\" she reveals to her confused friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew's eyes widen.<br>\r\n\"Then, let's get in there and rescue little guy!\" she states.<br>\r\n\"It's not so simple. Zoroarks are tricky. They can create illusions. We need a plan.\" Celebi says.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Mew agrees.<br>\r\n\"But what should we do?\" <br>\r\n\"I've got an idea...\" Celebi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up, small one!\" Zoroark says. You stop as her paw comes to pick you while she sits upright. She says you<br>\r\n\"Not bad, not bad at all.\" a compliment. That's good.<br>\r\n\"I wonder if you are good for other things too...\" you don't like that phrase. Nor the grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a noise is heard. Rustling. And it comes from outside the cave.<br>\r\n\"Stay here, human.\" Zoroark orders, placing you down, before getting up, walking towards the entrance of the cavern. She looks around, unaware of the invisible presence sneaking into the cave...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew carefully slides next to Zoroark. That is a delicate part of the plan. Using her ability to become invisible, she sneaks into the cave, while Celebi, hidden on the high trees of Ilex Forest, makes noise. And, as expected, Zoroark came out to check the source of the noise. Great. Slowly, Mew nears herself to the tiny human on the ground as she carefully picks him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you are picked up by an invisible grasp. You try to talk, but something is pressed on your lips as Mew becomes visible, her paw keeping you silent. Your heart seems to melt in relief. Finally rescued. Mew carefully moves you or her head and waits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" an alerted and irritated voice shouts from behind her. Mew doesn't even turn around as Zoroark is hit by an attack coming from upwards, which is strong enough to send her face down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew turns to face the dark vixen and flies over her, striking her with her tail, which is far more stronger than her stubby paws. That was totally unnecessary, but after kidnapping this new buddy of hers, this Zoroark deserved a few hits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen grunts as she stands back up, facing Mew angrily. And then, Celebi comes down from the protection of the trees. Zoroark quickly understands the situation. These two legendaries surely came to take back her slave and, judging from his tale, Celebi has a pretty good reason to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly calculating her chances of victory, Zoroark comes up that her best choice is to retreat. For now. And, before the two legendaries can attack again, she uses her signature night daze, momentarily blinding the two and disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Where did she go?\" Mew exclaims, recovering from the hit.<br>\r\n\"She disappeared!\" Celebi replies.<br>\r\n\"Should we search for her?\" the psychic type asks.<br>\r\n\"No. For now, let's focus on important things.\" the time traveler says, snatching the tiny human from Mew's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquealing, Celebi shoves you into her chest as she hugs you. You hug right back. If there was a moment in this day you were glad to see Celebi, it would probably be this.<br>\r\n\"Aw!\" Mew cheers from behind both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't even imagine how worried I was. I thought...\" Celebi stops in mid sentence to shake off the thought, before planting a kiss on your cheek. Even though you aren't able to understand her, you get that she's happy to see you.<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go back home. You've got a lot to tell me, cutie.\" she then says, starting to float away, you safely held in her arms, Mew following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next hour eating berries that Mew gathered for lunch earlier, while telling what you had to do in that cave. Then, after declaring you're stuffed, you wait for both pokemon to finish their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a satisfied sigh, Celebi picks you and places a paw on your stomach.<br>\r\n\"You've got a filled tummy there. Are you tired?\" she asks. You blink a few times, which, in universal body language, means \u2018uh?\u2019. Celebi looks at Mew, who rolls her sapphire eyes.<br>\r\n\"Tired?\" she asks you. You nod, yawning again in confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two quietly make their way under a huge oak tree, which shields the three of you from the afternoon sun. Celebi lies you on her smooth belly, her paws wrapping around you like a grass blanket. Giving a third yawn, you decide to rest for a bit. And, soon, you pass out from relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up several hours later. You notice the sun has disappeared, and the sky is starting to turn dark.<br>\r\n\"Finally awake, sleepyhead?\" someone chirps from upwards. You look up to see a certain green pokemon staring down at you with a smile.<br>\r\n\"You took your time, buddy,\" Mew says with telepathy.<br>\r\n\"We almost thought you were fainted!\" she giggles. Celebi rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the successive hours chatting with the two... if a mix of incomprehensible words translated by Mew can be called 'chatting'. Yet, Mew didn't talk about the 'things' she talked about this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the two gather more berries to eat. You aren't really hungry, but, to avoid upsetting Celebi, you force yourself to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you're done eating, the moon fully rose up in the sky. After a while, the two legendaries declare that it's bedtime. Celebi picks you and lies you on her green belly again.<br>\r\n\"Do I really have to sleep here?\" you ask as she encloses you in a hug.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush. That's the comfiest place in all Ilex Forest!\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to simply do as she wants, you lie your head on the soft, grassy skin. <br>\r\n\"Good night you two. See you in the morning.\" Mew says, closing her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Good night, Mew.\" Celebi says, before turning to you. She says you the same thing.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, my little guy.\" she says, ending the sentence with a peck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing furiously, you close your eyes, soon falling into a deep slumber...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are soundly asleep on Celebi's belly, her paws still firmly wrapped around you, keeping you still. Too bad that, far away in dreamland, you don't notice a big, slim figure sneaking its way to the shrine on the nearby trees...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping on yet another tree branch, a certain dark type vixen stops and looks downwards, in direction of the shrine dedicated to Celebi, where the forest's guardian herself, the other legendary and the tiny human are sleeping. Zoroark smirks. That will just aid her with her plan. With these thoughts, Zoroark proceeds with her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still sleeping when you feel the grip on you fading for an instant, before a new one replaces it and lifts you. You open your eyes a little. You notice Celebi staring right down at you with a smile. Too tired to discuss of the reasons of her sudden awakening, you close your eyes back up, instantly falling asleep again, your head dropping into the grass type's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, she starts carrying you away, leaving you unaware that the real Celebi is still snoring beneath the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her sleeping 'captive' held in her illusionary, green paws, Zoroark, who has taken Celebi's semblances, makes her way to a distant, well hidden clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, \u2018Celebi\u2019 quietly sits near a tree and releases you on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Sleep human, you'll have to work again tomorrow.\" the dark fox whispers, laying on a side, not dropping her illusion. If the human wakes up and notices the trick, he'd run away while she sleeps. Zoroark closes her eyes, and, slowly, the dark type starts snoozing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back to the shrine, Celebi keeps on sleeping, unaware that her little one had disappeared. At least, until her paw moves in her sleep, trying to hug you. And, as result, she ends grasping her own skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Celebi's black eyelids open up. Instinctively, she looks over her belly, where her little guy is supposed to be sleeping.<br>\r\n\"Bi?\" the grass type asks herself upon noticing that her tiny human is no longer there. Both her paws rush to her mouth, keeping her from screaming. Her little one is gone. Alone. In a huge forest full of predators. Alone. In the middle of the night. Alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly glancing at Mew, Celebi notices her heavily asleep. Like always. Not even giga impact would wake Mew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the grass type gets up and starts floating in midair, silently venturing into the depths of Ilex Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flies for an hour or so before finally passing through a literal wall of plants, arriving to a small clearing. And what she sees hits her. Laying there, sleeping, is another Celebi. A counterpart from another timeline? What is she doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily forgetting about you, Celebi flies over the other Celebi to touch her. But, as her paw gets near, the green figure disappears for a moment, before returning. But it was enough for Celebi to realize the truth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bi!\" she exclaims, waking both you and Zoroark. The dark type looks at the forest's deity pokemon, and so do you. Specifically, you're looking at both.<br>\r\n\"Celebi... and Celebi? Time travel?\" you ask them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi turns to you, shaking her head frenetically. She then points to Zoroark, then to herself, and shakes her head again.<br>\r\n\"That's... not a Celebi?\" you try, surprisingly getting a nod from the grass type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoroark, who was being silent until now, gets up as we and imitates Celebi's movements. The two pokemon start arguing. You soon get sick of this situation.<br>\r\n\"Stop!!\" you yell. The two instantly go silent and look at you.<br>\r\n\"Just prove me who's the real Celebi already!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gives a smile. She practically already won. She starts glowing green, the plants around glowing of the same color, as many flowers start blooming around filling the nearby trees and bushes. That's something only she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind puts two and two together.<br>\r\n\"... Zoroark?\" you ask as the dark type drops her illusion with a growl.<br>\r\n\"It's not over yet.\" she says, using night daze, disappearing like she did earlier. When you regain sight, you find yourself firmly wrapped in Celebi's hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the grass type makes her way back to the shrine, where Mew is still sleeping, like nothing had happened. Celebi sits down at the feet of the shrine. And she notices you pondering something. She pokes you with her paw. You look up to her. She's staring down at you with a curious smile.<br>\r\n\"You want to know what I'm thinking about?\" she nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath.<br>\r\n\"I just don't know, Celebi...\" you start with a sorrowful voice.<br>\r\n\"... About the love thing, I mean. I'm not even a pokemon, how can this work? We can't even communicate...\" Celebi's smiles fades to a serious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue.<br>\r\n\"...I'm so vulnerable at this size, that Zoroark already took me twice and, just yesterday, you at-\" she presses her paw on your mouth, stopping you from talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removes her paw, before pointing to you, then to the forest. Then, she cocks her head.<br>\r\n\"You want to know if I want to run?\" she nods.<br>\r\n\"I don't know... I like being around you and Mew, i really do, but I'd also like returning home...\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Celebi points to herself, then to Mew, then to you, before hugging you.<br>\r\n\"You're saying youand Mew will protect me from that Zoroark?\" you ask. She nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she points to you, then to her mouth, before shaking her head.<br>\r\n\"You won't eat me anymore?\" you ask. She nods again, before extending her open, free paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly hits you. She wants you to forgive her for eating you. Slowly, you place your minuscule hand in her tree sized paw. As slowly as you, her paw closes around it. Celebi smiles as she pulls you into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, dawn's first lights enlighten the place. You both stay silent, your mind thinking about what to do and, judging from her look, hers is doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so focused that you don't notice a certain pink kitten starting to stir.<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Gold morning you two</i>.\u201d she greets cheerfully. You reply with a simple nod of your head, but Celebi looks at her.<br>\r\n\"Mew,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I need your help.\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, you are settled on the ground, while the two legendaries sit down in front of you.<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Little guy, Celebi wants to talk, I'll translate for you</i>.\u201d Mew says telepathically. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi starts talking, while Mew translates word by word.<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Little guy, if you want to return to your home it's perfectly fine with me. But, we're going to bring you there. And we'll stay with you there. I don't want to get separated from you. I need you. You can pick wether if you want to return home or stay here.</i>\u201d Mew translates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Celebi? You want to stick with me if I pick to go home?\" she nods. You turn to Mew.<br>\r\n\"What about you, Mew? You're really willing to follow me home if I want to go there?\" she nods as well.<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I'm with my best friends, why not?</i>\u201d she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they both look at you seriously. And you get that the moment has came for you to choose, wether you want to get home or stay in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big part of you wants to return home... even though the two legendaries intend to stay there with you. But another, smaller part wants to stay in the forest. What would your parents say if you return home with at the size of one inch tall, with two pokemon that are supposed to be a myth, and with one of them being your actual 'girlfriend'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, you take a decision...</span></div></div>",

Zoroark looks right at you as soon the sound ends. You stare at her, your eyes filled with mortal fear. With a smirk, Zoroark moves you closer to her mouth and opens it up. She dangles you over it. You close your eyes as Zoroark drops you. You expect to fall in the dark abyss of her mouth, but you are wrong. Instead, you fall on a soft surface and you hear the dark fox laughing hysterically. You slowly open your eyes and notice you are on Zoroark's hand \"You should have seen your face!\" she laughs. Pale and shaking you sit down on her hand, panting. Your whole life passed right before your eyes. Zoroark finally stops laughing \"I already told you slave, I won't eat you as long you keep doing things for me. And if you ever protest...\" she shuts her fangs closed, making sure to show her sharp teeth to you \"Am I clear?\" you nod vigorously as the Zoroark smirks \"Now that's settled, my stomach is still asking for food, so it's hunting time. Consider your work done for now\" she says. A thought crosses you mind \"M-maybe... leave me here?\" you attempt. If this fox goes hunt and leaves you here, you could have a chance to escape! But... what if Celebi and Mew find you? Well, that wouldn't be as bad as this. But, to your misfortune... \"Do you think I'm that dumb slave? If I leave you alone, you'll run away. And, to show you just how dumb this was, what if a pokemon came here in my absence and ate you? Nope, the only one who'll eat you will be me if you keep trying to escape me. So you're coming with me\" Zoroark says. You stare at her, your jaw wide open. This fox is smarter than you! Well, you at least had to try. Clenching you in her grasp, Zoroark makes her way out of the cave. Once outside, she makes a great jump and lands on a tree branch \"I'll need my hands free to hunt so..\" she says putting you in her mane. Like last time, you hang on for dear life as Zoroark jumps from branch to branch, each jump threatening to make you lose your balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long passes that Zoroark spots her prey. An Ursaring. And a pretty chubby one too. She just hit the jackpot today. A slave and a hearty meal. It appears that the Ursaring is resting, sitting with its back against a tree. Silently making her way down, Zoroark lands behind the tree. She then hides in a bush and starts moving. The Ursaring notices the bushes rustling behind it and goes check what's making this noise. Meanwhile Zoroark is in the bushes right in front of him. Making sure that it's nothing, the Ursaring returns to its resting place, but Zoroark starts moving, making noise. As expected, the bear pokemon goes check once again, but as it gets closer the bush, Zoroark strikes him with her claws, piercing him and killing him on the hit. The Ursaring is dead before even crashing to the ground. Zoroark retreats her claws and comes out. Shaking the blood off her sharp fingers, she grabs the Ursaring by the legs and makes her way to her cave.</span></div></div>",

One is light and dark green colored, the other is totally pink. Celebi and Mew,  looking down, studying the fox, trying to come up with a plan to get her. Celebi wants revenge for getting you away from her. Whoever tries to steal you from her is unforgivable. Mew just wants to help her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pokemon wait for Zoroark to be completely beneath them \"Now?\" Mew looks up \"Now\" Celebi replies. Turning invisible, the two pokemon fly down the tree. Zoroark jeeps dragging the chubby, dead bear, stopping to wipe some sweat from her face \"Man, this Ursaring is too fat!\" she exclaims. In her mane, you are living pure hell. It's hot in here and Zoroark is sweating, making her fur slick. You have to hold on with all your might to not fall to your very probably death. Every step that the fox makes threatens to make you lose your grasp, each time your heart ends up skipping a beat. Suddenly, you hear Zoroark's scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoroark looks around her. Something just hit her in the stomach. Weird, nobody is here. Suddenly, another attack hits her in the side. Yelling in pain, she starts to look around frantically \"Who's there!? Come out if you have the guts!\" she yells. Just as she says this, she's tackled down, Celebi and Mew come into view. Celebi holds her down, a glare in her eyes \"We'll ask just once. Where is MY little guy?\" she asks in an angry yet incredibly calm tone \"Hmhp! Not telling you!\" Zoroark retorts, trying to slip aways, but the two pokemon are too strong for her \"If you don't tell me right now, death will be the last of your problems\" Celebi says. She always and still does hate threatening others as she is known as one of the kindest legendaries. But now, the life of her tiny guy is threatened, and she will do everything she can to get you back to her. Zoroark snorts and looks away. Groaning, Celebi glows green \"You asked for it\" she says, firing leaf storm. Zoroark is hit badly. Mew, who was being silent the whole time, uses aura sphere. Hit by a fighting, and so super effective move, she falls down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon Zoroark crashes to the ground, you lose your grip. Sighing, you sit down in her fur, relieved that you don't have to hang on anymore, when \"Bi cele bi!\". Celebi is here? Maybe she's searching you! Slowly, you stand up and poke your head out of the dark fox's mane. Mew and Celebi come into view \"Celebi?\" you call out. As soon she hears your voice, the grass legendary stops glaring and looks in your direction. The biggest smile she has ever has spreads all over her face as she reaches down for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing you in a tight grasp, Celebi brings you to her chest and closes your body in a hug \"Little guy! Are you alright? I missed you so much! But now you're back with me, and I'm not letting you go ever again. In fact, you will never go anywhere without me from now on!\" Celebi says, almost about to cry from joy. Though you can't understand a single word, to get that she's euphoric to have you back. Smiling a little, you hug her back, relieved that this nightmare is over \"Awwww, aren't you two so precious\" Mew giggles, while flying to hug the both of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoroark stares at the scene, disgusted. How could a pokemon, and plus a legendary one, fall for a human? That's just impossible. Snorting, Zoroark closes her eyes. She had been beaten enough. She has to rest \"Be sure that I'll have my revenge slave\" she whispers before fainting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pokemon squeeze you in their hug for about two minutes before Mew pulls off; Celebi softens her grip on you. She does kiss your cheek though. Rubbing the back of your head, you turn to Mew \"Um, what now?\" you ask \"Oh right. Well, I think it's time for lunch\" she says \"Come on Celebi, a big bunch of berries is waiting for us!\" Mew exclaims excitedly. Celebi's stomach growls at 'berries', sending shivers down your back. Mew giggles \"Come on!\" .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of flying, you reach the sanctuary. You notice multiple Rattata's and Weedle's fainted on the ground, a lot of berries near them. Celebi looks at  Mew \"Oh right, I forgot. I put a barrier on the berries, I didn't want to lose lunch!\" Mew giggles. Celebi giggles as well. They both sit down and pick the berries with psychic, levitating them closer. Setting three berries in front of you and the rest in front of them, they start to eat \"Isn't this a lot to me?\" you ask \"We have to celebrate out love and reunion!\" Celebi says with her mouth full \"She says you have to celebrate your love and reunion\" Mew explains. You blush and start to eat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating more than she has never ate before, Celebi lies down \"That was great! Right little one?\" she asks. You are literally about to blow up. You ate too much. Celebi snatches you from the ground and lies you on her belly, you listen to the food being digested in there, glad that you aren't part of it again. Mew lies down next to Celebi \"You ate a lot! When was last time you actually had a meal?\" she asks. Celebi looks at her \"Can you keep a secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that you actually ATE your boyfriend and then you used Time Travel to bring him back?\" Mew asks. Celebi nods \"Please don't think of me as a monster\" she says \"I don't\" Mew replies \"Really?\" \"Celebi, I understand that what you have done was a only chance in life, and I understand that you felt sorry for that. So no problem\" Mew says. Celebi smiles \"Thanks a lot Mew. You are a true friend\" she says. Mew blushes, though it's hard to notice \"Don't even say that. However, I want to know something.\" \"What?\" \"Is he tasty?\" she asks \"Yeah, he is really tasty, I couldn't believe it last night\" Celebi admits \"If that's so... could I try?\" Mew asks \"What?!\" \"Without swallowing of course, I just want to taste him\". Celebi thinks for a few moments \"You won't swallow?\" she asks \"Promise\" \"If you say so, alright then...\" Celebi says, reclutantly handing you to Mew. You stare into her blue eyes for a second \"Uhhhhh, what now?\" you ask \"Don't worry\" she says in your head. Before you can ask what she means, she drops you in her mouth \"Ahhhh... Mew let me out please!!!\" you yell \"You're right, he's tasty!\" Mew beams to Celebi. The grass pokemon smiles, but in her mind she's praying Arceus that Mew won't actually swallow you by accident. Mew sloshes you in her mouth for a bit, before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mew keeps sloshing you in her mouth, a sweating Celebi staring at her. You are moved back and forth into the cavernous mouth, the huge red muscle that is Mew's tongue gets you near her throat \"Mew! Don't do this please!!!\" you scream in horror. Too bad that Mew is in ecstasy right now, so she can't hear you. Your taste is incredible! Mew has never eat a human in her life, but your taste is absolutely delicious! No wonder that Celebi ate you last night. Mew is so lost in her thoughts that she doesn't notice that you are dangerously close to her throat. You close your eyes, waiting for the inevitable. Which obviously happens *Gulp* Mew swallows you. You fall in the tight yet soft tube of her esophagus, the walls squeezing you from head to toe. Mew licks her lips satisfied \"Man, was he tasty!\" she exclaims. Celebi's stare goes from a worried one to a horrified one \"W-wait 'was'? W-what do you mean?\" she asks, praying Arceus that she didn't swallowed her little guy \"Oh, I swallowed him\" Mew says, just noticing what she just said. She assumes her best worried expression \"Oops\" she says. Celebi stares at her, a mix of worry and anger in her eyes. The only things that keeps her from fainting is probably the hug worry for you. She doesn't know what to think. Right now her mind is yelling her to hit Mew hard until she spits you out. But Celebi doesn't. The only thing she does is drop to the ground and cry, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are dropped in a large, fleshy chamber thst Mew's stomach. You land in a pool of acid. Since you were in Celebi's stomach just last night, you perfectly know what happens if you don't get out of here fast. So you start struggling, trying to get a hold to one of the slippery walls \"Mew! Let me out!\" you yell at top of your lungs, while desperately trying to climb the walls of the stomach. But every progress you make, you just end slipping and falling back into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew stares at Celebi, sadly. She always hated to see her best friend sad, but now she isn't sad - she is desperate. Her blue eyes got red and puffy from all the crying she had been doing, tears are pouring down her cheeks \"My little guy! My innocent, poor little guy is gone!\" she cries. Mew flies next to her \"Celebi calm down\" she says, but Celebi ignores her. The sadness from losing you overwhelms her, she can't help but cry. She wants to scream, she wants to hurt Mew. But she can't do none of that. Even though Mew ate her boyfriend, Celebi would never hurt her, not at any cost at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew feels struggling in her belly and assumes her tiny friend is trying to get out, without making any results. She has to admit, she's starting to worry about you as well. But she can't help it. She has a very careless nature, it's not her fault. But she can't bear the sight of Celebi crying, so she has to try and get you out of her stomach. Focusing her psychic powers, she focuses on the struggles in her stomach and uses psychic...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still trapped in Mew's stomach, you climb on a piece of berry and try to think a way out of here. There must be one. Well, there is one, but you really don't want to take the 'back door'. Plus you're not even sure if you can reach it without being digested. So you reject the idea. You already tried to climb back up, but the slippery walls just won't let you. Your only hope is that Mew manages to throw you up. Disgusting, but it's the only way to exit through the mouth. Luckily for you, Mew has other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on the tiny presence inside her, Mew uses psychic. Back in her stomach, a blue aura envelops as you are lifted from the berry you're on. Of course! You totally forgot that Mew is a psychic type! \"Mew you're a genius!\" you yell from inside her. She giggles in your head \"Why thank you. Now, let me focus so I can get you out. A short time later, you find yourself being lifted in the esophagus, back in the throat and into Mew's mouth. Mew loses her psychic grip on you and you're dropped on her tongue. She then opens her mouth and lets you slide right in her short, pink paws. As soon you land, she hugs you; her pink fur is like an actual pillow, its softness and warmth drying you from the digestive juices \"Welcome back\" Mew tells in your mind. You smile briefly, when something catches your attention. You see Celebi crying with her head on the ground, so she hasn't seen you yet. You suddenly feel sad. Be it that you never could bear the sight of people crying, or be the fact that you are now stuck with Celebi for the rest of your life, you look to Mew \"Mew, can you put me down please?\". Mew looks at you, then to Celebi and smiles \"Sure\" she says, lowering you to the ground \"You'll be sure more successful than me at comforting her about 'your loss' \" she giggles, winking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way towards the crying legendary. Once you reach her face, you start to pet her titanic cheek \"I'm here Celebi, don't cry anymore\" you say softly. As soon the legendary hears your voice, she looks up, tears still pouring down her cheeks, and looks in your direction; you notice that her eyes are completely red and puffy. She blinks a few times to make sure you're not some kind of mirage created by her suffering brain. Nope, you're really in front of her, petting her cheek. In a moment, you are launched upwards and land in Celebi's open hands. She closes you in a hug, and a tight one too. Even though your organs are about to explode from the pressure, you manage to smile. Celebi stands up and a her mouth curls in a smile as tears start falling from her eyes again, though these ones are tears of joy \"Little guy! You're back! I'm so happy! I was so worried that I could have lost you forever that... I don't even want to think about what I could have done\" she says. As always, you can't understand, so you just return the hug \"I'm happy to see you too Celebi\" you say \"But can you release me now? I'm about to die from the lack of oxygen\". Celebi instantly softens her grip on you and turns to Mew \"Mew, I don't know how did you manage to get him back, but I'll be eternally grateful\" she says. Mew blushes \"Don't even say that, I did the crime after all. Tell you what, I should be ashamed. None of this would have happened if I hadn't been so careless\" she says \"I forgive you. All that matters is that my little guy is back with me. And he'll be for a loooooooong time\" Celebi giggles, making Mew giggle as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still plucked in Celebi's grasp. You notice the two pokemon giggling. Smiling, a thought crosses your mind. You never got to get to know to Mew as you planned back at the Tree. So you clear your throat \"Mew?\" \"Yes little one?\" she asks looking at you \"Could I ask you a few questions?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sure, what is it?\" Mew asks. You are about to reply, when the sound of a bush rustling is heard. You turn your head as a very familiar pokemon comes into view. Just the sight of it makes you cower in fear \"No! Not again!\" you yell. Zoroark grins evilly, happy that she manages to terrorize you with her bare form. Celebi, on the other hand, sends a glare that would make even the bravest of all pokemon flee \"You again?\" she says angrily \"What's the matter? Angry that I took your little bug for myself last time? Well bad news, it's gonna happen again\" Zoroark says mockingly \"Like you could. We're two against one, you have no chance\" Celebi retorts \"That's what you think\" the dark fox replies. In fact, two other pokemon come out from the same bush. A Houndoom and a Drapion. They both smirk at your sight \"You're after them? They look pretty weak\" the male Drapion says \"Yeah, we'll do this in no time\" the female Houndoom confirms \"You two idiots better not lower your guard. Those two are stronger than they look. Not for nothing they're legendaries, you know\" Zoroark tells them, with a disinterested voice. Clearly, she doesn't care if the two live or die in the battle, she just cares about getting her slave back. And maybe getting a payback on the two psychic legendaries for what they did earlier. Yeah. She will snatch you from that green pokemon and swallow you in front of her. Maybe she will bring you back later. Or maybe she will have you pass through the back door, not her problem if you are digested. These thoughts make the fox smile. You look into her blue eyes, you see all of her cruelty in them. So you fearfully hug Celebi's skin. The grass type legendary closes you in a hug, she wants to protect you. She HAS to protect you. And she's determined to do it, no matter what. Zoroark will not take her little guy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoundoom is the first to attack, firing dark pulse at Mew. Mew dodges and hits with aura sphere. Houndoom, showing and incredible speed, dodges and uses flamethrower, this time aiming to Celebi. Celebi dodges, but she then sees a sludge bomb coming in her direction, fast. She has no time to dodge, so she turns around, the attack hits her back. Gritting her teeth, Celebi uses ancient power on Houndoom. She dodges a few rocks, but one of them hits the target. Houndoom falls to the ground, while Mew uses aura sphere, hitting her and causing a small explosion. When the smoke fades, Houndoom is seen fainted on the ground. Drapion roars and tries to use poison fang, but Mew fires another aura sphere, while Celebi uses energy ball. Both attacks collide with Drapion's poisonous fangs, causing a big explosion. That is enough to knock him out \"Now for their leader\" Celebi says, turning to Zoroark, surprised to notice she's no longer there \"Wha-\" Mew tries to say, but she's hit in the back by a super effective night slash. Celebi gasps as a second night slash hits her as well. She falls to the ground. Luckily for you, she falls on her back, avoiding to crush you under her body. You stare in horror as Zoroark comes into view \"You  got beaten by the same trick I uses last time. The good ol' methods never fail\" Zoroark states as she reaches down for you. Moving Celebi's arms out of the way, she picks you and dangles you over her month \"Ready slave?\" she asks, keeping her mouth wide open like she did earlier. You're pretty sure she will swallow this time. You're shaking with fear, a great fear that blocks your body and shuts your mouth closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stares at the scene. Mew is on the ground next to her, fainted. The fox is about to drop her little guy and she can't do anything about it. She feels so weak right now. Her mind is screaming her to get up, to fight the cruel fox until the very end. Zoroark stares down at the legendary. She's looking at you, perfect \"See ya later slave. Or maybe not\" Zoroark laughs as she lowers you in her mouth...</span></div></div>",

She once again dangles you over  her mouth, making sure you see her sharp fangs, making your fear grow more. The fox lowers you, but suddenly a energy ball hits her. She steps back and loses her grip on you. You fall to the ground, but you are saved from your very probably death by Celebi, who hardly stands up. She squeezes you in a protective manner \"As I said, you won't get my little guy!\" Celebi yells, putting you on her head; she would need both of her hands to fight. Zoroark growls frustrated as she uses night daze. Celebi is hit by the attack, which causes and explosion. The grass type manages to hang on and hits with ancient power. The rocks hit Zoroark, while Celebi uses energy ball repeatedly, attacking out of rage. Everything that Zoroark did to her... everything that Zoroark did to her little guy... she has to pay! These are Celebi's thoughts as she fires energy balls in rapid succession. You notice that her body is shaking in frenzied manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Celebi finally stops her frenetic attack, Zoroark is on the ground, barely alive from all the hits she received. Celebi gently puts you on the ground. You still can't believe this gentle and sweet pokemon can turn into such fighter when she is backed up against the wall. Celebi gets near Zoroark and glows green, a leaf storm attack forming \"You will never bother us again!\" she yells exasperated. Zoroark closes her eyes, awaiting for her doom. Celebi readies herself to fire, but she looks back at you. Mew has just woken up, and she's staring st the scene shocked. Celebi momentarily stops her attack. If she kills the cruel fox, her friend would probably think of her as the cruel monster she's not. And her little guy would probably be scared of her. And Celebi doesn't want any of that. So she turns back to Zoroark \"You're lucky. The only thing that stops me from killing you is the fact that I'm not a killer like you. So I'll let you live. But you're not bothering me or anyone anymore\" Celebi says with an unusual poisonous yet extremely calm voice. The dark fox looks up, a smirk on her face \"What do you mean? If you let me live, I'll heal up and hunt you down. So I'll probably bother you again\" \"No you're not\" \"What makes you think that?\" Zoroark asks \"Well... it's the fact that I'm... I'm banishing you from this time!!!\" Celebi yells, glowing green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happens really fast. A green portal appears behind Zoroark. Celebi quickly shoves her in with all her might. Zoroark tries to hold onto the ground, but she is sucked in the portal, which disappears just after. Celebi drops on the ground. Mew snatches you from the ground and flies to her friend \"Celebi?\" she calls \"It's over. She's gone\" the grass legendary pants \"What did you do to that Zoroark?\" Mew asks \"Simple. I sent her back in the past. She won't bother us anymore\" Celebi states. You can't understand a word as usual, so you look at Mew \"Mew? What happened to Zoroark?\" you ask \"Celebi sent her back in time. Speaking of which, where did you send her, Celebi? Or maybe 'when did you send her' is more accurate\" Mew asks. But she gets no reply. Celebi fainted from both the wounds and the tiredness \"Looks like she fell asleep\" Mew giggles. But you notice her body full of scratches and bruises \"Mew, help me. Celebi is badly bruised. We have to heal her\" you say. Mew nods \"How can I help?\" \"Well, can you use heal pulse? Then, I'll need help to find some medical herbs\" you say. Mew nods again and uses heal pulse on her fainted friend, healing part of her bruises \"Perfect. Now for the herbs...</span></div></div>",

Mew shakes her head \"Well, no, but I know what they look like, so it'll be easier to find them\". You nod as Mew extends a paw \"Hop on little guy, let's give a look around here\" she says. Nodding, you hop on her paw and sit down, while Mew starts flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too much passes before Mew spots a weird shaped herb \"There it is\" she says picking it up with her free paw \"Glad I'm not Celebi right now. These herbs are bitter!\" Mew sticks her tongue out in disgust \"They may be bitter, but they can heal you for good\" you state \"Yeah yeah, as you say smarty pants, did you ever tried one?\" Mew asks. You give a little of a blush \"Well no...\". Mew giggles \"Just kidding little guy\" she says pulling you in a hug. Blushing even more you clear your throat \"Le- let's find a sitrus berry too, just to be sure\" you say, getting a nod from Mew. The cat pokemon looks up and spots the berry, which is pulled by psychic and floats to Mew \"Here we go! Now let's get to Celebi\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew has been flying silently for a while, so you take the opportunity \"Hey Mew?\" \"Mh?\" \"Remember earlier when I asked you to answer a few questions?\" you ask \"Yeah?\" \"Could you do it now?\" \"Sure, go ahead and ask\" she says \"Well, first, I wanted to know what do you do when you're all alone at the Tree\" you ask. Like last time, a blush appears on the pink pokemon's face \"Well, I do things...\" she replies, exactly like last time, but now no Celebi to interrupt you \"What things?\" you ask \"W-Well, you see, there are some toys I brought to the Tree, I play with them\" Mew lies sheepishly. The little guy mustn't know that one particular thing yet. Maybe when the two of you are closer friend. She has to be sure that he won't tell anyone first. The truth is that when she is all alone in the three, she can't help but fantasying about how great falling in love and  mating would be. Some of her legendary friends did it, some of them fell in love and mated. Mew and Celebi are different. Both never fell in love, and both are still virgin. Well, Celebi is in love now, and with the tiny human Mew is holding right now, so the cat pokemon is now one of the few legendaries without a boyfriend. That's why she has these thoughts when she's all alone, and she can't deny that she likes it \"Mew?\" a voice snaps her back to reality. Looking down she notices the tiny human staring at her worriedly \"Yes? What is it?\" she asks \"Mew, I asked you  what do you if toys bore you out\" you say \"What happened?\" \"Oh, nothing important. I was just thinking. However, when toys bore me, I leave the Tree and search for something funny to do\" Mew explains \"And you like doing something in particular?\" \"Having fun\" \"That apart?\" you insist \"Playing\" Mew replies \"Nothing else?\" you ask \"I also like eating. A lot. And I like taking naps. That's practically all I do when I don't play\" Mew says giggling \"And you can learn every pokemon move?\" you ask. Mew nods \"Yes, I can. And that's quite handy\" she states \"That's cool\" you say \"You can say that\" Mew giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while passes before you two get back to Celebi. Luckily, she is still where she was before, still fainted. Mew brings you in front of her and puts you on the ground \"What do I do now?\" Mew asks \"Squeeze that herb\" you say. Mew squeezes the herb until it pops and a white liquid comes out of it; it splashes on Celebi's body. You hardly climb on her body and start rubbing the liquid on her bruises. In her sleep, Celebi moans softly. Mew giggles \"Aren't you so romantic, helping your girl in this hard moment\" she says between giggles. You blush wildly \"It's not like that. I just can't bear the sight of hurt people and pokemon, that's all\" you say \"Yeah sure, admit it! You like Celebi back!\" Mew giggles louder \"Fine I do like her. At least a little\" you admit \"Isn't that love?\". You are practically as red as pepper now \"N-no! Listen, I know Celebi loves me, I accepted it as I accept my new life, but I think it'll take some time for me to completely fall for her. We met just last night, and she ate me, then she brought me back and I learned about her love for me earlier today, and it was Arceus who told me. So everything it's kind of sudden, but I accept it. It'll just take time for me to fall in love with Celebi, okay? I can't deny I like her though\" you say. Mew nods, a smile still on her face. You resume your rubbing when \"Bi cele bi?\" a faint voice is heard. You look up and see Celebi staring down at you, smiling \"You said you like me?\" she asks. You don't understand a word, but you get that she was listening to the conversation. Your blush grows wider as two green hands reach for you and bring you to Celebi's face. She nuzzles you \"You're so sweet, taking care of me\" she says weakly. Clearly she's not fully healed yet. Celebi continues \"I heard everything. You're so cute, accepting your new life with me. And take as much time as you want, I don't mind\" she says, puckering her lips and kissing your cheek \"Uhhhh... Mew?\" you look to the pink pokemon \"She heard everything; you can take as much time as you want to fall in love with her\" Mew explains. Your face is about to explode from the embarrassment you are feeling right now. Turning back to Celebi, you notice she fell asleep again, a smile on her face and you grasped in her grassy arms. Slowly, you slide out of her grip and turn to Mew \"Mew, feed her the berry. She's still weak\" you say. Mew nods as a psychic force opens the grass legendary's mouth. Mew moves the berry towards it and makes Celebi close her mouth once the berry enters the dark cave that was the cause of your death just last night. Celebi instinctively swallows in her sleep. You sigh and sit down on the ground, Mew sitting next to you \"Well, it's just 6 PM. Do you want to do something while we wait for Celebi to wake up?\" you ask \"Well yes, I say, let's...</span></div></div>",

She closes you in a hug \"Thank you!\" she beams <br>\r\n\"*Sigh* you're welcome. What are we playing?\" <br>\r\n\"What about hide and seek?\" <br>\r\n\"Fine by me\" you reply \"Then go hide! You have until ten to hide. And if you manage to touch that log-\" Mew points to the log  where Celebi is sleeping \"-You win\". You nod as Mew turns around \"One... two...\" before she reaches tree, you dash to a nearby bush and hide in it \"Ten! I'm coming little guy!\" you hear Mew shouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew searches for you for a while, she checks in possible hiding place but the bush you're hiding. She's getting more and more excited from the game, the little guy I good at it. Mew looks around and spots the bush you're in. Giggling, approaches your hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou poke your head out of the bush, and you see Mew approaching. Luckily, she doesn't seem to have seen you yet. So you retreat in the bush. Shortly after a pink object, that you recognize as Mew's tail, enters \"Little guy? Where are you?\" comes her voice. You stay as still as possible, while the tail retreats. You sigh in relief. But suddenly the leaves glow blue and they move apart, letting Mew come into view \"Found you!\" she shouts excitedly. Without even thinking, you make a dash for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run faster than you ever had, a laughing Mew behind you \"You're mine!\" she yells <br>\r\n\"Not yet!\" you yell back, laughing as well. You reach Celebi's sleeping body and jump towards the log... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a second, you think you won't do it. But you're wrong. In fact the reassuring feeling of the wood under your palm makes you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won!\" you yell, while Mew simply giggles \"You sure have little guy!\" she replies, her voice giggling in your head, as her long, pink tail makes its way under your chin, tickling you, making you laugh<br>\r\n\"You won what?\" a third voice asks curiously. Well, to you is just a \"Le bi?\", but you understand perfectly who spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you see Celebi fully awake and, it appears, fully healed. She's staring down at you with a curious smile \"Glad to see you awake Celebi. Are you feeling fine?\" you ask, getting an eager nod from the green pokemon \"Thanks to both of you! I owe you so much right now!\" Celebi beams, standing up. She then hugs Mew, who hugs her back. Then Celebi breaks the hug and picks you up. She presses you into her green skin, before lowering her head and pecking your cheek \"Hey no fair! I got no kisses\" Mew giggles, sending her friend into laughs as well, while you rub your head sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing while I was sleeping?\" Celebi asks \"Oh, really nothing. Just playing hide and seek\" comes Mew's reply. Celebi's expression drops a bit \"Without me? You meanies!\" she says, pouting. Mew simply giggles \"Well, it isn't like we can't fix that\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"What else could I mean? Let's play!\" Mew beams. Celebi's smile returns \"Sounds good\" <br>\r\n\"Great! You two have the first round!\" Mew replies, turning around. You don't understand anything, but due the fact Mew just turned around, you assume you're going to play again. And you have to hide... with Celebi. The thought of what she could do if she's all alone with you makes you gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou play hide and seek for many hours. Surprisingly enough, Celebi didn't do anything weird when you got rounds together. But eventually the sun sets, the afternoon fading to make place for the night. And a heavy yawn from Mew declares the game ended. After a quick dinner made out of berries - seriously, you'll have to find something else to eat apart from berries, you can't just always eat them - the two pokemon decide to go to sleep. So both fly up to a tree branch and lay down. You are about to lay down as well, but Celebi's hand stops you. Looking at her, you see she's pointing to her chest, to the point where both shades of green meet. You sigh. If there's a positive side of this weird day, is probably the fact that you won't sleep on the 'cold ground'. So you let Celebi move you to her chest and put her hands around you like a blanket \"Well aren't you cute\" Mew giggles loudly. You ignore her, you don't want to feel more embarrassed than you already are. So you relax back and try to fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aside from the shrine dedicated to a certain mythical time-traveling Pok\u00e9mon, Ilex Forest was also famous for its nightlife. The wide assortment of weak yet delicious Pok\u00e9mon who spent the dark hours of the day sleeping meant that nocturnal predators never went hungry. Some would consider it unsporting to gouge and feast upon a sleeping prey - Clearly starvation is merely a theoretical concept to these people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not as if being a creature of the night didn't come with drawbacks. Daytime, for one. A quick snooze can turn even the most skillful predator into a trampled mess if they pick the wrong location. This particular Weavile had spent the night on an unsuccessful hunt (had there been some kind of commotion around these parts? Not one Pokemon was sleeping!) and been forced to stretch out the hours until dawn broke. Yawning, stumbling, hungry, she walked aimlessly around the forest looking for a place to hide and wait for the sun to piss off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to reach Celebi, you hastily leap up and grab a hold of her foot. Being of diminished stature, everything looks really strange to you so you didn't even realize you weren't scaling the roots of a really odd shrub until it suddenly moved. The slick surface of the clawed toes made hanging on impossible as you fell back on the ground with a painful thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" the Weavile exclaimed drowsily. You stare up at the ginormous Pok\u00e9mon who looked back at you with hazy, unfocused eyes. She didn't even notice Mew (Flying through the air didn't make much noise after all) who quickly stopped herself. Wondering if maybe you could sneak off you start to slowly move backwards, but the Weavile bends over and reaches down towards you. You try to run but even with her slow, lumbering movement, this Pok\u00e9mon is just way to big and easily snatches you up in her clawed hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew's mind was racing. Another Dark-type. With claws. Near a vulnerable Celebi. With claws. Picking up her little human. With claws. Having made a quick assessment of the situation, she held up her hand in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him go!\" she shouted, startling the Weavile who quickly looked up at her. Mew focused her powers into the tip of her fingers and let a lick of fire ignite, and even though the Weavile was still in a bit of a daze the sight made her heart race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Let who go?\" the Weavile stammered fearfully as you repeatedly punch her metallic claws to gain her attention, a completely fruitless effort since you weren't the one threatening her life at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! Last warning!\" Mew exclaimed in a panic, remembering how quickly Zoroark had been able to steal you away. She wasn't about to let that happen again and quickly sent out a focus blast towards the Weavile's legs in an effort to incapacitate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" the Weavile screamed as she jumped up, just barely avoiding the attack as the blast struck the ground and made a decent. Looking at the furious pink legendary, she did what any good predator would during the day and ran like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" you shout while being thrown to and fro by the giant Pok\u00e9mon as she zipped around trees and over rocks as the area just behind her filled up with fiery explosions. Despite all this tumult, the giant Pok\u00e9mon finally realized she was holding something and looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?\" she yelled with confusion as she started to shake her hand back and forth, \"Get off me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally someone of your size would have responded by making a graceful flight before becoming paste on the trunk of a nearby tree, but hours of hanging onto a Celebi moving through the skies at super-sonic speed had hardened your will to live and let you cling on like the most stubborn tick that ever existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Put me down carefully!\" you try to shout down the tornado as more explosions roared around you. You were getting pretty tired of all these massive Pok\u00e9mon treating your safety so callously, what did Mew think would happen if the dark-type you were holding on to suddenly caught fire?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I have time for that!?\" the Weavile replied agitated, not used to bugs talking back to her, \"Make her stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I can!?\" you scream, \"She's going to blow us both up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hectic chase had left the Weavile fully awake, and her mind finally began to put two and two together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you're being cased too!?\" she asked with panic and a bit of concern, though mostly panic, \"Alright, hold on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost good chase scenes end by jumping down a waterfall or across a giant chasm. As neither of these would even slow Mew down, the Weavile instead opted for the more mundane method of changing direction and quickly zig-zagging between the trees until the fearsome legendary wasn't on their trail anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haah... haah...\" the Weavile panted before suddenly remembering that you were there, \"Looks like we made it. Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her with surprise and then examine yourself. You were bleeding. Not profusely but her sharp claw had cut up part of your left arm during the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, whoops,\" she snickers as she notices your wound and the startled look on your face, \"Well at least you didn't get cut in half or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't quite know how to respond, everything had happened too quickly. This Weavile had snatched you away from the legendaries, but unlike Zoroark her intent didn't seem malicious. Almost like this whole thing had been a big accident. She squints at you for a moment before putting you down on the ground and crouching over your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, you're really small,\" she states bluntly while holding a clawed hand next to you in order to measure you up, \"Why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, uh...\" you stammer. Being honest hadn't done much to improve your situation in the past, so you figured this was a good opportunity to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate a shrunken creature. And somehow that made me shrink down too,\" you lie, \"I think it's some kind of virus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. How contagious?\" the Weavile asked as she slowly retracted her claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That pink Pok\u00e9mon used to be like 50ft tall before I met her,\" you joke. She looks worried for a few seconds before starting to snicker again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right. That really was the legendary Mew, wasn't it?\" she continues with her questions, \"Did she have any reason for trying to kill you or is that just how she normally greets people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

At least until either Mew and Celebi rescue you - again - or the Weavile finds out that you've been lying, in which case you'll be probably very sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl of your captress' stomach confirms your decision to lie.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it appears I'm really hungry. And tired. I haven't been eating or sleeping since last night. Boy, I need to sleep.\" the Weavile yawns.<br>\r\n\"Maybe that cave over there will solve your problem,\" you say, pointing to a small cave in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided that maybe, if you become friends with this Weavile, she won't hurt you - or worse - if she finds out the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile seems to agree with you. Without answering, she roughly grans you, though careful to not slash you to pieces with her claws, and makes her way to the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the rocky surroundings of the cave, Weavile deposits you on the ground and lies down.<br>\r\nGiving one last yawn, the dark pokemon falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch her sleep, an idea crosses your mind. She's dead asleep, and this makes you realize two things: one, she was really tired, two you have the opportunity to escape and go back to Mew and Celebi right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... if you run away... Weavile will probably realized you lied to her and would most probably hunt you down. Another growl of her stomach makes you shiver, and it also makes you remember that she's currently very hungry, so her first thought when she wakes up will surely be about food. And if you run away, you'll probably be her dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then again, if you manage to get back to Mew and Celebi, they can protect you, right? They're legendaries, and aren't legendaries supposed to be the strongest pokemon ever? Memories about the earlier fight between Celebi and Zoroark - with the not-easy victory of Celebi - cross your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, Celebi will definitely give Weavile a fight to protect you. Plus Mew will surely fight alongside her. That if you decide to run and get back to them.

And countless Pok\u00e9mon who will most certainly eat you in between. Deciding your safest option is to stay, you wait for daylight to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it never does. In just a few minutes the Weavile regains consciousness, undoubtedly awoken by the growls of her own empty digestive system. You sit firm and make an effort not to shy away, hoping it wouldn't trigger some sort of latent predatory instict inside your new host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" the Weavile said, her eyes half lidded from weakness, \"What's it like being so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you ask, wondering if she was looking for a more specific answer than \"it sucks\". She blinks once and then grabs a hold of your body, lifting it up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like is this scary?\" she asks casually as a terrifying sense of vertigo sets in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" you shout as she snickers, calmly setting you down on top of her stomach. The black hair which covered it was so fine that it didn't even reach up to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frightening noise emanates from the ground below, a deep gurgling amplified tenfold here compared to when you were just at the Weavile's side. It reminded you of your current predicament as you looked at her face with a pleading expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my belly rumbles like an earthquake?\" she asks in the same casual demeanor, a smirk appearing on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No...\" you hesitate, noting that the ground hadn't actually been shaking aside form the constant movement of the Weavile's breathing, \"Just really loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles for a moment before yawning, and then fixes her gaze onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know... I was thinking...\" the Weavile said dryly, \"If I were small, all the food in the world would be really big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Everything in the world is big - And very very dangerous,\" you clarify in an attempt to dissuade her from this line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty fast though. I could fill up on nuts and berries,\" she continued despite your efforts, \"Wouldn't have to hunt anymore. Hunting is also dangerous, and makes it really hard to make any friends. I mean, it's not like I enjoy killing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... Good to know,\" you say. An awkward silence fills the cave as she continues looking at you and her stomach growls once more. Granted, you were never that adept at reading the atmosphere, but if you had any chance whatsoever of running away, you would be doing so now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course... If it meant I never had to kill anyone else ever again...\" the Weavile reasoned, slowly snaking her right hand up her body, \"I could make one tiny little exception. For the greater good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChance be damned! You turn around and run like hell down the black landscape. It proved troublesome to decide on a direction - The north side was blocked off by two subtle hills which ended with the one fang-filled thing you were trying to get away from. Jumping off the side seemed like a pretty poor idea considering it would be hard to continue a prolonged chase with two broken legs and lots of screaming. Your blood pumping with adrenaline removed all sense of bashfulness as you hastily made your way towards the recline of her pubic bones, thinking you could possibly repel yourself down her soft womanhood and she'd be all the more reluctant to wave her claws around the region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was, of course, pointless as the Weavile's swift hand instantly pressed you down against the warm flesh of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait! What're you doing!?\" you scream with futility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be like that,\" she complains as she drags you along her fur so that you're back to facing her again, \"I never wanted to be a predator. If I eat you, I'll shrink down and I finally won't have to be alone anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, don't be like that!?\" you shout back, \"I don't want to die! I thought you were cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" the Weavile thinks to herself for a moment, she did like to think of herself as cool and not sadistically ruthless like some predators, \"Well... Maybe if I just take an arm? Or a leg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll still die!\" you burst out in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what if I drink some of your blood?\" she rationalizes before shrugging, \"Nah, you're right, that's too mean. If I swallow you whole then you can just, sort of, drift off I guess. That's the nicest way of doing it, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growls, and this time it really felt like an earthquake. You realize that her simply talking about eating you was already kicking her digestive system into gear, the machinations that would be your demise. You were going to be hearing it even louder soon, feeding this giant creature who decided to eat you on a whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a wh-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it! You're just delirious from hunger!\" you attempt to reason with her, \"If you don't want to be alone, then I'll be your friend! How are you going to keep friends if you eat them!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that's where the shrinking down and switching diet part comes in,\" she quips with a small grin. You are reminded of the lie you told and suddenly you realize your terrible mistake. It's time to set things straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK OK, you got me,\" you admit with a hint of shame, \"I didn't shrink from eating someone. I just shrunk one day and made up an excuse to keep others from eating me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks a little confused for a moment. Then she starts to laugh as your whole world shakes up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, oh wow! You totally got me!\" she laughs, showing that at least she didn't hold any hard feelings at being played, \"You're such a clever little thing, I really wish I could keep you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W... Wish...?\" you whisper fearfully. The Weavile sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. Maybe I'm delirious. Probably, haven't slept or eaten,\" she slowly admits, \"But I don't want to die either. And I can't risk passing up a meal in this dire situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks you up and brings you to her face, which is looking less cute and more terrifying by the second, especially the wise-cracking mouth. You shield your face and cower up, not again, NOT AGAIN-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she stops. You find yourself hanging not far from a frown as the Weavile hesitates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. It scares you,\" she mutters sympathetically, \"It won't be so bad, I promise I won't bite. You'll just go inside my mouth, slide down my throat and you'll be right back where you were, but, y'know, on the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... Is a nightmare...\" you utter breathlessly as you shiver, each of the Weavile's syllable presenting you with your final destination. A cave of no return coupled with a kiss of death. This whole thing was making her feel uncomfortable, she was used to her prey being too dead to complain about going to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do to make it easier?\" she suggests, \"Any last requests? Which don't involve me getting up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind starts racing for something which might help you get out of this situation. However, before you can think of any, the Weavile's expression suddenly lights up with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know! We'll just keep talking!\" she says, \"My hearing is really good, so if you shout I'll still be able to hear you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing holding her back, the Weavile opens her mouth, stretches out her tongue and starts to move you towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! Wait! you yell in desperation, but she doesn't slow down one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even I don't know what my insides look like, you'll be the first to find out!\" the Weavile chirps happily, \"Isn't it exciting? Make sure to tell me every little detail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a playful lick, her wet tongue reaching out to touch you. You attempt to gather your thoughts one last time, but hurry - Your fate is rapidly approaching!</span></div></div>",

Are you happy now?!\"  you yell between tears.<br>\r\n\"Come in don't be like that. What the inside looks like?\" she asks. You give no response, you just keep crying.<br>\r\n\"Little guy?\" the voice calls out again, but you have no intention of answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting that you don't want to talk to her, Weavile starts rubbing her belly, in a useless attempt to comfort you before you're gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but just cry. Why life had to be so unfair? Why? Why did you have to wake up shrunken, in a forest. Why did you have to die twice? It's just not fair. Your mind travels to Celebi and Mew. You wonder if Celebi is still asleep as you left her, still unaware of her little boy's fate. You wonder what Mew is doing, if she's still looking for you, or if she gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Mew didn't gave. She's still wandering around the forest, searching for that dark clawed kidnapper of a Weavile. Angry, worried, bored, she flies all around the forest, before stopping in a particular place. She felt something... an aura... your aura! It's very faint, but she can notice another, stronger aura very near yours. The Weavile! <br>\r\n\"Don't worry little guy! Mew is coming to save you!\" she thinks, flying as fast as she can in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flies at supersonic speed through the forest, looking for any dark type pokemon with claws she finds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at you, it's been a while in this stomach. Whatever it's keeping you alive, it's starting to disappear, as the acid starts to burn your skin. You yell in pain, more tears falling from your eyes.<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Celebi. Goodbye Mew. Goodbye everyone. Whatever higher, please, have mercy of my soul.\" you think...</span></div></div>",

And apparently, she wasn't wrong. The figure of that dark type with claws who kidnapped her best friend's little guy is here, laying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving the Weavile time to think, Mew tackles her. If she had been standing, she would have fell on the ground. Even though Mew is way shorter than Weavile, she manages to block her arms, careful to not touch those sharp claws of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll ask you once: where's the little guy?\" Mew inquires coldly.<br>\r\nWeavile gulps down, hard.<br>\r\n\"I a... I ate him...\" she says, almost in a scared whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew expression drops for a second, before shifting into one of both anger and worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even replying, she floats upwards and uses aura sphere. The glowing sphere hits Weavile right in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trapped in the dark type's stomach, you can't make out what is happening outside, but you suddenly find yourself being thrown into the esophagus. After a short flight, you are in the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile spits you out, before letting her head lie on the ground. It was a miracle she didn't faint or worse from the twice super effective move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovered in a mix of drool and digestive fluids, you clean some of the stuff from your eyes. And you notice two things. One, you aren't in Weavile's stomach anymore, you are standing on her belly. And two, Mew is floating before her, a smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"Little guy! Are you alright?\" she says through telepathy.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am... Mostly.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, you find yourself enveloped in a blue aura and floating towards Mew, right in her open paws. She hugs you for a second, before letting go. If it wasn't for her psychic, you would have fell to your death.<br>\r\n\"Ew, you're all sticky!\" she exclaims somewhat grossed out, before giving a small smile.<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get you washed. Then we can head back. Hopefully, Celebi is still sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Mew heads out of the cave, with you sitting on her head, relieved to be still alive. If it wasn't for Mew, you would have been dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in relief, you let her carry you out of the cave, glad to be able to enjoy the fresh breeze of the afternoon again...</span></div></div>",

So she just lets Mew float out of the cave, carrying you away with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on Mew's head, glad to be still able to enjoy the softness of her fur and the cool breeze of the afternoon.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mew. I thought I was going to -\" you try to say, but she cuts you off by picking you and pressing you into her fur, hugging you.<br>\r\n\"Shhh, it's okay, you're safe now, don't even think about it.\" she comforts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel happy. You met Mew just a few hours ago and she's already showing that she cares for you deeply. So you hug her right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keeps you grasped in her hug while flying through the forest. Then, she suddenly stops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn, expecting to see the figure of Celebi, still sleeping under her shrine. But instead, your eyes meet with the sight of a small lake (that is as big as an ocean to you).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Why exactly did you bring me here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, I told you, you need a bath,\" she replies looking at your body, that is still soaked in liquids from within Weavile. The mix of fluids you're coated in makes your body all sticky and it makes it hard for you to see. Plus, it makes you smell horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I really need a bath - now.\" you say. Nodding, Mew releases you from her hug.<br>\r\n\"Ew! I think I need one as well...\" she replies, pointing to the wet spots on her head and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how I'm going to do this? I don't want to... you know... drown,\" you tell her.<br>\r\nIn response, she smirks.<br>\r\n\"Well, I do have an idea...\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without waiting for a reply, she floats over the lake and dunks her whole self - and you, who she is still holding, as well - in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComprehensibly scared, you try to fight Mew's grasp to, bit she's holding you too tightly. So, assuming she doesn't want to drown you, you give up and let her stay underwater until your breath runs short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to struggle from the lack of air. Luckily, Mew fells your struggles and merges.<br>\r\n\"Mew *puff* what the *pant* heck.\" you say panting.<br>\r\n\"Relax little guy, I would never do anything to hurt you... Celebi would kill me right then... And then again, we're friends!\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she starts rubbing your body, freeing it from the sticky and disgusting fluids - and almost tearing off your clothes in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mew is done cleaning you and herself, she floats out of the water. She then shakes to get dry, threatening to make you throw up.<br>\r\n\"There! All nice and clean!\" she exclaims once she's done.<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I still have that disgusting smell.\" you reply, dizzy from the 'ride'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiles.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry about that,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\".<br>\r\nYou get no response. Instead, she closes her eyes as the air suddenly smells like flowers. You start to feel dizzy again.<br>\r\n\"Mew... What's happening?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little guy, that's sweet scent. So you won't have that smell anymore,\" she replies with a giggle, completely ignoring the fact that sweet scent is threatening to make to make you faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a minute, Mew is flying through the forest again, this time directed to the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes her a while but she eventually arrives...</span></div></div>",

The terror you're feeling shuts your mouth close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mew can even think of attacking, Weavile attacks again with slash. Mew manages to dodge again, and she strikes Weavile with mega punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile groans in pain, before using metal claw. This one attack manages to hit Mew, who is sent flying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew groans. She can't give up, she has to fight to protect you from this dark predator.<br>\r\n'I have to fight, I won't let her eat him again!' Mew thinks.<br>\r\nAnd the thought seems to encourage her. She uses aura sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack hits Weavile. She falls on her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't exactly know why she's doing this for you. She ate you, you were her food... but seeing how Mew was trying to kill you before, surely she has an even worse fate than digestion in store for you.<br>\r\n'If I manage to save the little guy, I swear I won't eat him.' she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the fight goes on for a while. You stand there, completely unable to move; you're terrorized at the thought Mew could lose, and Weavile would eat you again. And your heart skips a beat each time Mew gets hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew is running out of energy. This dark type is giving her quite the fight, she won't be able to resist much longer. She could always grab you and teleport back to the shrine. But that would need enough time to grab you and teleport away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile keeps fighting the pink legendary with her remaining strengths. But she's still tired and hungry, so her attacks are pretty weakened. Her opponent looks tired, bit she gives no sign of wanting to give up. So her only chance is to snatch you up and flee once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two keep fighting for a while, until Mew uses aura sphere; Weavile uses shadow ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two attacks collide and explode, causing a huge cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough and close your eyes.

In fact, a pink, stubby paw suddenly snatches you from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your relief, Mew is the one who has a hold on you now. And, before Weavile can try to snatch you from her, the pink pokemon teleports in a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a split second, you find yourself back at the shrine of Ilex Forest. And, as expected, a little, green, familiar pokemon is there, opening her blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Celebi spots you enclosed in Mew's grasp.<br>\r\n\"There you are, you two.\" the green pokemon says excitedly while reaching out for you. But she immediately represses the urge to hug you upon seeing the state you are in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little guy, why are you so... dirty?\" she sniffs at this. She instantly turns her head with a disgusted expression.<br>\r\n\"And you smell horrible too. What happened?\" Celebi asks.<br>\r\n\"Better you don't know.\" Mew says, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one thing is clear: this little cutie needs a bath...\" Celebi snatches you from the pink cat pokemon.<br>\r\n\"... And I'd be more then willing to help him.\" she says with something between a grin and a seductive smile painted on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew? Mind if I take this little guy to wash for a while?\" Celebi asks her friend.<br>\r\n\"Of course not. I'll just wait here.\" Mew replies smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning her smile, Celebi carries you off into the forest. You wonder where she's taking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question is answered when you see the time traveler pokemon stopping by a small lake. You quickly figure out the reason of why she brought you here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi flies on the surface of the water. Gently, she lowers you, you almost can touch the water. Understanding what Celebi wants you to do, you quickly jump off her paws and into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the sticky sensation vanishes. You swim around for a bit, Celebi not losing sight of you.<br>\r\nStopping, you notice the green pokemon giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before you can ask yourself what she's up to, she flies up in the air before rocketing into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat normally would be a splash of water generated by Celebi diving at supersonic speed, to you is a tidal wave that washes you away. Spitting out water that ended up in your mouth, you notice Celebi emerging from the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks in your direction and notices you got farther than you were before. She smiles.<br>\r\n\"You want to play this game little cutie? So be it!\" she beams, diving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to make out what just happened when a shadow appears beneath you. You try to swim away, but a certain green pokemon emerges again, missing you of a few inches. Giggling, Celebi dives again. Understanding what she has in mind, you decide to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow appears again. This time, you are prepared and quickly swim away as Celebi emerges yet again.<br>\r\n\"Aw, I'll manage to get you sooner or later, I swear!\" she exclaims, diving again. But this time, you dive as well, just to see Celebi swimming rather fast towards you. You dodge her just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game goes on for many rounds until finally Celebi manages to catch you, snatching you in her paws and hugging you, giggling like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little green then has an idea; she lies down, floating on her back, and lies you on her belly. You have to admit, this is pretty relaxing. One good way to end this heck of a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Celebi takes you out of water, sun already settled, the moon shining up in the sky. Smiling, the grass type carries you back to the shrine, where Mew was waiting half asleep for her friends to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick dinner of berries, Celebi and Mew decide to hit the hay. You are pretty curious on where are you going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour doubts are soon answered when Celebi looks at you while pointing at her chest. It takes her a good while to convince you with her best puppy eyes, but finally you gave up and agreed to sleep with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, to stay with her, since you can't sleep at all! The two pokemon are soon fast asleep, but you, on the other hand, have some serious problems to get to sleep. The events of the day left you too alarmed to just sleep: First you met Mew and Arceus, then you discovered about Celebi's feelings towards you; then you are enslaved by a Zoroark who is then banished in another era from Celebi. And in the end, you are kidnapped and eaten almost for by chance by a Weavile, just to be then rescued by Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's really too much to take in. Five minutes pass, twenty, almost an hour, and you still can't sleep. Time passes and you...</span></div></div>",

You can't help but wonder how did you end up in this predicament; shrunk down to size and in Ilex Forest, where its cute little deity ate you, just to revive you right after by going back in time. Then she revealed her love for you and decided you were going to be hers without giving you a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, you think, if you ever manage to grow back to your normal size and tell this story, no one is going to believe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIF you manage to grow back to your normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a nocturnal pokemon screeching distantly snaps you out of your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.

But, if you refuse and ask Weavile to bring you back to Celebi, she would never believe you are her actual other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you decide you don't want to take risks.<br>\r\n\"Hey, someone's in there?\"  Weavile asks once again.<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh.<br>\r\n\"Weavile, I think I'm going... I think I'm going to stay with you for now...\".<br>\r\n\"That's good.\" she says with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down in front of the giantess. Her gigantic figure sitting there, looking at you with a smirk reminds you of earlier today, when you were 'enslaved' by Zoroark. With the only difference Weavile is much more gentle than the dark fox... Yes, she ate you, but she was starving to death, and most of yourself already forgave her. Though you are still a bit scared of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew makes her way to the shrine, a thousand thoughts running through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she gets there. Celebi is there and, judging from her stirring, she's just waking up. Mew gulps as her friend opens her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Hey Mew. Why do you look worried?\" Celebi asks. Mew sweat drops.<br>\r\n\"Celebi, you aren't going to like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while passed. You both sit there, silent. The sun is slowly settling down over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a very familiar noise catches your attention. Weavile's stomach growling. You shiver. Weavile smirks and suddenly picks you.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you sure look tasty for a little human,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp down hard. Weavile moves you over her mouth and opens it. She dangles you over the cavernous mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared to death, you close your eyes. Weavile lets go of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected to fall into her mouth and be swallowed; instead, you landed on a soft surface. Opening your eyes, you notice you're sitting on Weavile's belly. She's laughing, sending shockwaves through her body, threatening to make you fall.<br>\r\n\"You should have seen your face!\" she laughs.<br>\r\n\"Will you ever relax? I told you I won't eat you again, why are you scared?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while passes before you recover from the scare you had.<br>\r\n\"Don't do that again...\" you mutter. The dark giantess snickers in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, sun settled down...\" Weavile suddenly says. And, in fact, the sun is no longer there, replaced by the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile's grin drops in a somewhat annoyed expression.<br>\r\n\"And I'll have to go hunting again.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removes you from her belly. But, before jumping off, she suddenly stops.<br>\r\n\"Wait, I can't leave you alone. You could be attacked,\" Weavile states.<br>\r\n\"But, if I bring you along, I'll need to keep an eye on you...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile turns around, thinking, before deciding to let you pick.<br>\r\n\"Little guy, what do you want to do?\". The question catches you off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You're saying that little guy was kidnapped by a Weavile, he was eaten, brought back and kidnapped again?\" Mew nods, confirming her story. <br>\r\n\"That's horrible! We need to find him! My poor little guy, Arceus knows what he's going through right now!\" Celebi exclaims, before flying into the forest at supersonic speed, with Mew following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the tree, a good five minutes passed, but in the end you decided the most safe thing to do is...</span></div></div>",

But now, your mind is working hard to find something to convince Weavile to keep you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type pokemon moves you closer to her mouth, you can see the wet, slippery insides and the sharp, white teeth that seem to shine, awaiting for the new meal. Weavile opens wide enough to let you see her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark abyss, a dark abyss like the one you died in just yesterday. The only difference is that its owner hasn't the same kind intention of spitting you out, nor reviving you by going back in time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to shake, memories of yesterday, when you were about to be swallowed by Celebi, fill your mind, startling you. Then, memories about earlier, when you were in Mew's mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! Mew! That's it!<br>\r\n\"Wait!!\" you yell, causing Weavile to stop. You are mere inches from her mouth, her frosty breath blasting in your face, making you shiver with both fear and cold.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" she asks in a cute voice. Clearly, she's making the futile attempt to not scare you too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do you remember Mew?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Thar crazy pink pokemon that tried to kill us both? Yeah, why?\"<br>\r\n\"About that, I lied again. Mew wasn't trying to kill me, I don't even think she was trying to kill you, she just wanted to rescue me,\" you admit.<br>\r\n\"Rescue you?

Celebi's love approved by Arceus and Mew? That's hilarious!\" she snickers<br>\r\n\"I told you the whole truth! Now, probably Mew is looking for me, and maybe she wants to make you pay!\" you state. Clearly, this dark pokemon doesn't believe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right! You're funny little guy. Man, you don't know how much I would want to keep you. But, little guy, truth or not, I still want to eat you. Being tiny and finally have some friends... that would be too good to let it go\" Weavile says.<br>\r\nYou can't take it anymore.<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts?! Tell you what, if you do, not only you won't shrink, but if Celebi manages to find you, you'll be surely dead! Or you'll wake up one morning, just to find yourself somewhere in another era! I told you, I lied about eating a shrunken creature, why won't you believe me?! You said you don't like to kill. Well, I'll have you know, you're about to kill me pointlessly! Do you like the idea?!\" you burst out, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile seems taken aback from your burst out. She stares at you, seeming to think.

You decided to find a shelter and you got asleep, just to wake up beneath the legendary Celebi's head while she was sleeping. Right?\" she asks. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, she wakes up eats you, just to go back in time and keep herself from eating you, before bringing you to Mew. The two of them then brought you to Arceus - who is the god of all pokemon - and he told you about Celebi's love?\"<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" you confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, then this Zoroark kidnaps you and makes you her slave, but Celebi and Mew rescued you. Then Mew swallowed you by accident, but she brought you back up, and you were attacked by Zoroark and other two pokemon.<br>\r\nYou were almost eaten again, but Celebi saved you by sending Zoroark back in time, but getting hurt badly. Now, after healing her, you ran into me while playing with Mew. Did I got it right?\" Weavile asks. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Everything's so hard to believe...\" she says, before starting to snicker.<br>\r\n\"Tricky, clever little thing, I can't imagine how hard it must have been for you to survive this one day here. Ehehe... Groan!\" she groans as her stomach growls loudly again, asking for a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... hungry...\" she says, clearly suffering from hunger.<br>\r\n\"I need something to eat... We... Weavile...\" she says, reverting to some wild instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill grasped in her metallic claws, you try to slip away before she can think of you as food again, but as expected, her grip is too tight for you free yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile looks at you, hunger in her eyes. Her stomach growls again, louder than ever this time.<br>\r\n\"Vile... Hungry...\" she says, sending shivers down your back.<br>\r\n\"Little guy... forgive me but... I need to eat... Don't be mad at me, I could die... and you're the only one thing that I can eat right now...\" she says, licking her lips hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrorized, you just watch as she lowers you near the fang filled cave that could cause your death in a matter of moments! Then, suddenly, your survival instinct kicks in and you start to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait!! I thought we were friends! Would you eat... Would you eat your only friend?!\" you say, in attempt to convince her to keep you, at least until Mew manages to find you. If really you're her only friend, then, you hope, she'd be more than reluctant to turn you into food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile momentarily stops to look at you. The little guy in her claws is for sure trying to trick her into letting him live. She now knows about your cleverness. But, trick or not, you're right. You're her only friend. The only one living being that has ever even talked to her. And she's going to eat you. She stares into your eyes, you're terrorized, she can tell. Is she really going to end such a innocent life to satisfy her hunger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her stomach growls again, making her grit her teeth in pain. Her brain is screaming to eat the little human if she wants to live; Her heart is screaming that eating your only friend is even worse than hunting. And Weavile is in between this fight that threatens to make her head to burst...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill firmly held up in Weavile's claws, you see her eyes closed and a suffering expression painted on her face. You simply assume she's too hungry. You cower as she opens her eyes and looks at you, having taken a decision...</span></div></div>",

She opens wide, beginning to descend her claw into the razor-sharp teeth-filled cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait! You don't have to do this Weavile! I-I can get you food, don't eat me!\" you exclaim, fear once again overwhelming you. You look into the pokemon's half closed eyes, seeing a strong regret in them. You just have to try and convince her to keep you. At least, until either Celebi or Mew (or both) manage to figure out where you are and rescue you. Her mouth closes back up. She goes silent for a few seconds, just eyeing you tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry... I really am, but I <b>need</b> to eat. Like now. Don't hate me for what I'm about to do.\" she says, almost in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your mental activity increased by the fear, you quickly reply.<br>\r\n\"H-Hold on,\" you stammer.<br>\r\n\"Didn't you say you wanted to keep me? I could be really useful to you... yeah! I could do things for you!\" Weavile seems to ponder.<br>\r\n\"I said I <i> wished</i> I could keep you.

Her stomach growls once more, asking to be filled. She looks at it, then at you, a somewhat sad smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp down hard, big drops of sweat pouring down your face.<br>\r\n\"C-Come on Weavile, we're... we're friends, aren't we? Didn't you bring me here because you thought Mew wanted to kill me?\" you ask. Once more, Weavile seems to be pondering.<br>\r\n\"You're just trying to make feel guilty, aren't you? You clever, little thing,\" she snickers.<br>\r\n\"You don't know how much I wish I could keep you. You'd be a great company. Too bad that apparently it can't be...\" she says with a soft voice, opening wide once again. You descend of another centimeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start shivering as you come up with another excuse.<br>\r\n\"Then... why not? Let me stay with you, I'll keep you company. I can even get you food, just don't eat me!\" you exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile shuts her mouth close again. The tiny human is trying to trick her again. For someone that small, he's really smart. He's even offering to give up his life to keep her company. The only one who ever did that. The other pokemon she met were a little too... deceased to make such offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe storm of thoughts raging into her mind has the effect of making her forget about her growling stomach. The clawed paw that is holding you rises back into the air, away from her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile observes you, who are sweating heavily, shivering from head to toe. That's really the most pitiful sight she's ever seen - and, being a natural huntress, she has seen many. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the dark type talks again.<br>\r\n\"You'd really give up your life to keep me company? I mean, aren't you Celebi's...\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I hadn't a choice in the matter. She practically just decided I was going to be her... other.\" you reply. Weavile snickers loudly, before her stomach growls again, louder than before. Weavile glances at you once more. You really hope you managed to convince her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Weird. You expected her mouth more... wet than this. And then... an earthquake, which menaces to break your eardrums. It lasts a few seconds, before ending. And then, a new noise assaults your ears, along with new vibrations from beneath you. Although it seems much less of an earthquake and more like... laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken by surprise, you slowly open your eyes. You glance upwards, noticing that you're not in the fleshy 'cave' you expected to be inside of. Instead, you notice the laughing face of Weavile, miles of black fur away from you.<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, oh man! When was the last time I laughed like that? Y-You should've s-seen your face!\" stammers the giantess, unable to control her own laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand there in disbelief, pale, shivering, sweating as she keeps laughing.<br>\r\n\"Y-You...\" is the only thing you managed to stammer after several minutes.<br>\r\n\"Cheer up, lil' one, I'm not going to eat you... yet.\" she teases you, her laughter reduced to a mere snicker. You drop on your knees on what you determine is the furry surface of her massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, you wish you hadn't done that. Her belly growls again, louder than ever before. Your hands rush to your ears. Otherwise, the vibrations sent from her empty digestive system would have broke your eardrums for <b>real</b> this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mh, right.\" you hear Weavile, her voice muffled by the whining of her own stomach.<br>\r\n\"Since I won't be eating you, I need to go get food. Like now.\" she says. Just as she says that, both you and her notice the sun disappearing over the horizon, meaning that the time has come for the nocturnal inhabitants of the forest to rise and get the daily meal. And Weavile is no exception. She gives a deep sigh. A sigh of regret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even speak, she moves her claw in your direction, snatching you from her belly and placing you down on the ground. She then places both her clawed paws on the rocky floor of the cave and stands up. One of her paws travels to her mouth as she yawns deeply.<br>\r\n\"Well, time to go.\" she states, starting to walk over the entrance of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to stop almost immediately, remembering about her small friend. She turns to look at, who still haven't spoken a single word.<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" you ask after a moment of hesitation.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" the dark type replies bluntly.<br>\r\n\"I usually don't have... guests when I hunt. How can I hunt if I have to keep you safe? I mean, you're sticking with me now, right?\" she asks, with a not-so-subtle hint oh hope in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... yes...\" you lie. Secretly, you're waiting for Mew to come and rescue, even though Weavile said she wouldn't eat you. You have a feeling that Celebi wouldn't be so pleased to wake up to discover that you are gone - and with a formidable predator as a Weavile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to not notice your hesitation, Weavile keeps thinking about what to do with you.<br>\r\n\"... But if I leave you here alone, some other pokemon might get in here and attack you...\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarn. She's right. If she goes hunting alone, some random pokemon could try to eat you. Unless... unless you run away and go straight back to the shrine. Of course, <i>if</i> you manage to make it there unharmed...

Weavile snickers as she opens her mouth wide again.<br>\r\n\"<b>Ready?</b>\" she asks, making sure to keep her mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the wet insides of her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" you respond, closing your eyes as Weavile moves you closer to her opened lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, she gently places you on her tongue, before her lips fall back in place, sealing you in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling you readjusting within her mouth, Weavile stifles a snicker as she turns around and walks out of the cave, watching as the sun sets, marking the beginning of her hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCareful to not accidentally swallow the tiny human inside her mouth, the dark type weasel walks towards a tree and starts climbing with the agility of her species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the dark type is standing on one of the high branches and stands still, waiting for any pokemon weak enough to enter her eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while passes quietly. Inside of her mouth, you sit onto the giantess' tongue, afraid that any wrong movement might bring you to meet Weavile's teeth up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr even worse, the giantess could simply swallow you by accident, embarking you on a one way trip into her stomach, like she wanted to do before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the thought alone isn't terrible enough, the inside of Weavile's mouth is hot, and it smells like whatever she last ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig drops of saliva fall from her palate, hitting your head while soaking you to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, things start to shake, and you are carelessly thrown around inside the giant mouth as Weavile leaps onto another tree branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen on another as she carefully scans the world below, trying to spot any sleeping pokemon, or any weak pokemon she could ambush and easily beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' stomach growls as she grits her teeth. She won't be able to resist for much longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile suddenly thinks of the human within her mouth. It could be so easy to just swallow and finally fulfill her hunger! Curious, the dark type starts tasting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant muscle beneath you suddenly starts to move as it licks you, soaking you in saliva more. You open your mouth to protest, but the only you achieve is a disgusting mouthful of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile keeps tasting you. The human... he's tasty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, just when the idea of swallowing penetrates Weavile's mind, a bush suddenly starts to shake down below, drawing the giantess' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the giantess silently leaps down, throwing you back and forth within her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Weavile! Careful!\" you shout, getting another mouthful of saliva. Disgusted, you spit out and grasp the giantess' tongue, trying to avoid getting eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Weavile lands right in front of the rustling plants and rises her claws, ready to strike whoever is going to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, a pokemon comes out. And Weavile's claws dart forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was still wandering around the forest, searching for the dark type who stole her new little friend away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's been searching for hours now, and she still didn't find them. The pink pokemon dreads the chance that the Weavile might have hurt him... or worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she floats through another bush, Mew is greeted with the sight of a set of three claws darting towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, Mew closes her eyes and puts up a psychic barrier.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Mew!</span>\" she cries as the claws collide into the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing that she wasn't hurt, Mew opens her eyes to look at her aggressor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose sapphire eyes of hers widen as her face contorts into an unusual frown.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You!</span>\" she cries as she notices that she was attacked by... the Weavile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type retreats her claws with a startled expression on her face.<br>\r\n\"<b>Mh mhh...</b>\" she cries, unable to talk because of the human in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Mew did not know about that particular.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">The human. Where is he?!</span>\" she cries, menacingly floating forward.<br>\r\n\"<b>Mhh...</b>\" Weavile moans, the sound echoing throughout the insides of her mouth, almost deafening you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew's are close into two slits.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Your mouth. Open it.</span>\" she demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Weavile leaps back. She already experienced what happens when Mew is angry. And she doesn't want to experience it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried and angry at once, Mew starts floating towards Weavile, who leaps to the side. Mew turns to face her, an orange sphere forming in her paws.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You let the human out this instant,</span>\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Mh!</b>\" Weavile exclaims, making you cover your ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what is going on out there?! Did Weavile find a prey? Or did she become one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot understand the intentions of the Weavile, Mew unleashes her focus blast. The weasel's eyes go wide as she dives out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout losing time, Mew flies over her, her paw closing into a fist as she performs mega punch; Weavile's claws glow as she intercepts with slash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew cries in pain, a single drop of blood falling from her paw. The pink pokemon glares daggers at the dark type who, realizing that fighting a legendary pokemon such as Mew makes as sense as committing suicide, does the only logical thing she can think of right now: she turns around and starts running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Not this time!</span>\" Mew cries, enraged, as she starts chasing Weavile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon hearing the legendary's shout, Weavile's heart stats beating faster. Adrenaline pumps along with her blood as she dashes through Ilex Forest, trying to get away from the enraged legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mew wasn't going to let it happen again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts flying faster as she chases the dark type weasel, who nervously glances backwards. Only to notice a pink blur coming directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of pain takes over Weavile's body as Mew collides with her at supersonic speed, tackling her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Weavile's mouth, you are doing your best to hang to the giantess' tongue. A not-too-easy task: the red slick muscle is too big for you to actually hold onto, and it keeps slipping out of your grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what seems an explosion makes you let go. You are ready rocketed forward, straight towards the giantess' razor sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale. In a split second, your whole life flashes before your eyes. You close them, waiting for one of the teeth to tear your body apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon, you hit a hard surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you... are you dead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hears catch sounds of roars and cries of pain. Your heart skips a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you die and end up in hell?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering all your courage, you slowly open your eyes and look up. Your whole being sighs in relief: you are sitting on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact must have made Weavile open her mouth, while you were thrown out of it unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze is fixed on your body as you check if you're really in one piece, before you look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew and Weavile are on the ground, busily fighting each other. It seems like they completely forgot about moves as they're fighting the old-fashioned way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two roll onto the ground, Mew trying to hit the startled Weavile, and Weavile desperately trying to fight back the raging Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fighting titans also forgot about you, it seems, because they suddenly roll in your direction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaping in your chest, you hastily leap out of the way, the two rolling where you were before. You back up, dreading that you might end up as a red stain on the ground if they're not careful enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two keep fighting for a while more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it all comes to an end when Mew, now on top of Weavile, delivers a powerful slap across her opponent's face with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ear-splitting sound menaces to break both your eardrums as Weavile cries in pain, before her head hits the ground. The dark type lays motionless afterwards, suggesting that she just fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as Weavile is no longer able to fight, Mew sighs as she rolls off her opponent, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing in relief, you slowly walk over the panting titaness. Soon, you come to a halt beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when laying down, Mew towers above you. That only makes you feel even weaker than you currently are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hey,\" you say. Mew's eyes open as she looks down at you, giving a small smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Mew mew...?</span>\" she weakly asks, clearly too exhausted to use telepathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm alright,\" you say, assuming that the question was \u2018Are you alright?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you find the giantess' short paw reaching out for you. Her three fingers gently wrap around your waist as she brings you upwards, pressing you against her furry chest. Her other paw joins in her hug as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happily hug back. Mew made many efforts to rescue you, this is the least you can do to thank her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't help but glance at the fainted Weavile. She had called you her friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling things shaking, you glance back at Mew, discovering her getting up. The pink giantess unsuccessfully tries to hover a few times, before actually managing to fly in midair properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo huge, sapphire eyes gaze down to you.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Le-Let's go back...</span></i>\u2019 Mew speaks in your mind, having recovered enough to use telepathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, before glancing at Weavile again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Mew,\" you say, causing the legendary to halt and look back down at you. She gives you a curious stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She... she was actually being nice to me,\" you slowly admit, freeing one of your arms from Mew's hug and pointing at Weavile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew looks at her, then back at you, this time wearing a confused stare upon her visage.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I think we should move her somewhere else. Some other pokemon could easily eat her right now...\" you reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Mew glances at the unconscious Weavile, feeling a little guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink giantess hovers to her earlier opponent, her eyes glowing blue as she performs Miracle Eye. Psychic didn't affect dark types, and Mew didn't really want to drag a fainted pokemon throughout the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nType disadvantage gone, Mew lifts Weavile and starts hovering deeper into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew suddenly halts as she spots a small cave.<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"cpink\"><i>It'll work...</i></span>\u2019 she says in your mind, before moving inside of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize it as the same cave where Weavile tried to make you her next prey. However, you decide to keep quiet about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew gently places the fainted pokemon onto the ground, before flying out of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that was one crazy adventure...\" you mumble, making Mew giggle.<br>\r\n\u2018<span class=\"cpink\"><i>You can say that. Just look at us,</i></span>\u2019 she chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as she told. And you feel a lump in your throat upon doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't quite know what both you and Mew are going to tell Celebi: your arm is partially scratched and covered in dried blood, while your whole body is soaked in saliva; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew's pink fur is covered in a mess of dust, soil, small branches and leaves, while her palm is still bleeding from the slash she received. Luckily, that was the only thing that Weavile's claws touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Mew giggles again.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">That Weavile put up quite a fight...</span></i>\u2019 she says, before sighing.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Let's go back. I bet Celebi is awake by now...</span></i>\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and the giantess resumes flying in direction of the shrine where she left her sleeping friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was actually right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi has awoken from her slumber shortly ago. She felt much better now, thanks to the human's care. She made a mental note to thank him later and started looking around for him and Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the forest's patroness couldn't find them anywhere around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden noise draws the legendary fairy's attention. She looks around, noticing a bush shaking. And she watches as a familiar pink tail comes out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hi the-</span>\" she chokes back her sentence to let out a gasp: Mew is holding her little human... both of them are in a pitiful state!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew nervously giggles.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hi Celebi,</span>\" she says as her friend flutters closer.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mew... what...?</span>\" Celebi mutters incredulously as her gaze travels down to you in Mew's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the green fairy picks you in her own paws. She feels your body soaked.<br>\r\n\"Hey Celebi...\" you mutter, giving a small smile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Poor my little cutie...</span>\" she says, hugging you, before looking back at Mew.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mew... what happened to you? How did you end up like this...?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew giggles again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hehe, you see...</span>\" </span></div></div>",

Though it's just a mere scratch, it's covered in dried blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open, and you look up, noticing the legendary fairy examining your wounded arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">...

And, before her friend can further complain, Mew snatches you from her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Hehe, look at us! Me and this little one need a bath!</span>\" she exclaims, desperately trying to change topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it seems to work as Celebi suddenly nods, once again looking at the state you and Mew are in.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">There's no denying that.</span>\" she says, before floating in front of her pink friend and smiling.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Follow me.

Bullet?</i>\u2019 you complete with a smile. Mew sighs, before giggling.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Yeah. That.</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi suddenly stops.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">There,</span>\" she says, pointing to a small lake.

You barely have the time to hold your breath as the giantess splashes into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew surfaces again, and you along with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before you can grab your first breath of fresh air, another splash of water hits you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to see Celebi surfacing from the water.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Might as well join the fun~</span>\" she says, picking you from Mew and hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough wet, the grass type fairy's skin maintains its warmth, which is somewhat comforting in the cold water. You sigh as you watch the two giantesses merrily starting to play in the water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and Mew get out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew's fur was finally rid of dirt, while her paw stopped bleeding;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saliva was finally removed from your body, and the dried blood was washed away by the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mew and Celebi look at each other, before shaking themselves dry. You, who are still solidly held by Celebi, are shook back and forth, feeling dizzy as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">That was really nice!</span>\" Mew cheers as she and Celebi starts to fly back to Ilex Forest's shrine.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yep. Right, cutie?</span>\" the patroness of the forest chimes while looking at you.<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you respond, not quite sure of what she said, and not really caring right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the giantesses get back to the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly catch Celebi lowering herself to ground level, gently letting you down, before hovering upwards, plucking a few berries from a tree, before descending back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess tossed a berry at Mew, before sitting down beside you, making the ground shake beneath your feet. Celebi sets a single berry in from of you; it's roughly your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Eat up!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight fully descended into Ilex Forest when you, Mew and Celebi finally finish eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Celebi yawning.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well, today sure was tiring!</span>\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I've got a cutie for myself, then he was kidnapped by a Zoroark, then you ate him,</span>\" Celebi giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Then he was kidnapped by a Weavile...</span>\" Mew thinks out loud.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Nothing!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi huffs.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mew, you've been acting weird for a while...</span>\" she remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew freezes. Celebi yawns again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Well, bedtime I guess,</span>\" she says, causing Mew to sigh in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary fairy then turns to you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Time to sleep, cutie!</span>\" she says cheerfully, reaching for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Guess where you're sleeping~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next minutes pass too quickly for you to figure out what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a second, you found yourself laying down on top of Celebi's chest, her paws holding you down and a massive blush upon your face after she kissed your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the grass type and Mew are currently asleep beside each other, while you try to recollect your thoughts. However, you are pretty tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, you decide to sleep on it, and lay your head on Celebi's chest. Your eyes close as you enjoy the warmth and the smoothness of Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, your consciousness starts to fade, and you do nothing to oppose as sleep claims your head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up and yawn, feeling like a really short time passed since you fell asleep.<br>\r\nYour eyes open as you drowsily glance around, not quite making out things in the darkness of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes soon adjust to the darkness of the forest as you notice...</span></div></div>",

Cold, a hasty fall, and the noise of a giant spitting. The glob of saliva carries you out into further darkness and breaks your fall as you land on a patch of grass, though it your size it was more like down below the strands. Wiping the gunk from your face, you see Weavile hunched over you to try and see if you're still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, fucking hell!\" the Weavile yells exasperated as she sits down, her butt causing enough of a tremor to rattle you around, \"Why would you scream!? If Celebi had woken up... I almost had a heart attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why would I not scream!?\" you yell back, feeling quite exhausted after the trip and lack of sleep, \"You almost ate me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thanks I get for saving you!?\" the Weavile replies with annoyance, \"You're lucky I didn't shove you somewhere else to shut you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall silent as the Weavile puts her claw to her chest in an attempt to calm down. Seeing her giant body move makes you realize you had just been in there, and her heart had most definitively been working overtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save me?\" you repeat, feeling confused for a moment. Then you remembered what you had told her earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the Weavile mutters as she looks away, almost appearing somewhat embarassed, \"We're friends, remember? What kind of friend would leave the other to die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" you start, not sure how to feel about this. Was she mocking you? Was she angry that you had left her behind to die from her wounds or starvation? Was she just instilling you with a false sense of security before dropping you back into that pit of death, this time to never return?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my decision, Mew just took me away!\" you shout. It really wasn't your decision. Nothing is really your decision anymore. If you're not being carried around like a doll, you're being sucked on like a piece of candy. Waiting for the day that you'll be devoured and broken down to fuel one of the many giantesses this forest had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" the Weavile speaks up carefully, as you stand up defiantly and stare right at her. Her stature made you feel completely insignificant, and it felt fitting somehow. You're the size of an ant and the way others treat you you might as well be one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get it over with,\" you groan as you hold your arms out in submission, \"Do what you must. Eat me, or whatever makes you happy. I'm sick of living like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening chill blew past you as the Weavile looked down at you. With a sigh of resignation, she bends over and picks you up, holding you in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still asleep?\" she asks with a frustrated expression, \"I said I SAVED you. Do you think I'd risk fighting two legendaries over a bite-sized morsel like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Wha...?\" you say sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already eaten. I killed a Caterpie after you two left,\" she explains, and you remember that scent of death inside her oral cavity. Something you could still smell now that you were being held so close to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I was too weak,\" she continues before closing her eyes in determination, \"But I won't let them take you again. I'll protect you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"... Protect me? From what?\" you ask quietly. The Weavile snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're the size of my...\" she chuckles before suddenly adopting a very blank expression, \"... You're very small. So everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Celebi and I...\" you try to muster up a sentence in this shocking turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said she ate you,\" the Weavile interjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you!\" you reply vehemently before losing steam, remembering you wouldn't even be here if not for her mercy, \"... Kind of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Your situation is improving!\" the Weavile laughs as you shake around in her grip, \"Heck, I'll even do you one better. We'll find a way to get you back to your original size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You will!?\" you suddenly burst out in surprise. You feared that this was some kind of trick, but felt your hopes rising regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! No offense but small guy = big liability,\" as the Weavile gently sets you down between her legs, \"If you went back to the way you were we could do lots of things, like hunt together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know of a way to help me?\" you ask skeptically, feeling like this was somehow too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" she replies cheerfully. Figures. Though you had to admit to yourself, that this Weavile appeared more eager in finding a solution than both Celebi and Mew, who seemed to be enjoying you at this size. And a far better option than trying to go at it alone.</span></div></div>",

The Weavile's smile fades, and her eyebrow rises as she stares at you curiously.<br>\r\n\"I want to be nowhere near your mouth... or the other places you mentioned before...\" you say, blushing vaguely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile lets your words sink in, before smirking again.<br>\r\n\"That's debatable...\" she retorts. You freeze up.<br>\r\n\"... Why?\" you ask, before starting to tense up.<br>\r\n\"... You aren't planning to eat me again, are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile snickers.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I am,\" she laughs, before seeing your face, deprived of color, with your mouth hanging open.<br>\r\n\"Aw come on - I was kidding!\" she exclaims playfully, placing her claws down  in between her legs as she bends over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, seriously, just imagine what would happen if me and you ran into Celebi and Mew at some point,\" she then explains with a serious expression, which she hardly maintains as she witnesses you pale and speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about what would happen if they find you with me... I wouldn't be able to fight them back for long - just see what happened with Mew...\" she recalls, instinctively bringing a claw to her face, where Mew slapped her with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up as your face regains a bit of color.<br>\r\n\"... Just what are you trying to say?\" you ask, your vocal chords working again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm saying, if they happens, I'll have to run at some point, no? And, unless you want to be left with them again, I'll have to carry you...\" she nervously gestures for her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever little bit of color your face managed to regain fades again.<br>\r\n\"No way!\" you shout, recalling how you were almost killed while Mew and the Weavile fought while you were still in her mouth. You almost got a close meeting with one of her fangs, and you were mercifully thrown out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want to experience such thing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark weasel frowns.<br>\r\n\"Look, remember what happened earlier with my claws?\" she asks. You instinctively touch your left arm, the one she scratched while running from Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I-I... what would happen if you swallowed me?\" you reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile brings a single claw up to her temple as she nervously scratches her head.<br>\r\n\"Well... I'll be extra careful I guess...\" she responds.<br>\r\n\"Though if that happens, I'll have to spit you back out...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe promise made you a little bit more comfortable. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if... what if you don't manage to...?\" you ask, dreading the scenario of yourself slowly melting in a pool of gastric acid. You have already experienced that twice. Sadly, Weavile hasn't the ability to travel through time, nor she hasn't any psychic powers which she could use to bring you back up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Weavile blushes as she starts laughing nervously.<br>\r\n\"Well...\" she awkwardly says.<br>\r\n\"Then your only option would be to take the... \u2018natural route\u2019...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush massively as your face contorts into an expression of sheer disgust.<br>\r\n\"Oh God...\" you mumble as you try to shake off the image from your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile keeps snickering to herself.<br>\r\n\"Anymore questions?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Which don't involve my intestines?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wildly shake your head in embarrassment, causing the Weavile to snicker again. You then look up at her.<br>\r\n\"Well... about me regaining my original size...\" you say, getting back on topic.<br>\r\n\"... How do we do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Weavile responds as she suddenly quiets down, placing a claw under her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thinks for a few minutes, before giving a defeated sigh.<br>\r\n\"I'm clueless.\" she admits, closing her eyes and holding her claws up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour expression becomes one of annoyance as you huff. Just your luck, you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, relax,\" the giantess says, attempting to comfort you. Gently, her claw grips the back of your shirt, and the ground starts receding as she lifts you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you are dangling in front of her face.<br>\r\n\"We'll do it somehow. We might even have to leave the forest but... I promise we'll find a way to grow you back. In the meantime, I'll protect and feed you,\" she says, her mouth cracking up in a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, before smiling a bit yourself.<br>\r\n\"That's... nice, I guess...\" you respond, causing her to snicker as she begins to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might not be the best friendship ever... but I guess it'll go just fine...\" she chimes.</span></div></div>",

Night's sill young, y'know!\" she stated, looking at the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy its position, you judged that it couldn't be later than 2 or 3 AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, can't we do something in the morning?\" you insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you realized how dumb your question was. As a nocturnal predator, Weavile slept during the bright part of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Weavile said, her smile returning as she noted your resigned expression,<br>\r\n\"Now, since bug-types aren't that filling... or tasty...\" Weavile assumed a disgusted expression, her tongue stuck out and her body shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm going to hunt again,\" she continued with a sigh, making you remember that she was one predator that didn't like hunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're coming along!\" her tone was much brighter now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" you asked, recalling the disastrous results of you going with her earlier.<br>\r\n\"... Am I going into your mouth again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Weavile chimed,<br>\r\n\"I told that earlier too, remember? Unless you want to try that other option I mentioned...\" her cheeks flared up at this, but you paid the last comment no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO way!\" you retorted, flailing your legs and waving your arms,<br>\r\n\"You almost killed me last time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, will be extra careful now!\" she chimed, stomach growling in hunger.<br>\r\n\"Hear that? Let's hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to oppose again, to remind Weavile that Celebi or Mew could be searching for you, that she might risk another fight in which you or her (or both of you) could be killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you remembered that the two legendaries were asleep, unaware of what happened to you while they slept, and your mouth fell back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply adopted an expression of annoyance as you waved an arm in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Hold on!\" Weavile said happily, once again opening that dreadful, fang-filled cavern that smelled like death... not yours, hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two claws holding you hovered closer to the giantess' oral cavity and gently slid you past her razor-sharp teeth, placing you on top of the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few drops of saliva fell from her palate as he claw retracted, causing you to get hit by the sticky liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness fell as Weavile's lips returned back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess took a moment to enjoy your taste, before she moved towards the nearest tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled again. From your position dangerously close to the giantess' stomach, it felt like a thunderstorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt eventually ceased, and the only sounds that could be heard were your captor's heartbeat and her scaling the tree outside, although you couldn't possibly know; you were trapped in darkness, left unable to see anything of what was going on outside while you were thrown to and fro in the mouth as Weavile moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the weasel climbed up to a high branch, much like she had done earlier. There, she stood up and started leaping from branch to branch, from tree to tree with masterful agility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as the movements increased, you being thrown around more as a consequence. Plus, you had to bear through the occasional rumble coming from downwards and you had to constantly hold on to the giant tongue in order to not end up impaled on one of the many, many fangs that formed a solid, deadly wall of white in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it all came to an end as Weavile leaped to one last branch, before she spotted something green peeking out of a bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't tell what pokemon it was though... well, she was about to find out soon, she thought dejectedly as she raised one of her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever pokemon it was, it looked like it wasn't moving, so Weavile assumed it was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, she climbed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt tears in her eyes as she turned around and scanned the ground with more attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi had woken up from her sleep because of a bad dream, in which she had lost her precious little human; waking up, she had found that her nightmare came true: the little human she was so fond of was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Celebi had immediately left Mew to wander around in her own forest in search of the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a particularly hard task, she knew the forest like her wings, she could find him easily; but each minute that passed without him squeezed in her hug made her worry increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to find him, and soon, or he might have ended up as food for some predator. The forest was full of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time she heard the cry of a pokemon in distance, Celebi's heart leaped within her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as she was about to move on to another place, she heard paw-steps right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she barely had time to turn around to see a set of claws darting direction of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi had less than a split second to step aside, the claws passing her and hitting the air, before retreating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Celebi thought she was unharmed, but the sudden drop of something sticky and warm on her foot told her that the claw touched her, opening a small cut in her green skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith horror, Celebi realized that someone just attempted to kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, she rose to her full height to face whoever's claws those were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she found face-to-face with a Weavile, who backed up, horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi had woken up, and she just attacked her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bii...</span>\" the green legendary hovered in mid-air and out of the bush, menacingly close to the startled Weavile, whose jaw opened so suddenly that you couldn't help but tumble down and out of it, one of the sharp fangs partially scratching your arm in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell down and screamed, drawing the attention of both giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, something gripped you, and you found yourself going up instead of down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes with reluctance, finding Celebi's glowing as she held with psychic, regarding your saliva-coated body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at you for a couple minutes, in which Weavile backed up, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Celebi's face contorted into an expression of pure rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">BI!</span>\" she screamed, glaring daggers at Weavile, obviously having jumped to the wrong conclusion that Weavile wanted to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard to come to such conclusion, you thought, you literally fell from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it, why was Celebi even awake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe furious legendary started hovering closer to the utterly scared Weavile, you in tow, ready to make the weasel face her wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi glowed green and, for a moment, your mind saw Zoroark where Weavile was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered what end the vixen faced, sent in another era by Celebi's time-traveling abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime itself seemed to stand still as a green aura began enveloping Weavile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike it all had been just a nightmare, the aura faded, a small breeze blew through the woods, and Celebi looked down at you questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't move, held by psychic, but you could at least speak,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi, I know you're angry, but this is ALL a huge misunderstanding!\" you stated. Coming from your mouth, it sounded quite ironic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi cocked her head, while Weavile smiled in your direction, silently thanking you for avoiding her a horrible fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi?!</span>\" Celebi asked while glaring at Weavile once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! You need to let me explain, you might do something you might regret!\" you said, and you felt like you were back in the cave with the same weasel that was currently shaking in front of you, back when she wanted to make a snack out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Celebi's gaze traveled back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi.</span>\" she said quite coldly, though you couldn't understand her and simply opted to ask once more,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Celebi...\"</span></div></div>",

What if their version was true? Again, it seemed so improbable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi snapped out of her own mind to see that Weavile was blushing; she looked down at you, but avoided her gaze, having found an extremely interesting rock on the ground by the feet of the legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mythical pokemon looked back at the dark-type in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Answer me.</span>\" she demanded, but Weavile still didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting on Celebi's nerves, she was about to forget this and attack, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Re-Remember when Zoroark knocked you out?\" you suddenly asked, looking up and staring at the green giantess who was holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked confused. Of course she remembered that fiendish vixen that kidnapped her human, hurt her and Mew before she was unceremoniously sent somewhen back in time; Celebi didn't know for sure when she had sent her, but she didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she had to know right now was if this new dark-type was going to suffer the same fate as the first or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Celebi nodded slowly, her gigantic head (which was several times your height) rising and falling, a small breeze caused by the movement blowing past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yeah. Ehm...\" this was a delicate part of the story,<br>\r\n\"You see, Weavile... uh... <i>brought me away</i> from Mew...\" you admitted, looking down; almost immediately, your ears registered a loud gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was <i>saving</i> him!\" Weavile hastily explained, holding her claws up as she attempted to justify herself,<br>\r\n\"Your friend attacked me - what else should I have done?

I... God, I was sleeping, okay? I didn't even realize he was with me!\" Weavile explained and for a moment you remembered the cut on your arm, shivering lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part that followed was going to make Celebi really angry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I realized I had him I... he told me he was being chased and...\"<br>\r\n\"...

I kinda lied to her.\" you bluntly admitted, shivering; instead, for the briefest moment, Weavile snickered lowly, earning an irritated glares from your green protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... and things got real nasty then... Weavile believed my lie... far too much, and tried to eat me <i>for real</i>...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment those words left your lips, two things happened: Weavile's smirk faded and Celebi snarled, a long, murderous, high-pitched \u2018Biiii!\u2019 escaping her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Weavile held her claws up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, I was delirious, I didn't eat or sleep in whole day! We... the human talked his way out and managed to convince me go got hunting instead,\" Weavile said without breathing between each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, she had to pause to inhale deeply and for several times before being able to speak again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's when we re-encountered Mew,\" instinctively, the dark-type brought a paw to her cheek, feeling the skin under her fur prickling where Mew slapped her with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Who brought me back to you. Then, Weavile took me again,\" you finished.<br>\r\n\"And here we are... talking about this. Seriously,\" you continued, despite the glare that had formed upon Celebi's face,<br>\r\n\"Weavile wasn't trying to hurt me.\" this was the truth... okay, she may have TRIED to hurt you at first, but then decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you discovered that, after having gotten used to her dark sarcasm, she was a good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... that's true,\" the still startled weasel agreed,<br>\r\n\"I don't like... I don't like hunting... or killing. I would have never tried to eat the human if I wasn't <i>that</i> hungry, believe me.\" she continued in an apologetic manner, but you couldn't tell if she was apologizing to you or Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably to both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi listened to every word in silence, with a cold stare on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when neither you or Weavile added anything else to the concluded story, she acted.</span></div></div>",

I need to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile's playful smile fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" she exclaimed,<br>\r\n\"No! No no no, what do I do if you sleep?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, knowing why she was acting like this: Weavile are predators of the night that sleep during the bright hours of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I need to sleep Weavile. Just a few hours... please?\" you asked, causing the giantess to sign loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But... I'm still hungry! I need to hunt!\" she complained. By some coincidence (or she could do it at will?), her stomach growled in that moment.<br>\r\n\"See?... I have an idea!\" she then chimed, drawing what little attention you managed to muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can put you in my mouth and you could rest there while I hunt!\" she suggested, causing you to go white as a sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?\" you retorted,<br>\r\n\"Even if I managed to sleep in there with all the moving around, I'd be swallowed with all the moving around!\" you reasoned, the previous talk about an absolutely unwanted trip through her intestines emerging in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile huffed, having nothing to counter your logic with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" she resigned.<br>\r\n\"I'll let you sleep. But you'll have to match your times with mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eventually... and only until we find out how to grow me back up.\" you clarified, making the dark-furred giantess snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might take years, you know,\" she said as she started walking with you held in a claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered at the perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Let's just hope not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the trip to a small cave you recognized, you and Weavile were silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess placed you on the stone floor, before laying down beside you, claws stretched above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy now? I could be eating right now, y'know...\" she pointed out, causing you to smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correction: you would be killing right now. You want that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken.\" she admitted as you too laid down on the stone floor; maybe it was because you had gotten used to sleeping on Celebi pretty quick or because you were laying on stone, but the ground felt really uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Weavile asked instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not used to sleep on the ground...\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant dark-type snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you're uncomfortable, you can come laying against me. After all, we'll be sticking together for quite a while...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? You'd crush me in your sleep!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... there's always the alternative...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes and an awkward discussion later, you discovered that, despite her being an ice-type, Weavile's belly could be a really soft and warm bed; the fur didn't even surround you completely, but it still worked as a wonderful blanket. And, luckily, her claws were at a safety distance from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was your last thought before you slid into a deep slumber, with the immense blush slowly fading from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that you finally fell asleep, the giantess you were resting on snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, then. See ya in the morning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BIIIIIIIIIII!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream echoed around in the forest for a while, waking up several pokemon... and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head and upper body hastily sped upwards as you sat up, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed was that the cave was now enlightened by sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been morning, you judged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, you noticed that you were still laying not on Celebi, but on the Weavile you met yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you thought to yourself, that wasn't a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was really going to help you regaining your size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, you walked to the edge of her belly and looked down: not too much of a fall, but it was still high enough to break both your legs if you were stupid enough to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you definitely weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, grabbing the strands of the thin, black fur you started climbing down to the floor of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile was probably going to sleep until the sun set, you thought, unless you woke her up... in which case she probably wasn't going to be too pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down beside the sleeping giantess and sighed, while your stomach growled, asking to be filled. Hopefully with something different from berries of any size and shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BIII!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively looked down, taking several moments to realize that it wasn't a particularly loud growl of your stomach that resounded in the whole forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did have a clue of what it was, but you hoped that it wasn't her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you walked towards the entrance of the cave and peeked out, right in time to see each green blur flying past the cavern at supersonic speed before stopping nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked heartbroken as she lowered herself to ground level, scanning each inch of the ground with tears rolling down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight alone made you feel guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exactly knew that the legendary was searching for you: you imagined her waking up expecting to find you still cuddled to her, looking around when she noted that you weren't; and when she finally figured out that you were missing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Mew mew!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden behind a corner, you noted a pink pokemon coming into view as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew didn't look as desperate as her friend did, but had a look of determination on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Mew!</span>\" she spoke, causing Celebi's face to drop onto the hard floor as she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you felt even more guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when both had eaten you, they treated you with kindness; and now, you were running away from them, causing both legendaries to worry while also causing Celebi, who had proclaimed her love for you, to be heartbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should have just-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head to rid it of such line of thinking; you weren't sure where that even came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting your size back was more important than anything else right now, and if sticking to Weavile meant that you were going to stop being a snack to every pokemon you met, you were going to stay with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, your perfect schemes were ruined as Mew suddenly looked away from her crying friend to look at the cavern you were currently hiding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Mew...</span>\" she muttered as she hovered towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill traveled down your spine as you disappeared behind the corner, pressing yourself against the stone wall, hoping it could just swallow you and spit you out when Mew realized that you weren't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink giantess floated inside the cave, not noticing you right under her nose. The corner provided you with a little bit of shade, but any more accurate exam would have blown your cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew began inspecting around the cave, when she noticed the sleeping Weavile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Mew stood still: yesterday, the human was kidnapped by a Weavile, and was brought in the same cave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't be a coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thought Mew had was that the human was eaten; but then, she remembered his words, \u2018She was actually very nice to me\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the human in the cave? Maybe hiding from the Weavile herself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe discarded the possibility, but kept it in mind: after all, it was still a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew inspected the area around the sleeping pokemon, then proceeded to examine the entire cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her, backing up against the wall even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done examining the whole cave, Mew looked at the sleeping Weavile again, remembering that time when she had knocked her out with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt vaguely guilty, had the Weavile been sleeping since she left her in the same came she was in now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head; if the Weavile really wanted to eat the human, he wouldn't have told her to save the weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned, Mew was about to leave the cave empty-handed, when a particularly interesting corner drew her attention: she was sure she had seen something moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart, and whole being, stood completely still as you felt Mew's gaze on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she notice you? It seemed like it, judging by the way she was narrowing her eyes, trying to see better.</span></div></div>",

She was nice like I told, remember? We're friends Mew!\" you hastily explained, earning a second look from Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at you for an eternal minute, in which the only sound that could be heard was the crying of the green legendary just out of this cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Mew spoke in your mind again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">...

I don't want to come Mew. I want my size back, I told you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew looked taken aback. A look of sadness replaced the cheerful one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Y-You want to stay here...?</span></i>\u2019 she asked, dumbfounded,<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">B-But...

Whatever.\" you replied, knowing it was a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt broke your heart to do so, but you had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew nodded slightly as she emulated Celebi and laid down, wrapping her tail around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just laid there on top of Celebi, hearing - and feeling - the two pokemon snoring soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then you dared to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you only had to wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have fallen asleep at some point, because you were awakened by a voice calling for you in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes, finding a very familiar Weavile standing beside Celebi with an upset glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you yawned,<br>\r\n\"Hey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Dude, what gives!?</span>\" Weavile hissed while throwing her claws forward in indignation,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax.

So? Here to \u2018save\u2019 me again?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile gave a small grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Of course!</span>\" she whispered,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Just stay still for a moment...</span>\" she said, her grin fading as she began lowering herself towards Celebi, ready to snatch you out from under her paws...</span></div></div>",

Her feet lift off the ground as she hovers in midair, before slowly starting to venture into the dark depths of Ilex Forest. The human couldn't have gotten too far... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the darkness, along with the human's size, she had to look carefully in every spot to find him. So she lowers herself to ground level as she proceeds, scanning each inch of the grassy forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile doing so, Celebi tries to think of the reasons that might've made him leave her in the middle of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible thought finds its way inside her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What if... what if her ran off...?

It sounded like a reasonable explanation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please cutie... just be okay... I'm coming...</span>\" she whispers to herself as she continues her quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Weavile complains upon hearing your suggestion.<br>\r\n\"What do I do if you sleep?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, but I need to sleep Weavile.\" you bluntly reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffs.<br>\r\n\"Look.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I get it: nocturnal predator.

Or was he not? And if he was around, why didn't he respond to her? The voice of the patroness should have been enough to scare off any predator... Although her human couldn't understand her, he would surely recognize her and approach once he was free to do so, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi keeps searching the ground and plants, carefully examining bushes and the roots of trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the more she searched, the more grew the idea that her human was either eaten, or he left her because of what she did or he was hiding from some predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please be okay...</span>\" Celebi mumbles to herself, starting to feel tears in her eyes as she moves on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cry.

Facing the forest's dangers or facing the wrath of a jealous legendary?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had more chances in the forest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you bit the bullet and started running through the dark forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were normal-sized, you would have gotten lost for sure; at your current size, Ilex Forest was an endless maze of green, darkness and dangers full of predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you didn't get very far, you discovered when you heard the voices of the two giantesses you left behind, still talking to each other. Then, you heard a desperate cry and the sound of leaves shaking... Celebi was moving again! You had to get back to the shrine before she did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you jumped behind a bush, opting for a safer route - running out in the open would make as much sense as inviting the nocturnal predators of the forest to eat you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you had to stop to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't have any time to do so, you discovered when the ground started trembling, the vibrations causing you to lose your balance and fall on your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremors stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind screamed you to stay still and wait for whatever was out there to get lost before starting to move again... but curiosity was too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back on your feet as you peered from the bush you were hiding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a gigantic, bipedal bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Ursaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to ignore its <i>sharp</i> claws, the <i>sharp</i> fangs exposed from its open mouth and the absolutely <i>terrifying</i> expression on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to make a mental struggle to not run off in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you soon regretted not doing so as the Ursaring started smelling the air, probably having picked on a foreign scent... you! It smelt you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in fear as the huge bear started looking around, trying to locate you. And your heart started galloping within your chest as the Ursaring turned its head to look straight down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sick as you closed your eyes, waiting for a claw to grab you, throw you inside of the Ursaring's mouth and end your torment. Just when you were so close to finding help getting back to your original size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, fate decided to lend a hand... almost as if it realized how cruel it has been to you so far and was trying to make it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ursaring turned its head away as it started walking off, not having seen you in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the large bear was fully gone, you dared to sigh in relief, feeling like your legs were melting as you fell out of your hiding spot, hitting the ground with your knees. Your heart was racing, beating like a drum. You were quite certain that, against any logic, it was going to break out of your ribcage and pop out from your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, at least you were sa-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo large paws grabbed you by your sides and lifted you off the ground. Startled, you looked up... but your vision got eclipsed by a pair of equally large lips, which made contact with part of your face, smooching you. Your limbs went limp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were briefly pulled back, before being shoved in a wide, smooth surface and being rubbed up and down against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" Celebi chimed happily as she nuzzled you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finally found her precious little human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breath cut short by the affectionate fairy, you shove both your hands on the fairy's cheek and pushed yourself back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you noticed her blue eyes staring straight at you. Next thing you noted was her expression - she didn't look pleased at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi?!</span>\" she cried, almost deafening you and causing a lingering pain in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven to you, her first question was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm Celebi... y'see, I was...\" you paused to gulp. You didn't know if it was the fear you felt earlier - and that you're currently feeling - or the exhaustive run you made... but your throat was practically dry. But that gave you the perfect excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Thirsty.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fairy looked at you, skeptical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to believe you... but it didn't make any sense. Why risk your life in a forest full of dangers, in the middle of the night, for some water? When you could simply have woken her up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why are you looking at me like that? I didn't even drink - I got lost...\" you lied, before looking to the side.<br>\r\n\"... Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy sighed, convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wake me up the next time, silly,</span>\" she incomprehensibly said, before smiling a bit.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">As for your drink...</span>\" she mumbled, starting to fly somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly wondered where the fairy was headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were soon answered as she flew past a few trees and stopped in front of a small lake you recognize, having already seen and bathed in it earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi flew above the water and gently started lowering her paws, which were clasped around your stomach. Celebi was holding you so you could drink safely without falling into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Thank you, Celebi.\" you said, before turning your attention to the water, seeing your reflection... and the one of the giant fairy holding you. She was looking expectantly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou HAD to drink after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you took a few sips, the water sliding down your throat and into your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drank until your thirst was quenched, before raising your head from the water, small drops of the liquid falling from your lips and back into the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you were pulled backwards as Celebi stood up in midair and smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy leaned closer to peck you... before opening her mouth wide as a wave of humid, berry-smelling air blew past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just impolitely yawned in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, while the giantess giggled.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sorry!</span>\" she said cheerfully, pecking you like she originally intended.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">And now, back to sleep...</span>\" she drowsily added as she started hovering away from the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither she had a phenomenal sense of orientation or she knew the forest like her wings, because Celebi got back to the shrine in less than five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pink figure was sleeping at the foot of it, tail coiled around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew sure slept heavily, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi quickly laid beside her friend, pulling you in a hug. Her lips briefly landed on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Good night, cutie...</span>\" she said with a yawn, hugging you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, but yawned too, recalling the argument with Weavile about spending the dark hours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about her, you figure you should really catch some sleep before she gets back to pick you up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you close your eyes, letting darkness take you as you slide into sleep...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From her perch on top of a high tree branch, Weavile looked down into the clearing where the famous shrine of Ilex Forest was. There, she saw them: the patroness of the forest Celebi, one of the most powerful legendaries, Mew, that had her knocked out without even using her powers - it still stung where her tail slapped her - and, sleeping on Celebi's chest, the tiny human she befriended earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human. It was for him she came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huntress sighed - there was no way of getting him back now. Him and Mew were asleep, but Celebi had her eyes half open, her left paw caressing the small creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, she loved him... Weavile looked at the scene in silence, taking it as a confirm to the human's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVibrations in her ears - any predator worthy of that name has to be equipped with a good hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi yawned, her paws clasping around the human and her eyes closing. Weavile sighed - she had to wait for the green legendary to be in a state of deep sleep before getting the human. It wasn't a problem - a hunter also needs to be patient and wait for its prey. Such process can go on for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human had his taste of hunting... and she had her taste of him: he was inside of her mouth throughout the whole thing and Weavile ended up attacking Mew, too hungry to think straight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, that ended quite poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down again, Celebi seemed to be asleep now... she gulped. She hated that part - the human had almost screamed when she did this for the first time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe prepared to climb down... but gave a yawn, before hastily covering her mouth with a claw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a new light shined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile looked around, choking back a groan. The sun was starting to rise over the horizon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huntress sighed. She had no choice but to retreat now - nocturnal predators didn't like sunlight too much. So, she decided to relent for now... it'd be harder to grab the human with the sun bothering her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, once it was gone again, she was definitely coming again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she would rescue her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came to Ilex Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun fully rose up in the sky as the moon started to take its leave. And, despite her nightly adventure in search of the tiny human who she eventually found, Celebi began to fidget in her sleep quite early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo anyone, the sight of a fairy and a pink cat sleeping together would be adorable. To you, who had explored them from a new point of view, they were two scary titans who could crush you with a finger if they only wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi relaxed again, sending her consciousness back into the depths of her mind. Probably she'll wake up soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, her movements were enough to wake a groaning you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened as you sat upright...or better, you <i>tried</i> to sit upright. But you found yourself laying belly-down on your green, grass-smelling \u2018bed\u2019, a strong force applying pressure on your back... but you knew that it was nothing more than Celebi's small but extremely long arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... Celebi...\" you groaned drowsily as you glanced at your \u2018girlfriend\u2019... or better, your \u2018possessive, very very dangerous giant captor who claimed you as hers\u2019. True, you had her to thank for the fact that you were still here to feel conflicted about her, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still asleep... you had to admit, she looked pretty adorable like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Adorable\u2019...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... that's weird...\" you murmured to yourself, not sure where that thought came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Celebi was still asleep, keeping you restrained in her hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, feeling like her paws could break your spine at any moment. Plus, the smell of grass emanating from her skin was starting to become unbearable... no surprise from a grass-type, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started fidgeting in Celebi's grip as you tried to free yourself without waking her up. You weren't sure of what was left to explore of her nature, but you certainly still didn't have a clue about her morning mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAided by some luck, you managed to slip out from under the arms of the fairy and standing on top of her light green bosom, the soft, squishy ground sinking a bit under your feet. You looked around, spotting the other giantess, Mew, sleeping next to the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew...\" you muttered. Since you met her, Mew had proven to be useful and loyal. Her telepathy allowed you to understand the words of your \u2018girlfriend\u2019, and when Weavile took you yesterday, she hunted her down to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure about Celebi, but Mew was definitely your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Celebi and took a few seconds to inhale fresh air and make sure that the fairy was still asleep, before moving to the edge of her body and sliding down to the ground, the soft grass granting a safe landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood and looked around... finally, you had your idea of how small you truly were as you discovered that you could make eye contact with a blade of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did you even end up in this forest...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou casually started walking, wanting to rid your head from such sour thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you put a good amount of distance between you and the two sleeping legendaries, you heard a soft cry behind you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around, discovering Celebi sitting upright, shooting you a drowsy but questioning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Just walking around.\" you hastily explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi either was too sleepy to register your words or she didn't believe you, because her expression didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep yawn rang in your ears, before you find yourself being lifted from the ground by a psychic grip. Celebi was telekinetically drawing you towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour flight didn't last long as you stopped back in your original place behind Celebi's green, long arms, which closed around you like two powerful Ekans with a yummy Rattata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy lowered her head in her paws, her lips landing on the left side of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah... mornin\u2019...\" you said, Celebi pulling back to give you a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt somewhat relieved - so, her morning mood was identical to her usual mood, huh? That was good... you thought.  Celebi was... sweet for sure, but unpredictable and quite mischievous at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi.</span>\" came from above as one of her paws started caressing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Celebi casually looked at the sleeping Mew. Then, her gazed moved onto you.  Then onto Mew again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Celebi's gaze fell on you as she stared at you in silence, but with a smile spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped - that smile could mean no good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you were wrong about her morning mood...</span></div></div>",

This was the perfect moment to finally have some private \u2018fun\u2019 with her human. Mew was asleep, nobody was around and her mind was full of all the nice things she could do to you. Her head didn't actually cease coming up with new ones since yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you - you were so helpless, trapped in her tiny paws! She could easily stick you into... places. She could sit on you to enjoy your squirms and screams. She could swallow you again - feeling you squirming in her stomach the first time she ate you was amazing, it felt like an internal belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll great ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the giant fairy in front of you. She was now officially scaring you, wearing a creepy grin on her face, her cheeks crossed by a deep red shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had your idea of what was going on in her head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the fairy, she finally decided what type of game she wanted to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong all the nice ideas, feeling you squirming and screaming while she tasted you over and over... that made her shiver with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your eyes, Celebi spread her legs, you blushed furiously as her uncovered sex came into view. Hastily, you covered your eyes with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Celebi giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Shy, aren't we?</span>\" she chimed, the giant fingers of her left paw removing your small hands from your eyes with minimal effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could catch another glimpse of her sex, Celebi moved a paw underneath your chin and raised your head so that you were looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still smirking and blushing, and you were quite certain that she was breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou imagined her heart, galloping within her chest. Listening close, you were sure you could heart it, pounding the walls of Celebi's chest from the inside... and you had a feeling that it was going to be even louder from your next location...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi eyed you like a Mandibuzz with her next prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she spoke,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">... You know... you're really very precious to me...</span>\" she said, even though you couldn't possibly understand her, her voice losing its characteristic gentle tone to assume a more mischievous one.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">When I lost you last night... I thought I was going to be alone again...</span>\" she revealed, momentarily losing her smirk as she shook off such thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now Celebi... let's not be hasty... let me d-down...\" you stammered, now officially afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy ignored you. She looked deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smirk came back to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You know... yesterday, you actually healed me... I never got to thank you properly, cutie...</span>\" she said, her giant face inching closer, to the point you could smell her breath... it smelt like mint and whatever she last ate.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let me...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately glanced at Mew, she was still asleep and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong force came down on your head as it was turned so you were facing Celebi again. You discovered her paw on top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the fairy leaned forward... before she too looked at Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she woke up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled. Such things require privacy, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding you in her paw, the giantess got up, her feet leaving the ground as she hovered in the air. She looked up and smiled - the highest branches of that tree over there should be enough, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge sense of vertigo assaulted you as Celebi took flight, the shrine, the ground and the sleeping Mew receding beneath you as the fairy hovered upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew far up in the air and reached one of the highest branches of a tree and hovered above it before sitting down, making sure to spread her legs in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo avoid looking \u2018below the belt\u2019, you kept looking at Celebi's smirking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">As I was saying...</span>\" you were moved in front of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could complain, the two lips parted again,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Let me thank you.</span>\" Celebi whispered sultrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, forward went your world as you were pushed face-first into the eager pair, which pressed against your face as their owner kissed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi held the kiss for a minute, before pulling off, eyeing your blushing face with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips came down on your visage a second time, eclipsing your sight for a short moment before the fairy pulled back, smirking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the third time, Celebi kissed you... this time, her lips didn't leave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose same lips suddenly parted ways, leaving her mouth wide open while your head fell down, hitting one of the teeth of the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumid air hit you, but you didn't have much time to think about it. The upper lip came down on your head, sealing it inside the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been a miracle, you thought as you went pale, you weren't decapitated by the teeth. What you didn't know was that Celebi was being careful to not hurt you. Though she felt euphoric - why was this always so... arousing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cele-\" a strong suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour neck joined your head into the confines of the mouth, the rest of your body starting to follow as you were pushed past the teeth and onto the giant tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi closed her eyes and moaned as her lips took in your chest and stomach, then your waist. Your knees flailed outside of the mouth, but Celebi took them in too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, with a smirk, she sucked your feet too inside her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, eyes closed, heart beating fast, Celebi slid a paw to her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then and there, she started rubbing with a pleased smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME OUT!\" you screamed in terror as you were thrown to and fro inside the cavernous mouth, big drops of sticky saliva falling down from the palate and onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stifled giggle erupted from the abyss behind you, while the slick red muscle under your feet kept licking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, you lost your balance and fell on your butt in a lake of saliva beneath the tongue, which didn't waste any time and was on you again in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to fight back, but it was obviously useless - you were too weak to fight back a tongue, that was humiliating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, everything around you shook. This time, you had an idea of what Celebi was doing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy giantess rubbed her crotch with a paw, the other gripped the branch, her tiny fingers sinking into the wood - why did this feel so good? Her heart and mind were racing, her mouth was drooling, her sex was dripping, it wouldn't be long before she couldn't hold it in anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi felt ecstatic, this was all so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Mhh...</span>\" she moaned, mouth full of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was overwhelmed by a strong wave of pleasure as she kept masturbating feverishly. Again, she wasn't an expert when it came to this kind of things, but it sure felt good... she imagined the feeling doubled if she just opted to stick you down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere thought of it made her cheeks flared up, her body burning hot as she continued rubbing. Yep, this was a \u2018game\u2019 she enjoyed \u2018playing\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, Celebi couldn't hold it in anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep moan erupted around you, lingering inside the closed mouth and almost deafening you. If Celebi had her mouth open, the sleeping Mew below would have woken up, along with several other pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time-traveler leaned against the trunk of the tree, a visible puddle forming in between her legs while she smiled in satisfaction as she let you rest on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't dare to move - you were dangerously close to the edge of the throat. One wrong move, and you were going down that abyss of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, she suddenly thought about swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly shook off the thought... but it came back, stronger. The mere thought of you sliding down her throat and into her stomach... she could make you her breakfast - your taste was fantastic, and she would enjoy her precious human squirming, rubbing her tummy from the inside before... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she would obviously undo all that with a quick trip back in time, bringing you back to life again... she had the power of traveling through time, why waste it...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head - you hit the slick squishy walls inside her mouth - trying to discard the thought, but it kept coming back, stronger and stronger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed back on the tongue, unmoving and dizzy. Why wasn't Celebi letting you out yet...?... She wasn't planning to swallow, was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were the one swallowing, but in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind rendered hazy by the intense, lingering pleasure, Celebi...</span></div></div>",

Saliva was sent down your own throat as you swallowed, knowing how this was going to end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi didn't even notice when she swallowed you, too lost in her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a loud - to you - scream and the sensation of something traveling down her throat made her mind snap back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had swallowed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy blushed - she didn't actually mean to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice echoing in the dark, vertical tunnel that was Celebi's esophagus, you slid past a meaty ring and plopped down into a very familiar room that was just a bit bigger than you were. This was the same chamber that gave you death nearly two days ago: Celebi's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell right into a steaming lake of gastric acid, the liquid burning your skin at touch. Even worse, Celebi didn't eat anything aside from you, so there was no chance you could even slow down your demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the color left your face, your legs seemed to melt - something that was going to happen very soon - and your heart started beating faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after your landing in the death chamber, you started screaming while you struggled, hoping to somehow just pass through the fleshy walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich obviously didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the time-traveling fairy giggled as she felt you struggling in her tummy. Since she had swallowed you, she was going the feeling of you rubbing her belly from within before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was going to bring you back the moment after! After all, the human was too precious for her to let go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew, she'd have one hell of a time making it up to him for this, but it would be worth it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell back into the acid after uselessly trying to climb up to reach the fleshy hole that led into this hell and, the other way around, to Celebi's esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply floated on the lake of gastric juice, wondering what did you do to deserve all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrunken and eaten by a fairy... twice! What a humiliating fate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision started to grow blurry, and you began to feel really light-weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was melting away, but you didn't even register the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething red and fleshy appeared instead of your skin, which was burned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes, to never open them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust one second before your demise, you heard <b><i>her</i></b> voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Bye cutie, see you soon enough~\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi felt all the struggling ceasing and smiled, partly sad, partly cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt obviously left her with a feeling of guilt, but she was going to undo this all again, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBring her precious human back, make him feel better before trying a new kind of \u2018game\u2019...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary giggled and patted her stomach a few times, as if the spirit of her beloved human was lingering in there and could understand what she was going to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet, legs and body left the tree branch as she hovered into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi glowed green for a short second, before she disappeared, gone back in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud moan echoed inside the slippery cave as Celebi kept licking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy relaxed, her paw lingering on her crotch as a puddle started to form in between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about swallowing, but she could never do it: a blinding light shone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled as another Celebi came out of nowhere, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Celebi from the future looked at herself,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So, ehm... you do know why I'm here, don't you?</span>\" she asked, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past Celebi nodded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">For this little cutie in my mouth?</span>\" she asked, pointing to her mouth, her voice raining on your form and almost deafening you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">No, for the little cutie in my stomach... you're done anyway...</span>\" Celebi said, pointing at the hand placed on her past counterpart's dripping crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past Celebi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Go ahead, go back to the future... It'd be weird for him to see two of us... again.</span>\" she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Celebi that had eaten you nodded, waved a paw and glowed green again, before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very happy legendary returned to her own time, cupping her paws together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, like it already happened once, a bright light shone, approached her paws as the human appeared onto them, unconscious but unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Welcome back cutie...</span>\" Celebi whispered, pecking your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bii~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groggily woke up, feeling extremely dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recalled what happened... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you alive? Or were you dead? All you remembered was a tall, white and golden figure... it talked to you, but you couldn't remember what it said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened, but all you saw was an indistinct mass of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision cleared a bit, and you noted that the indistinct mass of green was a pokemon, one you learned to fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared down at you, smiling. She was still sitting on the tree branch where she gave you death, she was holding you to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at yourself, you were alive, your skin wasn't burned, you could feel your blood traveling within your veins throughout your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so, you brought me back again. Why?\" you asked with cold calm,<br>\r\n\"To eat me again? To torture me some more? Didn't I suffer enough for your likings?\" you barraged, and the smile of the fairy faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't care about what she just said: the only thing you cared about right now was throwing your frustration right in the face of this devilish fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter if she killed you without bringing you back again, death would put an end to your suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? First you say that you love me, and then you eat me again! Just what is wrong with you?!\" you hissed, angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's expression changed, but not into one of anger; it was sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It was an accident...</span>\" she mumbled, though you couldn't understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your head, irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Let me go, Celebi.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Celebi shook her head. It wasn't hard to figure out why: her letting you go would be the equivalent of you throwing yourself from this tree branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Then leave me alone. Kill me, find another shrunken human or whatever. I'm done.\" you said, squirming in her grip to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi blinked, before she smiled, comprehensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Oh, I'm not going to do any of those things... you're still all mine, cutie,</span>\" she said, manipulating you so that you were looking at her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could speak again, your sight was eclipsed by a large pair of lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smooched you, then pulled back, leaving you blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You...\" after what you said, how could she still have any feelings left for you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy started caressing your face with a paw, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you found that smile quite reassuring... damn it. Damn Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You...\" you repeated, your anger and frustration fading as you recalled what position you were in.<br>\r\n\"... Don't do it anymore... please...\" you whispered, your bitter emotions replaced by fear, the one emotion that lingered in you the most these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Nope... I won't eat you again,</span>\" she said, before a smirk appeared on her face along with a blush.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But we can still do other things...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't understand her, but you didn't like her voice. Last time she used it, she ate you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, wondering what the fairy was up to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fairy giantess in front of you smirked at you, once again a blush and that creepy expression from before returning to her visage as she regarded your pitifully small body, trapped in her three-fingered grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You know cutie... I didn't really mean to eat you again,</span>\" she breathed sultrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't understand her, but you had your ideas of what she was saying to you. And you discovered that you weren't liking where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself struggling to free yourself from the grip of the giantess. Something comparable to trying to move a boulder with a toothpick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi didn't pay any mind to your struggles, given that you couldn't possibly escape her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You know, I had something else in mind...</span>\" she said that while she slowly spread her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but glance downwards as you saw her legs parting ways... and the sight of Celebi's sex made you blush massively, while it made you understand what had been going on while you were trapped in her mouth: the slit was still stained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't remove your gaze from such part of the fairy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you were thinking was going to happen was actually going to happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, yes: the paw holding you tightly was moving downwards, right towards the growing organ, which seemed eager to meet you up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" young shouted, embarrassed as well as scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, you looked up at the fairy, shooting a pleading look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't! I-I... you've just eaten me!\" you reminded her, hoping she'd decide to give you a break... for the rest of your permanence with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Celebi's grin and blush remained glued to her face. She snickered - that was a bad sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Nope... I waited long enough for this human... I would have done this earlier... but you wanted to bring Mew along!</span>\" Celebi exclaimed in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was her best friend, but as long as she was around, Celebi couldn't have her fun with her human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, Mew was asleep, she could freely do whatever she wanted. And, at this point, who else could bother her? Even if something did happen during the process, just a quick trip back in time and all would be fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be a clear abuse of her power, but Celebi didn't care. All she cared about right now was her human and her, alone and undisturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't let this opportunity go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Celebi...\" you muttered as the fairy's crotch grew bigger and bigger as you got closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a matter of seconds before you were standing face-to-face with the giant organ, which was dripping with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Ready~?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately glanced downwards, looking at the shrine below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, you were staring at Mew... who was sadly still asleep. No one was going to pull you out of this, you sourly realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet made contact with something soft and damp, and your gaze rose up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush spread across your face, and a lump formed in your throat as you saw your legs, up to your knees, sinking inside of the green giantess, who had started moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... this is a nightmare...\" you whispered to yourself, for some reason recalling the proposal Weavile made you yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smirked at you, her paw grasping your upper body as your lower sank into into her sex. You tried to forcefully swallow the lump in your throat as you slid in, now waist-deep into the organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last grin, a deafening moan raining on you before the paw was removed from you; a strong push on your head, and all the lights faded, your world becoming pink, dark and slick, as well as hot and tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you were back into her mouth as all the lights faded; it was slippery in here, there was even an abyss at the bottom of this endless, pink cave. The only difference was the lack of teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething you were grateful for. And, as much as your own crotch was telling you that you were enjoying this, you wanted to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around you started shaking, and you couldn't keep your balance; you fell face-down as a rain of moans began echoing inside the fleshy cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like being simultaneously in the middle of an earthquake and a thunderstorm, your surroundings starting to grow wet as Celebi, once again, masturbated feverishly, enjoying your involuntary movements within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt all of them - each time you tripped, each time you got back on your feet and tried to get to the entrance of her \u2018cave\u2019, only to slip again, pounding the slick floor of her vagina with your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">F-Fi-Fin-nally!</span>\" she shouted, quite certainly drawing the attention of several pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumb luck, Mew was a heavy sleeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud moans mixed with gleeful giggles resonated around you while you tried to keep your balance, wanting to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, you couldn't take a single step, because you kept falling due the fleshy walls shaking wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's legs flailed in mid-air, her paw sped up, the other gripped the tree she was sitting on; her heart galloped within her chest, her mouth drooled, her mind raced and her sex dripped and pulsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had awaited for this for so long, and it was finally happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">H-Human! L-Love! L-Love H-Human!</span>\" she shouted as pleasure overwhelmed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as you were about to give up, something happened: your world shook, and you were thrown face-down by the pulsing walls once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be hit a by a sticky wave of white water, which dragged you along the pink walls and threw you out of Celebi and onto the hard branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were blushing furiously, the sticky liquid dripping from your body while you struggled to regain your breath after having your lungs being subjected to a sickeningly sweet scent for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly turned, discovering the giant Celebi looking at you, exhausted but satiated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, whatever amount of air your body managed to take in was squeezed out as a large paw grabbed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy brought you up to her, using a free paw to wipe her liquids from your body before she pressed her lips on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi~</span>\" she chimed cheerfully, causing you to blush even more. This had been perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply perfe-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi lost her smile to adopt a focused expression: she was sure she had heard a noise coming from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she knew that only one pokemon was currently below her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing furiously, Celebi glanced downwards; so did you.</span></div></div>",

Your legs felt sore, but you were unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around, noticing, just in time, a green paw reaching out for you. In fear, you desperately dove out of the way, got back on your feet and started running as fast as your tiny legs could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, Celebi cried in alert,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wait!</span>\" she exclaimed, fully aware of why you were running. She had terrorized you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green legendary got up as well and started flying in your direction, chasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">S-Stop... please...</span>\" Celebi meekly shouted, but you kept running. All you wished for right now was to get as far as you could from this legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please... c-can't we just talk about this?</span>\" it was a dumb question, considering that Mew was asleep and you couldn't understand what Celebi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how you weren't stopping, Celebi tried to use her psychic powers to catch you... but she found it extremely hard to hit a moving target who was completely hidden by the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now panting and sweating, but the fear made you keep running. You had to hide, you had to run away, you had-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached large tree, you saw something between the roots... at your normal size, you wouldn't have even noticed it by accident, but there it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very small, maybe some pokemon dug it to find some food or something, but the hole looked big enough for you to fit inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you sped towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last cry from behind you, before the outside world faded as you jumped into the hole in between the roots of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your heart pounding your chest, you looked around, finding yourself in what seemed a small tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you had little time to think about it: the sky suddenly got dark as the gigantic palm of Celebi tried to penetrate the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you backed up from the giant paw and watched it as it desperately tried to enter the hole. But it was too big to fit inside... maybe this size had its advantages after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Celebi desperately tried to grab you, but her paw didn't fit inside the hole her human had jumped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a sigh, and neared her head to the small hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Human...

I'm sorry for what happened...</span>\" she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored her, mostly because you couldn't understand what she said, but also because you had no intention of talking to the unpredictable patroness of Ilex Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Please...</span>\" Celebi tried once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward, intending to kiss you, but the mere sight of her mouth approaching made you shiver as you backed up in Mew's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi pulled back, looking at you with pity and sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I-I... I-I'm sorry...</span>\" she whispered brokenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'll talk to him,</span>\" she muttered dejectedly, hating every second of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi couldn't do anything but meekly nod her head in agreement. Maybe Mew would be able to convince the human to forgive her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another sigh, the pink giantess holding you fluttered past Celebi and back to the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Mew lowered herself and gently set you down at the foot of the shrine. You let her - you blindly trusted Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink pokemon laid belly-down in front of you, her sapphire eyes towering above you as she looked at your tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you were, sitting on a patch of grass in front of her, meeting her gaze, knowing the she wasn't going to hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, Mew thought what would have happened if she was the one finding you instead of Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould she have eaten you too? Would she have fallen in love with you like her green friend did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head moved imperceptibly as she shook of the thought, before inhaling deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Human-</span></i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it.\" you interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew sighed.

I don't know why I'm still here talking about it... and I have a pretty good idea of what she was doing before pulling me out,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">It's because she loves you,</span></i>\u2019 she explained, causing you to blush,<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Trust me, Celebi only wanted to mess with you... but she didn't want to eat you.

It didn't seem like it when she ate me the other night.\" you bluntly recalled, the mere memory making you shiver while causing you to inhale sharply, frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew gave a dejected look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">I know that... but let me ask you something: you think she would have brought you back if she wasn't truly sorry about it? Do you think you'd be still here if she didn't truly love you?</span></i>\u2019 she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a cheap shot, Mew was deliberately making you feel guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... what?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink psychic-type giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">See? Celebi's done something good for you after all,</span></i>\u2019 she said, now smiling cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, that smile had the extraordinary result of making you feel reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Y-Yes,\" you said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n\"She brought me back to life... oh, and she was about to kill me again,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">I'm telling you she wouldn't have eaten you again,</span></i>\u2019 Mew repeated patiently, showing no signs of being tired of this one-sided conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at both Mew and you from behind, hoping that her friend was going to make her precious little human feel better... she didn't know what she was going to do if her human wanted to leave her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thought lingered in the fairy's head: why wasn't the human afraid of Mew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden sting of jealousy was added to the raging storm of emotions inside the patroness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">And that's why you should forgive Celebi,</span></i>\u2019 Mew continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive...?\" you weren't able to finish the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew wanted you to forgive Celebi after said fairy attempted to eat you for the second time? Not all the words Mew could telepathically speak were going to convince you that if Celebi wanted to swallow you, you'd be already digested and traveling across her intestines right now... the thought was disgusting, and you quickly discarded the line of thinking to focus on Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thought persisted in your head though: you briefly wondered why Celebi didn't actually swallow you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... she only really wanted to play? Was that her way of playing with shrunken humans?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you looked at the green giantess; she was looking at you pleadingly, the word \u2018please\u2019 written all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the briefest instant, you felt genuinely bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">You do trust me, right? I'll have a word with Celebi later... but, forgive her,</span></i>\u2019 she chimed.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">...

I \u2018stole the human away\u2019?! You started attacking me all of sudden!\" Weavile snaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Mew's paws glow azure as a sphere forms in between them. Before Weavile has time to react, Mew shoots the sphere at the weasel.<br>\r\n\"Mew! No!\" you shout, sliding off Celebi's belly and uselessly trying to stop the legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Weavile rises a claw and slams it against the Aura Sphere, tearing it in half. The sphere explodes, crafting a cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Weavile dashes forward, striking Mew with her claws, sending her flying into a tree. <br>\r\n\"Mew!\" you shout as you watch the pink legendary sliding onto the ground, laying motionless afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for the slap of before.\" Weavile says.<br>\r\n\"She was the one who moved you into the cave! You'd be dead if it wasn't for her!\" you shout to the dark type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" she asks, turning her head to look down at you, wearing a confused stare upon her face. However, a menacing \u2018Biii\u2019 makes her turn her head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile notices Celebi glaring daggers at her, her fists clenched in ire.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">First you steal my little human, then you hurt my best friend!</span>\" she spits venomously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Weavile's eyes, the grass type fairy floats over her, her open palm slamming against Weavile's cheek as Celebi slaps her across the face.<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" the dark type cries in pain, before shoving away Celebi with her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi!</span>\" the legendary cries, feeling something wet and warm on her body. She looks down, a single drop of blood rolling down her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Sorry?\" Weavile says upon realizing that she just hit the patroness of the forest she lives in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi...\" you say, taking a step back, knowing what comes next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">BIIIII!</span>\" the grass type legendary shouts, her paws forming a large, green ball, which she throws at Weavile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type dodges, the ball colliding in a tree and exploding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're so dead!</span>\" Celebi cries as she floats forward in a menacing manner, wishing nothing more than to get a grip of her opponent's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Weavile dodges.<br>\r\n\"Cut it out! What kind of guardian are you?! You should be protecting this place, not try to kill its inhabitants!\" she shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Protect?! You came out of nowhere, kidnapped my human, harmed my friend and me! Do I need anymore reasons to attack you?!</span>\" the fairy shouts, throwing another energy ball at her adversary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant you no harm! You and your friend started it! Now stop it!\" Weavile shouts, dodging yet another green ball of energy, which explodes behind her.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You meant us no harm?! You were the one who hurt the human earlier, weren't you?!</span>\" Celebi retorts, remembering the cut on your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! And I apologized! Because we are friends!\" Weavile snaps back.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Friends don't hurt friends!</span>\" the legendary fairy states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says you - you ate him!\" Weavile retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Celebi stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did the Weavile-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy growls as she glows green, a thousand, razor-sharp leaves encircling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile starts to glow blue, and the atmosphere suddenly gets chilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the scene, feeling useless. They'll end up destroying the forest if you don't do something... but what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to your horror, Celebi and Weavile unleash respectively Leaf Storm and Blizzard. You finally manage to think of something that might stop this nonsensical battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" you shout, throwing yourself in between the two deadly attacks. On one side, thousands of razor sharp leaves; on the other, a wave of frosty air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth aimed directly at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, hearing two shouts:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">BI!</span>\"<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the attacks collide, causing a huge explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by now, you're sure that you're dead for good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open.<br>\r\n\"Am I... Am I dead?\" you ask yourself as you notice that you're cowering in pure darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around. You should be dead... and yet your feel very alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human!\" the familiar voice of Weavile calls you, while a few, heavy steps shake the ground beneath you. You look around again, noticing the dark type rushing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your whole being is filled with shock as you notice Celebi laying on the ground beside you, looking extremely weak. Her closed eyes open up into two tiny slits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing you alright, she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you realize what just happened: Celebi saved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... you saved me...\" you say, walking up to her. Suddenly, all your frustration towards this legendary fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi responds by leaning forward, pecking you, causing you to blush. But you pay it no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if your body is moving on its own, you move to the giantess' face and hug her cheek.<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy moves a paw on her cheek, pushing you against it, nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she gazes up at Weavile, who had been staring at both her and the human, flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi had shielded the human with her own body from a collision that would have given him death. Perhaps, what he said earlier was true: she DID have feelings for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Why...?</span>\" the grass type weakly asks. You too rise your gaze to look at Weavile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Why... are you trying to hurt us...?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, like I wasn't before,\" Weavile huffs.<br>\r\n\"And I didn't steal the human away earlier today - I was trying to save him! We... he's my friend... I'm only trying to help him...\" Weavile awkwardly explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" you chime in, drawing Celebi's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary closes her eyes and sighs, deep in thought. Your world shakes as she suddenly sits up, still pinning you against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass type fairy keeps thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the Weavile lying? Or should Celebi trust her and let her explain herself?</span></div></div>",

Then, that too fades, replaced by an unmistakable emotion: anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">WHAT?!</span>\" Celebi shouts as she gets up and clenching her tiny fists, staring daggers at Weavile, who swallows nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ca-Calm down...

Celebi's eyes close into two tiny holes as she moves forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her attention is drawn by an almost imperceptible movement beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step in between Weavile and Celebi. <br>\r\n\"Celebi, don't do anything you might regret later.

To grow me back to my original size,\" you bluntly say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's mouth opens.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Wh-Wha...?</span>\" she asks in disbelief. She was the one who refused Arceus' help with this problem, because she thought that she could \u2018protect him better\u2019!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">B-B-But...</span>\" Celebi is interrupted when she hears a noise behind her.

You and Weavile have serious expressions, while Celebi looks flabbergasted.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Alright, what did I miss?</span>\" Mew asks while floating beside Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy ignores her to look back at the Weavile, who rubs the back of her head with a claw.<br>\r\n\"I offered my protection.

We did manage to save you!</span></i>\u2019 Mew chimed gently. She knew what you were going through, and she couldn't really blame you for feeling the way you felt... but she and her friend were starting to grow pretty tired of the argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You rescued me, only to expose me to another danger! How many other times will this happen?!\" you shouted, before looking down and sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you looked at the legendaries.<br>\r\n\"You know...

Gently, the fairy leaned forward to give you a small kiss, before pulling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure around you loosened as the green legendary released you from her hug and gently set you down on the ground, in between her, Mew and Weavile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you understand that it's the moment to make your choice, whether to stick with the legendaries or with the Weavile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response seemed pretty obvious but... you find that it was harder than you thought. Sticking with Weavile, or with Celebi and Mew... each of these two things carry advantages and disadvantages, you find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side, the pokemon that granted you her protection and the promise to give you back your size... but, for what you knew, she was completely clueless about how to restore your original height... and plus, she had attempted to eat you earlier. You couldn't ignore the possibility that she would try to make you her next prey if you chose to stick with her... plus, she had no idea of how to grow you back, no? What if it took months? Or years? What if there was no remedy and you were damned to live your life as a dustmite?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perspective was horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, Celebi and Mew. The first declared her love towards you, and was willing to protect you... but unwilling to help you restore your size. Sticking with her would mean having to remain in the forest with her for the rest of your days as a shrunken human... but, you guessed, the protection of a legendary was better than the protection of Weavile... plus, Weavile was an huntress... if she ran into some prey stronger than her, you'd lose your protector and, possibly, your life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention the fact that the dark type was a living weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you got too near her claws, or fangs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a sigh of exasperation as you look in between the three titanesses staring down at your waiting for your last say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you finally make your choice.</span></div></div>",

Friends...\" you mumbled to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a deep sigh as you sat down on the ground, arms wrapped around your knees as you realized that you just lost Weavile's friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a chance that she was coming back, but your mind told you that if she did, it was probably to eat you like she originally intended to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced backwards, at the time-traveler sitting on the ground behind you, at the floating pink cat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And here we are then...\" you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stared at you, blinking, still processing what had been going on. She felt sore - not because of the fight, she could have taken Weavile down with ease; no, she felt sore because she had shielded her human with her own body and, while Blizzard wasn't a problem, her own Leaf Storm certainly did a number on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that, she was tired, and was sure that Mew was in the same state as her: after all, she was thrown into a tree and was knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiled a bit. At least, her precious little human had ultimately opted to remain with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, she reached forward and scooped you up, hugging you. You sighed, leaning against her chest, seeking for any kind of comfort after losing the pokemon that had offered to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrown away the only chance you had, but the risks were too high and you were far, far too helpless to take them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, you were safe... you hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So... a friend, huh?</span>\" Celebi casually asked, trying to change subject, but failing poorly since you couldn't understand what she said because of an annoying language barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">I'm sorry, but what actually happened after she took you away?</span></i>\u2019 Mew telepathically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>She... wanted to eat me at first,</i>\u2019 you thought. It apparently worked, because Mew glared in the direction where Weavile went,<br>\r\n\u2018<i>But she didn't!

If there was one chance to grow back... I wasted it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink giantess tilted her head, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went quiet, and the telepathic silence lasted for a while, until Mew spoke in your mind again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Well... if you really hate that size...

Mew was no different; Celebi was no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were one of her few friends, and her first human friend... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Celebi was her friend too, like she had been for ages. They used to live together, until one year ago, the fairy had left to go to Ilex Forest because \u2018things are getting awkward Mew...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\" you asked hopefully after a while of simply staring at the pink giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one of her two friends was she going to listen to?</span></div></div>",

Then, seeing that Celebi wasn't showing any signs of wanting to wake up, Mew looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"cpink\"><i>Let's go.</i></span>' she spoke to you through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go... where?\" you whispered from Mew's furry arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"cpink\"><i>Somewhere else.

She couldn't afford fighting when she had you with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the trip for the pink legendary was lot less... 'exciting' than she anticipated, which was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all she knew, that Weavile from before could have tried to strike her in the back to take the human she was holding again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why Mew carefully watched where she was flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you were left entirely to yourself as Mew was seemingly paying you zero attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe the answer to your biggest problem was right under your nose for the whole time, but you guessed it was better late than never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing big... who knew what would happen afterwards, since Celebi was probably going to be pretty upset, but that wasn't the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely enough, you did not wish to live in a forest, but even more surely that green legendary who had claimed you as hers wasn't going to let you go so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought worried you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the flight came to a halt when Mew reached a small clearing illuminated by the moonlight. There were no traces that any Pokemon or human had ever been here, so it was perfect for a task this delicate without the fear of anyone interrupting and/or interfering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\"><u>This should do just fine.</u></span>\" she spoke to herself, fluttering to the middle of the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout moving, Mew brought her tail close and coiled it around your waist, before lowering it to the ground, where she gently let go of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"cpink\"><i>There we go,</i></span>' she spoke in a very serious manner, which was unlike her,<br>\r\n'<span class=\"cpink\"><i>Now, I'm going to try to grow you, but I guarantee nothing.

After all, Mew was a powerful legendary capable of anything, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you asked, not losing hope despite the worry that was starting to spread within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew looked away for a moment and blushed lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she sighed and looked back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><span class=\"cpink\">The chances this is going to work are pretty much the same chances it won't.</span></i>' she informed, before continuing, <br>\r\n'<span class=\"cpink\"><i>I've never done anything like this before.

Why should I trust you?</span>\" Celebi weakly asks Weavile, clearly not fully trusting her yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type sighs.<br>\r\n\"The human just confirmed what I told you. If you don't trust me, trust him,\" she says, frustrated. She didn't mean any harm to Celebi or Mew - alright, maybe she held some hard feelings for Mew, but she didn't mean to hurt her or Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just had to defend herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Trust her, Celebi,\" you say in a whisper, trying to convince the fairy that Weavile isn't an enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looks at you.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi...</span>\" she mumbles, still extremely weak from protecting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance downwards, noticing the fairy bruised where the sharp leaves and the frosty air hit her. You sigh, not daring to imagine what would have happened if Celebi didn't shield you from the attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite certainly, you'd be dead. And, if by any chance you were still alive, your body would have received irreversible, permanent damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to Celebi, noticing her staring down at you intently, her eyes half lidded as she struggles to not faint. At least, not when the Weavile is still around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you slip out of the fairy's hug, earning a curious stare. You stand on top of her chest and look past her as you glance over Weavile, taking notice that she sat down, staring at the wounded fairy in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume she feels guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weavile,\" you say, drawing the giantess' attention. The dark type weasel looks at you as she fixes a curious look from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblack\">What?</span>\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go... go get me some stuff, please. We need to heal her,\" you say, motioning for Celebi, who looks at you surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo does Weavile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblack\">What, exactly?</span>\" she asks skeptically.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblack\">Don't you humans usually carry stuff to heal pokemon?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm not even <i>one</i> foot tall. How am I supposed to carry anything at all?\" you retort. Weavile looks away, not quite knowing how to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear you can see a pink shade starting to spread across her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.<br>\r\n\"Herbs. Berries. Whatever you find that might help, bring it here,\" you instruct in a calmer voice. The Weavile looks back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her nodding silently as she stands up, before turning around and leaving the clearing where Celebi's shrine is situated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze travels down to Celebi, who stares right back at you.<br>\r\n\"So... here we are again...\" you mutter, recalling how she was wounded after her fight against Zoroark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, this time, you haven't got Mew to help you gather things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Mew, you look back at her, noticing that she's still fainted, laying motionless at the feet of a three. You can't help but feel guilty. If someone meant to protect you throughout the whole day, that was Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">B-Bi...?</span>\" your attention is drawn by a weak cry from Celebi. You look down, wearing an exasperated expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why, Celebi? Why didn't you listen?\" you ask with a sigh.<br>\r\n\"None of this would have happened if you just listened to Weavile. She isn't an enemy,\" you tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">She took you away... She hurt Mew...</span>\" she retorts, though you can't understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... She's my friend, alright?\" you repeat, before sighing again.<br>\r\n\"I already told you, Celebi, I like you. But, if this... relationship has to go on, you should listen to me more,\" you scold, expecting her to be offended by your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before remembering that you actually need to tell her that you want to return to your normal size. You're not quite sure of how Celebi would take it. After all, she seems to be enjoying you doll-sized...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst your predictions, Celebi smiles a little. Then, she slowly rises her head, resting it against your body. Sighing, you spread your arms and hug her, showing that you don't actually hold any hard feelings against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd how could you, after she protected you with her body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden noise breaks the silence that has fallen between you and the fairy. You break the hug, and glance past Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your relief, it's not any hostile predator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Weavile, holding a few herbs and berries. She carefully moves up beside Celebi, putting the things she's holding down, before looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblack\">Alright. What do we do now?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last berry disappears into Celebi's mouth. The green guardian chews it slowly, before swallowing and giving a satisfied sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you find two fingers from a large, green paw getting a hold of your shirt as Celebi stands up. The wings on her back start to move as she hovers in midair, holding you in front of her face, smiling brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi leans forward, briefly placing her lips on your face.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Thank you~</span>\" she chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her gaze travels down to Weavile.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Thanks...</span>\" she mumbles, deciding to trust her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So...? You had something to tell me, right?</span>\" Celebi recalls as she floats down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile's smirk fades as she nods sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looks at you, not quite knowing how to start. You sigh, understanding that this is the moment to explain yourselves to Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething tells you that this isn't going to be easy...</span></div></div>",

She gives you a quick nod, before exiting the cave, soon disappearing, hidden by plants and darkness. You hold your breath for a minute, before deciding she isn't around anymore. You allow yourself to sigh as you walk to the entrance of the cave as well, ready to get out of here and run right back to the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mew makes her way back to the shrine. She spent hours in an unsuccessful 'hunt', trying to find Celebi's little human and his new dark type host. And the worst part it's that it was her fault. She literally let a random pokemon kidnap her best friend's human. And, although she did give chase, she lost the Weavile's tracks. And now, only Arceus knows what she might be doing with him right now! Not to mention what Celebi is going to do to her if she finds out about the whole thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, exhausted, worried, bored and nervous, Mew flies into the clearing where her friend's shrine is situated. And the first thing she notices is a certain grass type sitting there, stirring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi opens her eyes. She just woke up from her nap. She feels much better, and it's all thanks to her tiny human, who had been taking care of her earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Celebi looks around, spotting her legendary friend Mew floating a few meters from the shrine she was sleeping beneath of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving out a warm smile, Celebi quietly flaps her wings, getting in midair.<br>\r\n\"Hi there!\" she approaches Mew.<br>\r\n\"Hey Celebi. How do you feel?\" Mew asks, concern adding to the storm of emotions raging inside her right now.<br>\r\n\"Oh, so much better! And it's all thanks to little guy!\" Celebi replies cheerfully, before glancing around briefly.<br>\r\n\"Hey, speaking of, where is he? I want to thank him~\" Mew starts fearing. She hadn't thought of an excuse to justify the human's absence. She really expected to find him before Celebi woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, she didn't. She's in trouble now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew?\" Celebi calls out.<br>\r\n\"Uh?\" Mew says, snapped back to reality by her friend's voice.<br>\r\n\"Where is little guy? I don't see him...\" Celebi says, a light hint of worry in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping down, Mew takes a deep breath, before answering.<br>\r\n\"Uhm, you see...</span></div></div>",

I'm in!\" she cheers, starting to fly away. Mew gives a deep sigh of relief, before floating right behind Celebi as the two venture into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you are sprinting through the thick woods, occasionally stopping to hide whenever you hear a noise or simply to catch your breath. Reaching the shrine seems like an impossible task for someone your size, as there is no source of light but the faint moonlight, but you don't give up... especially with the thought that you might unluckily catch up with Weavile while she hunts, in which case you would probably be dead... and, although it's a very low possibility, it still scares you into running right back to your two pokemon companions. Sure, they could easily hurt you as well, but, at least, they're nice to you. And they're the best chance of survival right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop. You heard a noise. Looking around, you notice plants shaking... and, not losing an instant, you dive into the nearest bush you find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking through the leaves, you spot a certain, mythical time traveler and an as-well-mythical pink cat floating there, looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, you poke your head out of the bush. And that's when Celebi casually looks in your direction and spots you.<br>\r\n\"Bi!\" she chimes happily as she flies to you. She extends her long, green arm to get a hold of your body, literally squeezing the air of you as she pulls you in a hug.<br>\r\n\"Bi!\" she repeats.<br>\r\n\"Celebi, I can--\" you're interrupted.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>H-Hey little one, what an amazing game! You're good at this!</i>\u2019 Mew speaks through telepathy so that Celebi can't hear her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game?\" you ask confusedly, trying to look at Mew from Celebi's (mostly) gentle embrace. And, when you finally manage to get a glimpse of the sapphire eyed giantess, you see her waving her short arms frenetically, and a look that screams 'play along' on her face. It takes you a few moments to realize Mew's intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... yes... good match Mew!\" you state, faking a smile, getting the pink giantess to giggle. However, Celebi begins to feel cut out. She pokes you. Your gaze shifts to the bright blue eyes of the green time traveler.<br>\r\n\"We have some unfinished business, little one.\" she says softly, a smile adorning her face.<br>\r\n\"After all,\" she moves you closer to her face.<br>\r\n\"I owe you one. Let me show my gratitude.\" you can't understand a word of what she said. And you don't have much time to think about it, because Celebi quickly puckers her lips, and pushes them on your face, which instantly flushes bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew watches the scene with a smile.<br>\r\n\"You know, you both are just adorable.\" she comments as Celebi pulls off, letting you breath again. She looks at Mew with red cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Come on then, let's go back. It's dark already.\" she says, moving you to place on her head. But, as she does so, she notices something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bi?\" the grass type moves you back down. She picks your arm in her paw and examines it. Mew flies over to look as well. And her heart skips a beat when she notices your arm partially cut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bi?\" she inquiries upon noticing it covered in dried blood. You mentally slap yourself. So focused avoiding to get eaten, you totally forgot about the arm that Weavile had accidentally scratched. And, seeing as Celebi is obviously waiting for an answer, you come up with an excuse.<br>\r\n\"Ehm... you see, the bush I hid in had thorns.\" you lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Celebi seems satisfied with your answer. Nodding, she places her gigantic paw on your arm. You wonder what she's up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get your answer when the grass type glows green, and so do you, as the wound disappears from your arm.<br>\r\n\"There!\" she says, stopping glowing.<br>\r\n\"Er... thanks?\" you say. Celebi smiles, placing you on her head.<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go.\" she says, floating off. Mew laughs as she follows her friend. She was relieved that she and Celebi managed to find you. But she couldn't help but wonder about the Weavile. What happened to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes the duo just a few minutes to get back to the shrine. As soon they arrive, your stomach growls. It's been hours since you last ate, and now your stomach is claiming its last daily meal.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Hungry</i>?\u2019 Mew casually asks. You glance up at her and nod.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>So am I</i>.\u2019 she says with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few minutes, your two companions gather a small amount of berries. They settle them on the ground and sit down. Celebi places you on the grass and settles a single, although very big, berry in front of you.<br>\r\n\"Eat up!\" she cheers. Then, both pokemon dig in their own meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the pile of berries disappears, gulped down in the stomachs of the two legendaries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you finish your berry. Once again, Celebi picks you like a common toy and lifts you in the air.<br>\r\n\"Ready to go to sleep?\" she asks to both you and Mew.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I sure am,\" Mew replies.<br>\r\n\"I'm exhausted.\" the two float toward a tree and lie down, heads against the trunk.<br>\r\n\"See you in the morning.\" Mew says, rolling on her side, wrapping her tail around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looks at her, before gazing at you with a sweet smile.<br>\r\n\"For being such a good little human,\" she says, giving you a light peck on a cheek<br>\r\n\"You get to sleep on the best place in Ilex Forest.\" you blink, as you obviously didn't understand her. Giggling, she starts lowering you towards the darker green side of her body, right where her belly is situated. You finally understand what she's up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start struggling, trying to free yourself from her firm grip. You only just met Celebi, like, yesterday, and she already wants to sleep together? No way. But, obviously, you're totally powerless against her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to your struggles, Celebi giggles.<br>\r\n\"Didn't know you were shy.\" she comments, placing you down on her grassy belly, while your legs slide past her pubic area and hang a few feet from the ground.<br>\r\n\"Bi.\" you hear Celebi say, as her two paws enclose your whole being in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, trying to recollect the events of the day.<br>\r\nFor your first day here, you've already been eaten by two pokemon, enslaved by another and almost turned to food by a fourth. Some day this was. Sleep would be a great way to end it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, you don't seem to manage to get sleeping. You try to shift position, but Celebi's paws keep you in place, forcing you face down on the dark green landscape of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes pass. Twenty. Half an hour. And yet, you still can't sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Celebi couldn't sleep as well. She had to delay her... 'private playtime' with you because of Mew. But now, her friend is asleep, and she's starting to feel... needy. Maybe this could be the chance to finally try out some of the... 'ideas' she's been thinking about since morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at you, you finally start to feel drowsy. You let a yawn flee from your mouth as...</span></div></div>",

Groan!\" she weakly mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growls in confirmation of her words, getting  another groan from the dark type pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, she stops groaning and moving. Alarmed, you rush to her.

Weavile's not dead, she just fainted from the hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you climb back down and look at her humongous form. Her titanic body looms over you, filling all of your view. You notice the gigantic belly you were about to go in rising and falling along Weavile's breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of complete silence, interrupted just by Weavile's breath and the occasional, loud growls of her stomach, it hits you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't tell that when she wakes up she still won't eat you. She's dead asleep right now, but surely it won't take long for her to wake up again, again awakened by the complaints of her empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could take the chance that you had before and run away from her.

Berries could at least give Weavile some energy for her to go hunting. The slowly disappearing of the sun over the horizon confirms your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, her snoring stops.

She has a somewhat distressed expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I've already been here! Damn, where that Weavile could have gone?\" she asks herself.<br>\r\n\"Mew?\" you call out to her.<br>\r\n\"Where could the little guy be now? What if she ate him?! Poor little guy!\" Mew says worriedly, completely ignoring you.<br>\r\n\"Mew.\" you call out again, a little louder.<br>\r\n\"What I'm going to tell Celebi now? 'I'm sorry, I let a fellow pokemon kidnap your little guy'? She'll never talk to me anymore and-\" <br>\r\n\"Mew!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you manage to get her attention. She turns her head to look at you. Her signature smile returns as she bends to scoop you up.<br>\r\n\"Little guy! There you are! I was so worried!\" she hugs you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing slightly, you give a little smile.<br>\r\n\"Where have you been? Where's that Weavile?\" Mew asks.<br>\r\n\"Well, she brought me to a cave and then she suddenly fell asleep. I guess she was tired. I decided to run just then,\" you lie, sure that if you tell the truth, there will be no more Weavile to visit tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew nods.<br>\r\n\"At least you didn't got hurt. Except that little cut on your arm. Here, let me fix it,\" Mew says, placing a paw on your arm. Her own arm glows as a pink aura flows from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her paw, the cut Weavile did you is gone.<br>\r\n\"Wow, thank you.\" you thank her. She gives a warm smile in response.<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get back to our friend.\" she says, before flying in direction of the famous shrine of Ilex Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting there, she finds Celebi stirring, maybe just waking from her slumber.<br>\r\n\"Hey, remember-\" Mew's voice is heard in your head.<br>\r\n\"Not a word with Celebi about what happened.\".<br>\r\nYou look at her and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi yawns and opens her eyes. Looking around, she spots her lifetime friend and her newly found lover. Smiling at your sight, she gets up and flies over you.<br>\r\n\"Hey there you two. How much time I've been asleep?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"More or less, five hours. You were exhausted.\" Mew acts like nothing happened.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that Zoroark really gave me a fight. Good thing she's not here anymore!\" Celebi giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what did you two did while I was sleeping?\" she asks, snatching you from Mew. You feel like a doll every time she does that. Your thought is empathized by Celebi squeezing you in a bone crushing hug, even though she's being as gentle as she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, nothing special. You know... playing...\" Mew lies.<br>\r\n\"Playing? You played together? Aww, every time I want to play with my little guy, something bad happens!\" Celebi pouts. <br>\r\n'Trust me, I know it now.' Mew thinks, recalling your recent 'adventure'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. Not able to understand Celebi and not able to understand Mew when she doesn't talk to you through telepathy, you clear your throat, getting their attention.<br>\r\n\"Soooo... Is someone hungry? I'm starving.\"  you say.<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Then, let me get something nice for my little guy,\" Celebi smiles, gently depositing you on the ground and flying up to snatch some berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi hands you a small berry, that is the size of a watermelon to you. She then hands Mew a bigger one and helps herself with another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat silently, while the two pokemon before you make conversation. And a hilarious one, judging by their laughs. You finish up your berry. Then, you remember about your plan. You tap Celebi's leg. She turns her attention to you.<br>\r\n\"Bi?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me Celebi, could you get me another berry? I'm still hungry. Maybe a big one?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiles kindly.<br>\r\n\"Bi cele bi! Bi!\" she says. You assume it means 'yes' as she glows green. You wonder what she's doing. A green light glows to your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are amazed to see a flower blooming, then becoming a full mature berry. Celebi picks it and lies it before you.<br>\r\n\"Here you go. Dig in!\" she says, before turning her attention to Mew again. At the moment, they're paying you zero attention, so you take the chance and push the berry into a nearby bush. You will need it later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, Mew gives a loud yawn, declaring she's worn out. Celebi nods.<br>\r\n\"Well, bedtime I guess.\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute, you're laying down on Celebi's chest, her arms wrapped around your body like a blanket, Mew next to her. You don't even know how she convinced you to sleep there. Oh right. Puppy eyes. You could never resist them, even when you were normal sized. Your mom used to do that whenever you didn't want to do something. So it was pretty easy for her to incapacitate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for a while, trying to not fall asleep. Finally, after a few minutes, both pokemon are asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the opportunity and slip out of Celebi's hug. You slide on her side and get on the ground. You look up to see if she woke up in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi is indeed asleep. But she felt your absence, she needs you back in her sleep. So she waves her arms in a useless attempt to find you anywhere on her body. Not finding you, she gives up and resumes snoring softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief. Then, you head for the bush where you hid the berry and start pushing it, making it roll out. Even with all of your strength, you don't manage to lift it of an inch. So you give up and start pushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push the berry through the forest, stopping every once in a while to see where are you going, catching your breath in the meantime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAided by the darkness of the night, you finally spot the cave you've been in with a certain dark type pokemon just a few hours ago. You push for another while, before finally reaching the cave. Wiping away some sweat, you peek into the cave, hoping to find Weavile still there...</span></div></div>",

She sees movement out of the corner of her eyes, and sees a berry rolling torwards her.  Although the berry is big enough that she can't see you.<br>\r\n\"A berry.\" She said as her stomach growls some more. \"Did it just roll in here on its own?\"<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by her stomach growling even more.  \"I'm too hungry to care it's food.\"  With that she rushed forward and grabbed the berry in her hand and stuffing the berry in her mouth and swallowing without even bothering to chew.  Before sighing in pleasure as it filled her up.<br>\r\nShe put her claw on her stomach and said. \"Now I have enough energy to survive tonight.  Now to take a nap while it digests, hopefully without dreaming about a shrunken human like I did earlier.\"<br>\r\nWith that she laid down and went to sleep.<br>\r\nMeanwhile you were in trouble.  When she grabbed the berry you were still pushing it, and she was so hungry that she didn't realize that shhe had grabbed both the berry and you.  Onn top of that since you were pressed into the berry by her grip she never noticed you in her mouth as you were swallowed whole with the berry.<br>\r\nAs you landed in the stomach you were finally able to call out to her, but she could not hear you over her stomach.  Suddenly the stomach acid started swirling around, as Weavile's stomach started the digestion process.  The question is what happened to you, since there are four options.  One you are digested two you somehow manage to survive untill you come out the other end.  Three the energy Celebi used to create the berry mixed with the energy used to shrink you, and kept you alive, but trapped in Weavile's stomach while she shrinks to your current size (you shrink in proportion), fourth the energies mix like number three, but instead of  keeping you allive, you are digested.  Fifth the energies mix like number three and four, and you are still digested, but you mentally merge with Weavile so that both of you share her body and can communicate with each other.  and finally the same as number five but Weavile does not shrink.  So which is it?</span></div></div>",

Now she was free to take a nice little nap, she merrily thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her train of thought was rudely interrupted as a bunch of bushes began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Meow?</span>\" she muttered quietly as she looked around, scanning the area around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Meowstic let out another soft cry, before she closed her eyes and rose her ears, doing a psychic scan to detect any eventual presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she found nothing, aside from a few pokemon far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Meowstic relaxed, began to purr softly as she felt the human in her tummy yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, that's what she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she did good following you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to stop you, warn you about the many many dangers this forest had during the dark hours, but you were simply too hasty and didn't let her speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, you became a victim of a random Meowstic wandering around the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Why didn't you just listen to me?</span>\" Weavile sighed as she stared at her future prey; the Meowstic couldn't have detected her, she was a dark-type. And psychic has no effect on dark-types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was nothing to be relieved about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she wasn't quick enough, for her human friend was going to be too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily but careful to not make any noise, Weavile sneaked behind the tree where the Meowstic was resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, with the typical agility of her species, Weavile began climbing up on the lowest branches of the tall tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't going to kill the Meowstic unless it was necessary. She would have simply knocked her out and tried to make her spot the human out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill crawled down Weavile's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she wasn't able to take you back out, she would have to gut the Meowstic with her bare claws. The thought was a hideous one... but she was going to do so if needed, she thought with a newfound determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout anymore hesitation, Weavile jumped off the branch she was on and fell down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Meowstic was enjoying a nice rest, when she felt the wind blowing and something big approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes shut open, but the feline barely had the time to glance upwards before Weavile landed straight on her, full strength, causing her victim to fall unconscious immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Meowstic's head laid limp against the tree as Weavile jumped off her, repressing a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she focused on the unconscious pokemon's tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Please be alive...</span>\" she muttered as she took place beside the fainted feline and placed her claws on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated for a moment, before closing her hand in a fist and driving it into the Meowstic's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline winced, a moan escaping her mouth. Aside from that, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hm...</span>\" Weavile muttered as she raised her fist, before punching the Meowstic in the gut once again, causing the psychic-type to since again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Come on!</span>\" Weavile shouted in frustration and worry as she slammed both her claws onto the fainted pokemon's stomach, almost piercing her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dual-tailed feline began coughing in her sleep, a thin river of blood beginning to escape her mouth as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, something finally happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Meowstic coughed harder, before spitting out something tremendously similar to the human that Weavile let to earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her heart skipping a beat as she watched your body making a short flight in the air before landing on top of the Meowstic's furry chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile shot a pitiful stare upon seeing what state you were in; you were covered in saliva, slime and blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, you were frighteningly unmoving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, Weavile picked you up and held you in front of her face. She cleaned some of the stuff that covered you and stared at you attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of relief washing over her, she noted that you were still breathing, but you were unconscious, much like the pokemon who ate you was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile sighed, relieved she had managed to rescue her human friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, the dark-type turned around and, leaving the Meowstic where she was, she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did mention you were staying with Celebi, Weavile recalled as she made her way to Ilex Forest's shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was real, she should have given you back to the legendary, at least for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't be long before dawn, and if the patroness of the forest woke up without her little human, she was going crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, if she did wake up, noticing Weavile herself with her shrunken human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-type gulped, terrified. She considered turning back and return to the cavern where she had almost eaten you earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived to the clearing where Celebi's shrine was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mix of stupor and fear, Weavile noticed the two legendaries that were sleeping beneath it: Celebi herself and the Mew who had chased her earlier over the same human she was holding now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently and carefully, Weavile approached the green time-traveler and bent over her, holding you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, the dark/ice-type began moving you towards the legendary's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as if Celebi sensed a threat in her sleep, she began flailing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile felt her heart freezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was waking up!</span></div></div>",

You stare at the shiny white teeth,  glad that, at least, you didn't get to meet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of sudden, your world shakes as you are spat out of the mouth, completely covered in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou luckily land on Meowstic's furry paw and sigh relieved. Either she decided to spare you or she didn't like your taste. Which is probably the reason you're still alive. No wonder about it though, since the other times you've been in a mouth you never got to bathe. Or maybe this Meowstic is just really very picky about her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhichever was the reason she didn't eat you, you don't care, you're just glad you're out of the traumatizing, slippery chamber full of sharp teeth, ending with a dark abyss that leads to a certain, horrible death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering a bit, you turn to face the Meowstic, who is staring right back at you silently. You get to take a good look at her. Those red and yellow eyes of hers really seem to stare into your very soul; the two long ears on her head are probably twice your height - and she even hasn't them fully opened!

That would be a unique opportunity, she knows that. And plus you would be safe with her, while you would take so many risks walking through the forest alone. Sure, she almost ate you but, since she isn't going to anymore, she decides you're more useful alive than dead to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Meowstic decided what to do, sun fully rises.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing you don't actually have any use for her, the Meowstic decides to just let you go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, the white and blue pokemon lowers her paw to the ground. She waits for you to leap down on the ground before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, blinking a few times, trying to take in what just happened. A Meowstic shows up and shoves you into her mouth, scaring you to death, just to spit you out and leave. Seriously, what the heck was that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, drops of drool falling from your body.<br>\r\n\"Right. I need to wash myself, I can't go back like this.\" you say. <br>\r\n\"Maybe I can find a pond somewhere nearby.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, walking around for a bit, you spot a little puddle of water. It looks like a lake to you though. <br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" you say, walking towards it. You dunk yourself into the puddle, cleaning off the drool covering your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of the little puddle and decide that you absolutely have to return to the shrine. It must be around 7 AM, and if Celebi or Mew (or worse, both) are awake, you'll surely have to explain where you have been. And why you are all wet.<br>\r\n\"I'll just have to think of an excuse.\" you say to yourself as you walk towards the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly enough, you get there unharmed. Finally seeing the place in the forest you call 'home', after two terrifying experiences, at least makes you  feel a little safe. A little. You are still stuck with two huge pokemon that can crush you with a finger if they want to. And speaking of your two companions, you see a pink cat pokemon still sleeping, while a certain time traveler pokemon looks at you, a smile spreading on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can act, you find yourself enveloped in a light blue aura that lifts you off the ground. You look at Celebi, her eyes are glowing of the same color of the aura. She must be using psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hypothesis is confirmed by the fact you are floating towards the green giantess. More specifically, you are floating towards the green giantess' open paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi encloses you in a tight hug. But her smile soon changes into an expression of surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprise of finding you completely wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bi?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n\"Still can't understand pokemon language...\" you remind her.<br>\r\nCelebi sighs and lowers you, so you can see the little spot that got wet because of drops of water falling from your soaked body. Celebi then points at you.<br>\r\n\"You want to know why I'm wet?\" the grass type nods in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you see, I just went to take a bath. Yes, that's it.\" you lie. Celebi cocks her head.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I noticed I was all dirty and I decided to take a bath nearby...\".<br>\r\n'That's not completely a lie after all.' you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the fact you bathed with your clothes on, Celebi smiles, seeming satisfied with your explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting with her back against her shrine,  Celebi moves you closer to her mouth. Afraid of what she's going to do, you close your eyes. But Celebi wasn't going to put in her mouth again, like she did a few times, she just presses her lips on your cheek, smooching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you notice the time traveler giantess smiling at you warmly, a pink blush appearing on her cheeks as she hugs you again. One of her paws found its way to slowly caressing your head, soothing you, while Celebi relaxes herself with the quietness of the morning forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of the soft paw gently rubbing your head makes you drowsy, making you remember you didn't sleep all night long. Yawning, you decide to sleep, at least for a bit. It doesn't take you long to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up again after a while, just to find Mew still asleep and Celebi resting, with her paw still on your head. You must have slept for an hour or so, and the grass type must have fell asleep as well in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you manage to free yourself from Celebi's hug and carefully get off her. Her arms move a bit in her sleep, as if noticing your absence, but get down as Celebi relaxes once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly growing bored to just stay there and stare at the sleeping giantesses, you decide to wander around. You do not dare to walk into the forest though; if Celebi doesn't find you around when she wakes up, you're sure she'll get mad at you. Which would end pretty bad for your well being. Plus Ilex Forest's inhabitants are much more active during the day than the night, and it wouldn't be difficult to have a close encounter with some pokemon looking for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as you walk around, a noise makes you turn your attention to a nearby bush. You stare at it curiously as a golden, fox-like pokemon with fiery red eyes and nine tails steps out. A Ninetales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe majestic pokemon walks in your direction, lowering itself to sniff the soil. You almost get sucked into the Ninetales' nose. That's when the nine tailed  creature spots you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious about what you are, the Ninetales starts licking you, its tongue pinning you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting soaked in saliva again, you quickly look back at Celebi and Mew. Both are unfortunately still asleep.<br>\r\n'Please wake up please wake up please wake up!' you mentally, unable to talk because of the hot, red tongue shutting your mouth close. Ironic. Both pokemon are psychic types, yet none of them can't read your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared, you try to push the gigantic muscle away with all your might. Which obviously doesn't work. Instead, the golden pokemon starts speeding up its licking. You realize it is actually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are once again completely covered with drool coming from yet another pokemon trying to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh... stop... please\" you try to say between the licks of this golden pokemon. Which obviously ignores you. Like every other pokemon who wanted to get a taste of your body after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to think you're going to 'visit' your fourth stomach in the two, almost three days you've been in this forest, a sound makes your heart fill up with hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biiiiiiii.\" you hear Celebi yawn, which probably means she's going to wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your joy, your supposition was correct. The green pokemon opens her black eyelids, revealing her blue eyes. The Ninetales stops licking you and raises her head to face Celebi, who is staring at the scene incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's just a moment before she gets what's going on and flaps her wings, floating up in the air.<br>\r\n\"Leave him alone!\" she shouts at the fire type, her paws glowing green as a sphere is formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales stares back at her with a wondering look. Sure, the little guy has a somewhat good taste, but the golden pokemon didn't like it that much, so she decided to let him live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, when was the last time she had a good battle? And she has the opportunity to challenge a legendary pokemon, she cannot let this chance escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets in front of the tiny human, fire forming in her mouth. The legendary Celebi obviously likes him, so if she pretends to be wanting to eat him, she'll fight at top of her skills.<br>\r\nShe growls, a clear way to say 'He's mine.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment between the two pokemon is full of tension, when Ninetales shoots flames from her mouth. The grass type dodges the attack and throws her energy ball ball to the Ninetales, who dodges as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany minutes pass as the two pokemon keep throwing attacks at each other. But you are in utter shock. You know Celebi from a little more of a day, but you could never guess she could turn into a fiery warrior like now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's fighting her opponent heatedly, either dodging or enduring the fire attacks coming from the Ninetales, just to attack herself with her best shots. You know she's doing this for you; she wants to protect you, no matter what. And the only thing you can do is just sit there and stare. You feel so weak right now. You wish you could help somehow, but due your reduced size, and so reduced speed and strength as well, there is nothing you can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle goes on for while. Weirdly enough, Mew didn't wake up even with all the explosions roaring around her. Aside from an occasional shift of position, she's giving no sign of being alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodging one last flamethrower of the opponent, Celebi glows and fires leaf storm. Thousands of leaves are sent flying to the fire type pokemon. Just when the attack is about to hit her, the fox pokemon leaps up, dodging it. The leaves keep going, now aiming at... at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful attack coming right at you, the ear splitting scream coming from Celebi, your heart racing, your mind shouting you to move and your fear keeping your small body still... your head skips a beat as the barrage of sharp leaves gets nearer.<br>\r\n'Well, this is it. Goodbye everyone...' you think, bracing yourself for the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich never comes. Instead, an explosion is heard. You open your eyes, you find yourself enveloped in smoke. The attack must have hit. Which is weird, cause you're feeling pretty fine.<br>\r\n\"Am I... am I dead?\" you ask yourself as the smoke clears, revealing that Ninetales is standing in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding that the golden pokemon protected you, you fall on your knees. That was too much emotion for one day.<br>\r\nJust then, the Ninetales starts laughing. Both you and Celebi look at her curiously.<br>\r\n\"What an amazing battle! I hadn't one like that in ages! You really deserve your title.\" she suddenly says to Celebi, before lowering herself to nuzzle you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you or your green companion can act, the fox pokemon starts walking away.<br>\r\n\"I hope we'll be seeing again. Can't wait to battle again.\" she states, disappearing into the woods. Celebi stares at the now empty spot before remembering the reason of the battle and rushing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Le bi!\" Celebi exclaims, cleaning off the last drop of saliva on your body, before giving you a light peck on your cheek.<br>\r\nYou sigh.<br>\r\nCelebi goes and sits down against the shrine, settling you on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, you start rubbing the green skin, getting a small moan from the grass type giantess.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for everything you did for me.\" you say her. Another peck on the cheek is your reply. You chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes pass, before...</span></div></div>",

Having just heard her stomach asking for food, you at first think you are going to be her breakfast. You start to shake, waiting to once again enter the dark cavern they caused your death not even a day ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it never happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green paws rise over Celebi's mouth and gently deposits you on her head, in between her feelers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering about what she's up to, you see her floating in midair before starting to fly off, into the depths of the forest, leaving an asleep Mew alone at the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she is far enough, Celebi stops and looks around, searching for some sweet pecha berries that she knows to be around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Celebi spots what she is looking for and flies up on a high tree branch. She sits down and snatches a berry, before settling you next to her with her free paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately try to not look down, knowing the height of the branch you're currently sitting on. Celebi meanwhile picks a small - to her at least - red berry and hands it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thing is at least as big as your upper body. You look at Celebi, but she's already enjoying her own meal, so you decide to eat as well. You grab a bite of the red berry. It's very sweet, yet it has a... wild aftertaste.<br>\r\n\"That sure is a strong berry.\" you state, getting a giggle from the pokemon next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is pretty ironic. Celebi is considered one of the most rare and powerful pokemon there are... yet she acts like a little girl around you. And yet she could crush you easily, even if you were still normal sized. From what you read about her back at school, you knew she was supposed to be childish, but you were sure you'd never discover it from Celebi herself... in such predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap back to your senses when you accidentally bite the void. You notice you ate the whole berry in your trance.<br>\r\nCelebi giggles as two large paws wrap around your body and bring you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo green lips press on your cheek. You stare at Celebi, unsure of what to do now. She stares right back at you with a sickeningly sweet smile, clearly wanting you to say something.<br>\r\n\"Uh you're... pretty?\" you try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green pokemon's reaction is very close to what you expected, if not the same you expected. Her mouth grows into a huge smile, her eyes shine from the compliment she just received. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the next thing is something you'd never expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bi... cu... le... cut... le... cutie!\" your jaw shuts open at the realization the legendary before you just talked.<br>\r\n\"Celebi... you just said something, I wasn't dreaming right?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"Cutie! Cutie!\" she exclaims again, clearly excited about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing a bit of a blush, you smile. This is just great. If you can teach Celebi to talk, you have a feeling that living with her will be much more easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling, the green legendary lifts herself from the branch and, sealing you in a tight hug, she starts flying back to her shrine. She can't wait to tell Mew the news. That is, if she already woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. This is just a little step. But you know that, if you manage to make Celebi able to communicate with you, this relationship would be much easier. Not that you are falling for the green pokemon, but if you have to stick with her, might as well understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain carried away by your thoughts, you don't notice Celebi arriving back to the shrine...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon seeing her pink friend still asleep, Celebi's smile grows wide on her face. Finally she gets to have a bit of fun with her little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding you in a soft yet firm hug, the grass type quietly raises herself on the branch of a big tree and sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe releases you and holds you in front of her, looking at you. A sweet smile illuminates her face.<br>\r\n\"Cutie~\" she says, nuzzling you against her cheek, before planting a peck on your forehead. Celebi then holds you near her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo much near her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel her warm breath in your face. You are pretty sure of what is about to happen, and you don't like it one bit.<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Celebi? What are you doing?\" you ask, trying to not sound scared as you obviously are. Your shaking voice betrays your intentions though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally cursing yourself, you turn your attention to the green giantess holding you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggles softly. Her little guy is scared of her. Cute.<br>\r\n\"Cutie... in you go...\" she says sweetly, opening her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for the word 'cutie', the rest of what Celebi just said is pretty incomprehensible, being just a mix of 'le bi ce'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the mere sight of her opening her mouth wide makes you shake with fear.<br>\r\n\"Celebi please...\" is all you manage to say before she gently drops you in the dark insides of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight fades as you are enveloped in the slimy, dark cavern you've been in a couple of times. And each time, you get to see the traumatizing sight of the dark abyss that leads to a  most certain death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou uselessly try to get on your feet, as the slippery tongue simply won't let you, while Celebi licks your body over.<br>\r\n\"Celebi, get me out! Please!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stifled giggle is what you get for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggles gleefully. The scared squeaks coming from inside her mouth are, as always, doing a great job in making her aroused. Covered by the thousands of leaves of this tree, she spreads her legs and starts rubbing her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can't quite explain why it feels so good. She should feel bad for scaring you to death... yet those muffled screams of mercy, those little struggles for freedom, her tongue overpowering that tiny, helpless body... somehow, everything makes her feel great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are, once again, living a nightmare. The fleshy 'walls' are moving along Celebi's movements, throwing you back and forth into the 'cave'. Until you reach the edge of Celebi's throat.<br>\r\n\"No no no no no no!\" you exclaim out of fear. It's happening again. You're about to get swallowed again, and you can't do anything about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same moment, Celebi lets out a stifled moan. She retreats her paw, a small puddle forming around her sex. The green pokemon lets herself fall with her back against the trunk of the tree. She lets you lie still on the back of her throat for a bit as she recovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie there, shaking with fear. Things stopped moving, which you were grateful for, but you still are a mere inch from falling to your death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that she has terrorized you long enough, Celebi digs her paw into her mouth. Getting a hold of your body, she gets you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are welcomed back to the outside world by comforting sunlight. And then by a certain green pokemon smiling warmly at you.<br>\r\n\"Please... don't do that again...\" you mutter, unable to talk from the lack of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi just smiles, proceeding to clean saliva off your body, before starting to pet your head with her paw softly. You let out a sigh of relief, just glad to be still alive. But why does she keep doing this!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Celebi makes her descent, to the grassy ground, letting you sit on her paws. Mew is still sleeping. You look up; sun is now fully arisen in the sky.<br>\r\n\"How much can she sleep?\" you think out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you say that, the pink cat opens her sapphire eyes and yawns. A smile quickly spreads on her face as she sees her two best friends.<br>\r\n\"Morning you two,\" her voice telepathic voice rings inside your head.<br>\r\n\"Hope you didn't do anything weird.\" she says cheerfully, making you blush. You can't deny though that what happened was pretty weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mew can say anything else, her stomach growls. She rubs it slowly.<br>\r\n\"I need to fill my tummy. Hey little guy, come with me, it'll be fun!\" that said, her long tail wraps around your waist and snatches you from Celebi, before carrying you away. The time traveler stands there confused for a second, before pouting.<br>\r\n\"I wanted to come too...\" she says irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew!\" New beams, eating her tenth berry. You just sit there next to her, assuming she must be really hungry after sleeping for at least twelve hours. Or maybe she usually eats this much amount of food. Whatever it is, she's really enjoying her meal.<br>\r\n\"That was delicious!\" she suddenly exclaims.<br>\r\n\"No wonder of why you ate so many berries.\" you say with a small smile. Mew pats your head in response.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you just cute?\" she says giggling. You blush at her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both spend the next few moments completely silent. The only one noise that can be heard is the sound of the wind. Then, Mew suddenly gets up...</span></div></div>",

Come little one, let's get back to Celebi, so we can play!\" the pink cat pokemon exclaims, her tail sliding in between your legs and lifting you off the ground, before wrapping solidly around your waist. The grasp of the pink tail is soft, yet firm, so it keeps you perfectly safe as Mew floats back to the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to enjoy the quietness of the morning forest, as Mew flies slowly, without any rush at all. A small breeze blows through the forest, which is completely silent. Aside from you and your two pokemon companions, the other inhabitants of Ilex Forest are most probably still asleep. So you get to experience the complete silence, interrupted just by the occasional rustle of the leaves or the roar of a distant river. You sigh happily; this is the first time since you're in this forest that you feel actually... safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Mew gets back to Celebi's shrine. Her green friend is sitting on it,  with her back to Mew. The pink cat approaches her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail lowers and unwraps from your body, gently letting you on the ground. Just then Celebi turns to face Mew.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're back. Where's my little guy?\" she asks her friend. In response, Mew just points to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving you a cheerful smile, Celebi lowers her green paw for you to hop on. Which you do reluctantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw you're standing on brings you to the green legendary's face as she starts nuzzling you.<br>\r\n\"Missed you little guy~\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's play!\" Mew exclaims impatiently.<br>\r\n\"Sure... but what?\" Celebi asks.<br>\r\n\"What about cat and mouse? Ohhh, little guy would make a perfect mouse!\" her excitement grows as she speaks.<br>\r\n\"That's some idea.\" Celebi admits smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little guy?\" Mew's voice says in your head.<br>\r\n\"What?\".<br>\r\n\"We want to play cat and mouse. Wanna play?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Cat and mouse? What's that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"We count to one hundred while you hide in the forest. If you win, you'll get a reward!\" Mew beams<br>\r\n\"And... if I lose?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiles seductively.<br>\r\n\"You'll wish I didn't revive you when I'm done with you.\" she says with a playful giggle, while winking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you didn't understand a word of  what the green legendary just said, you definitely felt the mischievousness in her voice. And you don't like it at all. <br>\r\n\"So little guy, what do you say? Are you in?\" Mew asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are unsure about what to do. You can always refuse... but you have a feeling that you will regret it if you do. You can try to convince them to play some other game... but they seem very excited about the idea, so they'll almost certainly force you to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour best shot seems to play their game right now.. And you're curious about the reward anyway. But if you do, you could be attacked and eaten by wild pokemon... and worse, if you lose, you're sure your 'penalty' won't be so nice, judging by the two pokemon's excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a bit, desperately trying to find a way out of this situation, but you need to decide quickly though - the two legendaries are growing impatient!</span></div></div>",

You look up to the two pokemon, who are awaiting your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm in...\" you mutter, not completely sure if this was the right decision. But it's too late to go back. Mew and Celebi already exploded in cheering, before Mew's tail gently pushes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go hide then. We'll count. And better for you if we don't find you.\" Mew finishes, before she and Celebi turn around, their backs to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they can start, though, Celebi turns around again and  talks with Mew, who nods.<br>\r\n\"Right, I forgot, there's a time limit. If we can't find and catch you within that, you win.\" <br>\r\n\"And how much time do I have?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew and Celebi looks at each other, seeming to be wondering something.

Are you in?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Great idea!\" Celebi beams.<br>\r\nYou just nod timidly, not daring to refuse the terms of the game.<br>\r\n\"Great, let's play!\" with that, they turn around again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon you hear what you assume is 'one', you start running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run into the forest, without knowing where are you going, you just know that you need to hide. And soon. But you know you haven't gone far, since you soon hear two simultaneous screams, followed by excited squeals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting that Mew and Celebi are done counting, you stop, looking for whatever place you could hide in. There's nothing here, but some bushes and some big leaves, probably fallen from the big trees of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that the bushes are a too easy hiding spot, you go for the leaves. You manage to lift one and look back, checking if any of your two 'chasers' is coming your way, before getting under the dark green 'shelter'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes pass.  You don't hear anything around you so, careful to make no noise, you poke your head out of the leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to discover Mew floating right in front of you. Luckily, she has her back to you, so she hadn't seen you. Quickly, you retreat under the leaf. Right before Mew turned around, scanning the ground, searching for any weird looking bug that could be her tiny human friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something catches her attention. A small lump under a leaf. She smirks, extending her paw to pick the leaf.<br>\r\n\"I wonder what is under this leaf~\" she says in a singsong voice, before snatching the leaf up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to find nothing.<br>\r\n\"Aw, I was sure I got him!\" Mew whines, unknown you are hanging on the other side of the leaf she's holding for dear life.<br>\r\nHuffing, Mew places it, and you along, back down, before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, better get out of here before I become food for some Caterpie.\" you state, getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure of how much time passed from your close-catch, so you just keep wandering around, trying to find a good hiding place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pretty sure Mew or Celebi are already on your tracks, so you need to hide, fast. <br>\r\nThen, a familiar giggle makes your heart skip a beat. Celebi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start looking around frenetically, trying to find something you could use as a hiding place. <br>\r\n'She's coming! What do I do? What do I do?' you ask yourself. The shadow of the forest's guardian comes into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you jump behind the first bush you see and wait, sweat pouring down your face. <br>\r\n\"Cutie~ where are you~? Come out wherever you are! I just want to squeeze you in my hug all day long~\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the word 'cutie', which made you blush, you aren't able to understand anything else she said, but you can definitively make out one thing: she knows you're here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to stay as still as possible as Celebi searches around, trying to find you. Just when you hear no more noises, you dare to let out a sigh. Right then, a green paw appears through the leaves, and slams to the ground, mere inches from you. You can feel your own heart racing as Celebi's paw moves around for a bit, trying to find any small body that could be hiding here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you manage to stay still and silent until the paw retreats. You can hear a groan and some incomprehensible words, before Celebi leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down a bit, you step out of the bush.<br>\r\n\"Time for a new hiding place.\"  you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't really say what time is it now, but you assume that you are hiding from Mew and Celebi from at least six hours. Hungry, tired, sore, you somehow manage to get back to the shrine. Literally collapsing to the ground behind it, you look up to the sky; sun is on its way to set down, so you assume it must be around 6:30 PM. <br>\r\n'Still a bit... I can do this...' you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour and a half passes. You are quietly napping under the shrine, when a loud groan wakes you. Your first though is about checking the sky: you smile as you see the summer sun descending over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you notice the cause of the noise that woke you up as two familiar pokemon sit down on the shrine; they don't seem to have seen you though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, it's like he disappeared! How come we can't find him anywhere?\" Celebi asks Mew with a huff.<br>\r\n\"Well, he's pretty small, and the forest is pretty big, so he could be anywhere.\" Mew states.<br>\r\n\"And he's about to win...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you happen to snooze. Normally, no one would have been able to hear it, but it unfortunately didn't escape Mew's sensible hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, she spots you under the shrine. Her mouth curls into a smirk.<br>\r\n\"Look who's here.\" is heard in your head. Celebi, who turned around as well curious about her friend's actions, smirks as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than five seconds, you are securely grasped in Celebi's paws.<br>\r\n\"What a shame.\" Mew says, while her friend nuzzles you.<br>\r\n\"At least one more minute and you would've won. I almost feel bad...\".<br>\r\nCelebi raises her head, smiling.<br>\r\n\"You're right, it would be a shame to end it like this. Look,  let's give him thirty seconds. If he can avoid us, he wins. If he can't...\" Celebi's smirk grows at the last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew nods. Celebi puts you back on the ground and the two fly  quite distant from you.<br>\r\n\"You have one more chance,\" Mew warns you.<br>\r\n\"Avoid us, and you win!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two rush to you. They are coming fast - you have to dodge them, quick!</span></div></div>",

One more second and you'll be hers to deal with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the very last moment, when the two pokemon are about to catch you, you dive out of the way, which results with Mew and Celebi surpassing you. And that's when the sun completely disappears over the horizon, meaning you just won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, you drop to the floor, trying to catch your breath. Just to be grabbed by two massive green paws and smothered between them and one of Celebi's cheeks as she nuzzles you.<br>\r\n\"Good match little one!\" Mew exclaims in the meantime.<br>\r\n\"You did pretty well for your first time!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, since you won, I think it's time you get your reward~\" Celebi says sweetly. Just then, your belly growls loudly.<br>\r\n\"Right, I didn't eat all day long...\" you remember as your belly growls once again.<br>\r\nCelebi smiles warmly.<br>\r\n\"I may have an idea for your reward...\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously unaware of her intentions, you just look as she glows green, a nearby flower blooming into a heart shaped berry. Celebi snatches it and holds it in front of you; it's the size of a car to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping herself with many other berries from nearby bushes, Celebi sits down, settling the fruit she got in between herself and Mew, who sat down as well. In the end, Celebi settles you on her lap.<br>\r\n\"Eat up!\" she beams, starting eating hungrily, soon followed by her pink friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the two pokemon eating voraciously berry after berry. Feeling quite sheepish now, you bite your own berry. Its taste isn't bad, it's really sweet. You take another bite, it's delicious! You start digging in, enjoying the sweet flavor of the berry. And so do Celebi and Mew, judging by their cheerful expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a satisfied sigh. The berry is no more, gone bite after bite into your stomach.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Celebi. That was really nice.\" you thank the mythical pokemon, getting a squeal, that you just assume is a 'you're welcome'. You stare at the two as they chat merrily. You try to make out whatever they're saying, but it's a literally impossible task. So you just keep listening to the incomprehensible words coming out of the two pokemon's mouths. Once or twice, though, you hear Celebi repeating 'cutie',  so you assume she's talking about the first human word she learned. Mew seems pretty excited with the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a while, Celebi and Mew decide to hit the hay. Celebi, as careful as she can be, removes you from her lap and lies down at the feet of a huge tree, soon followed by Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green legendary looks at you for a moment, before smiling warmly.<br>\r\n\"Cutie~\" she says, before moving you towards her lips, giving you a long smooch on you cheek, threatening to pull your face off along her lips. Even though she didn't, she still left a furiously-blushing you staring at her as she lowers you on her belly, laying you down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night you two.\" Celebi proclaims.<br>\r\n\"Good night. See you in the morning.\" Mew replies, looking at you.<br>\r\n\"Uh, right. Night.\" you reply sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pair of blue eyes close, while two long, green arms wrap around your body, like a blanket, pressing you into Celebi's belly. Soon she falls asleep, you can tell by the constant rising and falling of the green land beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still reluctant to sleep though. You perfectly know that you promised Weavile you'd go 'visit' her, but the events of the day left your extremely tired. You don't know if it's the case to leave. What if you accidentally fall asleep in the middle of the woods and some wild pokemon eats you without any second thought? That's too much of a risk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe you could make it to the cave unharmed, due the inactivity of many pokemon right now... But then again, you're currently being squeezed in a quite tight hug from your green pokemon companion. If she feels you escaping her grasp, she could wake up and notice you leaving. Then she'll surely get mad at you, which may result quite... unhappy for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, after many minutes of deciding, you manage to choose...</span></div></div>",

She hands you the berry, which is as big as your head. You recognize it as a cheri berry. You look up to see Celebi looking at you hopefully.<br>\r\n\"Uh... Thanks?\" you say. A huge smile brightens her face as she sits down at the feet of a big tree, soon imitated by Mew, who's staring at the scene giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat the berry fastly.

Carefully to not wake you up, she snatches you from her belly and raises her back to sit against the trunk of the tree she slept under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, Celebi deposits you on her lap.

She moves toward her shrine to place you down on it, but she stops, remembering something, about how, two days ago, the tiny human was kidnapped by that Zoroark because of her. What if another pokemon comes out, grabs her little guy and flees?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shakes her head. No way she's going to let that happen ever again. She's going to be extra careful with you from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi? What's wrong?\" Mew worried voice stops her train of thought. The green pokemon turns around to face her friend.<br>\r\n\"What you're waiting for? Come on, put the little guy down and let's get to battle!\" Mew cheers, waving her paws, all her excitement returned in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi thinks about what to do for still a few seconds, before finally talking.<br>\r\n\"About that... I'm not really sure. I mean, remember that Zoroark who took him? It was all my fault.\" Celebi says.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good that you don't know about the Weavile...\" Mew mutters. <br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" Mew quickly says, mentally remembering to keep her mouth shut close about That. If Celebi ever finds out, she'll most probably stop talking to her. If she's lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Mew, the green time traveler decides to forget it and goes on.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I was thinking little guy should stick with me.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"But you can't exactly fight if you hold him with your paws.\" Mew states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighs. Her friend is right. If she protects her little boy, there goes her fun.  She wonders what to do for a minute, before she has an idea.<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before Mew can ask what she's talking about, the little guy floats out of her friend's paws, surrounded by a deep blue aura. He does not fall, though, he keeps floating in midair, between herself and Celebi. Mew notices Celebi's eyes glowing the same blue surrounding the human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing Celebi is using psychic, Mew smiles.<br>\r\n\"Okay, now that's settled... ready?\" she asks, getting into fighting stance.<br>\r\n\"You bet!\" Celebi exclaims with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without adding any other word, Mew's paws lit with energy as she fires focus blast. Celebi avoids the attack, as large rocks start to float around her. She throws them right at Mew, but she simply teleports, not a single rock hitting her. She reappears with a smirk across her face.<br>\r\n\"Good one! But you'll have to do better!\" she laughs playfully.<br>\r\n\"That's just the beginning!\" Celebi retorts, laughing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though explosions, laughs and excited squeals can be heard in almost the whole forest, you stay asleep the whole time, your mind still far away in dreamland. On one hand, that's a good thing; you wouldn't like to wake up while you're floating in midair, while two huge pokemon throw moves that could kill you in one instant at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the fight, Mew is hit by the thousands of leaves from Celebi's leaf storm. She's sent flying back. Then, plants coming from the soil wrap around her body, keeping her from moving. Mew notices her friend absorbing sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Mew uses ember to get rid of the plants blocking her and forms an azure sphere in her paws. <br>\r\nCelebi uses solar beam, while Mew fires ice beam. The two beams collide, exploding instantly. When the smoke clears up, Celebi and Mew are floating in front of each other, smiling and panting.<br>\r\n\"Like last time?\" Mew asks after catching her breath.<br>\r\n\"Like last time.\" Celebi confirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pokemon fly back. Mew glows with power as a blue sphere takes place in her paws. Smiling, Celebi crates a huge green ball of energy. Both pokemon stare at each other, before throwing the spheres, which collide. Energy ball blocks aura sphere for a few seconds, before the two attacks explode, creating a huge cloud of smoke, and waking you in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Celebi and Mew are sent flying backwards against a tree, you following along Celebi's psychic. It's a miracle she didn't drop her psychic grasp on you while she fought. Otherwise, you would have fell to your death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour two pokemon companions laugh uncontrollably.<br>\r\n\"Uh, Celebi?\" you call out, not quite realizing the situation. Immediately, you start to float over Celebi and you're dropped in her open paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezes the air out of your tiny lungs as she hugs you, not stopping laughing, the vibrations coming from beneath you, along the lack of oxygen, threaten to make you throw up. Luckily, Celebi softens her grip. Still, she does plant a kiss on your forehead.<br>\r\n\"Uhh, care to explain what's going on?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Just having some fun.\" Mew's happy voice says in your head.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like I will be doing with you once I recover, little cutie~\" Celebi says playfully. You gulp down hard. You learned what happens when Celebi talks with the mischievous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie there on Celebi for what seems hours, while the two pokemon recover from that huge display of power. Every once in a while, Celebi would start caressing your head with a finger, while muttering incomprehensible words of affection.<br>\r\nMew would just giggle at the scene, finding it sickeningly cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a good while...</span></div></div>",

Your back hurts. A lot. You had to go through many games, such as hide and seek, cat and mouse, and you even had to run while Celebi and Mew chased you. Without flying.

Good point.\" she says, in a somewhat cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't reply, walking to the sitting giantess, who extends a clawed paw in front of you. You climb on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world shakes as the giantess gets up, walking out of the cavern, examining you at moonlight. Her red eyes are fixated on you as they seem to scan within your soul. You start to feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"So... how are you?' you try to break the ice.<br>\r\n\"I'm Fine.\" she mutters in response without dropping the annoyed tone she's been using since you stepped into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return her gaze.<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is ridiculous. Just tell me what's wrong.\" you inquire. <br>\r\n\"You're asking me what's wrong? You should know too well, human. Why didn't you come last night?\" she asks back, her voice now filled with ice.<br>\r\n\"Long story short, I couldn't.\"<br>\r\n\"And that is because...?\" she asks again.<br>\r\n\"I dare you to try and break free from two arms the size of trucks.\" you partially lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile nods.<br>\r\n\"Still, that doesn't change the fact I was worried! I thought some pokemon killed you!\" the weasel like pokemon exclaims.<br>\r\n\"Be sure Celebi would have killed it right then...\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile sighs deeply.<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not mad at you.\" she admits, finally dropping her icy voice, that is now replaced by the best caring tone she can talk with.<br>\r\n\"But don't do that anymore, alright? You really scared me.\".<br>\r\nYou sigh. Guilt is the last thing you need right now. Still, you find yourself nodding your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile's mouth curls up in her usual smirk.<br>\r\n\"Good. How about a hug?\" she asks. Images of your body slashed to pieces cross your mind.<br>\r\n\"No!\" you exclaim, pale as death, sending Weavile into snickering.<br>\r\n\"Ju-Just kidding you know.\" she says, unable to control her laughter.<br>\r\n\"Not funny.\" you whisper, startled.<br>\r\n\"Please, don't do that again...\".<br>\r\n\"No promises\" she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't really figure out what's happening right now. Talking about making it up to you for her joke,<br>\r\n Weavile placed you on her head a couple of minutes ago, before climbing on a tree and starting to jump from tree to tree, heading to an unknown destination. You tried to ask her where she's going a few times.<br>\r\n\"Wait and see.\" is the only reply you managed to get from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems hours, Weavile finally stops on one last branch, before climbing down to the ground easily. From what you can see, you're in a small clearing, which ends with a slope. The whole place is completely enlightened by moonlight, giving it a mystical atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" you ask, while Weavile gently picks you and places you down. Tall blades of grass surround you, almost like a tiny forest.<br>\r\n\"It's a very secluded area. I think even Celebi herself doesn't know about it.\" the black weasel states.<br>\r\n\"I doubt that.\" you reply, while your mind goes back to Celebi. She indeed knows each inch of her forest... so, what would happen if she wakes up right now and, not finding you cuddled to her, tries to find you? Most likely, she'd find you within five minutes, which would end bad for both Weavile and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. Celebi is supposed to be protective toward Ilex Forest's inhabitants... except for the ones she believes a threat for you. You remember Zoroark, and how the green time traveler sent her Arceus knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to reality, feeling something poking you. You quickly realize it's Weavile.<br>\r\n\"Anybody in there?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, sorry. I was thinking.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, the dark type walks over the slope and sits down. Quietly, you reach her, making grass rustle as you walk. You sit beside Weavile.<br>\r\n\"Look down.\" she says you. You do as she asked and look down. A literal sea of flowers dominates a field beneath you.<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's amazing!\" <br>\r\n\"Indeed. As I told you, not many pokemon know about this place. I feel lucky to have found it.\" Weavile says, using a happy voice for the first time since you know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you stay silent, just enjoying the enchanting place in its beauty. Until...<br>\r\n\"Little guy? Where are you?\" a voice cries distantly. Weavile immediately jumps on her paws, alerted, while your heart seems to freeze. You could recognize that 'le bi le bi' everywhere. What Celebi is doing here? She should be sleeping... unless... the thought from before somehow came true, and she woke up, noticing you missing. You're in trouble now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile looks at you. You can see pearly drops of sweat running down her face.<br>\r\n\"She's looking for you, what are we going to do?\" she whispers, fear pretty noticeable in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily try to think of something, your brain working hard to find something that could save both your skin and Weavile's fur. But you can't think of anything but either hide in the grass, or try to come up with an excuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's voice gets closer and closer, she's coming here!<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" you exclaim.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without losing anymore time, you hide in the tall grass, disappearing into the thick 'forest'. Right before Celebi comes into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi scans around the small clearing, hoping to spot her little one somewhere. She woke up because of a bad dream, and she noticed that her little guy was no longer laying on her belly. And, without waking Mew, Celebi ventured alone into her beloved Ilex Forest, trying to find the human somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rustling sound makes turn her head.<br>\r\n\"Cutie?\" that word, the only one she learned, but correctly pronounced in her little boy's language, should catch his attention. But she gets no reply. Instead, Celebi just seems to notice a lone pokemon, a Weavile, standing there, seeming to not have noticed her. Maybe it saw her little guy!<br>\r\n\"Excuse me...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile gulps. Whatever the tiny human has in mind,  she hopes it works. Feigning an indifferent expression, Weavile turns around to face the mythical time traveler. She's never seen her so closely, and it's years she lives in this forest. Her only presence, along with the thoughts of what she could do to her if the plan fails, is enough to make her heart race with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Weavile asks in a neutral tone, trying to keep her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Celebi is choosing her words carefully: Weaviles are known to be formidable predators.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, do you happen to have seen a weird looking bug? That looks like a tiny human?\" she asks. Weavile pretends to be surprised.<br>\r\n\"A bug that looks like a tiny human? I've never heard of something like that... but, no, I didn't see it, sorry...\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay perfectly still. You can't risk of being discovered, so you try to stay as quiet as possible. You can hear Celebi and Weavile talking to each other. Then, you hear an irritated screech and the noise of leaves shaking. Then, after two minutes of silence, a voice speaks up.<br>\r\n\"Human? You still there?\" you recognize it as Weavile.<br>\r\n\"She left, you can come out.\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi flies through the forest. The Weavile hasn't seen her little boy. She groans. Where could he be? Why couldn't she talk through telepathy, like Mew? And why in the world did he leave in the middle of the night?! A whole lot of questions is now occupying the green pokemon's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, Celebi tries to think of something. But the only idea she can think of is trying to use telepathy. She sighs. Even though she doesn't know it... trying won't hurt. So she focuses, trying to send thoughts in your mind.<br>\r\n'Hello?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello?' a voice says in your mind, startling you. What was that?<br>\r\n'Hello? Little guy?' the voice talks again. <br>\r\n'...Mew?' you think. <br>\r\n'No silly, it's me, Celebi!' the voice exclaims in your head, revealing you who is talking.<br>\r\n'Celebi? Are you using telepathy?' you ask back, confused.<br>\r\n'No... I can't learn that... This is more... I think this is a small psychic connection that has formed between us. It allows me to talk to you!' Celebi exclaims happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she remembers what she was doing before.<br>\r\n'Hey, why did you leave anyway? In the middle of the night? And most of all, alone?' she now sounds pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly think of an excuse.<br>\r\n'Ehm, you know, I was thirsty and I went searching for some water. I was just heading back...' you mentally reply.<br>\r\n'Alright, fine. But don't do it again, I was worried!' Celebi's voice exclaims.<br>\r\n'Sorry...' you think.<br>\r\n'Don't worry. Just come to the shrine, alright? I'll be waiting you there, I'm tired.' she replies.<br>\r\n'Okay, I'll try to get there fast.' you state.<br>\r\n'Be careful little guy. Later.' that said, Celebi stops talking. <br>\r\n\"Hey! What's wrong?\" you hear Weavile instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see Weavile's worried face.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" she asks back.<br>\r\n\"I'll explain you later. But now, can you do me a favor?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain the situation to Weavile as she dashes across Ilex Forest.<br>\r\n\"I see. A connection. So that is why you suddenly got weird.\" she states.<br>\r\n\"Yes. I was talking with Celebi.\" you confirm from her head, as she stops, gently scooping you and letting you down on the ground. <br>\r\n\"So, I'll be seeing you later?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"If everything goes smoothly, very probably yes.\" you reply.<br>\r\nNodding, Weavile turns around and dashes away, soon disappearing, engulfed in plants and darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and walk into the clearing where the shrine is placed. As expected, Celebi and Mew are laying at its feet.<br>\r\n\"Celebi?\" you call out. The mythical pokemon raises her head, smiling at the sight of you.<br>\r\n'Finally. There you are.' the voice from before, which you now know that belongs to Celebi, talks in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over the green giantess, who extends a paw for you to climb on. You hop on it as she retreats it to her face.<br>\r\nShe pecks your face, before pressing you into her cheek, nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biiiiiiii!\" she lets out a deep yawn.<br>\r\n\"You're tired, aren't you?\" you ask her. She nods in response.<br>\r\n'Good night my little one. Sleep tight.' her voice rings in your mind as she lies you down on her belly.<br>\r\n'Please, don't leave without me knowing again.' she adds, her paws wrapping around your small body, keeping it still.<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" you lie, knowing that you'll have to next night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Celebi just smiles, proceeding to move one of her paws to your head, gently running her three fingers through you hair, soothing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. This is actually the first time in three days that you feel fully safe and relaxed around the green pokemon. If you ever return to your normal size, you think, nobody is going to believe your story. It sounds pretty crazy, thinking about it.<br>\r\n'At least we can communicate now. Things will be easier like this.' you think to yourself, before closing your eyes. And, in a few minutes, you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi keeps petting her little guy until she feels him snoring quietly. She giggles, removing her paw from her tiny human's head to wrap it back around his form.<br>\r\n\"We finally found a way to talk little cutie.\" she says in a whisper.<br>\r\n\"Can't wait to see Mew's face when I tell her tomorrow. But I'm not giving up on talking human language. You'll have to teach me that, wether you want it or not.\" she giggles, before yawning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really should to sleep now.\" Celebi whispers, her eyes closing, her breath slowing down as she relaxes. And, shortly after, she joins both Mew and her little guy in dreamland.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your eyes open. You heard what seemed an explosion. Apparently, Celebi and Mew heard it too, because they suddenly rise themselves in midair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Mew asks, rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n\"No clue. Maybe some branch fell from a tree.\" Celebi suggests.<br>\r\n\"Or a whole lot of branches.\" Mew says. Before replying, Celebi remembers about you and looks down at you, who are still enclosed in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices you awake.<br>\r\n'What happened?' she asks you.<br>\r\n'I don't know.' you reply, remembering about the newfound connection between the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighs.<br>\r\n'Looks like we aren't sleeping tonight, are we?' she says.<br>\r\n'Apparently'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew starts poking Celebi's arm.<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks. In all response, Mew points to a black  figure, blue rings shining brightly in the night. Both you and Celebi quickly realize it's a wild Umbreon. And a shiny one, judging from the blue rings on its body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume that it's probably the responsible of the noise you heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three pokemon eye each other for a full-of-tension minute. Then, the Umbreon's eyes shift on you, scanning your little body with interest. Celebi squeezes you in a protective manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the Umbreon suddenly disappears, striking Mew just then. <br>\r\nRealizing it just used quick attack, you stare at Mew, who recovers. Electricity starts to flow through her paw as she uses thunder punch on her opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi glows of many colors, using dazzling gleam to aid her best friend. The Umbreon doesn't even try to dodge. Instead, it lets the attacks land. Even though darkness, you can see its muzzle curling into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the Umbreon glows blackish purple, before tackling Mew, who is sent flying into a tree, not getting back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that the move Umbreon used was payback. And, since Mew attacked it first, the damage was doubled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could do anything to help her friend, Celebi gets hit by payback as well. She is sent flying as well, next to Mew. Her grip on you weakens, but she still refuses to let go of you.<br>\r\n\"I'm not going down just yet.\" she  states, somehow standing up and back in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi gently lets you on the ground, before turning to the Umbreon, who seems amused in Celebi's determination. It used quick attack again, but Celebi dodges it, before cloaking herself in multicolored leaves, throwing them at the Umbreon, who is hit by magical leaf. The shiny pokemon groans in pain, while slowly getting back on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pokemon fight for a while, until the Umbreon, dodging a powerful leaf storm, uses foul play, hitting Celebi in the stomach, sending her crashing into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, without waiting for her to recover, the Umbreon walks over you with unnerving slowness. You glare up at it, as its two black paws, which are literally black pillars of fur from your point of view, step in front of you. The Umbreon stares down at you with curiosity, its blue rings shining of a blinding light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after observing you for a while, it opens its mouth, lowering it toward you. You stand tall, expecting it to trap you inside its mouth. But, instead, the Umbreon's fangs close around your shirt, scooping you off ground as it raises its head, letting your body hang from its lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the Umbreon starts to walk away... </span></div></div>",

You can't help but glare up at this new dark type who, undisturbed, begins carrying you away. You don't even attempt to struggle, knowing that, if the Umbreon opens its fangs, the fall would kill you as soon you make contact with the ground. And so you you just let it carry you away, bitter thoughts about you being useless surfacing in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are able to see where Umbreon is going thanks to the light coming from its rings. You can't figure out wherever the pokemon is going though. The only things you can see are plants and your helpless body hanging like a common toy...<br>\r\n'But where is this pokemon carrying me?' you think, looking up at Umbreon. You've already met pokemon that could speak the human language perfectly in this forest, but you can't guess if this one Umbreon has that ability. And, with its fangs currently closed around your shirt, it can't produce any sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi starts to move as she slowly regains consciousness. It takes her a few seconds to remember what happened. Her head starts to dart in every direction, hoping to spot your tiny body somewhere. Not finding you, Celebi realizes what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly founds Mew laying against a tree. Celebi flies over her, starting to shake her body.<br>\r\n\"Mew... wake up... Mew...\" Celebi tries to awake her friend. Luckily, it seems to work, as Mew slowly opens her sapphire eyes.<br>\r\n\"C-Celebi? What happened? I remember getting hit by payback and everything went dark.\" Mew says.<br>\r\n\"You fainted. That Umbreon knocked me out as well, and she took my little guy away!\" the small time traveler exclaims with both irritation and worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do then?\" Mew asks, her attention fully turned to Celebi now. Mew had always been playful and cheerful, but when it came down to her friends, she became dead serious.<br>\r\n\"We rescue him of course! I swear I'm going to find little guy before dawn, or else I'm going to give up on the title of legendary!\" Celebi exclaims, her eyes shining venomously.<br>\r\nThat said, the green legendary focuses.<br>\r\n'Little guy? Can you hear me?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver. You just heard Celebi calling you once again.<br>\r\n'Yes, I can.' you think, replying to Celebi's question.<br>\r\n'Thank Arceus, you're alive. Where are you?' she asks again.<br>\r\n'Uhm... don't quite know... but I'm hanging from the Umbreon's lips, it's heading somewhere...' you inform Celebi.<br>\r\n'Alright. Hold on little one, we're coming!' she replies. With that, the connection interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's alive. But he's still with the Umbreon, we gotta go find him!\" Celebi exclaims.<br>\r\n\"How did you know these things?\" Mew inquires curiously.<br>\r\n\"I'll explain you later. For now, let's just find that Umbreon!\".<br>\r\n\"You're right, let's go!\" Mew exclaims, following Celebi into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon keeps walking for what seems an eternity, but it's really an hour or so. Until it suddenly stops in front of a cave, which is covered by leaves, making it hard to find. Silently, it walks inside, making leaves swish at its passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, the Umbreon lowers its head to the ground, its mouth opening to let you go. A small cry, coming from the depths of the cave, catches your ears. Looking forward, you notice a small Eevee, covered in a huge leaf, shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the Umbreon suddenly talks...<br>\r\n\"You're a human, right?\" it asks, sounding female. You look up at her.<br>\r\n\"What do you want from me?\".<br>\r\n\"Are you a human or not?\" Umbreon inquires once again, clearly nervous. You choose your words carefully.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. Why?' you ask back.<br>\r\n\"You're a human. You can fix Eevee!\" Umbreon suddenly exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You heard me. Eevee is sick. You can help.\" Umbreon replies.<br>\r\n\"And you had to knock out my friends and kidnap me - and all of this in the middle of the nigh - for this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I was searching for food, but I found you. If you help me, I'll bring you back to those legendaries. But you're not moving from here until Eevee is fixed.\" Umbreon states.<br>\r\n\"But what is it to you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"He's... he's my little brother... I've tried to heal him myself, but he didn't got any better...\" Umbreon lowers herself to face you.<br>\r\n\"Help him... I beg you...\" she suddenly says, a single tear rolling down her cheek. You facepalm. Guilt feelings be damned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as you get closer to the Eevee. You touch his forehead, quickly retreating your hand: it burns.<br>\r\n\"He's got fever.\" you whisper to yourself. You're not sure of what to do. You learned how to heal pokemon back at school,  but you never had to deal with sick pokemon. Maybe, if you can wait for Celebi and Mew to find you, they could help, somehow... Although you do remember that some medical herbs can be found around here. Maybe you can convince Umbreon to find them... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, thousands of thoughts threatening to blow up your head.<br>\r\n'What to do?' you ask yourself, hoping that Celebi and Mew show up soon... even though you're sure they would most likely attack Umbreon before for kidnapping you before understanding the situation...</span></div></div>",

How do you call those?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n\"Medicines. And I've got nothing like that with me, so we'll have to arrange with what we've got.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon stays silent for a few seconds, as if taking in every word you said, before nodding. She then walks over you and lowers her head, placing a paw by her muzzle.<br>\r\n\"Climb on. I'll help you.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as told and climb on her paw, which she moves up to her head.

And I told you, they're supposed to grow somewhere around here.\" you reply, trying to find what you're looking for. The light from Umbreon's rings is a great help, yet you still didn't find anything similar to the particular herbs you saw back at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you manage to spot something which can be distinguished from the grass because of a darker green color. A revival herb!<br>\r\n\"Hey Umbreon, I found it!\" you yell up to the dark type, who raises her head from the grass. She sticks her tongue out at the sight of your catch.<br>\r\n\"A revival herb? That's disgusting!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n\"But it can help. I need a few more things though. Let's go.\" you state while Umbreon lets you ride on her head once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if I'm right, this is an energy root.\" you huff, picking up the object and coming out of the sea of roots you just ventured in. You couldn't breathe down there, and it took quite some time to find the energy root.<br>\r\n\"Good job human. What else do you need?\" Umbreon inquires.<br>\r\n\"Well, we need some energy powder, a sitrus berry and some water. If we can find those things, we'll be able to heal Eevee.\" you state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we waiting for then? Let's go!\" she exclaims, clearly wanting to help her little sibling. She uses psychic to lift the root out of your hands. It joins the revival herbs you found earlier and starts floating behind her. Umbreon lifts you on her head, before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type carries you over a stream of water.<br>\r\n\"Okay, we found everything you said, we just need water now, right?\" Umbreon asks.<br>\r\n\"Indeed. The only problem is: how do we get it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if replying to your question, several leaves float from the nearby trees over Umbreon thanks to her psychic. They start wrapping around each other, forming some sort of bowl.<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" you compliment the dark type.<br>\r\n\"Oh hush. Let's get over with this.\" she replies, even though you can feel she liked being complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, she dunks the leaf bowl into the stream, filling it up with water. The bowl joins the four other things behind Umbreon.<br>\r\n\"Careful, don't spill it.\" you warn Umbreon.<br>\r\n\"Okay then, now I should be able to make Eevee recover.\" you say. The shiny pokemon nods.<br>\r\n\"Thank you... for all the help...\" she says. You can feel the gratefulness in her voice.<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet, we're not done.\" you state. She nods again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as she starts carrying you off...<br>\r\n'Hey.' a voice speaks in your head.<br>\r\n'Celebi?'.<br>\r\n'Yes. Have you figured out where you are?' she asks.<br>\r\n'Yes. I'm in a cave. Its entrance is covered with leaves.\" you reply, making her know where to go.<br>\r\n'Covered with leaves? I think I know that place. Hold on, we're coming! We'll save you!' she exclaims.<br>\r\n'About that, I'm not in...' you try, but the connection interrupts.<br>\r\n\"... danger.\" you say out loud, your palm making contact with your face. Now the duo is going to think Umbreon is torturing you or something, and they'll probably blast her to oblivion as soon as they see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking to?\" comes Umbreon's voice instead.<br>\r\n\"Forget it, get to the cave as fast as you can.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Why?\".<br>\r\n\"Trust me, please.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\" she replies, speeding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish you hadn't said that. Umbreon is now dashing at full speed through the forest. You have to hang on for dear life to her short fur in order to not be sent flying off, turning into paste into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seems hours, Umbreon stops in front of the cave. She steps inside and lowers her head. You dizzily walk down on the rocky floor and head for the still shivering body of the Eevee, Umbreon joining you.<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine now, hold on.\" she whispers to her little brother, before looking at you.<br>\r\n\"Let's get over with it.\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cool!\" Mew then exclaimed with her usual excitement, momentarily forgetting the situation. But a look at her friend's face told Mew that Celebi wasn't up for a laugh.<br>\r\nSo she went silent for a while.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo keeps flying until Celebi suddenly stops in front of a wall of leaves.<br>\r\n\"There.\" she points to a small, well hidden opening in the leaves.<br>\r\n\"The perfect hideout, uh?\" Mew asks. Celebi nods.<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" she asks. <br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Mew replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe things you and Umbreon collected  are gently deposited on the rocky floor of the cavern.<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n\"Well, if I'm correct, Eevee should just ingest everything. He should feel fine soon.\" you reply, starting to stroke the small - at least, compared to Umbreon - pokemon absentmindedly. Umbreon nods.<br>\r\n\"What are we waiting for? Let's...\" she doesn't get to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a second, two pokemon burst in, startling both you and Umbreon. You immediately recognize them as your legendary companions. But, by the looks in their faces, they don't seem willing to hear any kind of explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon gets into fighting stance.<br>\r\n\"We'll tell you only once.\" Celebi states.<br>\r\n\"Give us back the little guy and we're not going to hurt you.\" she points to you, not seeming, though, to notice the small, shaking pokemon covered by a leaf.<br>\r\n\"Listen, I can explain everything...\" Umbreon tries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue sphere misses her of a centimeter, exploding into the back of the cave. Umbreon glares back at the two legendaries.<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want...\" she says, turning to you.<br>\r\n\"You. Help Eevee. I'll handle these two.\" she says, before turning again and charging the two legendaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gulp and a nod, you turn to Eevee. Grabbing the revival herb, you move it in front of the normal type.<br>\r\n\"Come on Eevee, open up.\" you whisper. The pokemon opens his eyes, giving a weak cry.<br>\r\n\"Listen, I need you to open your mouth, I can help you feel better.\" you state. Eevee seems still wary.<br>\r\n\"Look, your big sister there helped me collect this stuff for you. She trusted me, so I need you to trust me as well.\" you say, desperately trying to convince the normal type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it seems to work. Eevee points his gaze to his currently fighting sibling. With a small nod, he opens his mouth, finally willing to let you help him. With a small smile, you place the revival herb in his mouth. He chews slowly, looking disgusted, but in the end, he swallows it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, one by one, you feed Eevee all of the things you found earlier, before dragging the leaf bowl full of water in front of his face. He starts drinking as you place your hand on his forehead. You smile in relief. His fever is rapidly descending. \"You should feel better by the morning. Now sleep.\" you tell Eevee, who gives you a a grateful lick, coating you in saliva, before closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for him to be asleep, before looking over the three, fighting pokemon. Just to see Umbreon blown away by unknown attacks coming from Celebi and Mew, who are now charging respectively leaf storm and aura sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, you run, stopping between Umbreon and the two legendary pokemon.<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" you shout. Their attacks vanish instantly. Both stare at you curiously.<br>\r\n'Sweetie, this Umbreon...' Celebi's voice is heard in your mind. However, you cut her off.<br>\r\n'... Kidnapped me because she needed help.' you think, getting an inquisitive look by the green pokemon. She wants answers. And she wants them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat, feeling sheepish since all the attention is now focused on you. You try to talk, but no sound comes out of your mouth.<br>\r\n\"So? We're all ears little guy, speak up.\" Mew's telepathic voice now rings in your head. You look back at Umbreon, who nods while slowly getting back up. You sigh.<br>\r\n\"You see...\".</span></div></div>",

You look back; Umbreon had already sat down, waiting for you to talk. Not one pokemon seems intentioned to stop looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, having no choice, you start to explain what happened after Celebi and Mew were beaten by Umbreon.<br>\r\n\"I noticed she was carrying me somewhere, though I couldn't really understand where.\" you tell them.<br>\r\n\"It took a while, but Umbreon took me here. She wanted me to help her little brother over there.\" you point to the big leaf, which isn't shaking anymore. Eevee probably feels better already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and Mew just seem to notice the little Eevee sleeping soundly. Then, they look back at you.<br>\r\n'... And then? What happened?' Celebi talks to you through the connection.<br>\r\n\"Well, me and Umbreon went to find some things that could help Eevee.\" you continue. At this one point, Celebi looks pissed.<br>\r\n'Hey, when I contacted you, you said nothing about all this, you just told us where to go!' she states, pointing an accusatory finger at you.<br>\r\n\"You should have listened. I was about to tell you that I wasn't in any real danger, but you stopped talking!\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew puts her paws over her muzzle, giggling at her arguing friends. Then, she turns to Umbreon.<br>\r\n\"Hey, maybe I can help your little brother.\" she says with a friendly smile. And, without waiting for an answer, she lazily floats over Eevee, placing a paw on his forehead. Suddenly, Mew starts glowing pink, energy flowing through her body, transferred to the small pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe, Mew stops glowing.<br>\r\n\"Dear old heal pulse never fails.\" she giggles.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Umbreon thanks her, cracking up a smile.<br>\r\n\"No problem. Take that as an apology for bursting in and... you know... hitting you. Now, let me get these two out before Eevee wakes up\" Mew states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should...\" Celebi is interrupted in mid sentence as Mew slides her short paws around her body.<br>\r\n\"Come on Celebi, let's just get over with it. It was all a misunderstanding.\" she says with an happy smile, playfully pretending to drag her green friend. Celebi calms down and sighs, while Mew unwraps her arms from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi then extends a paw down on the ground, right in front of you.<br>\r\n'Just get on. Let's go home.' even though that phrase was said mentally, you could hear Celebi exhausted. Smirking, you step on her paw as she carefully lifts it up. She then turns to Umbreon.<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry for everything...\" Umbreon gets closer.<br>\r\n\"I mean, for breaking in and thinking you meant to hurt little guy...\" Umbreon stops right in front of Celebi.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" she whispers, leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon starts nuzzling you with kindness.<br>\r\n\"Thank you for helping me! You know, for a human, you're nice.\" she admits gleefully. You just smile, petting the blue rings on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording that she would come to find you when Eevee feels better, you greet Umbreon one last time, before letting Celebi carry you out of the cave. Within fifteen minutes, both her and Mew are back to the shrine. The time traveler giantess literally collapses at its feet, quickly followed by Mew.<br>\r\n\"You're tired, aren't you?\" you ask. Both nod.<br>\r\n\"Guess because of who.\" Celebi says with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"Not mine.\" you reply. She pouts.<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" that said, she places you on the ground, turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew laughs.<br>\r\n\"What's happening Celebi? You don't like him anymore?\" she giggles.<br>\r\n\"Nope, don't know why I chose him in the first place.\" Celebi replies.<br>\r\n\"Really? Well then...\" Mew smirks, picking you up in the meantime.<br>\r\n\"Hey little guy, you'll be sticking with me from now on. Just imagine it! Me and you traveling around the world, having lots of fun, that'll be amazing!\" she mentally beams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi turns around, eyeing Mew grimly, but without talking.<br>\r\n'Just play along little guy.' Mew says through telepathy, while winking. You silently nod, while Mew continues her silly game.<br>\r\n\"I think we should sleep together from now on, so-\" Mew is interrupted when Celebi snatches you from her at light speed.<br>\r\n\"Mew! What are you doing with my little guy?!\" she exclaims indignantly, closing you in a hug that threatens to crush each and every bone in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiles. Goal achieved.<br>\r\n\"You said you didn't like him anymore Celebi.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Of course I like him. I ate him, scared him to death more than once and I almost crushed him - and all in just three days - and yet, he chose to stay with me!\" Celebi cries. This sends Mew into a blissful laughter.<br>\r\n\"Good, because I was just kidding. I would never dream to take little guy away from you.\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighs. This one was not funny. She turns to you.<br>\r\n'Why didn't you say anything? It was cruel!' she says.<br>\r\n'Just playing along.' you calmly reply.<br>\r\n'Well, don't do that again. I don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you.' she admits. This makes you smile.<br>\r\n'I won't.' you reassure the time traveler, getting a peck on your cheek for answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi yawns.<br>\r\n\"Man, I could sleep for weeks now.\" she states.<br>\r\n\"Well, that'll be a bit hard.\" Mew says.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean.\" in all response, Mew points to the sky, where dawn slowly emerges from the horizon.<br>\r\n\"Dawn already? Damn!\" the grass type whines.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think we can still take a nice, long nap wouldn't you agree?\" the pink cat pokemon asks cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" Celebi nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner said than done, the get comfy.<br>\r\n'I'm going to sleep for a bit little guy. I suggest you do the same, you had a long night.' Celebi says, caressing your chin. You yawn in confirmation of her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the both of you are ready asleep, she at the feet of the shrine, you on her belly. Mew looks at you with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Little guy, I was kidding alright, but I wasn't laying on one thing: traveling around the world together and have lots of fun would be amazing.\" she whispers to herself, careful to not wake you or Celebi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those happy thoughts, Mew lies down as well, next to her green friend. She's sure that's whatever day it'll be today, it's going to be wonderful.<br>\r\n\"And rescuing little guy is becoming a funny habit.\" Mew giggles one last time, before falling into a deep slumber, one like she didn't have from a long time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning sun shines brightly up in the sky. You are still asleep in Celebi's solid grasp; the forest's patron is asleep herself, still tired after last night's events; next to her, a certain pink, furry pokemon is snoozing like her two friends. None of you three gives the minimal sign of waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass as you and your pokemon friends keep on sleeping. Just after midday, around 3 PM, Celebi gives a deep yawn. Absentmindedly, she starts to stir, while sitting up, making you slide on her down her belly, right back on her dark green colored lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting her gaze downwards, she notices her tiny boy sleeping there, right before her legs. Cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her arms down, she snatches you up and starts to gently shake you. At least, as gently as she can. Which, you learned, is very little. In fact, she's currently squeezing the air out of your lungs while throwing you back and forth, threatening to make you throw up whatever is in your stomach. But, at least, she achieved her goal: she woke you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that again...\" you say dizzily, making a huge effort to keep your previous meal where it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at you, Celebi turns to Mew.<br>\r\n\"Mew, wake up.\" she says. No reply, the pink cat doesn't wake up.<br>\r\n\"Come on Mew, wake up.\" Celebi repeats herself, still with little success.<br>\r\n\"Well then...\" the green time traveler says mischievously, turning to you.<br>\r\n'Little guy, will you help me with something?' she asks with a honey-filled voice. How can she do that with her mind?<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n'You see, Mew isn't going to wake up anytime soon. And, if we don't wake her up, she's going to miss all the fun. You know we're best friends, so.I know Mew has one big weakness.' Celebi explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would be?\" you ask again.<br>\r\n'Tickle. We're going to tickle her. She is very, very ticklish. I assure you we'll laugh for days.' Celebi says with a playful smirk. You nod as she picks you up and deposits you on Mew's furry belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pink fur is so fine that it barely reaches your ankle.<br>\r\n'Ready?' Celebi asks. You nod.<br>\r\n'Now!' she presses her paws into Mew's sides. You do the same and 'dunk' your arms into the fur of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect is exactly what you expected from Celebi's description. Mew  immediately bolts upwards, shaking as she laughs heartily at the tickling sensation.<br>\r\n\"P-Please stop!\" she began between laughs.<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, Mew.\" Celebi laughs herself, keeping on with tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later, you stop. Celebi stops as well, letting her friend breath.<br>\r\n\"Boy, when was the last time I laughed like that?\" Mew asks.<br>\r\n\"Let me think.\" Celebi comments sarcastically.<br>\r\n\"Just yesterday, the day before, and the day before, and the day before.\" she says, giggling at her own joke.<br>\r\n\"And you helped, you naughty little human?\" Mew giggles, her short paws wrapping around your body as she hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, easy there.\" the time traveler says, her smile suddenly disappearing.<br>\r\n\"Aw come on Celebi, don't be jealous.\" Mew says cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"Right, we're just buddies. Friends do hug each other.\" you aid her.<br>\r\n\"Exactly. We hug each other too.\" Mew says, patting your back. Celebi nods.<br>\r\n\"Point taken.\" she says, her smile back on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while passes. Celebi had picked up berries for the three of you to eat, but then, everything went quiet, none of you talking.<br>\r\n\"I'm bored!\" Mew suddenly whines.<br>\r\n\"Celebi, do you have any plans?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking to time travel with little guy...\" the grass type replies Mew's eyes lit with excitement.<br>\r\n\"Can I come too?\" she asks with energy.<br>\r\n\"Uhm... you see, I wanted some private time with him...\" Celebi replies, shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in fact, she was thinking about bringing you somewhen where she could finally try some of the ideas that are present in her mind from days, making her smile sheepishly each time she thinks about them. She isn't sure how you would like them, but she's sure about one thing: she would enjoy every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, but I don't want to be alone!\" Mew whines again.<br>\r\n\"Being alone is no fun...\"<br>\r\n\"That's true...\" Celebi admits, while scooping your form up easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... why don't you leave little guy with me while you time travel?\" Mew asks.<br>\r\n\"What? You know why I want to time travel, right?\" Celebi asks back.<br>\r\n\"Yes, quality time, I got that, but couldn't you... I don't know, go back to before you found him and have fun with him? \" Celebi shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"I don't want to risk altering anything, little guy's already scared as he is. Imagine me doing things to him, then disappear as another me comes out and eats him.\" she says, recalling what happened when she found you hiding in those roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, what to do?\" Mew asks. She understands that her best friend wants some alone time with the tiny human she loves, but she doesn want to be left behind. Waiting alone for hours while waiting for her friends to return would be an agony for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighs. There is no way out. She wants to have some quality time with her little human badly, but, in the meantime, she doesn't want to leave Mew alone. She knows Mew suffers solitude (which is practically the whole reason of why she leaves the Tree so often). Maybe she could bring Mew along and give up her private fun with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she could leave you with Mew, giving up her fun anyway, resigning to postpone her... 'playtime'. Maybe she could visit the future this time, getting a look at how things are going to go with her tiny cutie. Only thinking about it makes her blush furiously, but it also makes her kinda happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile, can't help but wonder what Celebi is thinking about. First she talks with Mew without you understanding anything of what they said, then she goes silent and blushes as a smile spread on her face. Is she ignoring you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi?\" the grass and psychic type is brought back to reality from her daydreaming upon hearing Mew's voice.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I got carried away... What is it anyway?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"So? Have you decided?\" the powerful, pink legendary asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighs and shakes her head, making one final decision...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And then... she floats over her friend and plants a kiss on your forehead, which almost immediately starts burning with embarrassment.<br>\r\n'See you later my little one~' Celebi tells you, while Mew giggles loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Celebi glows green as she slowly rises herself in the air, before disappearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew looks at the spot where her friend was for a few seconds, before turning to you, who are still blushing furiously.<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's just you and me now little guy.\" she says, a noticeable hint of excitement in her voice. <br>\r\n\"Why do I know what's coming next?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Because you want it too. Let's play!\" the pink pokemon shouts happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.<br>\r\n\"So? What game have you got this time?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Cat and mouse?\" Mew quickly asks. She loved the previous match she had with you and Celebi, and she wants to play again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you shake your head.<br>\r\n\"How about something more simple? Which doesn't involve me getting lost and possibly eaten by the first passing pokemon?\" you ask. Mew seems to ponder something.<br>\r\n\"Something simple but fun... How about tag?\" she asks, before her mouth curls into a smirk.<br>\r\n\"Or, if you're brave enough, we could make it extreme...\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by 'extreme'?\" you ask. Mew smiles.<br>\r\n\"We could play ice beam tag.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" you inquire again.<br>\r\n\"Well, you have to escape while I shoot you with ice beam.\" she explains. She giggles seeing that your face turned pale.<br>\r\n\"Aw come on, I'm sure you'd like it better than thunderbolt tag or flamethrower tag.\" she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And normal tag it is.\" you mutter. Mew huffs.<br>\r\n\"Fine. Spoil all my fun.\" she says, before poking you with her tail.<br>\r\n\"Tag! You're it!\" she shouts, flying away.<br>\r\n\"Hey, no fair!\" you yell, starting to chase her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, it's almost impossible for you to reach Mew, who keeps flying away each time you get close.<br>\r\n\"You'll have to do better than that!\" Mew shouts a couple of times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, like any funny chasing scene,  Mew starts floating in circle, as you struggle to catch up to her. Which is totally useless, the psychic type is too fast. Or, more accurately, your tiny legs are too slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run until you have to stop to catch your breath. You also try to come up with a plan, as you can't go on like this. You're never going to catch Mew if you don't think of a strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you get an idea. You quickly let yourself fall back down on the grass, faking a collapse. Not that your legs can hold you any longer anyway, so this better work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you alright?\" comes Mew voice as she gets close to you, poking your chest with her tail. <br>\r\n'Now.' you think, rocketing upwards, startling Mew as you get a hold of her elongated tail.<br>\r\n\"Tag... you're... it...\" you pant, falling back down. Mew's tail wraps around your waist, scooping you up and bringing you to her pouting face.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you cheated!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n\"And this is coming from the same pokemon who is twelve times my size and flies instead of running.\" you retort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink pokemon crosses her short arms.<br>\r\n\"Fine, you won this round. Guess it's my turn now.\" she says, letting you on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Can I rest for a minute?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Nope. But I'll give you an head start. You have five seconds.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start running. Mew counts to five before starting her chase. And, as expected, she quickly catches up with you. Even if you weren't running onto shaking legs she would have reached you easily. But, clearly, she doesn't want to win easily. In fact, she leans forward, trying to catch you with her paws, instead of simply extending her tail to catch you. And, with the advantage of her short paws, you manage to leap out of the way, avoid her.<br>\r\n\"Almost got you now!\" she shouts playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep avoiding her for full five minutes. But Mew soon grows bored. And, as she reaches you once again, her tail darts in your direction, like a snake striking its prey from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a desperate attempt to dodge, you throw yourself as far as you can from Mew. You land on your belly on the grass, exhausted, unable to run - or even move - anymore.<br>\r\n\"Looks like the game's up little guy.\" you hear Mew saying.<br>\r\n\"You're quite the opponent, I must admit. But now, it all ends here~\" she literally sings the last part, her tail gently sliding beneath your tiny body, letting you on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew brings you up to her paws and closes you in a hug, squeezing that little amount of oxygen left in your lungs out of you.<br>\r\n\"You're good at these games. You're one of the best playmates I ever had.\" she compliments you, flying under a tree, with you in a solid yet soft grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun settles down. Mew got that you were far too tired for anymore games, so she just sat there, you in her paws, as she asked how did you shrink down and get in Ilex Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I graduated from school.\" you explain her.<br>\r\n\"I returned home, where I would have got my first pokemon. I was planning on starting my journey the day ahead. But, when I tried to find out what pokemon was inside the pokeball my parents gave me, I suddenly blacked out. I woke up here, shrunk. I tried to find shelter in some roots and fell asleep. When I woke up, Celebi was sleeping right on me. She then woke up, she noticed me and... I think she told you how things went then.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew nods.<br>\r\n\"She ate you, then went back in time to save you. And then she decided you'd be hers. And, honestly, I can't blame her. You're pretty sweet, smart and, let's say it, you're a cutie.\" Mew giggles, while your face turns of a fiery shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink cat gets berries for you and her to eat.<br>\r\n\"Honestly.\" you say with a mouthful of fruit.<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can go on with just berries. I'll eventually need meat.\" you state.<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know about it since Celebi doesn't eat any meat - you excluded.\" she says before you could point out that Celebi actually ate you.<br>\r\n\"But I think we'll find a solution.\" she finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing your meals, Mew settles you on her belly, waiting for Celebi to return. Or for anything interesting to happen, whichever comes first. And then, when she is about to fall asleep from boredom - and you from  drowsiness - something finally happens...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A blinding green light suddenly shines. You close your eyes for a moment. When you open them, a very familiar green pokemon is laying there, looking half unconscious. Several scratches and burn marks cover Celebi's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon Mew notices Celebi badly bruised, she rushes to her, completely forgetting about you on her belly. Which results in you flying off her belly and landing with a painful thud on the ground. You hear Mew calling out for her friend in pokemon language, screeching worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing the back of your head, you stand back up and slowly reach the two pokemon. Mew is shaking Celebi, trying to wake her up. And it apparently works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi slowly opens her eyes and slowly turns her head.<br>\r\n\"Mew? Where's little guy?\" she asks with a weak voice. Mew points to you. Celebi turns her attention to your small body. She gives a small smile  as you walk closer.<br>\r\n\"Celebi... how did you get hurt?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Le... bi...\" she replies, clearly too weak to use the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Mew.<br>\r\n\"Mew, I'm going to find something to heal Celebi. Can you stay here and take care of her?\" you ask. The psychic type stares at you with pleading eyes.<br>\r\n\"But... it's not safe...\" she replies. You look to Celebi, who weakly shakes her head. She doesn't want you to take risks.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I'll be fine.\" without saying anything more, you dash off, leaving the two pokemon behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run as fast as you can. Yes, as Mew said, it's not safe. Good thing you got friends. Specifically, a friend. Yes, Weavile would most likely help you out. So you head towards the cave where she usually waits for you at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep running until your breath is too little to go on. You stop, inhaling huge quantities of air in order to fill up your lungs.<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't wander around the forest nighttime. It's not safe.\" a voice says. You look upwards, right in the direction where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot a lone pokemon sitting on a tree. Weavile smirks at you.<br>\r\n\"Already heard that...\" you mumble.<br>\r\n\"I need your help.\" you then say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel like pokemon leaps down to the ground and lands gracefully.<br>\r\n\"Why? What happened?\" she asks, her smirk dropping as she sees the look on your face.<br>\r\n\"It's Celebi. She got hurt. I need your help to find some stuff... and to not be killed by other pokemon...\" you say. Weavile looks at you for a moment, before lowering a claw.<br>\r\n\"Sure. Hop on.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Weavile's help, thanks to both her speed and agility, you manage to find plants that are supposed to heal burns and some that should relieve pain. Luckily, no nocturnal pokemon showed up so far - something you are grateful for - and Weavile keeps dashing undisturbed, you on her head, and everything you collected safely hold in her arms.<br>\r\n\"I think we got enough plants. Celebi should feel better with these.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll bring you back to the shrine.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, she stops behind a tree. You can clearly see the shrine. Celebi looks asleep, while Mew seems to be waiting, most probably for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile gently lets the plants on the ground and picks you off her head, before placing you down.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can carry all that stuff?\" she asks. You nod.<br>\r\n\"Alright. So... tomorrow?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll be there.\" your reply as she leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your arms full of plants, you walk towards the two pokemon. Mew immediately eyes you.<br>\r\n\"Little guy, are you alright?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n\"Yes. Now, these plants should heal Celebi.\" you reply. Mew nods, the plants floating out of your arms, enveloped in blue light. You make your way to the green pokemon. You slowly climb her body, and you hardly make your way to her belly.<br>\r\n\"Come on Mew, give me some of those and help me.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAided by Mew, you start squeezing the plants you've gathered,  white substances splashing on Celebi's burns and scratches. Once the pile of plants is reduced to zero, you start rubbing the white stuff on Celebi's wounds, getting pleased moan from the mythical time traveler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll need some berries too.\" you point out once you're done rubbing. Mew looks upwards, her eyes glowing briefly. Not even a second later, a bunch of berries falls down from the trees. She scoops some in her paws and brings them to Celebi.<br>\r\n\"Celebi?\" you call out to her. The grass type's black eyelids open up a little.<br>\r\n\"Come one Celebi, eat up.\" Mew says, handing her a berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Celebi looks at you on her belly and smiles. She takes the berry from Mew's paws and places it near you. Then she opens her mouth wide and points to it with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew starts giggling, while you shake your head, blushing. Celebi wants you to feed her.  You start pushing the berry towards her mouth. You shove it in. Celebi chews and swallows, squealing delighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, all the berries disappear into the time traveler's mouth and are sent into her stomach.<br>\r\n'That... felt... good...' her voice says in your mind as she slowly stands up, getting a hold of you in the meantime. And, before you can reply, she shoves you into her lips, showering your body with kisses, leaving you breathless <br>\r\n- and completely red - when she pulls off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a while to recover from such barrage, while your two companions laugh heartily, hugging each other. At least, Celebi is totally healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" you say, interrupting the two from their laughs.<br>\r\n\"What happened? What, or who, reduced you in that shape?\" you ask Celebi, who suddenly becomes dead serious. She picks you and sits you down on one of her legs - which is the length of two tree trunks to you - and looks at both you and Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well... you see... I time traveled to about two months in the future. I met our future selves, we started chatting, and then, suddenly, some pokemon attacked us... or will attack us, yeah, I think that's better... Anyway, it was very powerful. Me and my future self, alongside with future Mew - speaking of which, she says hi! - managed to fight back, we protected you, but we all got in rough shape. I used the remaining of my energy to return here.' Celebi explains. You nod in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You know that I can't hear anything if you talking through a connection, right?\" comes Mew's voice. <br>\r\n\"Celebi and our future counterparts got attacked by a powerful pokemon. And future Mew says hi.\" you synthesize Celebi's tale.<br>\r\n\"How nice of her!\" Mew giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head at Mew's naive behavior and turn back to Celebi.<br>\r\n\"Do you know what pokemon was it, Celebi?\" you ask the grass type. <br>\r\n'Well...</span></div></div>",

When I woke up, the pokemon was gone and the others were unconscious. So I got back here.' Celebi explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head in understanding. <br>\r\n\"Ahem...\" a certain pink, furry pokemon clears her throat, getting annoyed by this one sided conversation. You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to look up to Mew and explain, but Celebi beats you. She talks to her friend for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it. But you traveled to the future, am I right?\" Mew asks. Celebi nods.<br>\r\n\"Then... How do we know when this pokemon is going to attack us?\" she asks, her usual smile fading to a worried look. Something that doesn't happen too often.<br>\r\n\"In about two months...  whenever another me from the past comes here...\" the grass type replies, getting a nod from Mew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink cat yawns loudly, tired out.<br>\r\n\"Boy, I need to sleep. Let's just forget it for tonight, shall we?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Celebi replies with a nod of her head.<br>\r\n\"See you in the morning, you two.\" Mew says tiredly, laying down on her side.<br>\r\n\"Good night, Mew.\" Celebi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green pokemon then looks right at you, and points to her belly, smiling playfully.<br>\r\n'Get here you.' she says.<br>\r\n'Do I have to walk? Can't you give me a lift?' you mentally ask.<br>\r\n'Nope. You'll have to do it yourself, cutie.' Celebi replies.<br>\r\n'Fine.' you say, getting up and walking to the edge of the leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, what are you doing?' Celebi asks.<br>\r\n'Getting down. I'll sleep on the ground.' you reply. One of Celebi's paws comes to wrap around your torso, scooping you up.<br>\r\n'Aw, aren't you just cute, thinking you have a choice.' she brings you at her chest level. You look up to her.<br>\r\n'Do I have to remember you I helped you twice when you got wounded?' you retort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighs defeated. She knows that too well.<br>\r\n'You may have won this battle, my little guy, but the war is still far from over.' she says, pouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiles as she hears Mew's snoring. <br>\r\n\"Time for some fun~\" she says in pokemon language, with the effect of you not understanding anything about what she said. But that mischievous voice can't mean anything good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, Celebi gets up and starts floating upwards, you safely grasped in her paws. She sits on a high tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass type moves you to her mouth. Just when you are about to talk, her tongue comes out of the cave as she starts licking you, coating you in thick saliva.<br>\r\n\"W-wha...\" you don't get to finish, as Celebi sticks you inside her mouth, her lips sealing behind you, trapping you once again in the slippery, dark confines of the 'cave'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the little human starting to struggle in the inside of her mouth, Celebi spreads her legs, while her left paw travels down to her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again feeling aroused because of the activity in her mouth, Celebi starts rubbing her pulsing crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the inside of the 'cavern', you try to get a foothold, which is practically impossible because of the reddish pink 'floor' throwing you back and forth. <br>\r\n\"Come on Celebi, let me out!\" you shout. Why in the world does she keep doing this?! Celebi swishes you around, ignoring you. Mercifully, you don't get to meet her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's tongue starts pushing you further into the mouth, extremely near her throat. Your heart skips several beats. You open your mouth to shout once again, but you just get a mouthful of saliva. You almost choke as the muscle you're laying on moves you further again. At this point, your feet and part of your legs are practically already in the dark abyss of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside world, Celebi moans blissfully. She's feeling great, her blood pumping in her veins, her heart galloping within her chest... If she accidentally uses her psychic, with this amount of pleasure, her powers would go wild for sure. But that gives her an idea. Giving one last push with her tongue, she shoves her tiny human into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart almost stops. Celebi swallowed you. Is this the end? Are you going to die again?<br>\r\nYou struggle as you are moved into the esophagus, trying to halt your fall somehow. Which obviously doesn't work.<br>\r\n\"No...\" you whisper, unable to believe this is happening again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi feels the little lump travelling down her throat. She giggles. Her little guy must be terrorized. Not stopping giggling, she focuses on the movements down her throat and uses psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body suddenly stops falling. You find yourself glowing blue as you are brought back up into the mouth. The psychic grasp releases you on Celebi's tongue. Just then, the giantess lets out a sharp moan, sending vibrations through her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grass type relaxes back, a small puddle forming around her sex as her paw retreats. <br>\r\n'That... felt... wonderful...' she thinks to herself. She feels her little human struggling to get out again. Smiling, she digs her paw in her mouth, getting a hold of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are pulled back out by Celebi's paw. She lets you lay there, pale, shaking, dripping both saliva and sweat. Her free paw finds its way to your head as she gently caresses you, waiting for you to recover from the frightening experience you just had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while, but you calm down enough to talk.<br>\r\n\"Y-You swallowed me!\" you shout. Celebi laughs.<br>\r\n'Quit being such a baby, I did bring you back up.' she says you. \"...Why? Why do you keep doing that? The mouth thing, I mean.\" you ask, as calmly as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's legs immediately close together, hiding the puddle several feet beneath you.<br>\r\n\"Bi~\" she starts giggling. You sigh. Looks like you won't be getting any response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi cleans off your dripping body with a paw, before flying back down to her shrine, sitting down next to a sleeping Mew.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pecks your cheek.<br>\r\n\"Can... can't we just sleep?\" you ask, trying to get rid of the pink shade on your face. Celebi laughs silently, not wanting to wake Mew, before looking down at you.<br>\r\n'First, could you be a sweetie and do something for me?' she asks.<br>\r\n'Why should I? You swallowed me!' you mentally shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Celebi makes her saddest face, her lips shaking, tears welling in her eyes.<br>\r\n'Please?' she asks. Damned puppy eyes!<br>\r\n\"Urgh... What?\" you say, annoyed. The giantess' face instantly brightens up.<br>\r\n'Well~' she says, her eyes glowing of an azure light, that soon surrounds you.<br>\r\n You float in midair as Celebi rolls on her belly. You are lowered on her back, right in between her big, fairy-like wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Could you rub them for a bit? It's been ages since I got some attention there. Those girls feel kinda lonely.' she says, faking a sad tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure?\" you say.<br>\r\n'Be careful, my wings are very sensible. I might move too much and you could fall off. Or...' Celebi  tries to warn you, but you stop her. <br>\r\n'I got it!' you think, trying to shake off the images of your body turned to paste on the ground. Or worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin rubbing one of her wings - which is twice your height - slowly, immediately getting a blissful sigh from the mythical pokemon.<br>\r\n'That's great! Don't stop!' she encourages you with a delighted voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not a easy task, as Celebi's wings are mostly out of your reach - so you have to limit yourself to rub the lower area -  but the major problem here is another: if the two massive objects start flapping by any chance, you would probably be sent flying like a piece of paper. The only difference would be your landing, which would be much more painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub both wings - very often, getting sighs and moans of pure happiness from the time traveler - until your arms hurt, in which point you stop petting.<br>\r\n'Hey, why did you stop? It was lovely! Keep going, please!' Celebi whines.<br>\r\n\"My arms hurt, and I need to sleep.\" you say bluntly. The grass type beneath you gives a disappointed screech in response. <br>\r\n'Fine.' she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are yet again lifted by a psychic force as Celebi rolls on her back. Then, the invisible grasp holding you disappears, and you fall down, right in her paws.<br>\r\n'You were wonderful! I loved it!' she chirps with glee. You smile a little.<br>\r\n'I didn't feel like that in ages.  And I know how to reward you  nicely.' she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, she lies you on the landscape of her belly, right where both shades of green meet. Her paws close around your form, pushing you further into the grassy flesh, leaving just your feet out of of her hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the grass type starts humming quietly, a soothing sound that makes you... more drowsy than you already are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when your brain is about to drift off, you decide to forgive the time traveler.<br>\r\nYou use your remaining energy to talk.<br>\r\n\"Please... Promise me you won't do that anymore... promise me you won't swallow me again...\" you beg the grass type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiles, lifting you up and bringing you to her face. <br>\r\n'Don't worry, my dear little one, I won't.' she plants a peck on your forehead, before placing you back on her belly, covering your body with her paws again while resuming her humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, you are asleep on the 'bed' made out of the giantess' belly, a peaceful look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing you asleep, Celebi smiles brightly as she looks around. Mew fell asleep long ago, she couldn't possibly have heard or seen anything of what the time traveler did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on her face, Celebi relaxes back, her eyes disappearing behind her black eyelids. Her breath slows down. The small time traveler cuddles to her little human and slowly falls asleep, joining both her lifetime friend and her tiny boy in the world of dreams.</span></div></div>",

You didn't come, so I thought I'd come and check on you.\" she explains.<br>\r\n\"How did you know where to find me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You mentioned Celebi yesterday, so I assumed you were here. And if it isn't enough for an explanation, isn't that the same Mew who wanted to 'kill you' yesterday?\" she replies.<br>\r\n\"But you seem quite... busy right now though...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you slide out of Celebi's hug and get up. Extremely careful to not awake Celebi or Mew, Weavile moved one of her clawed paws in front of you. You hop on as the dark pokemon quickly flees into the forest at full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, Weavile lets herself fall on her behind, and places you on top of her belly.<br>\r\nSeveral minutes pass as she catches her breath, before speaking.<br>\r\n\"So... how are things going?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Ehm... fine? Anything too exciting, I mean.\" you quickly correct yourself, hiding your nervousness, still not completely used to chat with talking pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile nods. Then, her stomach growls, shaking your whole world, while threatening to make you deaf.<br>\r\nWeavile snickers.<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Looks like I'm hungry.\" she apologizes as your hands rocket to your head, trying to stop it from shaking.<br>\r\n\"I noticed...\" you say in a whisper, intensifying the sneakers coming from upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey human.\" Weavile then says, stopping her snickering.<br>\r\n\"What?\".<br>\r\n\"I just got an idea. I have to hunt, I can't possibly stay without food again, can I? But I really can't leave you alone while I do so... I think it would be nice if you... wanted to come with me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer request shocks you. But the barely audible 'okay' that quickly escapes your mouth shocks you even more. The dark pokemon smiles as she gets up and sets you on her shoulder, dashing deep into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weavile? Where exactly are we heading?\" you ask, trying to hang on the best you can. If you though hanging on Celebi's head as she flew at supersonic speed while you were riding on her head, riding on Weavile's shoulder as she dashes at light speed is many times worse. You have to hold on to the short strands of black fur, a not simple task to perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get no reply. Instead, when you are about to throw up, Weavile stops.<br>\r\n\"Urgh... what now?\" you ask, but the black pokemon whispers you to shut up as she points to a fluffy, long creature that you recognize as a Furret wandering around, unaware of your presence. You sigh, understanding Weavile just found dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully holding you, Weavile quickly climbs up on a tree and waits for the Furret to turn around, before darting downwards without making any noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the cream colored pokemon turns around, just to leap back scared at the sight of Weavile, who quickly, charges it, waving her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pokemon start fighting. It's pretty clear that Weavile is stronger, as she almost immediately manages to overpower her opponent with her unbeatable speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the Furret, with a lucky shot, uses tackle, hitting Weavile in the stomach, sending her flying into a tree, while sending you flying from.her shoulder as well. Luckily, you land on a soft surface, between two large ears: the Furret's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe normal type lets you down of its head and sniffs your tiny body for a while, long minute, before suddenly it lowers its mouth. You can't even scream as its jaws close around you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stop to rub your eyes for a second.

Mentally preparing the first excuse you can think of, you come out of the bush you were in. Celebi seems to feel your presence, since she turns her head in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile spreads on her face as she spots you. And, before you can act, you're suddenly enveloped in a blue aura. You're raised from the ground and start floating towards Celebi.

Celebi could really take the moment and have finally some quality, private time with you. This chance is not going to return, and she knows it. So she decides that if she wants to have her fun, she has to do it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are quietly napping, relaxed from Celebi's soft skin and the warm embrace she has you closed in. But then, you are awakened by the feeling of yourself moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see Celebi rising you from her belly.

Are you here?\" you call out, unable to see further due the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. No figure of someone getting up. No noise of a stomach growling loudly. This cave is completely empty aside from you and the berry. Weavile must have found some energy to get up and go hunting. You sigh. You had to work hard to push the berry here, and now you find it was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, you decide to wait until Weavile returns. Hopefully, with her hunger satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments pass. Minutes. Almost an hour. And Weavile still doesn't return. You yawn drowsily and rub your eyes. Boredom mixes with drowsiness as you wait for a familiar pokemon with sharp claws to return the cave. Asking yourself what made you leave your soft, warm 'bed' for a hard, cold rocky floor, you close your eyes. You don't want to sleep, just to rest your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to re...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Weavile is up in the trees, jumping from branch to branch. Her movements are slowed down by the hunger, so she hasn't gone very far. She has to find food. Preferably asleep, so she can eat without hearing those annoying screams of death. But if she skips another meal, she'll be the one dead, granted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, she still didn't found a prey. Her belly growls again, making a few Rattatas flee. Damn! <br>\r\n'Good way to let preys flee. Thank you stomach.' she thinks sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at you, you are suddenly awakened by something sneaking in the cave. You open your eyes.<br>\r\n\"Weavile?\" you call out. <br>\r\nNo answer.<br>\r\nInstead, two golden eyes shine in the darkness,  you hardly notice a black figure standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your misfortune, it's not Weavile. It's a Cacturne! The grass type is staring at you with hunger in its eyes.<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like I finally found dinner. A little bug and a berry as big as a fist. Lucky me.\" it says, raising its barbed hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared to death, you scream as you avoid being captured by rolling away.<br>\r\n\"Hey, come here you little bug, I'm hungry!\" the Cacturne exclaims, giving chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile looks up. She's sure to have heard someone screaming behind her. Her hearing is very good, so she's sure that was a scream. Though it seemed like a faint squeak. Looking back at the cave, she sees a tall figure standing at its entrance. It looks like a Cacturne. This makes her think. That voice seemed like... the little human from earlier. But that can't be possible right? It was just a mere hallucination caused by the hunger, right? Another scream comes from the cave. Apparently, the little guy from before - and her so-real only friend - fled earlier and came back, maybe to check on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, if he is real, then it means that he's in danger! Another scream is heard.<br>\r\n\"Coming little guy, hold on!\" Weavile says, while jumping down and dashing to the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run, trying to escape from the Cacturne, but you end up backed up against the wall. The Cacturne smirks triumphantly.<br>\r\n\"Looks like I got you little bug. Finally I can eat!\" it snickers, as it lowers its hand to get you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thought it would have helped you a bit,\" you partially lie.<br>\r\n\"But I see you managed to get something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile's belly growls at the word 'food'.<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? Have you ever tried eating a Cacturne without hurting yourself? And then, they taste horrible. In fact...\" she roughly pushes the fainted pokemon outside, before turning back to you \"Back at us. Please tell me you did it. Please tell me you got food. Please tell me there is food in this cave right now.\" she says, groaning. Clearly, she hasn't eaten yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile a little.

Where?!\" Weavile asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't even reply. She already spotted the berry herself and rushes to it. Dropping you gently on the ground once she lowers herself, she roughly grabs the berry and throws it into her mouth. Without even chewing, she devours the berry in one big gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was good. Where did you even find that?\" Weavile asks after giving a satisfied sigh.<br>\r\n\"Uh, you know, I found it laying around...\" you lie. You're sure that telling her that berry was created by a certain green pokemon, who appears to be the deity that guards this forest, would be pretty weird.<br>\r\n\"Well, that was satisfying anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long passes before you let out a yawn.<br>\r\n\"Uh, are you tired little guy?\" Weavile asks.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Better I get back 'home'. Bye Weavile.\" you say, making your way to the exit of the cave. Right before a clawed paw drops in front of you, blocking your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to Weavile confused.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I can't let you go,\" she states.<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You see, I'm not the only nocturnal predator around here. The only difference is that I'm a lot nicer than the others. Not any predator would have been like me,\" she explains.<br>\r\n\"You tried to eat me!\"<br>\r\n\"But I didn't, did I? Now, for your own sake, it's better if you spend the night here. Or at least you could have me get you back. But you seem pretty tired, and I don't know which way to go. What are you going to do?\" she asks, before yawning.<br>\r\n\"I could use some sleep too,\" she admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with your mind clouded by your drowsiness, you try to think. If you spend the night, you will surely have to do a lot of explaining with Celebi. The whole thing might end with you in a lot of trouble for sneaking away in the middle of the night and/or worse, in Celebi's stomach once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Weavile is right. You're tired, you could collapse in any moment. And then again, what guarantees that one of the other nocturnal predators Weavile talked about won't try and attack the both of you? Weavile would have to fight in disadvantage since she would be carrying you. <br>\r\nAnd maybe, Celebi could be still asleep when you got back in the morning. In which case you would be extremely lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawn again. You need to sleep. So you hurry up and take a decision...</span></div></div>",

I need to... sleep...\" you reply, laying down on the rocky floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. But I don't think it's a wise thing for someone your size to sleep on the ground.

Anymore questions?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. This pokemon has a solid logic, a logic that you can't fight. So you just decide to agree (mostly to get some sleep as soon as possible.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Weavile snickers, while gently picking you. She then lies you down on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe it. Weavile wasn't kidding about being warm. Her fur is just as warm and soft as Mew's, just... darker. An ice type pokemon being this warm, it couldn't be possible. But now you are quite used to impossible things to be the exact opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night little guy. Try to not move too much.\" Weavile says, crossing her claws on her chest. You sigh in relief. At least those six sharp claws aren't anywhere near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling a little sheepish, you yawn again and try to get asleep quickly. Sleep would erase your embarrassment. These are your last thoughts, before you slowly drift off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are awakened by the sound of an early Pidgey chirping. You slowly open your eyes, trying to recollect the memories of last night. Last thing you remember is falling asleep on Weavile's belly after agreeing to spend the night with her. You look down. You're still on the massive furry belly, apparently still intact. Weavile is in the same position she was last night. She wasn't kidding about being a sound sleeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie there without moving. You should get back to Celebi, try to make it before she wakes up to avoid any trouble. Yet, something to be pushing you down. You try to get up, but your body won't listen. Clearly, you're still tired, it's still too early to go anywhere. Weavile is still asleep, and she probably will be for a while, so you can easily sneak away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, what's the harm if you stay a bit longer? You can easily return later and tell Celebi you needed a drink. But what if she somehow finds out where have you been? That would be bad. She would most certainly punish you.

The only sound heard is Mew's soft snoring. Then, Celebi suddenly turns your attention to you and gently picks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, her smile was caused by her thinking of some nice things she could do with you. And now Mew is asleep, she can easily try some of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Celebi staring at you with something between a grin and a warm smile.

Yeah, me too. It may have been the weirdest day of my life, but hey, at least I got a friend.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"AND a girlfriend!\" Mew says, now laughing.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Celebi.

Mew... Can't... Breath...\" you mutter from the lack of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink cat quickly releases you.<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Sorry!\" she giggles. But then she yawns.<br>\r\n\"I need to sleep.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer statement makes you remember the reason of why she woke up in the first place. You yawn loudly as well.<br>\r\n\"Me too.

'give you back' to Celebi tomorrow though,\" she replies, before yawning again.<br>\r\n\"Good night little one.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Good night Mew...\". With that, you close your eyes.

Bothered by the sudden feeling, you give a yawn and slowly open them. You find yourself still closed in Mew's soft yet firm hug. The pink cat pokemon is still pretty much asleep, snoring softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are really tempted to get back to sleep, but you know you have to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCareful to not wake Mew up, you slowly slide out of her grip. Mew seems to notice your sudden absence, since she almost immediately rolls on her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad you weren't on the ground (and more specifically, crushed beneath Mew) right now, you make your way towards the sleeping body of Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is asleep as well, one of her long arms is laying there on the ground. Stepping on her huge finger (that is almost twice your size), you start walking towards Celebi's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk for a while on the immense, green land, before finally reaching your destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon you reach the spot where both shades of green meet- specifically, Celebi's chest, aka your new bed -you lie down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon you lie down, Celebi instantly wraps her arms around your body; only your head and your legs are left out of her hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't move, you just stay still (not that you can move anyway), rising and falling along the land beneath you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi keeps snoring for a good while, before you feel her breath stopping. Your world shakes as the little time traveler pokemon releases and begins stirring.<br>\r\n\"BIIIIIIIIII!\" she gives a deep yawn, before opening her blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite remembering where you were last night, Celebi absentmindedly sits up.<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" you scream as you fall down. Right on her lap. Luckily, your little scream could be heard by the green pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her own lap, Celebi smiles as she moves her arms to pick the little human that fell there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce secured in Celebi's solid grasp, you are brought up to her face.<br>\r\n\"Good morning little guy~\" she chirps.<br>\r\n\"How was your sleep?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not able to understand her like you won't be for a looooong time during your stay with Celebi, you sigh.<br>\r\nThe green pokemon holding you gives a little sigh of her own, like you annoyed by the fact you can't understand her, nor she could speak the human language. So she limits herself in pecking both your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stay silent for a while, you trying to get rid of the blush that has appeared on your face, Celebi trying to think of something interesting to do in private with you while Mew is asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Celebi has an idea. Since Mew is sleeping, the little time traveler could use her powers and do the same thing she often does when she's alone: travelling in time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that it's indeed a good idea, Celebi looks at you smiling. Sure, she's sorry that she will have to leave Mew alone for a bit without telling here where the two of you are, but the chance of having some quality (and most of all, private!) time with you is too good to let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlowing green, Celebi flies up in the sky. You wonder what the heck she's doing, but you soon get your answer as both of you disappear in a flash of green light.</span></div></div>",

You remember about Celebi signature ability of travelling through time. She must have brought you back to yesterday. And the other Celebi and you are just the both of you returning from Celebi's 'trip', the one that was meant to bring you back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curiously watch the scene of past Celebi petting your sleeping body, occasionally picking you to nuzzle you against her cheeks.<br>\r\n\"We traveled through time Celebi?\" you ask, getting a nod from her.<br>\r\n\"And you took care of me while I was asleep? Thank you.\" You whisper with a small smile.<br>\r\n\"Bi!\" comes your reply as she hugs you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Celebi glows once again and disappears again.<br>\r\nJust to reappear in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Celebi wanted to verify a little thing of her own. Since she was asleep yesterday after fighting with Zoroark, she wants to see what her little guy and Mew did while alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi flies for a bit, before spotting herself, Mew and her little guy. Her past counterpart is already sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay still as you are being carried by Celebi as she follows your past counterparts. The little green pokemon assists at the scene where you healed her (in which part both you and your past self get a kiss); then, Celebi watches you playing with Mew and running from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Celebi, all of what is happening now is just a funny game between her friend and her lover. But to you is a lot more. You start to sweat as you remember something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the moment when you run into Weavile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, as your past self runs towards the log Celebi was (and currently is) sleeping, a bush rustles.

You are pretty sure you were loud enough for anyone to at least hear a faint squeak. But Weavile apparently didn't, and she continues her meditation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're shocked. How focused this pokemon is to don't even notice your presence here? You slowly make your way towards the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, anyone would have said that Weavile is meditating. But a closer inspection reveals that she's not at all... in fact, she's asleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou face palm.<br>\r\n\"Weavile!\" you shout. The dark type instantly shuts her eyes open, startled at the sudden voice calling out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically searching for whatever caused that scream, Weavile spots you on the ground. Her startled expression slowly fades to a grin.<br>\r\n\"Hey there little guy.\" she greets you, while moving a claw in your direction for you to climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're on the sharp, metallic surface, you're brought face to face... Or, more accurate, face to body with Weavile.<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you kept your promise. I was waiting for you, but I guess I got asleep.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Yes, you did.\" you remark <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly growing bored of the awkward silence that has formed after your last sentence, you decide to speak up.<br>\r\n\"So, I'm here now... want to do something?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile smirks.<br>\r\n\"Though you would never ask.

We could have some REAL fun... or we could just do something else... That's totally up to you.\" she says, her smirk not leaving her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her for a few moments.

You have time until one hundred before she chases you. And she never said that you couldn't hide in the forest, right? So you have plenty of hiding places. That would give you a great advantage and, hopefully, it would led you to victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then again, Weavile is a predator. Weaviles are in fact known not only for their amazing speed- and their razor sharp claws -but also for their incredibly as well sharp senses.

And if she finds you... you shiver at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in your thoughts, you didn't notice Weavile reaching sixty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapped back to reality by her voice, you hurry up and take a decision...</span></div></div>",

But, even though this size gives you the advantage to hide easily, it also slows you down, meaning that haven't gone far...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, shortly after, you hear the familiar voice of Weavile coming from the cave.<br>\r\n\"One hundred! Coming!\" she shouts with excitement. This only makes you accelerate your running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Weavile is obviously faster than you - if not faster than any pokemon in the whole forest! - and quickly dashes out of the cave, searching for her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head, Weavile is quickly coming your direction. With growing fear, you keep running, searching for any possible hiding place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you sigh in relief when you spot a small puddle of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot caring about where it came from, you jump in it, producing a small *splash*. You hold your breath as much as you can, while Weavile stops to look for you.<br>\r\n\"Where are you little guy? Come out wherever you are!\" she calls out with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to drown in this puddle, but luckily for you, you feel the water vibrate. Knowing that the vibrations are caused by Weavile's booming footsteps, you merge. Coughing, you walk out of the puddle, soaked. Weavile is nowhere to be seen, so you assume she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as you are about to get going, a booming sound is heard behind you.<br>\r\n\"Look who's there.\" a very familiar voice sends shivers down your back. You slowly turn around, praying that it was just your mind playing pranks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnluckily, Weavile is really standing in front of you now, her usual grin painted on her face. You put two and two together and you realize she tricked you! She pretended to leave, but she climbed on a tree to take you by surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there paralyzed with fear, while Weavile walks to you. She snatches you in her claws.<br>\r\n\"What a shame, I thought you would last longer than that. Well, it appears I got you, so-\" she doesn't get to finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a scream is heard, and a figure passes, startling Weavile, and you as well. The dark type looks to see that it was just a Wurmple, apparently scared by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapped back to your senses, you notice Weavile still wondering what the heck just happened, so you take chance and slip out of her loosen grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on her paw. Jumping off, you dash away once again. Still not having realized that you left, Weavile turns to you. And, to her surprise, you are gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Weavile starts chasing you again, recovered from the surprise, you are already far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run through the quiet forest, sweating and panting. With your heart racing, your vision obscured and your breath running short, you have to stop to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering, you reach a berry bush, trying to rest. Suddenly, you let out a yawn.<br>\r\n'No, it's not the right time to sleep. I need to stay awake. I need to st...' you think before falling asleep. Already tired from the day you had, the game just made you more drowsy, at the point you collapsed on the ground, asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes. Weavile searches for you in the forest, in a futile attempt to find you. But she didn't think of searching in that berry bush she passed a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, somewhat annoyed by your hiding skills, she tries to find you without results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up much later. Yawning, you get up and walk out of the bush, before remembering what were you doing. Immediately awake, you look around to see if Weavile is anywhere near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot finding her, you look up in the sky. Your heart seems to beat faster when you see the moon slowly disappearing to let the sun rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour moment is short lived though. In fact, Weavile is walking back, thinking that maybe you aren't ahead of her, you are instead behind her. And her thoughts turn out to be right when she spots you on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smirk reappears on her lips.<br>\r\n\"Finally! There you are! I was thinking you disappeared! But you're here, right you were for the whole time right?\" she asks. You don't answer. Your fear shuts your mouth closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile continues.<br>\r\n\"Well, now you're here, in front of me. And you won't go anywhere.\" she snickers, slowly walking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs seems to melt. You can't move, you're paralyzed. Your only hope now is that the sun rises before she eats you. But you know that's highly improbable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffling, you close your eyes, awaiting your doom...</span></div></div>",

The only pokemon I meet are usually too dead to make conversation... Except the occasional screams of pain or...\"<br>\r\n\"I don't want to know it. The point is, we are friends and we know very little about each other.

What about you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I would have loved to be a pokemon trainer...

Celebi and Mew are standing (or rather floating) on the wooden structure, puzzled expressions on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat, getting their attention. Immediately, Celebi flies at supersonic speed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, you find yourself securely grasped in her paws while she nuzzles you lovingly.<br>\r\n\"Bi! Bi!\" she says in an excited squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still can't believe how fast things went. One second, you are in Celebi's paws, getting nuzzled, and the other you are on the ground, the two gigantic pokemon staring at you with puzzled expressions once again on their faces. They're absolutely colossal to you, as big as skyscrapers, empathized by the fact they're standing on their feet, leaving you obscured in their shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little guy, where were you until now?\" Mew asks in your mind after talking with Celebi in pokemon language.<br>\r\n\"Ehm, I just went to explore around, that's it...\" you lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the excuse convinces Celebi, who nods her head.<br>\r\n\"Exploring? It could have been dangerous,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but he's here, perfectly fine. So, even in that size, he still has perfect survival instincts, wouldn't you agree?\" Mew asks with a smile.<br>\r\nCelebi smiles back.<br>\r\n\"You're right, little guy is smart. Though I would prefer if he sticks with me. But that's enough-\" Celebi says scooping you in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"- You're here now, so we can finally have fun!\".<br>\r\nMew's eyes lit up at the word 'fun'.<br>\r\n\"Fun! Fun!\" she beams.<br>\r\n\"We could time travel again!

Feeling cut out of the conversation, you are surprised to hear Mew suddenly talk in your mind.<br>\r\nUpon telling you the situation, you think of the ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the two pokemon quickly grow impatient.

Celebi squeezes you in a protective hug. Zoroark smirks maniacally.<br>\r\n\"Hi there. Long time no see.\" she says coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything happens in a matter of seconds. Zoroark uses night daze, which Celebi and Mew avoid. Both then fire respectively energy ball and aura sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth spheres combine and hit the dark fox, who is sent flying back.<br>\r\n\"You will pay for that.\" Zoroark mutters under her breath, while hardly standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Mew raises a stubby finger and starts wagging it. You realize she's using metronome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you're freezing. You realize Mew is using blizzard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack hits and Zoroark gets freezed.<br>\r\n\"We got a few minutes, come on! Let's return to our time!\" Mew exclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nods while grabbing Mew's paw. Getting sure she has a good hold on you, she starts to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, when you thought you were safe, Zoroark manages to break through the ice. Then, in a second, she somehow manages to grab Mew. Before anything else can happen, Celebi uses time travel, letting the four of you disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash of green light, you are brought to what you assume is present Ilex Forest. Normally, the sight of the place that has been your home for days would have tranquilized you. But the figure of the dark fox is all but tranquilizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the battle goes on. At one point, Celebi deposited you on the ground, before joining Mew. You watch impotently as the three pokemon fight. You feel frustrated. You're powerless, you can't do nothing to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an idea crosses your mind. Actually, you could do something to help... if SHE is awake, that's it. Yeah, Weavile could definitely give Zoroark a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, if you leave, you could run into some wild pokemon looking for lunch. And the sun is still shining, so darkness won't aid you. And Weavile could not be in the cave. Obviously, these are secondary fact; your main worry is about what happens if Celebi and Mew gets defeated. Even though both are legendaries, Zoroark is a really powerful pokemon. <br>\r\nAnd she can create illusions too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes, and none of the three pokemon gives any sign of wanting to give up. You have to take a decision - now!</span></div></div>",

Even if I won't shrink, I <b>need</b> to eat...\" these words pronounced by the gigantic Weavile are more than enough to make you tremble with fear. Suddenly, you find yourself wishing once again that you were with Celebi. Your chances with a pretty yet fearful legendary are much better than your chances with a hungry, delirious pokemon. But Celebi is maybe still asleep, unaware of your awaiting doom, while Mew is Arceus knows where. So you haven't many chances of survival right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the inevitable happens. Giving you one last, although sorrowful look, Weavile starts pulling you closer to her mouth, opening it in the meantime. Your trembling increases as she moves you to her opened lips, shoves you inside, and closes them back up, sealing you in the dark, hot, slippery (and most of all, terrific!) confines of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type moves you around in her mouth, tasting you but, true to her word, you don't meet any of the sharp teeth present. <br>\r\n\"Please!... No! I'll get you food, you don't have to do this!...\" you tell at top of your lungs. Weavile stops for a short moment. Your heart freezes as the mouth opens briefly.<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" comes her booming voice, before the tongue beneath you starts moving yet again, this time dragging you to the edge of the abyss that is her throat. And then, with one gulp, the dark weasel sends you to a one way journey to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUseless to say, you slide down the right and slippery tunnel of Weavile's esophagus and land into the fleshy interiors of her stomach, right in a sea of acid. This can't be happening again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around frenetically, trying to find any possible from this fleshy hell. But the only thing that you can spot in the darkness of the stomach is a small spinchther that most probably leads to Weavile's intestinal tract... but, even if it's better than the alternative, you'll never willingly take <i>that</i> exit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Weavile rubs her belly.<br>\r\n\"Hey? Are you alright in there?\" she asks to her own stomach. She carefully listens to your answer.<br>\r\n\"Not for long!\" you exclaim with fear.<br>\r\n\"Come on, don't be like that. What's it like in there?\" she asks, remembering of her curiosity about her own insides.<br>\r\n\"It's dark, hot, and it smells awful. Oh, yeah, and I'm also going to die very soon!\" you reply sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, look on the bright side...\" she says. Not the type of thing a dark type says usually.<br>\r\n\"Why, is there any?!\" comes the rhetorical question.<br>\r\n\"We-\" Weavile attempts to say, but you cut her off.<br>\r\n\"Look, just stop and let me die.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your anger, and respecting your true, last wish, Weavile just shuts up. Hunger settled, she decides to face her second problem and sleep for a bit. So she closes her eyes, attempting to get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile, didn't give up in trying to find a way out of this. Since Weavile is laying on her back, you try to climb back to her throat. But, at your first try, you end up falling right back into the stomach. Darn... Where the heck is Mew?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith horror, you realize that the fluid, that isn't burning yet, has risen up to your waist. The heat is also starting to become unbearable. And the smell surely isn't getting any better. What are you going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile had been trying to get some sleep, but she simply couldn't. She feels a weight in her chest, which undoubtedly is her own conscience, that is hammering her heart. And she perfectly knows the cause. Your words resound in her ears.<br>\r\n\u2018I-I'll be your friend!\u2019. Those four words are repeated hundreds of times in her mind, making her feel even worse. She doomed her friend... her only friend, and she knows that.<br>\r\n\"What... what have I done?\" she asks herself with sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the stomach, your time is running out. The acids rose once again, this time to your torso. So, lacking ideas to get out, you simply decide to try and convince Weavile to let you out of here.<br>\r\n\"Weavile!\" you shout. <br>\r\n\"Hey...\" she replies after a few seconds.<br>\r\n\"Come on Weavile, I beg you, let me out! I'll do anything! I'll be your friend, I'll be your slave, just let me out!\" you say desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you say that, the acids rise up to your neck. You start to feel a tingling sensation. After the experience in Celebi's stomach, you fully know that it will soon start to burn, then you'll be slowly dissolved into nothing but food for Weavile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBubbles of acid start to form and pop around you, meaning that digestion has started. A small hope enters your heart as you, listening carefully, hear Weavile whispering to herself. Is she thinking to let you out? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the dark weasel decides, you hope she's quick - your date is incoming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Outside of the dark, lethal chamber that is Weavile's stomach, the dark type pokemon lays there, eyes half lidded, arms and legs spread on the floor. She's drowsy, but unable to sleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy does that human she ate have such an effect on her? He's just food, like every other prey unluckily enough to end up in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile shakes her head. That isn't entirely true. She never ate a human before, and she's regretting doing so now. The tiny human wasn't just food, he was the very fist soul she ever talked to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very first living being she called a friend, even if it was for a really brief time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence inside the cavern is suddenly broke by a what seems a mere whisper, coming from within her. And, as Weavile told the human before sending you on a trip in the inside of her stomach, she has very good hearing, so that the single word he said didn't escape her.<br>\r\n\"Please...\" his voice sounds weaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice-dark type figures out that it won't be long before the tiny human is digested. She imagines your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone, in complete darkness, and surrounded by flesh while submerged in deadly liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shudders at the thought, quickly shaking the imagine off her head. It only made her feel worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemorseful, Weavile makes a choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'll spare the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, without even thinking lucidly, she lifts her left arm in the air, her claws shining sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the same claws glow with icy energy as she performs ice punch. Which she then slams into her own stomach with great strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith enough strength that her legs rise off the ground, her teeth grit and her eyes close in pain, while a thick layer of ice forms on her belly, only to shatter shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her action also had a side effect on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to lose every hope and - for the second time - accept your horrible fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your world suddenly shakes along Weavile's stomach as a violent impact ungracefully throws you upwards. A stream of gastric juice follows you, dragging you into the giantess' esophagus and, eventually, in her mouth, which she opens while tilting her head, making you slide out, into the light and onto the cold, hard floor of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot caring about what you just went through, you fearfully turn to face the dark weasel, who just eyes you with a small smirk.<br>\r\n\"<b>Hello there</b>\" she snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't respond, and take a few steps back instead. The smirk fades from Weavile's face.<br>\r\n\"<b>Do not leave, please. We need to talk, alright?</b>\" you don't answer, but you halt.<br>\r\n\"<b>I'm too tired to try anything anyway, so there's no need to fear me.</b>\" she speaks, empathizing her words with a loud yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to talk to you?\" you ask frowning, while wiping some of her gastric juices off your body.<br>\r\n\"<b>... I let you out?</b>\" <br>\r\n\"You also let me in, so we're even. And I don't have anything more to say.\" you reply coldly, starting to walk away again.<br>\r\n\"<b>You know, you're kinda walking to your grave,</b>\" Weavile states, successfully getting your attention.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"<b>The sun set down, the forest's full of predators and I'm the only one who can keep you safe right know. It's not like you have a chance out there.</b>\" she says with another yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say nothing, but lower your head. She's right. You would be nothing but a snack for the first pokemon you would meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, sighing, you sit down, back turned to Weavile.<br>\r\n\"And I thought you were cool.\" you remark. The giantess snickers behind you, showing she doesn't hold any hard feelings for your pissed behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground quakes lightly beneath you as her clawed feet move towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain still and, soon enough, a shining set of claws gently picks you up.<br>\r\n\"<b>Come on, are you going to pout forever?</b>\" Weavile laughs as she manipulates you so that you're facing her.<br>\r\n\"What if say that I'm really sorry?\" she asks, giving a sympathetic smile, while gently cleaning you from the foul substance that covers your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you're about to respond, a loud cry resounds inside the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Found you!</b></i>\" both you and Weavile turn to see a pink pokemon, with a long tail and sapphire eyes hovering above the entrance of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're the first to recover from your alarmed state.<br>\r\n\"Mew?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you (mostly) fine, Mew smiles briefly, before looking at Weavile venomously.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">You. Let him go. This instant!</span>\" she cries in poke-speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile sweat drops.<br>\r\n\"<b>W-Wait, I can actually explain thi-</b>\" she abruptly stops upon seeing the stern glare Mew is giving her. She quickly realizes that she's isn't up to hear any story right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile knows what she has to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, without hesitation, she does it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Mew by surprise, she dashes towards her, roughly pushing her aside and running towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her plan goes poorly as Mew's tails suddenly coils around her leg, tripping her and making her fall down. You are released in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mew hovers close to the dark type waves her paw, a cloud of thick, green smoke hitting Weavile, who suddenly falls down.<br>\r\n\"Is she... dead?\" you ask, unable to think that Mew Just poisoned a pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary laughs as she lowers herself to pick you up.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Nope. She's just asleep. Thanks sleep powder!</span></i>\u2019 she telepathically chimes, gently caressing your hair, before turning around and floating out of the cave, leaving an asleep Weavile behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Hey,</span></i>\u2019 the telepathic assault startles you while Mew carries you most likely to Celebi's shrine. You briefly wonder about the grass type before answering:<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask, hiding a hint of annoyance.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">Sorry for not asking before, but... what happened in that cave? What did that Weavile do to you?</span></i>\u2019 Mew asks with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate, thinking that if you say the truth, Mew might just rethink, go back and poison Weavile for real. You shake your head. Mew wouldn't be capable of doing that. She's far too sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew takes your silence as horror. Slowly, you find her embracing you.<br>\r\n\u2018<i><span class=\"cpink\">It's alright if you don't want to talk. But, if you need to say something, you can. Come on,</span></i>\" she encourages you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment, pondering your answer, before deciding to say nothing.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Mew, I'm fine.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew nods her head, before hugging you tighter. You hug back, silently thanking her for caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you didn't grow fond of Celebi, you would be lying if you told that at least you didn't grow fond of Mew. Even is she ate you, by now you're sure it was an accident. But you know that you like both legendaries' company, at least a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it won't be so hard to get used to this new life after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, Mew releases you, giggles and places you on her head, before silently venturing deeper into Ilex Forest, making her way to Celebi...</span></div></div>",

Most probably that Mew went to wake Celebi when she lost sight of Weavile, and if the two find her... you're sure that she will go and make Zoroark company back in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I asked you something\" Weavile snaps you out of your train of thought \"Oh yeah, you see, this is all a huge mistake. Can you bring me back to Mew?\" you ask \"What? That crazy pokemon that almost killed us both? No way\" Weavile states \"And what mistake you are talking about?\" <br>\r\n\"Well... you see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mew wasn't chasing you, but she was chasing me to get you back? And you're saying that she was probably worried about you, because of all the bad things that happened with this Zoroark that claimed you as her slave? And now she and Celebi, who is your girlfriend, are for sure worried sick about you and very probably they are... coming to find you... and kill me? *GULP*\" Weavile gulps hard at the last part \"No, they won't kill you, I'm sure of it. But I think that you should try and explain yourself convincingly... or else you could wake up in the Prehistoric Era...\" you say. Weavile nods slowly \"Everything's so hard to believe... I mean, human and pokemon relationships are forbidden...\" <br>\r\n\"I want to let you know that I hadn't a choice in the matter. Celebi just brought me to Mew and Arceus; they both approved\" you say. Weavile thinks for a few seconds \"I believe you\" she says \"Thanks. Now, could you bring me back to Mew? I don't really want you to see you forced to pass through a portal that would bring you in another timeline. You seem nice\" you say \"Why thank you\" Weavile replies with a sly smile \"But I think you'll have to wait to get back\" <br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Because right now... I need to-\" Weavile collapses to the ground, asleep. You stare at her for a second, before getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander around for a small bit, before sitting down again. There's nothing to do. You can only wait for Weavile to wake up or for Mew and Celebi to find you. So you decide to try and recollect your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wake up!\". You open your eyes at the sudden voice. Weavile is standing before you. You must have fallen asleep \"You fell asleep\" Weavile confirms your thoughts \"I noticed\" <br>\r\n\"Well, now you're awake, I'm bringing you back\" she says, her sharp claws reaching down for you. With extreme caution, she picks you in her claws \"Let's go\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark type pokemon moves fast between the trees; speed is the most important weapon that Weaviles have in nature. Apart the claws of course. With both, they can slash anything to pieces in a matter of seconds. You don't even want to think to what would have happened if this Weavile wasn't so nice to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Weavile dashes forward, but she bumps into a fellow pokemon that was passing. She falls back. Luckily you manage to hold onto her claw. Getting up, Weavile notices that it is actually two pokemon she bumped into. A pink cat and small, green humanoid. Both get up as well and see Weavile. More specifically, they see you grasped in Weavile's claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, Mew's paws lit with fire, while Celebi glows pink \"You have one second to put the little guy down and leave\" Mew says in a calm voice \"Leave my little human on the ground and you won't wake up in another era\" Celebi says as well calmly. But her voice is full of poison. Weavile sweat drops. Everything the human said was right! \"W-wait! This is all a huge misunderstanding! I just found him on the ground; I was half asleep and didn't even notice is was holding him. Next thing I know is that Mew was blasting me with fire\" Weavile explains. Celebi's gaze goes from angry to amused as she looks at Mew \"I was trying to get our tiny friend back!\"<br>\r\n\"I would've given him back if you gave me the chance!\" Weavile retorts \"He's safe and sound! Look yourself!\" she holds you out for the two pokemon. Celebi quickly snatches you and looks all over your tiny form. Her eyes widen at the sight of the cut on your arm, the one that Weavile accidentally did you earlier \"If he's safe and sound, how do you explain this?!\" Celebi picks your arm and shows it to Weavile. Clearly, she noticed the small wound on it \"I would have been more careful if your friend there would've stopped attacking me. Back there I was a 'little' busy getting away from her!\" Weavile explains. Celebi and Mew...</span></div></div>",

And if I wasn't bringing him to you, why would I have given him back without a fight?\" Weavile retorts \"We're legendaries. Any pokemon would have\" Celebi lies, remembering how Zoroark gave her quite the fight for the her little guy. Weavile finds nothing to counter this last sentence \"As I thought\" Celebi says again, glowing green, while Mew readies focus blast. Weavile has a terrified look on her face \"Well little guy *Gulp* been a pleasure to meet you\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that your two pokemon companions are about to attack the helpless Weavile. So far, she didn't hurt you.

Ignoring her, you continue \"Don't attack her! She didn't do anything bad to me!! She helped me instead!\" you shout, getting weird looks by the three pokemon. Even Weavile is shocked that you are actually defending her \"B-but that cut...\" Mew says \"It's been an accident, Weavile never wanted to hurt me so far, she's been actually nice to me\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's gaze shifts from you to the dark type pokemon \"Is that true? You... you didn't hurt him on purpose?\" she asks \"Yes, everything he said is true!\" Weavile shouts, fearing for her life. A moment passes, when Celebi stops glowing \"If my little guy says so... I believe you\" she says. The sphere in Mew's paws disappears as she looks at Weavile \"Hey, sorry to have scared you. We were just worried, you know\" she apologizes \"It's okay. N-now, if you let me, I'll be on my way..\" Weavile says, starting to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the dark type pokemon leaving.

I barely know you\" Weavile says \"Yeah, but I don't consider someone who has been so nice to me a foe\" you state, getting a nod from Weavile \"Fine, I'll stay.

No!\" you shout out of embarrassment, a quick blush appearing on your face. Celebi nods \"You better\" she says, grasping you possessively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Weavile breaks the silence \"So... What now?\"<br>\r\n\"I was waiting for someone to say this. Let's play!\" Mew giggles, happily floating in circles. The sight makes you chuckle, and it makes Celebi smile, while Weavile rolls her eyes, her arms crossed. Clearly, she is a serious pokemon. But she eventually follows you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of non stop playing, the sun sets down, the moon starting to rise in the sky. Weavile had proven herself a valid player, her speed make her win most of the games you played. You're sure that she enjoyed it, though she didn't show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the moon fully rises in the sky, Weavile looks at it \"I'm going to hunt\" she says \"Will we be seeing you again?\" you ask hopeful <br>\r\n\"If you stay here, in the morning maybe\" she states. And with that, she dashes off. You look at her as she disappears through the forest, making her trail disappear as well \"Now that I think of it, we have to get dinner as well\" Mew says. Both you and Celebi nod, while three berries are snatched from a tree by psychic and float over you. An oran berry floats in front of you as the two pokemon dig in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating the berry, both Mew and Celebi yawn \"I think it's time to hit the hay little guy\" Celebi says, laying down at the feet of a big tree. Mew follows her and lies down as well, while you are placed on Celebi's chest, that you assume is your new 'bed'. Sighing you snuggle comfortably to the green giantess, getting a giggle from her \"That tickles!\" she exclaims, petting you slowly. The relaxing feeling makes you feel drowsy, you close your eyes just for a moment... and you end up falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Celebi smiles warmly \"You really do love him, don't you Celebi?\" comes the voice of a certain pink pokemon \"Yeah. I'm really glad you and Arceus accepted my love. I'm even more glad that he agreed to be mine\" Celebi says \"No problem, really. I have to admit, I would have done the same thing if I found him. He's a cutie!\"Mew giggles, sending her best friend into laughs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up and open your eyes. You notice that you are still laying on Celebi's chest, her hands wrapped around you. She's asleep, and so is Mew next to her. Something else catches your eye. Weavile is there, sleeping. She kept her promise and came back, a visible lump in her belly. Whatever she ate, it was big enough to fill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after you woke up, Celebi wakes up as well, followed by Mew \"Good morning little guy\" both pokemon greet you, Celebi pecking your cheek.

She joins in the hug, able to hug the both of you thanks to her long green arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are being crushed between two walls, one of pink fur and the other of green skin.

So she snatches you from the wooden surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen in fear when you notice you're getting close to Celebi's mouth <br>\r\n\"Celebi?\" you ask with fear, but she ignores you and, without giving you time to react, she drops you in her mouth and closes her lips, trapping you in the same dark cave you've been twice. You immediately start struggling, while Celebi spreads her legs and, as usual, starts rubbing her crotch, moaning lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'cave' drops with saliva, soaking and disgusting you. But these facts are not important right now, you are thinking about getting out without being eaten <br>\r\n\"Let me out! Please!\" you cry out. Something between a giggle and a moan echoes in the mouth as your reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi is in ecstasy right now. Her beloved feeling of power is once again overwhelming the needy one, and all thanks to the small guy inside her mouth. Celebi giggles, loving the feeling of her tiny human struggling inside her mouth. Every struggle he makes causes her to moan as she rubs her sex with increasing speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Celebi still can't tell why in the world it feels so good, but it does, and she can't help but going on. The feeling of power, her racing heart, her pulsing sex, all the facts combine to form an immense pleasure that passes through her whole body like a shockwave. But again, she's going to let you out once she's done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep on struggling and crying out for Celebi from the inside of her mouth<br>\r\n\"Please! Let me out! I thought we were... I though we were in love!\" you attempt to get out, hoping that the word 'love' would convince her to let you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi stops. Has she heard right? The tiny human in her mouth just said that the two of you are in love? A big smile spreads at light speed on her face. Granted, he's gonna get a big one when he comes out of her mouth, no doubt about it. Smiling even more, Celebi keeps rubbing her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop struggling, tired. Your only hope now is that Celebi lets you out. Which she does. You feel her tilting her head and opening her mouth, letting you slide outwards, right into her open hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are welcomed back to the outside world by comforting sunlight. You look up at the verdant giantess, fear in your eyes. But she does nothing, expect for quickly cleaning your face from her drool and laying a big, wet kiss on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn intense blush covers your face as Celebi pulls off, almost pulling your face along her lips. Cleaning your face the best you can, you stare up at a blushing Celebi, who is giggling like a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much passes before Celebi returns to stare at you, the same sweet expression she had before. That expression can only mean she has other plans for you! You gulp hard.</span></div></div>",

You notice she's moving you closer to her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fear that she wants to put you in her mouth again. Experiencing death thanks to that wet cave left you preferring to stay out of it. Even though you can't explain why every time you entered, everything began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Celebi doesn't want you in her mouth again, this time she has other plans for you. Plans that you might actually enjoy. So she puckers her lips and starts smooching your face all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would enjoy this experience more, if it wasn't for the lack of oxygen you are having. You are hardly able to breathe with Celebi's lips covering your face. Luckily for you, she gives you one last kiss, but it lasts longer, almost pulling off your face with her lips when she pulls off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting to catch your breath, you stare at the green giantess with a curious expression. She stares back at you with a slight smile, happy that she finally managed to get her 'fun'. You find yourself being snatched up again, as Celebi nuzzles you against her cheek lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Celebi raises herself from the branch and picks you up. Flying down, you notice that Weavile is still dead asleep. Celebi carries you to a small lake nearby. Floating above mere inched from the water, you stare at your own reflection in the water; you notice you're all red from both the embarrassment and the 'mark' that Celebi's lips left on your face. Celebi dunks the tip of her left foot in. She shivers at the cool sensationensation. You notice that the water is getting closer as Celebi dunks her whole body but her head, and so you (who is still plucked in her grasp) as well, in the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit, the refreshing feeling of the water is relaxing you, Celebi's submerged head towering over yours. She is still holding you in her solid grasp, careful to not let you go. In fact, even a Magikarp could be a threat to you, even though it's the weakest pokemon ever. She swims around for a bit, pressing you more into her skin \"There! Isn't this relaxing little guy?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you have no time to realize what Celebi said because suddenly, you notice, the water starts to shake. Celebi notices as well. Looking down, she sees a shadow coming from underwater. Celebi has barely the time to lift herself and you from the water that a HUGE - and not just from your point of view- Gyarados comes out, roaring at the sight of the food before it. Celebi backs away, but the Gyarados strikes with ice fang. Celebi dodges just in time and strikes back with energy ball. Gyarados dodges and hides underwater. Celebi tries to fly away, but the Gyarados submerges and hits with headbutt. Celebi is sent flying and, before she can move, the fish pokemon fires hyper beam.  Celebi dodges, but she is hit slightly on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beam hits the tree Weavile is sleeping under, walking her up. But she is still tired and doesn't notice the Atrocious pokemon attacking the legendary pokemon and her tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi hardly reaches the ground and lands, before collapsing, her grip on you weakening. The Gyarados approaches the ground, smirking evilly as he moves its mouth to the food...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Thank you!\" she exclaims with glee. You smile at her excitement and pet her cheek.<br>\r\n\"Just for a bit. Celebi is probably going to make us both pay when she discovers I was here all the time,\" you say, making Mew laugh.<br>\r\n\"You're right, I don't want to make her worry too much.

You're it!\" she beams, flying away from you.<br>\r\nSmirking, you rush behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in Ilex Forest, Celebi is literally scanning every inch of the forest, trying to find her little lover.<br>\r\n\"Little guy! Where are you?!\" she exclaims, her worry rising as once again she gets no reply. Exhausted from almost an hour of  searching you all over the forest, she collapses to the ground and starts crying. Weavile reaches her. Even with her natural speed, she couldn't catch up with the hysteric, sobbing legendary.<br>\r\n\"Where could he be? We can't find him anywhere!\" Celebi screams. Weavile helps her stands back up and gives a warm expression.<br>\r\n\"Hey, no need to cry, we'll eventually find him. He must be somewhere around here, we just have to find that Skarmory,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd idea pops in Celebi's mind. Of course! The Skarmory! It must have brought you to its nest. Grabbing Weavile, Celebi flies up in the sky searching for the nest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" you yell, finally having managed to grab Mew's tail. It took you a while, as Mew is able to fly and you are shrunk. Mew giggles.<br>\r\n\"Again! Again!\" she shouts excited.<br>\r\n\"Mew, we've been doing this for quite a while, can we do another game?\" you ask, panting.<br>\r\n\"Of course! How about hide and seek?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\"<br>\r\n\"Then go hide! I count!\" and with this, Mew turns around, starting to count. You make a run for it and hide behind a crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Ilex Forest, Celebi finally manages to spot a metallic nest. An iron bird like pokemon in it. Celebi's eyes twitch with rage as she fastens her flight. The Skarmory barely has the time to open its eyes that Celebi tackles it full force. Thanks to Weavile, who is an extra weight, the action results even more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi pins the bird to the nest with her little yet surprisingly strong arms.<br>\r\n\"Where is the little guy?!\" she asks exasperated.<br>\r\n\"W-what little guy?\" the bird asks with terror. It then remembers about the small human it snatched from the legendary in front of it earlier.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that little guy...\" the Skarmory says.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, WHERE IS HE?\"  Celebi asks again, louder this time.<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I brought him here, but he fell off! I don't know what happened to him!\" the Skarmory explains. Celebi eyes widen in horror, Weavile's as well. Celebi's innocent little guy fell from such height?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi is about to start crying once again, but Weavile interrupts her.<br>\r\n\"Wait. We don't know if he is still somehow alive. It's a fool hope, but may as well take it,\" she explains. Celebi looks at her and nods. Then she remembers when, yesterday, she felt her little guy's aura when he was kidnapped by Zoroark. So she closes her eyes and focuses yet again on your aura. She locates it far away, right next to an incredibly strong aura.<br>\r\n\"Little guy! You're alive!\" Celebi exclaims with a smile, before assuming a curious expression \"And... with Mew? What does this mean?\" she asks herself before opening her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Let's go Weavile,\" Celebi says, grabbing the dark type by her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Did you find him?\" Weavile asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes. And he and Mew will have to do a lot of explaining when they come back,\" Celebi replies.<br>\r\n\"Mew? What does Mew have to do with the whole thing?\" Weavile asks again.<br>\r\n\"That's what I want to find out,\" Celebi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Tree, you play with Mew for longer than you should have. In fact, you got carried away and it's now fully afternoon. You are resting, tired from having played many games with Mew, the pink cat resting next o to you,  when suddenly you remember about Celebi.<br>\r\n\"Mew! We got carried away! I need to return to Celebi!\" you say, getting a nod from her.<br>\r\n\"You're right. Hold on, I'll bring you to Ilex Forest,\" she says, picking you up and disappearing in a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appears just in front of Celebi's sanctuary. The time traveler pokemon is sitting on it, Weavile next to her. The grass type turn her attention to you, an upset glare. And a disappointed \"Le bi,\" is all you need to gulp in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are,\" Celebi says, hopping off the sanctuary...</span></div></div>",

I don't even know what I could do!\" Celebi screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can understand anything, but the screams of the legendary are enough for you to get she's angry. You feel heavy under those light blue eyes that stare at you intently, waiting for an answer. <br>\r\n\"C-celebi c-calm down, let me explain,\" Mew says, stepping in the conversation.  Celebi stares at her silently, a sign that means 'go on'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was bored back at the Tree, once checked it was fine. So I decided to come and check if you were alright. And I'm still glad I did, because the little guy was falling from a great height. Luckily I managed to catch him. Then I brought him at the Tree, and I asked him to play with me. O was the one who kept him for all this time. If you are angry, be angry with me, because it's my fault,\" Mew explains, trying to not put you in any trouble. They are friends, Celebi would probably forgive her later. Not sure about you thoug, even though you're much more than a friend to Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's expression goes from an angry one to a curious one.<br>\r\n\"Is that true little guy?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh,\" you say. Celebi rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Mew,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"She asked if everything I told her was true,\" Mew says to you. You look back to Celebi.<br>\r\n\"Look Celebi, I don't know what Mew told you, but here's how things went. I was falling from that Skarmory's nest. Mew saved me and brought me to the Tree of Beginning. She asked me to play, and I agreed, at the condition she would have to bring me back here after a bit, because we didn't want to worry you. But we lost the track of time, and Mew brought me here again.

She looks at Mew, who nods, a guilty expression on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi puts you on the ground and turns around, deciding what to do with you.

What are you taking about?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Oh, didn't I tell you? You are asleep. This is your dream. I decided to peek into your dreams.

You are staring at the spectacle of Metapods evolving into Butterfrees, thousands of them flying around the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnchanted by the sight, you don't notice Celebi sitting down, setting you down on her lap. You are snapped back to reality when she pokes your side with a hand.<br>\r\n\"Beautiful, isn't it little one?\" she says, while laying a small peck on your cheek. Blushing, you rub her belly.

Poor guy, what a horrible fate,\" Arceus says. The three pokemon nod.<br>\r\n\"That's why we're here. Could you bring him back? I'm heartbroken,\" Celebi sobs.<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Mew says.<br>\r\n\"Me three,\" Weavile adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to the three pokemon sadness, Arceus shakes his head.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry my girls, but when someone is dead, it's wrong to call them back to life. The little guy is in heaven now, resting in peace,\" he says. But Celebi isn't going to let it go this easily.<br>\r\n\"I know, but I want him back. He was my sweet, cute little boy, why did he had to die in such horrible way? Please Arceus, bring him back!\" Celebi pleads crying desperately.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I could bring him back, but it would be wrong. Please forgive me Celebi,\" Arceus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi drops on the marble floor and cries hard. Mew, seeing her friend so desperate, decides to act up.<br>\r\n\"Arceus?\" she says.<br>\r\n\"What is it Mew?\"<br>\r\n\"Please, bring the little guy back. He was very important to us, and he was still young. He didn't deserve to die like this,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he was a good person Mew, no wonder about it, but when someone dies, they stay dead. I'm sorry,\" Arceus says. Mew tries to not cry, but she fails in doing so and drops next to Celebi, who has her head in a small pond of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeavile, seeing her two new friends crying, speaks up.<br>\r\n\"Arceus, my lord,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"No need for formalities, just call me Arceus,\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Arceus then... It was all my fault if the little guy died. So bring him back and take my soul instead, I deserve it,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"You're really willing to sacrifice yourself for the little guy?\" Arceus asks, shocked by Weavile's words.<br>\r\n\"Yes, if it makes Celebi and Mew happy. I really liked him too,\" she explains, getting amazed looks from the two crying pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus, shocked by Weavile's courage, speaks up.<br>\r\n\"Listen, all of you. Celebi, your little boyfriend is enjoying the heaven right now, but he's having regrets about leaving all of you, he really liked you,\" Arceus says. Even though the situation, the three pokemon smile, as the Alpha pokemon continues.<br>\r\n\"I can bring him back, but he's going to make a choice, whether he wants to ascend to heaven or come back with you,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three pokemon smile at the statement, as Arceus focuses himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are suddenly staring at Celebi, Weavile and Mew. How can this be? One second you are in Weavile's stomach, the other you are in this wonderful, heavenly place, and now you're here, in between Arceus and your pokemon companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIstantly cheering at your sight, Celebi extends a arm to pick you, but her hand passes through your body.<br>\r\n\"He's a soul now, you can't touch him,\" Arceus says. Upon hearing that, you realize you're dead, and the place you were before was heaven. You look at Celebi sadly, she looks back at you, as Arceus talks to you.<br>\r\n\"Little guy, I called you from your eternal rest because these three pokemon want you back with them. I want you to make a choice. You can completely ascend to heaven or return to life, return with Celebi, risking death again,\" Arceus explains. You silently take in what he said. You have to make a choice, whether you want to return to life or stay dead.<br>\r\n\"What is your choice little guy?\" Arceus asks. You look at Mew, Celebi and Weavile, you see tears welling up in their eyes, they want you back with them, especially Celebi. But... heaven was truly wonderful, you could stay there forever... In the end you make a choice.</span></div></div>",

That would be a great help in keeping him alive,\" Mew says.<br>\r\nBut Arceus shakes his head.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I already did a lot by bringing him back, I can't modify the way of how things work. Just try to keep him out of stomachs,\" he says, getting an eager nod from Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crushing you in her hug for about five minutes, Celebi declares thst she wants to go back home to have fun with her little guy.

What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"We were playing when you found me and brought me here. Could you bring me back?\" you ask, remembering what happened earlier, when you stayed with Mew at the Tree.

I still have some questions for you.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Well...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, a wild Umbreon is wandering outside the cave, searching for a fight, Not that it is hunting, it just wants to train by battling fellow pokemon. It spots Pikachu in the cave. Its eyes widen; perfect prey. And, thanks to the shades the sunset is providing, it sneaks in the cave. And, before you can answer to Pikachu's questions, it strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happens in a moment. Pikachu is laying on the ground, badly bruised, blood pouring down an open and deep wound on her belly. Luckily, you managed to fall on your feet when Pikachu fell. Turning your head, you see the Moonlight pokemon Umbreon standing there. It spots you, but it doesn't show any interest for you, seeing in you a too weak opponent. Having nothing more to do, the Umbreon leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there astonished, when you remember about Pikachu and rush to her, trying to help her. What you can do? You could help her, but your only healing skills are the basic ones you learned back at school. You could also take this opportunity and go search for Celebi and Mew, they are probably worried, not having found you after all this time. And if you get them, you could convince them to help Pikachu (though you want to get them mostly to avoid a very probable punishment). But Pikachu's wound is pretty deep, if you leave she could  die.<br>\r\n\"What to do?\" you ask with growing fear.</span></div></div>",

But, before landing, it is hit by an energy ball that sends it crashing in a tree.

The rocks hit the Moonlight pokemon while Celebi strikes with U-turn. The Umbreon endures the attack and tries to use quick attack, but Celebi dodges and hits with dazzling gleam.

Getting ready for a final attack, the Umbreon forms a big shadow ball. Celebi forms an as well big energy ball. The two pokemon stare at each other for a second, before throwing their attacks. The two spheres collide, but energy ball bloes shadow ball away and hits Umbreon, that is sent flying in the depths of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired out, Celebi drops to the ground, when the two familiar figures of you and Mew come out to assist her after hearing the explosion...</span></div></div>",

She notices Celebi peeking through the leaves \"Why are we hiding? And what are you watching?\" she asks \"They're in there\" Celebi replies, pointing to something out of the bush. Celebi moves to let Mew look; the pink pokemon sees a cave, a Zoroark and something resembling a tiny human in there. Found you! Mew retreats from her peeking spot \"What are we waiting for? Let's get him!\" she silently exclaims. Celebi shakes her head \"We need a plan first. That damn fox managed to win thanks to its illusions\" Celebi explains \"Then what we do?\" \"Listen carefully\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start rubbing the paw of your mistress, even though you barely reach her claws. Zoroark moans in pleasure \" Oh yeah slave... mhhhhhm... if you keep doing a good job, I might just reward you \" she moans. You ignore her, you never felt so humiliated in your whole, forced to rub the paws of a pokemon to have your life spared. You wish you were back with Celebi and Mew, at least they treated you well, Celebi loved you. Even if you are still a bit uncomfortable with being her other, you can't deny that you grew to like her, at least a bit. Though you are still scared of her. You are lost in your thoughts- and the Zoroark is lost in her pleasure- so you don't notice a thunderbolt coming her way. The Zoroark is shocked. You also get a shock, but you manage to pull off before you're fried alive. As soon the thunderbolt ends, Zoroark looks outside, enraged. Standing there,  a Pichu sticks her tongue out and runs away. Zoroark roars angrily \"Don't move slave!\" she yells, before chasing the Pichu outside. Too bad she doesn't notice a familiar green pokemon coming out of a bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to recollect what just happened, when you feel something snatching you from the ground. You are brought face to face with Celebi \"Celebi?\" you yell, shocked, receiving a kiss on your face as an answer. She looks at you all over, checking if you are alright \"Cutie! You're safe and sound! I was worried sick!\" she says, nuzzling you lovingly. You can't understand a word, but you assume she's just happy to have you back with her \"Don't you worry, you're safe now. Me and Mew will teach that meanie a lesson\" she says, before flying out of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pichu, aka Mew, smirks. The plan worked, Celebi has surely rescued her boyfriend by now, so she stops running. The Zoroark stops a few meters from her and roars, clearly pissed off. Smirking again, Mew shifts back to herself. The Zoroark's jaw seems to drop. The legendary Mew is really standing in front of her? The human! He must have... \"Hey you\" a voice speaks behind her. She turns around, Celebi standing there. And, plucked to her chest... you?! Zoroark has to think carefully about her next move. She could fight a legendary, but two? That's impossible for everyone, humans and pokemon. So she turns around and looks at you \"That was you, wasn't it? You also summoned Mew to help you?\" she growls, angry \"Summoned, what are you talking about?\" Mew asks \"Yeah, we came to rescue this human, because he's my lover\" Celebi says. Zoroark sweat drops. So the human spoke the truth, Celebi really loves him. Zoroark can't fight right now. It's not the right time \"This isn't the last you hear from me human\" she says, disappearing. Another illusion. Celebi looks around, expecting for the fox to strike, but it never happens. Sighing in relief, Mew gets close to you \"Are you alright?\" she telepathically asks. You nod, Mew gives a smile \"Then come on, let's go back to the sanctuary. I'm still hungry\" Celebi says, flying off. Mew giggles as she follows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating a full amount three berries- which to the two pokemon was a normal meal, to you was a whole feast- you spend the several next hours getting to know to Mew and Celebi. You get that, before Celebi moved to Ilex Forest, the two were best friends. Mew is the cheerful and playful pokemon, while Celebi is the as - well - cheerful but shy pokemon. Mew then asked you how did you two met. When you were about to explain that Celebi ate you, she gave you a pleading look. You got that she didn't want you to tell Mew about that one part, so you willingly skip it. After getting to know each other, Mew insisted to play, and Celebi gladly accepted. Not that you had a choice, so you had to play. After hours of hide and seek (Mew's favourite game), it's now nighttime. After a quick dinner made out of other berries, the two pokemon yawn. The two lay down at the feet of a tree. You get in between them, but Celebi gives you a weird look \"What?\" you ask. In all response, the grass type points to her chest. She wants you to sleep with her. You blush like crazy \"N-no, isn't it a bit early for that?\" you ask, backing up, just to end bumping into Mew \"Nope, it's just fine\" the cat pokemon says in your mind, pushing you to Celebi. The green pokemon reaches for you with both arms and stares at you with a sad expression. An expression that could melt your heart \"Okay, fine I'll sleep with you\" you say. Celebi smiles as she encloses you in a hug to her chest, while Mew giggles \"Good night you two. Try to not do anything weird\" she says, before closing her blue eyes. Celebi giggles, while you just blush more. So you quickly lay down on Celebi's skin, hoping to fall asleep soon, so you won't have to feel more embarrassed than you already are. It doesn't take long, thanks to both the softness of the skin and its warmth, for you to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi notices her tiny human asleep and smiles. He looks cute when he sleeps. She then looks at Mew, she's already snoring softly. Giving the human a goodnight kiss, she relaxes back as well. Within minutes, she is asleep. </span></div></div>",

It's time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoroark rapidly climbs down to the ground and lands beside Celebi. Next to her, Mew is also sleeping soundly, her belly rising and falling along her breath. With a grin on her lips, Zoroark proceeds to remove the long, green arms from your small body, extremely careful to not wake Celebi up. Moving her arms to the side, Zoroark slowly picks you in her sharp fingers and lifts you up to her face \"Welcome back slave\" she whispers, starting to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi starts to move, as if she's going to wake up. She's still asleep, but she feels your absence and needs you back in her sleep. So she starts moving her arms, searching for you. Zoroark notices the legendary pokemon moving and sweat drops, afraid that, if she wakes up, she will have to be ready to run. Luckily, the grass type relaxes back and returns to her soft snoring. Sighing a small sigh of relief, Zoroark turns around and starts to leave again, with you securely grasped in her paw. *Snap!* a loud snapping sound is heard. Zoroark looks in horror downwards, seeing that she crushed a twig \"Bi?\" a voice comes from behind her. Turning around, she sees Celebi,  wide awake, and looking around for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi was sleeping so good, when a noise wakes her up. She moves to a sitting position, but notices something's wrong. Where the heck is her little guy? He didn't run away, did he? Looking around for the tiny human, Celebi notices something. Two blue eyes shining through the night. Even though all this darkness, Celebi manages to see a very small figure grasped between red claws. The Zoroark again?! \"BIIIIII!\" Celebi shouts angry. Without giving the fox time to react, she fires energy ball at her. The dark type pokemon is hit in the chest. Luckily, she manages to keep her hold on you, but both the scream and the explosion were pretty enough to wake both you and Mew up. You look around, scared, and you find yourself staring into two gigantic blue eyes. But they don't seem to belong to neither Celebi or Mew \"Z-Zoroark?\" you ask. The pokemon looks at you for a moment, before shifting her attention elsewhere. Following her gaze, you manage to see Celebi standing there, an half asleep Mew looking at Zoroark. The dark fox doesn't lose anymore time. She has to run away. So she moves you to her mouth. Before you even have the time to scream, she drops you on her tongue and closes her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cave you are trapped in reminds you of Celebi's own mouth, but this one is much more hot, and Zoroark breath smells horrible \"Let me out!!!\" you scream. Zoroark completely ignores you and makes a run for it \"Oh no you don't!\" Celebi yells, chasing the fox along a now fully awakened Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoroark runs like she never run before, she has to get rid of the two pesky pokemon chasing her. Luckily, it's still nighttime, so she will luckily get away at some point \"Give him back!!\" she hears the two legendaries screaming behind. Scared maybe for the first time in her life, Zoroark fastens her dash.</span></div></div>",

So she jumps and turns around, flames exiting her mouth as she uses flamethrower. Both Mew and Celebi manage to dodge; the pink pokemon uses aura sphere, while the green pokemon uses energy ball. Zoroark can do nothing but stare in horror as the two attacks combine together and collide with her, generating a huge explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still trapped in the dark, wet confines of Zoroark's mouth. You don't know what is happening outside, but judging from the huge explosion you just heard, you can tell that something big is going on. You feel that Zoroark isn't moving anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi and Mew get closer to a now badly bruised Zoroark. Celebi lifts her face with her long arms \"I'll ask just one time, before we get rough. WHERE IS HE?\" Celebi asks, making sure to spell each word. Zoroark stares at her with out talking.  A small groan escapes her closed mouth. Celebi understands where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what is happening outside. You are completely covered in drool and dizzy from being thrown back and forth around Zoroark's mouth. You stare at her closed lips, when they suddenly open. You don't have time to react as three green fingers reach in the mouth. They land directly on you. Feeling your small form, they close around you and pull you out of the dark 'cave'. You are greeted by moonlight, and the smiling face of Celebi. You look around, you notice that Mew is holding Zoroark's lips. As soon you are pulled out, she lets them fall back in place  and gets closer to you two \"Are you okay little one?\" she asks. You nod as both pokemon sigh in relief \"Thanks Arceus. I can't imagine what I'd do if I lost you\" Celebi says. Clearly, you can't understand her. The green pokemon groans. She has to learn how to communicate with you if this relationship has to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Celebi spoke, a small yawn escapes her mouth. It's still to early in the night to be awake. She looks at me \"You're sleepy, right?\" \"Yeah. This isn't any time to be awake\" Celebi replies, getting a nod from Mew \"You're right. Now that you make me notice, I'm sleepy as well. Let's go back to sleep\" she says, flying off. Celebi follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short fly later, you are back to the sanctuary. The two pokemon yawn, meaning that they're sleepy. But you aren't. The events of tonight made you lose all your sleepiness, and you probably won't sleep for days. Judging by the position of the moon, it's about 2 AM. The two pokemon lay down on the wooden sanctuary. Celebi plucks you to her chest \"Good night again Mew\" she says \"Good night\" \"And good night to you too my little cutie\" Celebi kisses your cheek. You don't pay much attention to it and to her words. Seriously, to you is just a mix of 'Bi cele  bi' that you can't understand. Maybe you can teach her to talk sometime, though that'll take a lot of time. Looking back, you notice both pokemon already asleep. They were sure tired. Yawning, you snuggle up to Celebi, hoping to manage to fall asleep as well. You thought you weren't tired, that you were not going to sleep, but you were wrong. You were just ad tired as Celebi and Mew, if not more. In fact, as soon you close your eyes, you fall into deep sleep.</span></div></div>",

And, for how many ideas you have to escape this giant fox, you cannot do anything but one thing.<br>\r\n\"Please... let me go... don't eat me!\" you scream, moving the parts of your body that aren't caught in Zoroark's grasp frenetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoroark stares at you as you desperately try to break free.<br>\r\n\"Pick one already, human!\" she growls, trying make herself understandable. But it has no effect; you simply keep struggling, not understanding her words. The giant fox closes her eyes for a moment, her mouth closing as well. <br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm wasting my time.\" she says to herself, slowly reopening her lips, pulling you closer to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat at the Zoroark's actions.<br>\r\n\"Please... Help!...  Don't do it!... Help!\" you scream incoherently. But Zoroark has made up her mind. Quickly, she nears you to her mouth, drops you in and closes her lips behind you, sealing your tomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar away, near the famous shrine of Ilex Forest, a certain green pokemon is crying, face down on the ground, forming a literal lake of tears around her face, while her body is shaken by desperate sobs. Celebi cries so hard that she doesn't even hear the many thuds behind her and the alarmed cry of a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was returning from her 'hunt' when, getting back to the shrine, she sees Celebi laying there on the grass, face down as she cries. Instantly, Mew drops all the berries she gathered and flies over her.<br>\r\n\"Celebi, what happened?\" she inquires, helping her friend sitting upright. Mew glances around.<br>\r\n\"Hey, where's little...\" a sniffle from Celebi is enough to tell Mew the reason of her friend's tears.<br>\r\n\"Did I miss something?\" she asks worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible!\" Mew exclaims after hearing Celebi's tale. Celebi, who calmed down a bit, bursts right back into tears. Mew stares at her silently, not finding anything to say to comfort her friend. Just when she is about to start crying herself, a thought crosses her mind.<br>\r\n\"Celebi... you talked about a Zoroark, right?\" Mew says. <br>\r\n\"Y-Y-Yes...\" Celebi stammers with broken voice.<br>\r\n\"Then... what if it was just an illusion? Zoroarks can do that, remember? Maybe... Maybe it was a mere illusion... Maybe he's alive...\" Mew tries to convince her friend as well herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sniffles a few times, before looking at Mew.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" she asks, shedding some tears.<br>\r\n\"It could be... let's go find that Zoroark, maybe she has little guy...\" Mew says. Celebi silently nods, floating in midair as the two start flying into Ilex Forest, in search of the Zoroark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let me out!\" you scream at top of your lungs. Big drops of saliva rain on you from your host's palate, while her tongue swishes you around tasting you.<br>\r\n\"I'm not kidding! I'm really going to grow back to my size and I'll blow you up from inside!\" you scream again. That does not serve anything but to get a mouthful of saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spit out said liquid while Zoroark keeps tasting you, enjoying your unique taste. Finding that excuses aren't so effective, you start using the more simple method of struggling. Which is as useless as using excuses to convince Zoroark to let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoroark keeps tasting you for a few more minutes, before getting ready to eat her prey...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She can't deny she feels guilty for eating him, but, then again, she's going to reset all this, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these thoughts, the green deity pokemon closes her baby blue eyes, ready to take a nice, long nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at you, you're still sliding to your final destination. You're living a nightmare. Not only you're going to die far from home, in the stomach of a pokemon, but you're also being crushed between two walls of slippery flesh. The entire process is of a terrorizing slowness, each inch you go down, a wave of saliva rains down on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all is making you feel more scared than you already are.

Sitting upright, the green pokemon brings a paw to her neck and starts to cough, sending vibrations down her throat each time she does. You gulp. If you let go now, you'll die.<br>\r\n\"Come on...

You kept your arms and legs spread, but you felt like you couldn't go on for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time Celebi coughed, the muscles of her throat collided, crushing you in the process. Not only that, but the fleshy surface was starting to grow slicker and slicker as the fairy swallowed saliva, desperately trying to gulp you down. Periodically, a tight ring beneath you opened and closed, revealing, in the few instants in which it was open, a steaming liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pretty sure of what it was, and you didn't want to get any closer than this to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi kept coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were choking her from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME OUT!\" you screamed in determination - and a fair amount of terror too, though mostly determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cough was your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Celebi placed a paw on the lump in her neck and desperately tried to push it down. But it was useless - the human she swallowed was stubborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she only had one option left... this was going to spare her from having to travel through time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cough - you slid down a bit, giving off a small cry of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother gulp - you were about to give up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA last cough - you let go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell down, the fleshy ring opening, Celebi's stomach ready to receive you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother, strong coughing fit of the fairy sent you rocketing upwards. At light speed, you were launched past Celebi's esophagus. For a moment, you dreaded the possibility that you could actually take a detour and end up in one of her lungs, but you flew straight back into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with another cough, you were sent straight out of the fairy's mouth and went flying, feeling the cold wind blowing past your saliva-covered body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new terror made you reconsider your choice - were you going to survive this fall? You looked down... wishing that you hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were high up in the air... you were in reality flying a meter or so above the ground, but to you it was the equivalent of soaring the skies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, you briefly looked back at the Celebi who just tried to make a snack out of you. You saw her still coughing, one eye open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking at <i>you</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped - if you survived this fall, you were going to be sa-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain spread across your body, you felt a hard surface behind you. You must have hit a tree or something, you realize as you slowly slid down a hard surface while your mind slowly slid into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you hit the ground, you were already unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsciousness slowly started to rise from the depths of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, your whole body was assaulted by a searing pain, which seemed to linger in the back of your head the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to move an arm, but you found that you couldn't feel it... your eyes shot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you dead?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down... discovering that you were laying on your left arm. It must have fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you sat upright, noticing... blurry figures dancing around you. You must have hit that tree harder than you thought, though you could already tell since you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunted, your head was killing you. But this was better than the alternative, you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you started to remember... the Celebi... your flight... you hitting the tree and passing out... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you grunted. Each time you tried to recollect your thoughts, you were assaulted by an overwhelming wave of pain, which spread throughout your whole being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you brought a hand to the source of your pain...you gasped as you felt the back of your head wet and sticky. You brought your hand to your nose... blood. Blood that was probably coming from an open wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to catch your breath, you slowly looked up, inhaling and exhaling heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the only thing you noted was an indistinct mass of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, your vision started to clear, and you noticed...</span></div></div>",

You remembered them - the green face of the forest's patron deity was one you learned to fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green giantess was kneeling down, you noted, as she stared at you with... concern. You were probably in a pitiful state, covered in dried, smelly saliva, bleeding from an imprecise part of your body and looking in extreme pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you finally awake, Celebi's lips upturned in a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she shot your out of her mouth with enough force to send you flying, Celebi had recovered enough to search for you... it wasn't hard to find a shrunken human, laying unconscious at the foot of a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the giant Celebi for a while as she stared back at you. You could feel your heart beating faster as you noted one of the large paws of the fairy reaching out for you. The memory of yourself being confined in her esophagus still fresh in your mind, you ignored the searing pain and dove out of her reach, landing roughly on a patch of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily got back to your feet - you had to get away from this giantess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempted to run... but you found that your left leg was in pain. All you could do was try to wall away onto shaky legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, you didn't manage to take three full steps before the green patroness of Ilex Forest flew straight above you and scooped you up in her paws, which carelessly squeezed you in her grasp causing you an immense pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expressed it with a loud scream, and Celebi's grasp suddenly softened as she stood in midair, pondering what to do... she wasn't going to eat the human again. She had done it once out of curiosity, intending to use her time-traveling powers to bring him back to life before it turned out there was no need to. Now, like the fairy had imposed herself earlier, she had to treat you nicely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, at this point, eating you would be a mercy, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were certainly in pain after hitting that tree. Your left leg hurt a lot, although you could still move it, suggesting that it wasn't broken, but nonetheless badly injured; you still had an open wound in the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi noticed that as, attempting to comfort you during your suffering, she started rubbing your head... until her fingers ran into a wet spot on its back. She lifted the up to her face, only to notice them stained red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weakly looked at the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, she looked horrified... and deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to keep you, there was no doubt about it - a shrunken human was a too good of a catch to let go - but she needed to heal you somehow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, your bleeding wound had to stop bleeding... then, she had to fix your leg, minor, less important injuries here and there across your body before convincing you that she was trying to be your friend... something told her that the last one was going to be harder than healing you... and she discovered that she couldn't blame you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched at the grass-type fairy moved a paw to the back of your head... another wave of pain assaulted you as she applied pressure on your wound, trying to hold your blood in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?!\" you screamed in pain.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just kill me?! Eat me, or whatever makes you happy!\" you said in resignation, unable to bear the immense pain. Even worse, you were unaware of Celebi's intentions and simply assumed that the sadistic legendary wanted to make you suffer even more before sending you straight back done that abyss of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her face didn't show any hint of malice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the giantess got up. She carefully held you in one paw, while the other remained glued to your wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden, your green captor started glowing bright green, the light engulfing your whole body as you felt a pleasant feeling spreading throughout your body... before another horrible, immense wave of pain replaced it as your wound sealed itself, your injured leg snapped back in place and a few of the ribs that were broken when you hit the tree were fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a loud scream of pain while the green light finally died down. If it wasn't for the fact that the sharp pain was keeping you awake, you would have fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Celebi in front of you contemplated her work with a smile, before sitting down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely had to glance at her before the paw you were laying onto moved forward, the fairy hugging you to her chest. You blushed - personal space must be a foreign thing to pokemon, even to legendaries who were supposed to be way more clever than regular pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling that Celebi was the cause of your suffering, you started struggling in an attempt to get free from her paws, but they held you in place. Though your efforts got Celebi to look down at you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi?</span>\" she inquired, wondering why you were still struggling... maybe the tiny human didn't like hugs, she naively thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go...\" you meekly complained as you considered calling for help... before deciding against it. It could enrage Celebi... and who was going to help you anyway? Who could be dumb enough to take on a legendary? Despite her size and innocent looks, Celebi retained a great power - a single glance could blow away many normal-sized people at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as our figured what she could do to <i>you</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you stopped struggling to look at the green fairy, who smiled reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... You don't want to hurt me...?\" you stuttered. Celebi shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why?\" you questioned, recalling how quickly she threw you in her mouth and swallowed, sending you to a one-way trip into her esophagus... it was dumb luck if you got out of there alive, you were sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to your question, Celebi smiled brightly, her embrace grew tighter around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt confused - a pokemon that earlier ate you now was sitting there, hugging you and telling that she didn't want to hurt you? What sense did that even make?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the giantess, she seemed sincere enough... but could you risk entrusting your life in her paws again, like you did earlier?</span></div></div>",

It seemed like it, she had healed your wounds after all... but maybe, you realized, she only wanted you to last some more, play a few wicked games before she gulped you down again... even that wouldn't be the end. Celebi could travel back in time, no? How many times were you going to suffer even after your demise? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fear, you looked back at the giantess... she was smiling at you. Not grinning, not snickering like you expected, but smiling warmly, soothingly. Maybe she was sincere...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even knew it, you found your struggles ceasing as you looked at the giantess without moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrusting Celebi seemed a bit odd given what she attempted before... but, the protection of a legendary, one of the most powerful beings in the world? You couldn't give up that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Please...\" you whispered pleadingly, Celebi smiling even more. Finally, you decided to trust her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily, the fairy got up, still hugging you, and fluttered over a few trees, laying down at the foot of a tree. It wasn't hard to see what she was doing - it was still the middle of the night, she clearly wanted to catch a few more hours of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the process, she didn't let go of you, leaving you trapped between her chest and paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi.</span>\" she said cheerfully, before yawning and closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed - how did you even end up in this situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that you should sleep for a while before the unpredictable Celebi woke up, you closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness soon claimed your mind and you slid into a dreamless sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next few days, you started to get used to your new life in Ilex Forest, under the protection of its patroness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause it became clear, Celebi really didn't want to hurt you... not anymore at least. It was the exact opposite, Celebi didn't let you out of her eyesight one minute and she fed you - though your mouth was starting to get tired of the taste of berries, which were the only food in the forest since the fairy didn't actually hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your stay, you also took notice of other pokemon, the inhabitants of the forest. None of those ever attempted anything though, too afraid of approaching your green guardian. It was better like this, you figured, they couldn't try to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, you were starting to enjoy the company of the cheerful legendary. You were afraid of her for the first few days, and it was quite awkward to try to get to know a pokemon that couldn't speak your language... even though she clearly understood you. Every time you expressed your hunger or thirst, she'd provide you with a different berry or she'd bring you over a small lake so you could drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, basically, things were going swimmingly now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though your situation, you were safe and fed... but you couldn't stop thinking about your shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you seemed to have forgotten how it did actually happened. You only remember you got home, ready to greet your first pokemon... and then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi?</span>\" Celebi asked you one time, seeing you deep in thought and wanting to know about your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna know what's making me think?\" you asked. As usual, like whenever you guessed her words right, she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It's... It's me Celebi. How I shrunk... I can't remember how...\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy simply smiled and patted your head with a finger cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent a few other days thinking about it, while your first week as a shrunken human lazily passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was now the only thought that occupied your head, it was your only source of entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one day, while you were eating with your giant green protector, you finally remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" you exclaimed, letting go of the Sitrus Berry you were eating, startling the fairy whose lap you were sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi?</span>\" she quickly asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent a few moments looking in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poke-ball... the one that was supposed to contain your first pokemon... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Le bi?</span>\" Celebi inquired again, picking you up and staring at you questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

But Celebi had already understood, you could tell by the frown that appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you awkwardly said, before shaking your head.<br>\r\n\"Celebi, you've got to help me... I need to go back home... that poke-ball might be the key to grow me back to my original size!\" you stated. Celebi looked skeptical.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi...</span>\" she said, mistrusting you. She couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were going swimmingly between the two of you, why did you want to catch her now?... Maybe, you were telling the truth...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi didn't talk to you for the rest of the day... or the night when she, as usual, cuddled you to her chest for the dark hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, the day after, she was quite silent, looking deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, she finally spoke again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi.</span>\" she said, looking at you while pointing to you. Then, she pointed to herself and at the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n\"Uh... you want to show me something?\" you tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shook her head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... are thirsty?\" you asked, struggling to remember if the direction her finger was pointed at was the one that led to the lake where she usually brought you to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Celebi shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... You want to go to the shrine...?\" you asked. She had brought you to a wooden shrine a few times during your stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi sighed, while you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...\" you said resignedly. Celebi looked at you, before grabbing a hold of you and lifting you up. A blinding light shone, forcing you to close your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you re-opened them, you were staring at... yourself and Celebi, \u2018talking\u2019 in distance. You looked back at Celebi - did she just-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi you've got to help me... I need to go back home... That poke-ball might be the key to grow me back to my original size!\" you from the past told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Celebi from your timeline nodded as he spoke those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a lump in your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... want to help me...?\" you asked, before that bright light shone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi returned to your timeline, and sat down, looking at you and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you felt blissful,<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU CELEBI!\" you shouted, a few bird pokemon fleeing from the nearby trees. The green fairy hugged you happily. You returned the hug.<br>\r\n\"We need to go to my house Celebi...\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiled as she fluttered in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi?</span>\" she asked, \u2018Which way?\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Celebi offered you her help, it was around midday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the sun was setting, and Celebi was still flying with you restrained in a hug, following your indications to get to your house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, finally, the green giantess reached a house that you recognized as yours. You pointed to one of the windows, and Celebi flew over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peered inside... there wasn't anybody inside, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother, father and sister, even the pokemon, they weren't inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... they were gone somewhere?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The front door Celebi,\" you said, pointing to the door. The fairy moved in front of it, and you started knocking with all your strength, but without producing any audible sound. If there was someone inside, you doubted they'd hear your knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily - and very, very unluckily - Celebi decided to act for you; the door was suddenly hit by a psychic blast which seemed to shake the whole house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trembled upon witnessing a taste of the power this legendary had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nobody else was there, you noted by the lack of startled screaming and crying of humans and pokemon. Celebi glanced at you with a look that asked \u2018Now what?\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you put a hand on the door handle and tried to pull it downwards. You luckily, managed to move it, but the door remained close - it was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed - of course it was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be hard to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud noise echoed inside the deserted house as the door was psychically assaulted, falling down like a log. Celebi fluttered inside and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Celebi... let's look around, find a poke-ball.\" you instructed, hoping that it was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary nodded as she started moving through the various rooms... nothing in the kitchen, living room, bathroom, your parents' room or your sister's room... although you did get to have a good laugh when Celebi mistook your sister's dolls for other shrunken humans. It took you a while to explain the difference between an actual shrunken human and a lifeless object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there was only one room left, yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi quietly moved inside your room and started looking around, emulated by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, after a few quick looks, you noticed...</span></div></div>",

She evidently understood that the situation was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe... Celebi could help you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebi... help me, pick those two pieces up!\" you instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the fairy flew back, reluctant to pick up a poke-ball, even if broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain hastily found a solution to this issue.<br>\r\n\"... Use psychic Celebi, I promise nothing will happen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi looked reluctant for a few more moments, before deciding to trust you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red and white pieces flew in midair as Celebi telekinetically lifted them, before looking at you questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, put them back together,\" you said, and the two pieces of the broken ball were reunited psychically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let go...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball fell on the bed... the two pieces fell apart again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, defeated. You felt that your legs couldn't hold you anymore and fell onto the bed, pale, desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bii...</span>\" Celebi said dejectedly - she hated seeing her tiny friend like that. She had seen him in such state in the first days he was with her, and it wasn't very hard to see why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut calling him a friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi shook her head, and picked the poke-ball up again, wanting to make a second attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pieces were put together again, only to fall apart once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi tried a few other times, but it ended with the poke-ball ultimately falling on the bed in front of you, the red piece rolling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi...</span>\" she said dejectedly as she gently picked you up, hugging you to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned against her green body, seeking for some kind of comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you doomed to live your life like this now? The size of a small doll? What did you even do to deserve this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up, Celebi was smiling at you dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... The bright side, huh? Is there any?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi raised her head with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discovered that you were smiling as well,<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I still got you...\" you said sourly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi giggled and released you. You hovered in the air, held by a psychic force while Celebi put her paws together, indicating your small size, smile glued to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... you like me like this...?\" you were probably guessing wrong, it couldn't b-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy nodded. Once again, you felt the air leaving your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... B-But... why did you try to grow me back then?\" you simply had to ask. It didn't make any sense, if she liked you tiny, why did she try to help you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Celebi... she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, the fairy started to get a weird feeling whenever she was around you... and it was basically all day long. And, after nearly two weeks of protecting someone that tiny and cute, it wasn't hard to understand what the feeling was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to you, then placed both her paws on her chest, where her heart was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat simple gesture made you realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell into the room as you stared at the floating fairy, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a few minutes, you finally broke the silence,<br>\r\n\"Y-You...\" you went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi nodded, blushing furiously, as she gently picked you up, holding you in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, slowly, she pressed her lips against your cheek, confirming your theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi, a legendary pokemon, was in love with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did that even imply!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your body burning as the giantess kept her lips on you for half a minute, before pulling back, leaving you blushing furiously while blushing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh...\" you tried to speak, but the shock silenced your vocal chords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could you even respond to such thing? How would Celebi take a \u2018no\u2019 for an answer? Probably, she wasn't even going to take it... you weren't even sure about how your own feelings towards her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought was interrupted as you noticed the fairy moving, carrying you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi made her way back to the front door, which was still laying flat on the floor. She flew outside, a breeze blowing past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey... where are we going...?\" you asked, before remembering where she actually lived.<br>\r\n\"... Ilex Forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at you and nodded a few times, before starting to move again, blushing. She was literally carrying you to what was going to be your new home... because, if Celebi loved you, you doubted she was going to let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... you had to remain here, you had to stay home, wait for someone to come so you could get help... but it was clear, you couldn't leave your green guardian... you didn't want to leave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the only one to protect you in this dire situation of yours, without her you'd be helpless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that only meant one thing: you only had two choices.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, the legendary pokemon decides that, wether you're a dream or not, she would find out in the morning; she's too tired. So she lies down again and moves to put you back on the ground. But as you are inches from the ground, she stops as a thought crosses her mind: if this wasn't a dream, the tiny human would run away. An Celebi really wanted to know how did he got so small. Plus, if he runs away, even a Wurmple could be a threat to him, and Celebi can't have that. She knows has to keep you from escaping somehow. She could put you on a high branch on the tree, but what if you accidentally fall? Celebi shakes her head, that's out of the question. She could pin you to the ground with her hand until morning. No, you could be crushed. Celebi keeps thinking of a way to keep you safe while she sleeps; you stand still the whole time, just staring at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of thinking, Celebi has an idea: she could hold you in her mouth! You couldn't possibly escape and, if she swallowed you by accident, she could always bring you back up! Celebi decides to do so. So she turns to you and moves you close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems an eternity, the legendary pokemon finally turns her attention to you with a small smile. You wonder why is that as she moves you closer to her face. She opens her mouth and moves you close to it. Unaware of her intentions, you start to fear \"No, please, don't eat me!\" you yell. Celebi just ignores and moves you closer \"Please don't!\" you yell again, trying to get free from her grasp. Celebi momentarily stops. This human is  clearly agitated. That's not good, if he struggles in her mouth, she could swallow him. So Celebi decides to help you calm down a bit, before proceeding with her plan. She closes her mouth and moves her other hand to your face. You close your eyes, fearing the worst; instead, you feel her hand on rubbing your cheek. You slowly open your eyes, to find Celebi smiling at you while caressing your cheek. From this, you get that she doesn't want to hurt you. Or maybe she wants to make your last moments more comfortable. You strongly hope in the first as Celebi stops. She then yawns again and looks at you, tiredly. She then opens her mouth once again and quickly drops you on her tongue. You immediately turn around and try to jump out of her lips, but they close before you, sealing you in darkness. Celebi moves her tongue all over you: the tiny human is tasty! But she doesn't want to eat him... yet. So she eventually stops and slides her tongue on your body and relaxes: the human can't escape now. The legendary pokemon then lies with her head against the tree and closes her eyes. It takes just a few minutes for her to fall asleep. Meanwhile in her mouth, you try to struggle, but her tongue is too strong for you. You try to free yourself for a while, but you can't. So you eventually give up and relax, falling asleep almost immediately under her tongue.</span></div></div>",

The Ninetales stares at them for a second \"Nine tales nine\" he says.<br>\r\n*Pokemon speaking*<br>\r\n\"Relax, I don't want to hurt any of you. I just want to verify something\" Ninetales says \"How do we know you don't want to hurt him or worse?\" Pichu says, stills sparkling \"Yeah, that's right. How do we know that?\" Celebi asks. The fix seems to smile \"If I wanted to hurt him or you, I would have already attacked. And then again, I'm no stupid to attack a human protected by a legendary pokemon\" she says. Pichu and Celebi calm down at this, finding nothing to fight her logic.<br>\r\n*Human speaking* <br>\r\nNinetales gets closer you, who are still sitting on Celebi's head \"May I take a look at your arm?\" she asks. You nod and pull up your sleeve. A black colored flame - shaped mark is there. You, and your two companions gasp at the sight, while Ninetales looks at it with a sad expression \"As I thought\" she says \"This is a curse from another Ninetales. And, I'm sorry to say, it's irreversible' she says. Your eyes widen in shock; are you going to remain like this forever!?  You sadly lower your head. This couldn't be possible. You clench your fists, frustrated. Meanwhile, you hear Ninetales talking in her own language with Celebi and Pichu. She must be explaining them your situation. A second later, you are lifted from Celebi's head. You see the grass type smiling sadly at you. She pulls you in a tight hug, while Pichu simply jumps and wraps her short paws around Celebi's chest, hugging you as well \"Ce le bi\" \"Chu\" the two say.<br>\r\n*Pokemon speaking* <br>\r\n\"We're sorry for you. But look at the bright side\" Celebi says \"You still have us. We'll be there for you\" Pichu says. You sigh, before you manage to smile a little: at least you had two great friends to protect you. You look at Ninetales, but she's gone. And so is the Magikarp. Instinctively, you look in ghhe cave, and see her devouring the fish pokemon. She smiles briefly, before digging in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you and your two companions decide to leave. So you wave Ninetales goodbye and leave. After a few hours of riding Celebi, you three return to the sanctuary in the forest. Celebi goes sit down on it. She then picks you and sits you on her lap. 'This is funny' she thinks 'A human sitting on a pokemon's lap'. She giggles, while Pichu climbs on the sanctuary. Celebi then notices you're looking in the depths of the forest .<br>\r\n\"I wonder if I'm ever going to return home\" you whisper. Suddenyl, you feel a weight on your head. You look up and notice Celebi caressing your head with her hand, while Pichu stares at you with a small smile on her face \"What are you thinking about little guy?\" the grass type pokemon asks. Obviously, you can't understand her, but you still tell  them that you miss home, when an idea crosses your mind. They could bring you back home! But... if they do, you'll have to split up, because Celebi has to guard this forest. And you really don't want to say goodbye to them, they've been so kind with you. After a bit, you decide to</span></div></div>",

And you really don't want to. Not after they've taken care of you so kindly. In the end, you decide that you couldn't leave them, so you will stay with them in the forest. While you are deep in thought, thinking if it's the right choice, Celebi pokes you with a hand, snapping you back to reality. You look up at her \"What is it Celebi?\" you ask. The grass type points to herself, then to Pichu, who is staring at you two smiling, then to the direction you'd been staring at. You think for a moment what could she mean, but you then realize: she was offering to get you back home! Was she thinking about it like you? It doesn't really matter now, cause you made up your mind. So you shake your head. Celebi stares at you confused as you speak \"I really have to thank you for your kind offer, Celebi, but...\" you say, determined on your choice. Celebi tilts her head, it is a clear 'go on' sign. You take a deep breath and continue \"But I really don't want get separated from you two. So ...could I... stay here... with you?\" you ask. The grass pokemon looks at Pichu for a second, realizing what you just said.<br>\r\n*Pokemon speaking*<br>\r\n\"Has he really said what I heard?\" Celebi asks with a glint of hope. Pichu, with a huge smile painted on her face, squeaks in joy \"Yes! He wants to stay with us!!\" she yells in happiness. Celebi turns her attention to you and, with a smile as huge as Pichu's one, she nods eagerly \"Are you kidding? Of course you can stay!\" she says, picking you in a tight hug. You are pressed against her soft grassy skin for a minute, before she  passes you to Pichu. The mouse pokemon nuzzles you happily, careful to not shock you, before settling you on the wooden surface of the sanctuary.<br>\r\n*Human speaking*<br>\r\nFrom both of their reactions, you get that they would be glad if you stayed \"It is decided then\" you say, as happy as them.

She's too kind for that. Even if a shrunken human is something new, he ended up in her forest. The patroness of Ilex Forest usually cares about each and every creature within it, flora and fauna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this little guy will be no different, she decides. She'll treat you just as she treats every other inhabitant of Ilex Forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy's smile shifts into a grin. That doesn't mean, though, that she can't have some <i>harmless</i> fun with this new 'inhabitant'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the legendary's smile turns into a grin, her mouth opening slightly, giving you a clear sight of her pearly teeth, which seem to shine, eager to receive their 'guest'- you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith unnerving slowness, the fairy's lips part, giving you another sight to dread: a dark, pink and wet cave, full of white stalactites and stalagmites, and a dark abyss at the end of it. A dark abyss that would lead to a slow, painful death inside of the Celebi's belly if you ever get too near to it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Celebi gets eclipsed as her tongue darts out of her mouth and slams in your face, forcing you to close your eyes while covering your face in a thick layer of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant, red muscle shifts position, from your face to your upper body, then your lower as it completely bathes you with saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, it retreats back into the shadows of the fairy's mouth, while she closes her mouth, grinning down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgusted, you spit out saliva, before looking into Celebi's eyes.<br>\r\n\"Do not eat me please.\" you beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess starts giggling. You just gave her another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the two giant lips split up, revealing the insides of her mouth again. Before you can even think of begging, you're shoved right inside, the lips closing up again, sealing you in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you're entrapped in the Celebi's mouth, you give out one loud cry.<br>\r\n\"HEY, LET ME OUT!\" you shout, fearing what's coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the giant tongue beneath you starts wiggling, licking you all over as Celebi tastes your body. You gulp. When she's done, you will be meeting her stomach up close...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, the fairy isn't planning to swallow. She's just having some fun with her new tiny friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi leans back, her back against the trunk of the tree as she thinks. What to do with this human when she was done playing? She couldn't let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone so small would get eaten alive by the first Weedle he met, and the guardian didn't want that. So, the only way to keep this human safe... is to keep this human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi's eyes lit up. How didn't she think about it before? This human could be her companion. Time traveling is an useful power, and it's just as fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, being able to share this experience with someone else would be something new. Usually, Celebi doesn't get too near to humans as they would be a threat to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this one human is completely harmless... and he'll be the perfect candidate to be her companion during her time travels, she decides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi smiles as her mind returns to you, who are still trapped in the darkness of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can't explain why, but the human's flailing, his struggles, his screams are kind of... arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi quickly glances at her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one, she's alone. Well... that's not correct. She's alone with her tiny 'guest'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, the grass type slowly spreads her legs wide, her sex revealed to the world. Celebi rolls her eyes as her long left paw finds its way in between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing and smiling at once, the grass type starts rubbing as she pleasures herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't exactly tell how much time passed since you entered the hot darkness of this slippery 'cave'. A lot for sure. But it's starting to get even worse as your surroundings are shaking for some reason, while your ears are assaulted from cries coming from below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat in the world is Celebi doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET. ME. OUT!\" you scream for the... you lost count of how many times you've repeated this three words tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaking comes to an end as you hear one last, yet very loud cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the unexpected happens: the two lips part again, allowing fresh air to enter the mouth. That, and a giant paw which gets a hold of your legs and pulls you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly, your soaked body is brought to the legendary's face. She stares at you for a second, before bursting into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she just prank you? You were having a heart attack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy takes her time to stop laughing, before proceeding to clean your body from the sticky saliva.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi.</span>\" she happily says as she wipes the last drops away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're not going to eat me, are you?\" you question. Celebi smiles warmly, slightly reassuring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the fairy's gaze shifts elsewhere. Gently, she lets you down on her belly, on the dark green side of her body. One paw pins you against the smooth, grass skin while the fairy thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved that you didn't became a snack for the legendary, you look up at her, wondering what she's up to...</span></div></div>",

Not like he can't just fly out of there, but there is just a surreal feeling of the forest at night he likes. It's also the fact that he likes to take shiny and interesting items that people leave behind in the forest, like bottle caps and random beads he might find. He does think about flying back home, but a few more minutes of searching won't kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draaaaaa~..gon?\" While yawning and walking, Dragonite thought he saw something in the corner of his eye. It looked like a small human in between the roots of a nearby tree. He stopped, and looked back at the tree roots where he thought he saw the human, but nothing was there. There was no way he imagined that, right? Keeping an eye on the roots, he retraced his steps to then spot you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonite quietly approaches your sleeping figure, hoping not to wake and scare you.

This particular Ampharos learned to survive on its own after becoming lost from his flock as a Mareep. Weary and tired, he finds a nice spot to rest, right next to a log. Unbeknownst to him yet, you have already found this log. He lays down beside and closes his eyes to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before he senses another presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pokes his head up and looks around. No Pok\u00e9mon were in sight (and thankfully no trainers either). Still alert, but still very tired, he lays his head back down, ready for sleep. Just before he closes his eyes, he sees something. This thing appeared to be a human, but was smaller than a leaf! And that so happened to be you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached his arm toward you, but hesitated for a brief moment. Was this alright? Is this a smart thing to do? Thinking carefully, he realizes traversing this large forest must be very difficult with your tiny size. Carefully, he reached his arms toward you and slowly scoops you up. He brought you towards himself and examines you. He didn't know why, but he had the feeling he should take you to safety. Begrudgingly, he slowly stood back up and continued walking forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly an hour later, the entrance to his cave comes into view. His slow steps eventually lead him inside. He approaches his bed, made entirely of leaves and sticks, which was covered in bundles up Mareep wool. He plops down, exhausted, and forgets about you for a moment. Thankfully, he rolls at the last minute and you land safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat doesn't keep you from staying asleep, however. The jostling if the wall wakes you up, and you take in your unfamiliar surroundings. You were in a cave, clearly, and could see several things scattered about. A makeshift table-like structure sat in the center, complete with a wooden stool. A pile of berries sat in a corner, with the majority of them being Oran berries and Iapapa berries. A pile of scorched twigs and sticks sits nearby, presumably for heat or cooking food. You look down and see you are on a pile of wool. You guessed this was from Mareeps or Flaaffys, seeing as every now and then you felt a little shock. As you begun thinking of how you got there, you heard soft breathing from behind you. You cautiously turned around and saw the behemoth that was a giant Ampharos. You stood in shock at your predicament. Or was it really a problem...?</span></div></div>",

You saw it slurp your feet into its mouth, pulling your legs in behind and slightly lifting you off of the ground. You, the future Pokemon League Champion, were being devoured by a hungry Caterpie tonight. Unfortunately, things appeared not to be headed for change. As your entire lower half became submerged inside the Caterpie's mouth, initiating the swallowing of your feet, you accepted that you had only had pipe dreams. Nobody was here to save you. This Caterpie was just like you, wishing only to see the next rising of the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms and body entered Caterpie's mouth. You could already feel the tugging as Caterpie tried to ingest you as quickly as it could manage to. It was choking on you, slightly, having a bit of trouble taking in a person your size. However, you were just small enough that once it could close its mouth around your head, you were nothing but a goner. The rest of the process became easy, at least for the Caterpie. You were downed into its throat, allowing a breath of relief from the Caterpie as you squirmed your way down into its stomach. Unfortunately, the string that tied your body prevented you from making a fight until the finish. As the Caterpie settled down and got some well-needed rest for the night, you became an easy midnight snack for its empty stomach. By morning, nothing would be left of you but your bones in its gut.</span></div></div>",

You had no way of knowing, of course, but the recent hunts for Spinarak had been unsuccessful. In order to live, it needed to eat--now. Unfortunately, it could care less if you were human or pokemon, you were its now. A sharp piercing feeling like a blade entering your body. Blood began to leak from the wound, then came the horrible feeling of being drank alive through Spinarak's straw. It was slowly draining you of all of your fluids, leaving you like an empty Capri-Sun or a dried out grape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few horrid moments passed with loud screams and struggles to prevent your ingestion, but in the end, Spinarak left with a full stomach and an entombed carcass which had once been you.</span></div></div>",

You became something of an insole to her foot, causing you to embrace it and bend with the curve of her arch. You were at the end of her leg, almost an extension of her own foot. But, you belonged to her, not the other way around.

And, that person was <i></i>you<i></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to believe, but you didn't consider it for much longer. When her first challenger entered her gym, she jumped up and down in youthly joy, nearly annihilating you in the process. It was an incredibly painful experience--and all without even a single shred of awareness on her part--but you were grateful just to live another moment. In fact, you were already realizing your truly great situation. Many would dream to be in your \"predicament,\" but probably none would ever actually live it like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to feel a bit prideful.

A young girl would stick every other thing in her mouth, even a helpless little worm that was not aware of the girl's desire to taste and ingest whatever came her way.

Now, you needed to be eaten. She couldn't simply look at you and study the shape. Nah, she'll take in your detail with her tongue, studying your nuances as they are broken down inside of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilosophy aside, your life was over. The spoon tipped over and pressed you down onto her soft tongue, pushing you slightly into it. As the spoon left her mouth, her lips closed and darkness replaced all the light. All of a sudden, saliva rolled in. You were immediately drenched before being quickly tossed to her cheek. You were a small bulge in the side of her face before being placed between her molars. You had half a second more to realize that you were the victim of Whitney's interest in her food. In fact, you really weren't even human, at least not to her. You were food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teeth came down upon you and proceeded to chew and smash you up until you became a small pulp of unrecognizable human parts. She then swallowed you, and you were left in the care of her stomach as an initiator to the digestion of her breakfast.</span></div></div>",

You can feel pressure around you,certainly...and you can even speak,though your voice is soon drowned out by hers <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">.\"A pacifier? Well, that always help calm the pichu down...\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally dawns on you ,just where you are.You're in the donation box at the pokemon daycare. You haven't merely <i>shrunken</i>. You've been shrunken and ,during the time that you had were asleep, picked up,deemed to be a toy, and <i>donated</i> to a daycare. You have nary a chance to ponder the lowliness of your misfortunate state. The hand is descending once more ,this time upon you! A pair of fingers pinch around your head relentlessly,and you are roughly throttled upward, getting knocked against the plastic toys along the way. The fingers hoist you up into the air, sliding  downwards until they grip against your chest. You find yourself several stories off of the ground, face to face with the massive woman. Her eyes are fixated on your tiny form. From the looks of it, she is assessing you. Genuinely curious about the nature of this particular donation. Surely she will recognize that you are a human. Surely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Oh ,what a wonderful doll this is! And it even moves! The little pokemon will just love this!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a legitimate attempt at pitching in, but it doesn't help your situation at all. You feel a rush all around you as you are lowered down,and you wind up once more in darkness. She has deposited you into her apron pocket.  Before you can mount an escape attempt. Congratulations. You are now the property of a pokemon daycare. A mere plaything for the youngest of pokemon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough ,you are finally taken out of her apron pocket. You recall the daycare having an indoor area that was designed to accommodate for the more human-like pokemon, as well as an outdoor area ,one that was more suitable for the more animalistic ones. Even if you were sent outdoors, you doubt that you could realistically escape. Most daycares are equipped with special fences that prevent even the smallest of pokemon-yes ,even the incorporeal ones- from wandering off.  Struggling to get some idea of what is going on ,you look around frantically and find that you are in...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lying in the apron pocket, you hear the sound of a door creak open, and you are suddenly met with the  cacophonous noise  of toddler-aged titans running rampant through the room, a terrifying and even physically painful reminder of just where you are. Your owner's fingertips mash around you with brutal force,and you are hoisted out of the soft confines of her apron pocket, flung into the world The first thing you see, as your owner's fingers come to a halt, is an pair of enormous windows, each practically spanning the height of the room. You look out through them, at the idyllic outside world. A paved road, a whitewashed fence perched upon by a wild Spearow...a ten year old boy biking down the path, swiftly zipping from one end of your vision to the other. This ironic glimpse of the simplicity of life in the normal sized world makes your predicament all the more painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn your attention to the interior of the daycare, which will likely be your world for the time being. A table supporting a set of colorful arts and crafts supplies lies just beneath the humongous windows. Bright green wallpaper lines the walls, a cartoony alphabet banner hanging just beneath the white plaster ceiling. Craning your neck to the right, you see a low-height mesh walled crib, another positioned just beside it. To your left, you see an enormous diaper-changing table, complete with multiple shelves and a nearby diaper pail. Throughout the room, various cute decals are positioned on the walls,and some paper ornaments even hang from the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour inspection of the room is interrupted by the shifting of the daycare worker's fingers. You're briefly flipped around, your body staring at a flowery dress before her fingers clasp up into a fist, trapping you in the darkness. The air smells of sweat and salad dressing. The shouting and pounding of the Pokemon children seems louder than ever,and your body is overwhelmed with the force of the gripping hand and the vertigo induced by its motions.  About a minute later, the woman's fingers part oh so slightly, just enough to give you a chance to glimpse the outside world. You see what appears to be a tan carpet floor,a Ken doll with a head chewed up beyond recognition lying upon it. It appears to be wearing a pink Barbie dress, an ominous brown smear besmirches its right arm-the only arm it has left- and its chest is scorched black. As you examine it, you hear the sound of the <b>BOOM</b>ing footsteps of one of the Pokemon drawing closer to you. You  see a fuzzy yellow paw come down right for it, gripping it and swiftly yanking it out of your view. Your owner chuckles warmly. \"<b>Oh Pichu. You all can be so rough on your toys, but I wouldn't have it any other way!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the woman sets you down atop an enormous set of cubbies. She looks at you briefly,smiling, examining your motions.Attempting to communicate with her, you earn nothing more than a dismissive response. \"<b>Oh. The little ones are going to love you SO much</b>. You sigh and turn  towards the daycare, to see the opposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree pokemon appear to be playing. The Pichu from before is running about,smashing the Ken doll's messed up face against the edge of the arts and crafts table. A streak of drool trails down from his mouth and onto his pudgy , fuzzy belly, cutting off just above the waistband of his diaper. His diaper appears to depict a grinning cartoon car. Seeing the cartoon car, you grimly wonder if Pichu will wind up running you over, mashing you into 'roadkill' beneath his paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Clefairy sits nearby, quite close to the cubbies. This Pokemon, clearly the oldest at the daycare, but still not old enough to be potty trained, appears to be playing with a pink dollhouse,using  a massive hairbrush to come over the hair of a doll roughly twice your height. She occasionally rips out a few of the doll's hairs, for what purpose you cannot imagine. She's wearing a pink diaper featuring a cartoon princess in a flowing dress, though, curiously, her owner seems to have thought it would be appropriate to strap little butterflies along the waistband...still alive, their wings weakly wavering. Curiously, a 2-foot wide translucent plastic dome sits beside the dollhouse, a doll lying beneath it,coated in a thick sheet of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, an Axew is playing around on a playmat in the corner  of the room. It appears to be a model town. Toy cars and very simplistic looking model humans are scattered about atop the playset. Axew smashes his paw down on one of the little cars, cackling gleefully. Its tusks are a frightful sight to behold. They are massive, sturdy, and sharp. Worse, however, is the fact that a model human toy has been impaled onto each of its tusks. Their plastic faces remain static, stuck in a smile...but you know well that you'd be screaming for your life if you were in that situation. It becomes evident that no matter who you are handed off to, you will likely find yourself in a life-or-death game,at the mercy of a deadly pokemon cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can look about any further, you feel your owner's hand grip around you. She has finally made her decision.</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds of stomping, the woman lets out a deep sigh,clearly unable to keep up with the electrically fast baby Pokemon,  and calls out to the child. <b>\"PICHU! PICHU! MOMMY'S GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOU!</b> The frantic sounds of Pichu's paws smashing rapidfire against the carpet slows to a halt, a sloppy yet spine chilling <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">giggle</font> sounding out.You hear one last <b>thwack</b>, presumably a result of the Pichu smashing the doll against the table again for good measure, before the creature approaches you.You can hear the sounds of its footsteps growing louder and louder, until they finally stop. Instead,you can hear him breathe...though it's hard to make out over the breaths of your owner and the sounds of the other two Pokemon playing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman speaks up once more, speaking to the Pokemon in a doting, maternal voice. Her fingers mash against and shift around your body, her fingernails digging carelessly into your flesh a few times as she adjusts her hold on you. When her fingers finally  secure themselves around your head, you find yourself at belly-level with the enormous pokemon cub, a sheet of downy yellow fur covering his pudgy yellow belly. You look up towards his face, getting an unusual glance of it from underneath. He's looking up at the caretaker, not having noticed you yet, so you can't see much beyond his chin and his cheeks, though you CAN see that one of his enormous paws is stuffed right into his suckling mouth. You turn your head to the side, turning your attention to your surroundings. Pichu's body is framed by the familiar sights of the daycare,the same mesh walled crib and arts and crafts table from before, the enormous window to the outside world still visible, and a white door looming to the side of the cribs. Looking down, you see the waistband of the creature's diaper, the garment alone happening to be the size of an army tank relative to your body. More ominously, you can see the barbie-fied ken doll dangling from his pudgy handpaw by its one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly shaken by a loud <b>THUD </b>from beneath,and you realize that the Pokemon has started to move. You immediately look up to his face, realizing its fixated upon you. He stomps towards you in a haphazard path, such that you have to turn your head to follow him, carelessly flopping his doll about, but keeping his eyes fixated on you. He eventually stops right in front of you, sniffing at you with his relatively tiny (relative to his face, of course) nostrils. <b>\"Oh. I can just tell you're going to love it\"</b>the caretaker says,smiling warmly. You hear a rustling noise as Pichu scratches against the drool-soaked portion of his belly with the side of his arm, pushing the wet, matted fur about. After a brief pause, the caretaker continues <b>\"Your old toy looks a bit messy. Why don't you put it down so I can wash it,and then you can play with the new one?\"</b>She asks, in a tone meant to suggest that he really should hand her over the old toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu lifts the old toy up in front of his face, looking at it with a hint of sentiment. He pulls his drool-soaked paw out of his mouth and shoves the old toy into  his mouth, giving it a few  good chomps before pulling it out, its head warped even further. He tosses it to the ground and slams his enormous paw onto it , rubbing his foot back and forth, a final display of dominance before its departure. He kicks it forward gently,  and you hear a thud as the caretaker swiftly pins it beneath her slipper. She picks it up and dumps it into her apron pocket. <b>THIS one's gonna need a good hot bath...</b>she says to herself with surprising stoicism. She must have cleaned up toys that have been in FAR worse messes than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu looks at you intently,tapping one of his paws against the ground, producing a series of light <b>thuds</b> in the process. He brings his hand over towards you hesitantly and decides to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As your owner carries you about, you begin to hear the sounds of the Clefairy's shrill grunts grow louder, the sound of the fibers of her brush scraping roughly down on her toy growing louder as well. The gigantic daycare worker's thumb pushes you upwards roughly,and her  middle finger quickly coils around your chest, leaving you with your back against her palm. Looking forward, you get a brief glimpse of the contents of the cubbies, a single Pokeball in each, with most having some sort of hygienic supplies,snack food, and toys. Looking above the cubbies, you can see what appears to be a chart of sorts, a grid featuring the names of multiple pokemon and a list of dates going back from the start of the month.You spot the Clefairy's row on the chart, and are relieved to see nothing but smily faces. She must be one of the better-behaved Pokemon at the daycare. Before you can look much further into the list, however, you find yourself zooming down at a sickening pace, still trapped in the grip of the daycare worker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen things come to a halt, you find yourself being held about two feet away from the towering back of the Clefairy you saw earlier. Her figure towers over you,even at a mere 2 feet in height (technically closer to 2'4, for she's a bit big for a Clefairy her age.) Clefairy squirms around slightly, playing god knows how roughly with her doll. Her arms move about. Her little folds of babyfat,small though they may be,  jiggle, hidden beneath thick a thick sheet of pink fur. Her spiral shaped tail,which pokes out of a specially cut section at the rear of her garment, swishes to the left and right. As you watch the casual play-motions of the baby Pokemon, you pick up a new sense of fear of these gigantic creatures. Whatever unspeakable tortures Clefairy is afflicted upon the toy, she will be afflicting upon you momentarily. Clefairy is a Pokemon associated with girls..not just girls, but innocent and young ones. To the normal world, she might be a sweet, harmless little cuddle-creature that gradeschool girls can compare themselves to. To you, she is a predator who seeks not to devour your flesh, but to abuse you until she has had her fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you observe her motions, you notice one of the butterfly 'ornaments' on the waistband of her diaper begin to flutter its wings frantically. Clefairy responds by bringing her paw down towards it and pinching around its wing with her sharp, white claws.She pokes a slight hole into the wing, and the butterfly's struggles cease. She brings her paw away, having subdued her decoration's little rebellion with ruthless efficiency. Your owner finally speaks up.<b>\"Clefairy! I've got a special dolly for you!</b>The caretaker booms, causing the Clefairy to cease her motions. You hear her make one final go with the brush  before she  sets down her doll with a thump. She twists her body very slightly...until you can see her face, making direct eye contact with you. Oh god no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mouth opens wide in curiosity,you feel a terrible pit feeling of dread overtake you. Clefairy  clumsily turns her body around, scooting about this way and that  to get a better look at you. <b>\"Since you've been a good girl, I'll let you play with him first.'</b>The caretaker says,immediately eliciting a delighted giggle from the Pokemon. Clefairy swiftly snags you up inbetween her enormous, fuzzy fingers and holds you right in front of her face, squinting to get a better look at you.  She brings one of her claws right towards your stomach, threatening to skewer you just as she did the butterfly's wing. Her claw pokes against your belly gently,a few milimeters  away from gutting you. You squirm just a tiny bit, but it's all you can do to avoid fighting back screaming, to avoid triggering her judgment. Clefairy lets out a curious \"<b>ooooooooh</b>\" as she sees your body's response to her aggression,and for a moment you wonder if this girly-girly pokemon is about to dig into you , if your attempts not to startle or anger her have been futile from the getgo  You wince in pain as she drags the claw to the left and right,scratching at your skin, but not wounding it any further. She lifts her claw up, bringing it away from you at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe games have just begun, though. After a brief pause, you feel a surge of pain as she begins to press her fingers around you TIGHTLY, the pressure threatening to cause your body to explode. You shriek out in pain, a direct reaction to the torture, but the pain swiftly fades away as Clefairy looses her hold on you. She brings you brings you up before her enormous mouth and opens wide, an enormous pink tongue poking out of it,frothy drool bubbles clinging to it. She shoves your upper body against her tongue, dragging it up and down against your body  painfully. The  enormous tongue press into you, squishing around your body, practically burying you in the warm, damp surface as it slides back and forth. Her saliva  soaks over you, making breathing all but impossible. What few breaths you manage to take are tainted by stray bits of saliva. Just when everything seems hopeless, Clefairy pulls you away from her tongue, your entire front half covered in slobber. <br>\r\n Clefairy's gaping mouth curls up into the dopiest smile you have ever seen. She is going to LOVE playing with her new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving satisfied her initial bout of curiosity, Clefairy moves on to an actual game. She glances over at the dollhouse, then over to the enormous bubble-like dome beside it. Her fingers pinch tightly around you as she contemplates whether to play dolls with you, or take you to the dome, for what purpose you cannot yet fathom.</span></div></div>",

Her hand tightens around you as the finger thoroughly rubs around  your face, not only blocking out your view of the world, but also nearly smothering you in the process. In the tightness of her grip, you begin feel a sickening sensation as she starts to move about the room,deep booming THUDs sounding out beneath her paws as she makes her way across the carpet. You can feel the Clefairy swing her arms to and fro as she walks, flinging your body about with her every move. After several more steps, the frightening THUDS  and breathtaking swings at last come to a halt. The Clefairy remains stationary, perhaps frozen in thought. Her handpaw begins to sporadically clench around you with unrelenting force, again and again, as she contemplates what to do with you. An idle gesture to her, but a series of agonizing squeezes to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After several more squeezes, the gigantic Pokemon baby slams her padded bottom onto the carpet with another, louder THUD and pauses in place for a moment as she gropes at your body with her fingertips once more.  Eventually her fingers come to a stop around your legs, pushing around them with  near-bone-crushing force. With your upper body freed, you're at last able to see again. You find yourself staring out at the mostly pink,wooden dollhouse from before. It clocks in at about 3 feet in height, bigger than the Clefairy, but still not too big for her to manage.  The front end of the dollhouse is secured by a brass latching mechanism, with no functioning door. Instead, its door is little more than a brown rectangle painted onto the facade. The front-end of the dollhouse does have two pairs of windows, but they're thick and immovable plastic sheets, likely far too sturdy for you to break. You feel a cold chill pass down your spine as you realize that she could easily lock you in, affording you no means of escape. The entire building smells of soap,and has likely been given a good scrubbing recently.  The Clefairy briefly lowers you down towards her hip, mashing you against the waistband of her diaper as she fumbles with the latch, finally opening the dollhouse up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts her arm up  just a bit and brings it forward,  holding you out in front of the opened building as if to show off its contents. The interior consists of five rooms,none of them accessible from the other. A kitchen, a living room, a bedroom,and a bathroom comprise the bulk of the dollhouse.  Above the others rests another bedroom, grander than the other, making up the entirety of the attic. Toys lie scattered about the interior,mostly other Pokemon, but a few human-shaped dolls are mixed in with the rest. The furniture inside of the rooms is somewhat scattered. While the kitchen's interior is relatively orderly, the bathroom's tub is overturned and entirely too many toys are laid against one another in the attic bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour observations are halted by a sudden shake from the gigantic Pokemon. She lifts you up in front of her face,staring at you eye to eye, shifting her body noisily about as she holds you relatively stable. She suddenly brings you towards her mouth once more and mashes a pair of teeth around your head, softly humming to herself as if lost in thought. She pulls you out moments later and slaps you down against the carpet, brutally  rubbing you against it to dry you off, wanting her doll to at least be dry before she plays with it. Evidently she doesn't care much about that, however, as she quickly lifts you back up  in front of her head, your body still rather damp , but with the added issue of a few clinging carpet fibers.  The Clefairy eyes you curiously before silently lowering  a pair of fingers right down towards your head, likely wanting to give you a bit of a touch up.  This can't end well. You can either resist her advances with all your might, or comply and hope that she doesn't treat you too brutally</span></div></div>",

Are you really going to be able to face off against a giant who could fit dozens of you in her belly? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Clefairy hesitates for a moment before sending her fingers forward, both of your hands taking on one mighty finger each. You struggle with all your might to fight back against her, but  your arms are swiftly and painfully sent reeling  back.   As the Clefairy repositions her fingers to better grip around your face, you lift your arms and begin to swing them against her fingertips,thrashing your body about all the while.  The Clefairy looks down at your furious struggle and her focused expression shifts into an irritated pout. She can't groom her dolly with its body spazzing out and its arms smacking against her fingers! For all she knows, it might even bite her! Not only is the dolly getting in the way of her playtime, it's disrespecting her as well...and she can't have either of those from her darling little toy. She comes to a perfectly rational decision. She'll shake the fight out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little Pokemon brings her spare arm back and lifts you up a tad,your body slowly nearing her face. You're sent forward at gut-wrenching speeds, the world fading into a blur as the Clefairy flicks her hand forward. Your nerves  reel from the near-whiplash-inducing swing, and you're left to reflect on your actions as she holds you in place, your body facing towards the dollhouse. If she gets her way, and if you somehow survive long enough to even get a chance, that's where you'll be, doing whatever it is a living doll is expected to do. She brings her other hand back down  towards you, a devilish smile on her face. Not willing to give up, you lift your arms once more. She  pauses and hesitates before swinging you once more, this time harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're dazed even worse than before,but things  just get worse from there. Her fingertips tighten firmly around your body. In fact, her grip is so tight that you can barely breathe. Without any provocation, she sends you reeling, up and down, left and right, as if you were on some sort of roller coaster with constantly changing tracks. It's starting to get to you. Your motions become disoriented. The carpet floor, the cubbies at the far corner of the room, the little Pokemon's chubby belly, and the dollhouse all zip by you in a chaotic fashion. Your arms begin to tire from all that flopping. The Clefairy, however, is still as eager to play as ever.  Shaking the fight out of her dolly is fun! She adjusts her hand's position  until you're left hanging upside down,then brings you back rightside up for yet another fling. She brings you up to the side of the dollhouse and presses you against the side of the roof,pinning you there with one fingertip firmly against your beck. With just a bit more effort, she could crush your back. But, mercifully, she instead  releases you and allows you to fall back down to the carpet. with a thump. You land between her pudgy legs, at eye level with her enormous diaper. You attempt to flee into the dollhouse, but  before you can get very far her handpaw slaps back onto you and her fingers quickly wrap back around you, this time by your leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings your body back up to eye level with her belly and looks down at you with a simple-minded smile on her face. Just getting her dolly to calm down has been quite an adventure for her. She swings your body around by your leg, causing you to flop even more than before. By this point, the will to resist is just about gone. She slides her fingers around your body until she has them firmly around your chest, this time around managing to pin one of your arms to your side. Once more, her spare hand descends for you,ready to wipe that little head of yours clean.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clefairy continues to hold you between her fuzzy and cushiony but crushing fingertips, her  shimmering black eyes fixated upon you, her newest and most intriguing little dolly. The Clefairy remains relatively quiet as she examines you, in stark contrast to the Pichu, who is stomping about and raising hell with his high-pitched voice.  Your 'adorable' captor's  fingers smell strongly of slobber and sweat, but at the same time an overwhelmingly fruity scent clings to the air. Looking up at the underside of one of her claws, you indeed see a loose scrape of mashed up Bluk Berry, though you hardly have any time to appreciate such fine details of your surroundings. Clefairy suddenly hoists you high overhead, the world shifting into a blur. The Clefairy's arm clumsily flails about over her head,and loud THOOMing stomps soon follow. The world is a hellish mess of terrifying sensations...the thunderous stomping and piercing shrieking of three unrestrained titanic baby Pokemon, the blurred images of the ceiling and the alphabet-banner lining the top of the wall beneath it, the mighty fingers mashing around you,and, worst of all, the terrifying knowledge that a baby holds your fate in her grubby hands. Suddenly, you feel a tumbling sensation. The clefairy jerks her arm downward before halting, holding you against her hip, one of the butterflies stuck to her diaper fluttering its wings weakly against you. Turning around to see what she's doing, you realize that she is lifting up the dome from before. Before you can respond, she flicks you onto the carpet and slams the dome around you, an explosion of sound reverberating from around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare out into the translucent edge of the dome, the daycare around you reduced to a blur...a mostly clear one, but a blur all the same. You are suddenly shaken by the clefairy's footsteps, and you find that you're  eye level with her tank-sized paws, a pair of pink stompers, grubby and cute,each equipped to mash you into a bloodstain. Turning your head up, you see the enormous Clefairy looming tall over you, gazing at you with a smile, a trick of drool coming out of her mouth. She reaches forward and,somehow, manages to poke her finger <i>through </i> the dome, the material parting around her finger as if it were a pool of water. She  mashes her finger against you, knocking you onto your back,and giggles. You hesitate a little as the Clefairy draws her fingers back...you have a feeling this is about to turn bad.In fact, it almost immediately does.  Once Clefairy is settled in, she begins to do a familiar dance...the metronome dance. Watching as the baby titan's paws rhythmically smash one after the other  against the carpet, you are left with no choice but to flee for your life. The fibers of the carpet are thick and tall,coming up all the way to your knees, impairing your sprint, as if the constant quakes from her footfalls weren't enough. You manage to reach the edge of the bubble, but smack  right into it. Apparently, the bubble is meant to allow things to -enter- freely...but keep things from getting out. As Clefairy begins humming the finishing lines of her tune, you struggle to  crawl underneath the edge of the dome, to no success.You struggle with all your might to lift it up, but try as you might, you cannot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a deafening burst of sound blasts throughout the  bubble, pushing your body against its edge ,the sheer force of the burst causing your body to bounce back into the air, a painful ringing in your ears. You crash onto your back, your entire body sore and beaten back by the force of the blast, the Sonic Boom having done a serious number on you. You struggle to get up, but feel a searing pain in your right arm as you attempt to push off of the carpet. Something must have broken from the impact.  As your hearing recoveries, you hear Clefairy's terrifying giggle pushing its way into your ears over the painful ringing noise. It's a noise that you have by now been conditioned to fear. The booming thuds of her footsteps soon resume as she goes for round two. She means to play with you until you break. You tremble, capable only of muttering to yourself weakly. \"No...no...no.\" You're not a meal to get eaten or a bug to get stomped upon...you're a toy to be dealt with in whatever way its owner wishes.  As you tremble fearfully, you hear another set of footsteps headed this way. The yellow paws of the Pichu stomp towards the dome before stopping just outside of it. He scratches at an itch on his right leg, then towards the Clefairy to get a better look at her dance. His  face soon turns towards you,and he plops his butt down onto the carpet. He lets out a yawn,gazing at you idly,eager to see what move she uses next. He soon gets his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the interior of the dome grows deathly cold,and a white haze of powdery snow swirls about overhead. The powder quickly swirls around you, the cold sensation so intense that it nearly burns. The Powder Snow clumps around your body. You manage to fight it at first, but it quickly accumulates to a point that you cannot overcome. Soon, your body is   almost completely encased in ice, frozen, stuck in the middle of the Clefairy's target-practice toy. Painful though your position may be, it is a miracle that you are alive. Were she anything more than a baby Pokemon, you would be dead now. The Pichu claps his hands together, squealing out in applause, begging for an encore. Clefairy soon confirms your fears as her paws start back into motion. This could be the end. Right here, right now, you might just die at the hands of a baby wishing to show a cool trick to another, a victim of an innocent game you didn't even know about until four minutes ago. She's about to take another go at putting her toy to use.</span></div></div>",

You think,for a moment,that she has decided to spare you....or perhaps to leave you to die, trapped in your frozen shell. You lie motionless, able only to listen to the distant stomps of the Axew in the corner of the playroom. The Pichu lets out a loud, curious grunt, confused by the pause in the action. Clefairy's response is a simple giggle, an ominous sign. Whatever she's about to do, it won't be good. Never have you felt so vulnerable. The Clefairy takes a deep breath and stands up extra straight, stoking herself up for the next round of play. She brings her left leg forward, right towards the dome, almost as if she were a child taking a tentative first step into a swimming pool. Her leg phases through the side of the dome, just as her hand did before, and her paw crashes down into the carpet right near the edge,a massive THUD sounding  out as her paw smashes down, trampling the fibers underneath. Frozen in place, you can't even move your head to see anything above her pudgy, fuzzy legs. Looking out at them, you spot her right paw in the distance, just outside of the dome. It appears to be...glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before you can put two and two together, the  Clefairy lifts her right leg up and slowly moves it forward..right...towards...you. <b>\"CLE....FAIRY.\"</b> She bellows, her girly voice echoing from overhead. A shadow casts itself over your tiny body, one that grows darker and darker. Moments later,the warm surface of clefairy's pawpad presses against your head, not actually crashing down onto you...just resting there. She's toying with you. Clefairy pushes her paw against your chest as gently as she can, knocking you onto your back. Her paw slams down right beside you with a deafening boom, sending your body away from her, just a bit.  For a  moment, though it's hard to be relieved with your body frozen and a painful ringing noise echoing in your head,you begin to think that the Pokemon chose to spare you. Then she lifts her paw up once more,and you realize that she just knocked you onto your back to make it easier for her to crush you. This time you  can see what's coming next. An oval-shaped paw, squishy pink flesh surrounding a purplish-pink leathery pawpad,a single white claw extending from the front. A few carpet fibers cling to the underside of her pawpad,curled into twisted strands by her repeated footsteps, stuck in place by a thin layer of grim and sweat.  Realizing that he's about to witness an amazing spectacle, the Pichu leans forward, eager to get a better view of your demise. He screeches out a terrifying cheer,  begging the Clefairy to do the deed this time around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does so with glee. Her enormous paw smashes down onto your frozen body. For a brief, brief moment, your body is mashed down into the surface of the carpet, pinned beneath the pawpad, stuck in place as the force bearing down on your tiny body increases exponentially.You can hear the sound of the ice around you crunching,a single crack forming overhead before the inevitable happens one instant later.  It takes just a mere second for the pressure applied to your body to finish you off. Your chest is crushed into a bloodstain beneath her little paw. The rest of your body breaks apart, shattering along with the ice, broken to bits.Death claims you in an instant,your last thoughts being nothing but raw fear. A fear for your life, a fear of dying at the hands...or feet...of a little baby Pokemon,the same one who laid claim to you moments ago, the same one who would ultimately kill you. A fear of a dingy little pawpad crashing down towards you. You spent the last moments of your life as nothing but a child's plaything,and the child that broke you relished doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClefairy looks down, her mouth agape. She's surprised her plaything broke so quickly...and that it wound up being so gooey. She pauses for a moment, having to spend a few seconds just to take it all in. Her surprised expression fades to a smile. She lifts her paw up and sets it down on the carpet, dutifully wiping off the gooey stain on her pawpad into the floor.  The Pichu immediately crawls forward, sweeping the shattered toy's limbs up into a little pile. He sits down, leaving the pile between his outstretched legs. He picks one up and shoves one into his mouth, chewing on it curiously. In the meantime, the Clefairy manages to swipe away the toy's head, not wanting the Pichu to poach ALL of the remaining pieces. The Pichu hardly even notices. He picks up the other limbs that remain and heads off, eager to figure out some way to play with them. As he walks off, the Pichu occasionally dramatically smashes his paws against the carpet, wishing that he had a little toy-man of his own to smash and stomp upon. For her part, the Clefairy carries the toy's head away, back towards the dollhouse,wanting to see if the broken toy's head will fit on her favorite doll. She plops her butt down in front of the dollhouse and reaches for the toy,ready to find out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Clefairy's feet continue to pound against the carpet floor as she gets ready to launch another playful attack. Your body is still hopelessly frozen over, a sitting duck for whatever Clefairy is about to send your way.  You begin to hear a crackling noise from overhead, soon joined by a deep, echoing <b>\"OOOOOH\"</b>, the Clefairy clearly intrigued by her new power. Sparks of electricity tumble to the ground at her paws, giving you a clear and ominous indication as to what's about to happen. The Pichu lets out a loud sigh,awestruck by(and, perhaps, jealous of) the sight before him. You would let out a scream of shock if you could actually move your mouth. The Clefairy takes a single stomp forward, her paw smashing down into the carpet, right through the edge of the bubble. You can see her paw twist just a bit as the shadow of her arm approaches. As you watch the torch-sized sparks tumble to the ground, somehow dissipating against the carpet fibers, you realize that she's really going to do it. She's going to electrocute you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion of sound and light fills the dome, and pain instantly seizes you. A brilliant bolt of lightning crashes to your body, your little form vibrating in place as the deadly bolt overwhelms you. The lightningbolt is so intense that the ice around you begins to melt into a puddle,causing you to stumble forward onto your chest.  <b>\"AH HA HA HA HEE HEEHEE\"</b> the Clefairy giggles, amused by the sight. You're flopping about against the newly damp carpet fibers as if you were a Magikarp, animated by the surge of electricity throughout your system. The current of electricity swiftly abates, but the shocking sensation doesn't go just yet. You can hear the stomping of footsteps, hopefully those of the daycare lady, coming to save you. Though you can hardly move given your circumstances, you just barely manage to roll over to your side, motivated by the slim chance that someone is coming to save you from this horrible game. However, what you see does nothing to comfort you. You see the pudgy, fuzzy paws of the Pichu,the source of the stomping noise from earlier, pounding over towards the Clefairy. He begins poking at her,hopping about giddily, pointing towards you. Before you can figure out what he's talking about, he turns around, facing you,looking at you eagerly. He clenches his fists as he glares down at you. Sparks begin to fly from his cheeks. He wants to show the Clefairy that he can shock things, too....and he probably wants her to know that he's better at it, too! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pichu lets out a terrifying \"<b>CHUUU</b>\" as he strikes you with a terrifying thunderclap of his own,sending you onto your back and causing you to writhe in agony once more. This time around, the Clefairy is the one  able to sit back and freely to enjoy the spectacle. She eagerly watches, her mouth agape, as your body flops about, just as amused with your 'silly' motions as she was the last time. The thunderbolt is indeed mightier than the Clefairy's,and is enough to leave you completely paralyzed. Your body is hardly able to take the force of the attack,and when the numbness finally subsides, you are left with a dreadful sensation all throughout your body. You look worse for wear, to say the least though you don't even want to think about that. The baby Pokemon don't seem to care at all about your wounds, though the fact that you're not moving nearly as much as before is a sure sign that their toy is about ready to break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Clefairy  begins hopping around in place,  huge booming thuds sounding out as she prepares for her next turn. The Pichu runs around the dome, back to his initial position,and lies on his belly, just at the edge of your field of vision. His enormous face gazes at you, its chin resting against the carpet. You can feel the warmth of his breaths, if only barely...and you can definitely smell the scent. Yuck. The Pichu's ears perk up as the Clefairy begins the metronome dance again.  You wish there was a way to convince them to stop, but they can't. This is actually the most fun Clefairy has had in a while, and for Pichu it's a wonderful chance to bond with the creative little girl. She's not so different from him after all. In fact, she knows how to have fun just as well as he does. Unfortunately for you, there's just no way that the little-writhing toy-thing the babies are so eagerly playing with will EVER be able to convince them to close up shop and move on to a gentler game. Clefairy's going to attack you until your little body can no longer take it,and maybe  keep on going even after that. They're going to keep on using you as a simple toddler toy until you're a bloodstain on the carpet. Clefairy continues to stomp about,eager to impress her audience, and curious to see what torment she shall unleash upon her dolly next. Eventually, she finally makes her next move...</span></div></div>",

The Clefairy looms over you as she resumes her curious variation of the metronome dance. You can see her lifting her arms up and slowly swinging them left and right, her claws beginning to emit a brilliant white light as they gather up energy. Her mouth is wide open, in a tremendous grin, a single trickle of drool trickling out,right down to the waistband of her diaper. You can hear her paws pounding against the ground in the same rhythm. Most Clefairy stand in place whenever they use Metronome...maybe this one is a bit more energetic than the others,or maybe she's just stomping about to frighten you. Whatever the case, the continuous <b>THUD THUD THUD THUD</b>s of her paws smashing against the ground are a horrifying reminder of what is to come. It won't be too many more stomps before she's ready to subject you to yet another potentially deadly attack. Gradually, her motions begin to slow down, until her fingers are pointed straight up. The glowing light begins to subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\"AHHH!?\"</b> The Clefairy yelps out, looking left and right at her fingers, shaking them as if trying to figure out what went wrong. You can feel your heart pounding as you wait in anticipation. Maybe she has run out of juice. Maybe they'll leave you alone. It's a slim, slim, one percent chance...but it's reason enough to give you hope. The Pichu scoots forward a bit , his handpaws slamming forward, his head head passing through the dome, and his fuzzy chin hovering over your tiny body. <b>\"CHUUU?\"</b> he coos, sending a chill down your back as you realize he'd probably snag you up and play with you himself if the Clefairy decides to abandon you. Either way, he's clearly just as curious as you are as to what's about to happen. The Clefairy quickly answers by taking a stomp forward, having decided what to do. The Pichu takes a glance at the Clefairy before quickly crawling back, looking at you eagerly. The Clefairy lifts her right paw up and brings her foot forward, bringing it towards you. She's going to attack you directly,and you soon find out how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Clefairy's paw slams down right in front of you, the sound of her mighty footstep nearly deafening you. You can feel the carpet sink beneath the weight of her paw, the fibers bending to conform to her enormous foot.  She pivots her  left leg over your tiny body, but doesn't step on you. No, instead, she begins to turn her enormous body around. You can hear  a happy laugh coming from Pichu as you look up at the sight overhead. The back end of the Clefairy's purplish-pink diaper hangs over your tiny body, her enormous pudgy legs poking out of its legholes, a loop running around the slim base of  her curly tail, secured by a velco strap at the  waistband. Blueish star-shaped decals are printed onto the surface. You don't like where this is headed. You summon all of your might and manage to wriggle back across the carpet in spite of your near total paralysis, fighting your way back as if you were a worm. You make little headway.The enormous, chubby Pokemon's butt still hangs over your head, eclipsing your view of the world overhead. Her back towers high over you, stretching as far as your eyes can see.Her arms rock back and forth, as does her rear.  She's getting ready for a jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few more motions, you hear the Clefairy speak up<b> \"Cleh...fair....\"</b>,  she booms, pausing at the end.  A loud pounding noise booms out as the Clefairy kicks her feet into the carpet and bounces off of the ground, almost to the ceiling. \"<b>REEEE</b>!\" she screams as her  enormous backside descends towards you, slowly for the first second or two, then quickly accelerating to a dreadful speed. You continue to crawl back pitifully,your life flashing before your eyes. The massive rear soon covers the entirety of your view, its shadow engulfing the floor around you...and its descent doesn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your body erupts into pain as the Clefairy's rear smashes down on you, accompanied by the sound of almost every bone in your body crunching, followed by a  sickening squish as your body is pounded near into a pulp. The padding of the diaper pounds down onto your body, smashing you between her backside and the carpet, the garment briefly doing what it can to conform around your body before splattering you into a gooey mess. \"<b>YEEEE</b>!\" The Pichu shrieks noisily, clapping his handpaws together as the Clefairy softly giggles to herself.<b> \"HEE HEE HEE\"</b> . As it turns out, however, her work is not finished. In spite of the massive weight of the Clefairy,you managed to survive the initial blow, remaining trapped in the darkness beneath her backside. You can feel the creature's truly immense weight bearing down upon what is left of you. There's no fighting back at all, now. In fact, you can't even do anything beyond cry. After a few moments, the Pichu points this out to the Clefairy, who lets out an annoyed grunt. She'll handle this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You feel the weight on your body begin to let up as the Clefairy begins to lift her backside off of the carpet, carrying your crushed body along with it. Suddenly, she slams her butt down onto the carpet again, with a bit less force than before, but with enough force to pulverize you all the same, putting your body into an even worse state. <b>\"GUH. GUH. GUH\" </b> she grunts as she continues smashing her butt down onto you again and again. Now that your body is broken completely, you're of no use to her, and the only thing left to do is to wipe you out completely. She smashes her butt down again and again, shoving it extra hard into the carpet, the sound of your body squishing beneath her growing squishier each time. The Pichu hoots and hollers, stomping his feet to the rhythm of her bounces and cheering her on with a shrill but booming \"<b>CHU! CHU! CHU!</b>.\"  The Clefairy continues working your body down to a little red stain,bouncing off of what little remains of you again and again, for a full minute, until there's nothing left to bounce off of. After the fifteenth bounce, she stops putting any significant effort into her motions,and instead simply repeatedly hops in place, barely moving at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She gives you one last bounce, drags her rear back and forth for good measure, then stands up, sighing in relief. Pichu steps behind her, checking to see if she got you. Seeing nothing but a red streak, he squeals, clapping his hands and stomping his paws about noisily, confirming her victory. This time around, the toy's gone for sure.The Clefairy rubs at the back of the garment, wiping the bloodstain up onto her paw. She licks at it before cringing, finding the flavor not sufficiently sweet for her liking. She slaps her handpaw onto the ground and wipes it dry,then hurries over to the Pichu, ready to play a game with him, the pleasant memory of her playtime with the little prey-plaything fresh on her mind. </span></div></div>",

The woman hesitates, lifting you up and debating whether to toss you to the Pichu like a hushpuppy to a prized bloodhound, or to wait until after she handles the guest to let Pichu show you what it means to be a toy. .She sighs before shoving you back into her apron pocket, deciding that it would be a bad idea to leave her back turned after introducing Pichu to his new toy.  The Pichu pounds his feet into the carpet ,letting out a shrill cry, forcing the caretaker to calm him down as best she can. She leaves the room, heading over to the front desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she nears the desk, you hesitantly poke your head out above the top of her pocket. You see the young boy from before, standing at the doormat, busily wiping his sneakers against it, each stomp causing you to nearly lose your grip on the edge of the apron pocket. His sneakers are enormous, easily big enough to crush you like a roach, and are smirched with grass stains and flakes of dirt. He's wearing a pair of black pants, a blue jacket, and the most confident looking smile you've ever seen. Though he's young, boyishly cute, and kind of scrawny, he exudes an aura of authority that you can feel yourself practically bending to already. You're not sure if you want to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hilbert, was it?\"</b>The caretaker says, your body getting knocked back into the depths of the pocket as she steps forward to greet him. Looks like he's a repeat customer. <b>\"Yeah. Nice to meet you again, mam.\"</b> he replies politely.  As he chats with the lady about a Pokemon he wishes to drop off there, you feel the woman's fingers seize around you. <b>Looking to drop off a Pokemon?</b> she asks,  starting to play with the tiny toy-boy in her pocket. Her digits grope at your face, press  at your arms, even  move you about,casually toying with you as she addresses her guest, nearly spraining your right wrist in the process. <b>\"Yeah. Here you go. It's a Ponyta. Her name is FlameDash\"</b>He says, clearly proud of the arbitrary nickname he gave her.  The caretaker suddenly lifts you out of her pocket, casually setting you down by an enormous journal. The boy hands her over a Great Ball, and signs his name on the journal, his enormous hand passing right beside you. He glances over towards you curiously as he finishes with his signature. The caretaker shakes his hand and bids him farewell, then turns to leave the room. The gigantic boy  lifts his head upwards and zips his bag up.  He will likely be leaving the daycare soon...this might be your only chance to get his attention. Alternatively, you COULD wait for him to leave the room...then you'd be able to attempt an escape all on your own, but you'd have to  be quick,as the caretaker would likely return soon thereafter. </span></div></div>",

The colossal tween's expression immediately changes from one of curiosity to one of surprise and intrigue. You  feel a chill down your spine as he eyes you,and you think back to what you saw just moments ago, his sneakers, pounding down onto the doormat just to wipe the dirt out from under his feet. You could be next. The boy interrupts your thoughts by expressing his own. <b>\"wohhhhhh, cooool!\"</b>  he says, showing enough interest in you to terrify you. He slowly lowers his enormous hand down towards you, his palm casting a shadow over your tiny body . His sweaty fingertips grip  firmly around you,and you find yourself before his inquisitive eyes.He breathes out onto you, the scent of a cheeseburger and fries hanging over his breath. Suddenly, his lips spring into motion as he speaks up.  <b>\"Hey lady!\"</b> he shouts , causing the daycare lady to turn around.<b>\"Where'd you get this toy?\"</b> He asks,  resting his elbow on the countertop and holding you out in front of the woman. She steps towards the boy, briefly glancing at you before turning back towards his face. <b>\"Oh, that? Found it in the donation box today. Isn't  it something else? I've never seen a toy move quite like it does. It's like a real person...in fact, sometimes I like to think it is one.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilbert tilts his head back, scratching his chin and glancing over at the daycare lady.<b>Can I have 'em?</b> he asks, actually referring to you as something other than an 'it!\"  Jugding by the expression on the boy's face, it looks like he doubts the woman will say yes. The woman responds, confirming his suspicions. <b>\"Oh no...whoever donated this toy donated it for a reason,and frankly it's the best toy I've ever seen. This toy also already means a great deal to a little Pichu, and , well...Pichu is certainly a bundle of energy. Having a good toy to entertain him always helps\" </b>She laughs, rolling her eyes. She continues.<b> \"it would probably make him cry,too,and I wouldn't want to disappoint him.\"</b>The boy tightens his grip around you instinctively as she speaks,and you can hear him sigh in disappointment. The woman holds out her hand <b>\"Can I have him back now?\" </b>she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy hesitates, slowing bringing you over towards her hand, but hesitates. Finally, he speaks up,stopping just short of handing you over. \"You know ...what if this little guy really were a little guy?\" He asks, tapping a fingertip against your hair. The caretaker ponders this before speaking up <b>\"Well..I would still keep him. There would be so many uses for him,and it's not like he'd be doing better anywhere else. At least he could be useful with the baby Pokemon.  Wouldn't you want to keep him, too?\"</b> The boy kind of guilty replies.<b>  \"Yeah..I guess I''d keep him too. Keeping him as a pet would be a lotta fun.\" </b> The conversation continues down this frightful avenue for a bit more, until Hilbert...</span></div></div>",

The caretaker tilts her head, looking at the boy in confusion, surprised he would so quickly offer to part with his money over  what amounts to an a chew-toy, even if it is a top-of-the-line one. She sighs before nodding slowly. Looks like Pichu will just have to deal with the disappointment. <b>\"Well,ok. If you really want to. I can just buy another one, I guess. \"</b> She says, not wanting to deny the boy something he very clearly wants.    Hilbert hands over the currency,and the woman doesn't even bother to count it.

In fact, in your current position,all you can see is the cobblestone pathway leading to the daycare's doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the giant boy's hand  rushes upwards, still clinging tightly around you.

He rotates his hand and releases his grip on you, at last allowing you to move. Before you can actually move, though, you hear his voice again<b>. \"Stand up, little guy.\"</b> He says, matter of factly, though his excitement is obvious. Realizing that he already knows you're alive, you can see no harm in obeying. You push your hands against his soft palm and clumsily stand up, nearly tumbling to the distant ground.Finally free to move on your own, at least as far as his palm goes,  you look out at the world around you. The terrain is unfamiliar, but you seem to be on a walking path near a small town.<b>\"Wohhh....you really ARE a small person...this is so cool..\"</b> the boy mutters to himself, interrupting your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You turn towards his face. He responds by grinning an awkward, toothy grin and waving his hand about frantically. \"Hiya little guy! Can you say something?\" He asks, his massive eyes fixated upon you.<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Hey.\"</font> You respond, waving your arm back to him just as awkwardly. The boy extends a meaty fingertip down towards you and mashes it down onto  your face, clumsily petting you. <b>\"You can talk,too...oh man, this is great. I have the world's first mini-dude!\"</b> He says, clearly impressed. You push your hands up against his finger, impotently trying to deflect it from your head. You try to explain to him that you aren't a toy, that you're scared for your life,and that you want back to normal.  You innocently ask the boy if he will help you get back to normal size. \"<b>Maaaaybe. Let's  take you back to a hotel or something first My name's Hilbert, by the way..</b>,\" he says in the same way that a boy might lie to his mother. You feel a pit in your stomach. That means no. You protest, but he cuts you off. <b>\"Dude. I just saved your life. I can give you back to the daycare if you want.  Wanna play with that Pichu?\"</b> He asks. You immediately shake your head. Gods no, anything but the horrors of that terrible, terrible, noisy room.  Hilbert brings you before his face, scratching his chin, clearly feigning contemplation...though what he's actually planning, you can't tell. \"<b>Hmm...I duuuunoooo.

Sorry, little guy, but think I need to teach you a lesson before I can take you home\" </b> Hilbert says, speaking to you with a hint of indignation, even if there's a clear playful tone in his voice.  He reaches his other hand towards you and gently pinches you between his fingers, the enormous fingers locking around you and trapping your arms in place. You are  carried you towards an enormous wooden fence. You look towards the distant, enormous field. The heat of the summer morning beats down upon you, and a less than pleasant odor clings to the air around you.  A series of sounds much like cannons being fired  echoes through the air, and you soon realize it to be the clopping of an enormous Girafarig's hooves. The boy holds you steadily in place, wrapping his fingers tight around your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou  kick and squirm, begging for help as the enormous Pokemon's face draws nearer and nearer, but none comes. The Girafarig finally arrives in front of you and gives you a good sniff before opening its mouth  wide. Whatever you felt about the boy's breath, you can agree that the Girafarig's breath is ten times worse. Suddenly, her head rushes forwards, her enormous tongue headed straight towards you. She locks her muzzle around the boy's fingers,your body included,  and begins to assault you with its squishy,  tongue. You squirm as it pushes against you, rubbing against your face, dragging up and down your body, occasioanlly bumping into the fingers that bind you in place. You squirm with all your might, something that  merely entices the Girafarig to pursue you more aggressively..but you ultimately give up your struggle when you realize that breaking free from the boy's grip would spell certain death. Saliva seeps around your body, ruining your clothes inside and out,  soaking your body in spit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe  Girafrig begins to  push her teeth against your back and tug at you, trying to rip you out of Hilbert's grip. Hilbert  quickly reaches into her mouth with his spare hand, managing to part it just enough to pull you out. The Girafirig trots back, spinning in a circle before turning back towards you. Hilbert  brings you back over the fence,the the Girafarig approaching slowly, eyeing you skeptically.She clearly wants you back, almost certainly because it wishes to devour you outright.  Suddenly, the Girafarig lunges for you,  only for Hilbert to swiftly pull you away.<b> \"Wow, you're fast, little guy!\"</b> Hilbert says, taunting you.  The boy continues to jerk you about here and there, toying with both you and the Girafarig...to the boy, who likely doesn't appreciate just how cruel he is being to you, it's a simple game. He's probably a 'good kid' as far as kids go, too. Maybe somewhere in there he appreciates the idea that Girafarig could eat you, but for now he's lost in the fun of the game. It's no fun for you,however...it's a life or death struggle! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n To the Girafarig, of course, it's a potential meal. After five more pounces, the Girafarig finally gets you in its maw once more, much to Hilbert's surprise. </span></div></div>",

Her teeth lock around Hilbert's fingers and swiftly tug back at you, yanking you free from his grip with ruthless efficiency. You tumble forward, onto the Pokemon's squishy, slobbery, smelly tongue. You  almost immediately scramble back, using your newfound freedom to attempt to escape from the gigantic Pokemon's maw. Before you can even try to part her lips, however, the Girafarig jerks her head to the side. Her hooves slam down against the soil soon thereafter,and you realize that she has just managed to walk out of Hilbert's reach.\"<b>AW CRUD!</b>\" the boy shouts, realizing with horror that he's lost his little find. You're 'free' from Hilbert, alright...and a free meal for the Girafarig, to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Girafarig's tongue suddenly pushes you forward, right towards her waiting teeth. Two rows of flat chompers pound around your body, applying a huge force all around you. You scream in pain as you're struck by the teeth, your body barely able to take the pressure without getting crushed. Desperate to  get out of this mess, you push forward the moment the rows of teeth part, and you manage to shove your hands between the unsuspecting Pokemon's lips. The Girafarig attempts to chomp down on you again, but just barely misses your lower body.  Struggling with all your might, you force open her maw and tumble down to the distant soil, striking the surface with a thump. You struggle to get to your feet, your body beaten,bruised, and sore, your clothes soaked and torn, and your legs hardly able to hold you. You push your way between blades of grass that are just as tall as you are, trying to put as much distance between the Girafarig and yourself as you can.  You turn your head back to check up on your predator,and find that she appears to be holding her head in place near the ground, eying you, but not moving. You make a beeline for the fence, your heart pounding, your little legs about to give out. Just a bit more...a peaceful life as a gradeschool boy's property awaits. You got Hilbert's message loud and clear. Defying him lead to the scare of your life...surely this is fate telling you not to defy him again. You can practically feel it. You're going to be safe...you'll live to see another day...just a bit more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you near the fence, you begin to  feel a bizarre sensation overtake your body. You find yourself getting drawn back by an unseen force, as if pushed by a strong wind. You step forward still, fighting with all your might to make it past the fence. You continue to step towards it, but find that with every step, your motions slow even further, almost to a halt. Your hope begins to die down before vanishing outright. Suddenly, the force intensifies dramatically, flinging your body over the blades of grass and back towards the Girafarig, your body landing on its back. Right...she has psychic powers, you forgot. All you managed to achieve, in your flight, was to drain your own energy, making the Pokemon's job all the easier. Suddenly, you feel a FAR more painful force smashing down onto you. The Girafarig's hoof crashes down onto you, jamming down into your  legs and almost immediately snapping your bones. You yell out in pain and terror, but earn no recourse from the gigantic predator. In fact, she actually decides to drag your body beneath her hoof just a bit, pushing your body against the soil firmly enough to leave an impression wherever she drags you. You are helpless, able only to watch as the Girafarig's enormous face descends towards you again. Her  mouth opens wide, and she clamps her teeth around your upper body, using her hoof to hold your lower half in place as she roughly yanks and twists at your upper half. Your body can hardly stand the trauma. When resistance finally becomes impossible, she releases her hoof's hold on you and hoists her head up into the air, your legs dangling from her mouth. She pushes you inside, trapping you in the darkness of her maw once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This time around, Girafarig has no trouble pushing you between her teeth. They aren't as viciously sharp as those of some of the more carnivorous Pokemon, so she has to put in a bit of additional effort to pound you into submission. She smashes her teeth around you again and again, slowly but surely pulverizing you. By the time she finally sends you plunging down into the depths of her belly, you're hardly alive. A pain courses throughout your entire body as you lie there, trapped in the darkness, forced to listen to the sounds of the creature's internal processes, accompanied by the distant stomps of her hooves. Your body is sloshed and shaken around as she stomps about. Soon, an avalanche of chomped up leaves begins to tumble into her belly, burying you up to your neck beneath the rest of her meal. Stuck beneath the bed of leaves, afforded only a tiny portion of oxygen, and cradled by the shaking of Girafarig's belly, you slowly fall to sleep for the last time. Death finally claims you as Girafarig's stomach goes to work on her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lizza the Girafarig thinks back to the interesting little vermin she gobbled down  a few hours earlier, idly trotting about within the pen as she does so, occasionally pushing a toy ball about with her nose. She had used her psychic powers to read a bit into its mind earlier, just enough to know that it apparently thought itself to be a human. An amusing thought, a human only barely bigger than a PokeBlock. That'll go down in the record books as the most arrogant prey she devoured. Then again, maybe it WAS a human. Wouldn't that be something. She of course loves her human owner, but she's always wanted to completely overpower a human being. It was a shame that her meal fought so hard. She would have loved to have spent a bit more time delving into its mind, to see what it was thinking before it couldn't think of anything beyond its current agony. It's always a guilty pleasure, reading the thoughts of her meals. Speaking of her meal, she finally feels ready to be rid of it . She digs a hole in the ground and promptly puts it to good use before kicking some dirt over it, covering her tracks. She trots off, wondering when her owner will be back. A cute Growlithe sprints between her legs, giving Lizza  a much wanted distraction for the time being. She playfully gives chase, returning to her usual routine.</span></div></div>",

He purses his lips together almost immediately and breaks out into a giggle, amused by his boyish antics. <b>\"Ah, don't worry. I was just teasing you little guy</b> The gigantic boy says, loosening his grip around your head. He grins before speaking up once more,<b>\"Thouuuugh....\"</b> he says,  lifting you up over his head, tilting his head back in the process. <b>\"You DO look kind of tasty\"</b> He adds, opening his mouth wide, sticking his tongue out. He swings his tongue left and right as he slowly lowers you down towards his cavernous mouth, his breath washing over you once more.   Right as your feet barely touch against the tip of his tongue, he yanks you up again and tickles you in the chest. <b>\"Aw. Why are you so afraid! I wouldn't eat you!\"</b> he says, and while you're sure that he wouldn't dare devour you, the fact that he doesn't see anything wrong with these games is just as scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Come on. Home's too far away for tonight, so I'm gonna take you over to the nearest town, we can spend the night together in a hotel!</b>  Just as the giant finishes speaking , he starts sprinting off away from the daycare, your tiny body getting flung about madly in his grip. He carries you over to an enormous bike and stuffs you feet-first into one his pants' front pockets, your body winding up mashed against his wallet.  He plucks you out a moment later and brings you over to his enormous carrying bag, a blueish plastic bag with a half-Pokeball logo emblazoned onto the side. . He opens his palm out, hovering it in front of the opening, then he lowers his hand over towards the top of his bag, your body stumbling around in the process. \"Ok little guy! Hop on in!\" he says, as if he were inviting you to join him in a pool. A thinly veiled command that he wants you to obey. You peek down into the bag, hesitant about diving in. You feel a sudden force against your back, his fingertip jabbing you forward towards the edge of his palm. Getting the message, you suddenly dive forward into the bag, tumbling down to the bottom, landing  atop a wadded up receipt and a rolled up bag of candy. The bag is shaken about for a brief moment, and you hear a terrifying grinding noise as the zipper is sealed shut , well..mostly shut. A tiny crack of light pours into the bag from an opening in the corner <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag shakes into motion as the boy  hops onto his bike and starts riding off, carrying you along with him to...well,wherever he is going. You keep hoping that you'll be able to persuade the boy to help grow you back to normal,or at least to knock off with his petty games...another part of you fears for the worst, that things are only going to escalate from here. Whatever the case, you're bound to be with him for a while. You manage to pry a piece of candy out of the candy bag, and you begin nibbling on it. Though it's too sweet for your tastes, and it's not really nutritious, you could use the extra burst of energy. As you nibble on it, you look up at the light coming from the corner of the bag. The opening is big enough for you to slip through! You feel your heart skip a beat,  both excited and afraid.You can make your escape if you want...but what if escape isn't the best option? Hilbert  will probably toy with you and belittle with you the first chance he gets, but is the outside world really any better? At least Hilbert seems to want to keep you alive.

You were sold as a plaything to a giant 5th grader,and while he clearly knows that you're alive, you're almost sure that he views you as a pet. You've seen how kids usually are with their Pokemon. They might view their pets as friends, but they expect them to be at their beck and call constantly. Your situation is much worse than that of a Pokemon, though...you'll be the first addition to Hilbert's collection that is <i>incapable of fighting back</i>. A Pikachu could zap him if it felt abused,it wields enough power on its own to put the boy's authority into perspective, and would be a visible enough victim for the boy to get into trouble if he mistreats it too badly. The best you could do would be to give the boy the middle finger, which would really achieve nothing more than giving him an excuse to try out a new form of punishment on you.

A chance motion causes you to nearly fall off, but you just barely manage to grip tight enough to avoid having your progress reset. After a minute of climbing, you finally make it to the edge. You take a look around you. Aside from the boy's jacket, a massive tower of blue fabric to your side, the world is a blur,the dirt path beneath you included. Before you can make any attempt at trying to descend, the boy's motions force your hand. The bag swings to the side just a bit, just enough to cause you to tumble over the edge.

You fling yourself onto the bottom of his jacket, gritting your teeth. The cool air beats against your body, and you are subjected to even more force than before. The gradeschooler's legs push up and down, back and forth as if they were part of an enormous engine. It becomes apparent that you probably won't be able to climb down, but you're going to have to try anyway. You wait for the right moment before releasing your grip on the jacket, and you manage to cling onto the side of his pants, near his knee. Unfortunately, the boy's motions are simply too violent for you to handle. You lose your grip on his pantsleg and plummet down tot he dirt path, landing awkwardly on your right leg, immediately tumbling onto your back. You pant in and out, your  arms sore, your right leg overtaken with a throbbing pain,and the rest of your body not feeling particularly well either. Still, there's something relaxing about hearing the sounds of the biking boy fade off into the distance. You just managed to save yourself from becoming a 10 year old's action figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lie there, you begin to grow nervous. You aren't really safe out here, but your body is tired as all else. You're not sure if your leg needs any more rest,but the soreness all over your body is definitely telling you to rest.

You\u2019re not even sure if you can properly run in your current state, but you can\u2019t just lie here and do nothing. You are completely exposed to man and Pokemon alike, and you have seen what they are capable of. Even if you manage to avoid detection, you\u2019re still in the middle of the road. Just lying here, you would face a substantial risk of getting stepped on or worse. Summoning all of your willpower, you get to your feet, a pain shooting through your leg, but not one so severe that it prevents you from moving.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You head towards the closest side of the road, which, at your size, is over a quarter of the length of a Unovan football field away from you.  Clumps of dirt the size of your head lie scattered about the path here or there, a fine detail you would have likely ignored if you were at your normal size. At the far end of the path lies an enormous stick, stripped of any jutting branch, aside from a short one near the base. A sizable trench of dirt lies beside the discarded stick. Perhaps a boy was here earlier, playing with the stick as if it were a sword, scratching at the ground just for fun. Whatever the case, the \u2018trench\u2019 would be deep enough for you to lie down inside, just another reminder of your small scale, and how the most insignificant of actions on the part of the \u2018giants\u2019 could have an impact on your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stagger over an ankle-deep tireprint that\u2019s almost as wide as you are tall, in awe of its scale. You\u2019re getting close to the edge of the road. However, before you can arrive at the patch of grass, you hear the beating of wings, followed by a loud squawk. Turning towards the noise, you see a shadowy figuring descending right towards you, wreathed by the brilliant light of the sun. Your movements must have drawn the attention of the flying predator. Seized by your primal drive to survive, you sprint to the side at full speed. You apply too much pressure to your injured leg in the process, however, and you collapse forward, scraping your hip and elbow, just barely avoiding getting pinned beneath the incoming hazard.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolling onto your back and swiftly scooting back, you get your first glimpse of the new threat. An enormous reddish-brown talon with long, white claws. You can see the many ridges lining the toes of the talon, and are almost immediately reminded of a dinosaur. Indeed, the avian beast that presents himself to you might as well be one, given his scale. Looking up, you see the underbelly of the huge Spearow , but are soon met with the more intimidating sight of his enormous beaked face, gazing right at you. His beak is parted wide, his eyes glare at you cockily, the confidence of a prize fighter going in for the kill\u2026or a hunter quite literally going in for the kill, in this case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Spearow parts his wings dramatically, revealing his truly impressive wingspan, roughly eight times as wide as you are tall. He lifts one of his talons into the air dramatically, a downpour of dirt flakes tumbling to the ground underneath, before slamming his sole down onto the soil with a mighty thud. He drags the talon back, a shrill grating noise sounding out as it cuts into the surface of the soil. He repeats the process, slamming and scratching his talon into the soil again and again, getting stoked for a chase. The entire sight is enough to send you into a panicked state.  You\u2019re almost certainly going to die here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as you manage to get to your feet once more, the Spearow finally decides to take initiative. He charges towards you, his mighty talons scratching against the ground, his face hovering just above the ground, his beak open wide, ready to snap you into his eager maw. It\u2019s fight or flight, now. A battle for your survival, with a humiliating death as the quarry of a bird being the cost of failure. </span></div></div>",

Hastily surveying your surroundings as you retreat, you spot a basketball sized chunk of dirt nearby, something that could be used as an improvised weapon. You rush for the dirt,the Spearow quickly drawing closer and closer to you. Gripping at the surprisingly light chunk of dirt, you hurl it straight at the Spearow's forehead. It strikes the giant bird right between the eyes and bursts into a puff of dirt,momentarily blinding the creature. Using this distraction to your advantage, you circle around the enormous bird, moving out of his field of vision. You spot a twig and grab at it, clumsily holding it as if it were a spear. You cautiously retreat towards the fence at the side of the road, mostly to gain some distance between yourself and the bird, who is already shaking the dirt of, getting ready for another charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The enormous Spearow turns around, letting out a mighty squawk and spreading his wings once more. He leaps up into the air, noisily flapping his wings at a dreadful pace. He swiftly advances upon you,attempting to attack you from above. His enormous talons swiftly rush towards you, threatening to catch you in his grip. Whatever he intends to do with you once he has you in his clutches, you can be sure that it would spell the end for you. You rush the creature head on, narrowly avoiding his gripping talons, and hit his underside with your weapon, actually managing to produce a small scratch. The Spearow's talons slam down onto the soil immediately thereafter, the gigantic Pokemon clumsily stomping forward, carried by the momentum his failed dive.  He swiftly turns around, one of his mighty wings smashing into you in the process. You are flung back by the force of the impact, knocked onto your back, your weapon cast aside. You rush over to the  twig, the Spearow's talons swiftly chasing behind you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You dive for the stick, the Spearow's beak slamming down right behind you, just narrowly missing your legs. The Spearow flicks his beak forward, knocking you  away.  You roll as you hit the ground, this time around able to hold onto your stick. You get back to your feet, just in time to see the Spearow resume his charge you, his head hovering just about the surface of the ground. He's showing no signs of tiring, beyond merely being annoyed at your resistance. You realize that if this keeps up, you'll eventually run out of steam and get hopelessly savaged. With his head so low to the ground, you should be able to hit him in the eyes. You charge towards the Spearow head on, in a desperate attempt to strike at his most vulnerable point. You leap up a full body height into the air and prepare to thrust your weapon into beast's eyes. Suddenly, the Spearow jerks his head up. He opens his maw wide and slams his beak down onto the stick, leaving you hanging from its tip. Having no choice, you abandon the stick and step back, feeling a dull terror as the Spearow effortlessly breaks your weapon, crunching the stick in half with his mighty beak. You desperately search for another twig, but the closest one is located on the opposite end of the road, the formidable Spearow blocking your path. Instead, you decide to attempt to climb onto the creature's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You rush around the Spearow as he spits up the remaining chunk of the stick, hoping to  outmaneuver the lumbering titan. You manage to round his flank, his tailfeathers in sight. You leap forward, managing to grip onto a tailfeather right as the Spearow whips his body around. You are flung several feet away, your tiny body smashing into the dirt painfully. The Spearow squawks angrily, realizing that you might have given him the slip. He quickly scans the area, taking all of five seconds to spot you. He chases you down again, and this time you lack the energy to truly evade him. He slams his beak right down,and it is all you can do to dodge the blow. He slams it down again and again,  forcing you to roll past it left and right. After dodging ten pecks, you feel a shooting pain throughout your body. You are hoisted up into the air,the Spearow's beak having managed to seize itself around your chest. Your upper body dangles from his beak, providing you with one last glimpse of the outside world, albeit an awkward one. He pushes his beak against the ground and growls as he pushes you against the soil, forcing you deeper into his beak,until only your head  is exposed. He lifts his beak up and forces you down into his maw, the partly cloudy sky vanishing from your vision as you are pushed down, his beak noisily snapping moments later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You are easily forced down into the darkness of the enormous bird's belly. You listen in terror,hearing the muffled sound of the Spearow <b>SQUAAAWK</b>ing as noisily as possibly, crowing in triumph. You give a token struggle, not wanting to die this way, not wanting to die as vermin in the belly of a beast. But it's all to no avail. The fight is over. You have lost. The Spearow leaps up into the air, sloshing your body about. Soon enough, you give out at last, reduced to mere nutrition for the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spearow stands atop the fence, peering down at the path, occasionally flapping his wings about, or pecking at the air to deter a random fly. It's a somewhat boring hunt, but the path is a good fallback when his usual hunting grounds prove barren. Usually he only find discarded bits of food from the humans, but from time to time he finds a real prey. He's already forgotten the little battle he had. He remains stationary for another hour before a burger-toting-trainer finally spills a sizable scrap of bread. The Spearow dives for it, snagging it up and gulping it down quickly. He flies off, heading back towards his nest.</span></div></div>",

Your arms ache from the difficult climb, your leg hurts like hell from the drop,your chest is sore from the rough treatment at the hands of the giants,and the sounds and sights of the daycare's interior still haunt your mind. You simply don't have it in you to get up,at least not yet. Instead, you opt to lie down and simply absorb the environment around you as you recover. It's a bright day. The warmth of the summer noon's sun bears down upon you,and the scent of soil is thick in the air. The chirps of birds echo noisily through the air, though thankfully the chirps are easier on your ears than the chaos of the daycare's interior. You lift your head just a bit and look around, surveying the area. The daycare is far away now, the outdoor pen just barely in your view. The distant calls of Pokemon sound out from the area...you don't want to go back. A large patch of grass extends alongside the path, cut off by a deep,pristine river. On the opposite end of the road, the same white fence you saw earlier towers over the roadside, separating the path from a grass embankment. Beyond the embankment lies a forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shifting your vision upwards , you catch a glimpse of the talons of a bird Pokemon,resting on one of the fenceposts. Looking up just a bit, you see a Spearow peering down at you, curiously. The humongous bird Pokemon tilts his head left and right,trying to get an idea as to what you are. You feel a cold chill pass down your spine, a paralyzing fear gripping your body. Your life could depend on whether or not  the Spearow decides to examine you. You remain as motionless as you can, trying to pass yourself off as a discarded plaything, something unworthy of the Pokemon's time. Your heart pounds as you stare up at it. You're afraid to even close your eyes. As you lie there, you hear the sound of a rumbling coming from a distance, growing louder and louder. The Spearow averts his gaze from you for just a moment, giving you a chance to turn towards the rumbling. In the distance, you see an enormous bicycle headed your way, a  mud splotched black rubber tire dragging rolling against the dirt path, headed right your way. looking up, you see the crimson framework of the bike,and the smooth, feminine legs that work at it. A pair of black, skintight  exercise shorts rests atop the seat, belonging to a woman in a pink vest. Beads of sweat cling to her legs. She looks to be in her 20s, certainly more mature than the boy from before. Whatever the case, this could be your chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to get up, pain shooting through your right leg, but not enough to prevent you from walking.

Dirt spews forth to either side of the monstrous machine, pushed aside by the gigantic wheel. You can hear the constant roar of the wind against the bike, a wall of air torn asunder,  displaced by the enormous advancing machine. The wheel spins at such a fast pace that the pattern of its treads is nearly a blur, but you can still make it out. Five rows of rectangular knobs bulge out from the surface in a checkerboard pattern, some of them more worn than others. The soles of the woman's sneakers jut out over the sides of the pedals, a splotch of dirt caked to her left sneaker's sole.  Your split second observations are enough to tell you that your odds of getting the giant woman's attentions are slim, but it's a risk you will have to take. Maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to get those enormous soles to stop peddling. You rush in front of the enormous bicycle, your heart pounding out of fear and determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"> \"HELP!

The wheel shows no signs of stopping, though it does wobble left and right slightly. You continue to shout for help with increasing desperation, the hopelessness of your efforts become more and more obvious. You get a brief whiff of the scent of the rubber of the tire wheel as it plows against the ground. The pedals move out of view,and the wheel quickly eclipses your world, the numerous treads smashing into the road, threatening to grind you out of existence. Your life flashes before your eyes as the bike draws nearer and nearer, and you briefly freeze up, too horrified to move, though only for a split second. You leap away from the wheel as quickly as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It's too late. The enormous tire falls down upon you. The rubbery surface pushes  you onto your side, knocking you against the dirt path you so freely walked upon before. The treads of the tire smash down onto you, pulverizing your body the moment it hits you. Your body squishes to the surface of the tire. Thanks to your jump, you manage to survive with your upper torso and head intact,  the world fading into an agonizing blur in the process. The bright crimson framework of the bike passes into your vision, its brand emblazoned onto the surface of the bike, in white, though you can't quite make it out given your current situation. It's flanked by the smooth, toned legs of the lady cyclist, beads of sweat tricking down from them. You just barely catch a glimpse of the crotch of her microshorts as the wheels rolls upward, and you catch an even briefer glimpse of her face. Earbuds. She's listening to music on her phone. You never even had a chance of getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your body remains plastered to the surface of the tire as you're sent hurtling to the ground. The dirt path rushes towards you as the tire's wheel advanced relentlessly,as if it were part of the wheels of fate. You're smashed down into the ground, this second impact proving to be your undoing. What little of you that survived the first loop around the bike's wheel is squished like a grape, dragged into a little smear, and much of  THAT smear is ground out into a streak of blood along the path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cyclist felt a slight bump as she traveled down the path, the third she's felt during the day's work-out routine. The area in front of the daycare is usually somewhat poorly kept after, so it's hardly a surprise. She doesn't even bother to glance back to check what exactly she road over. She pauses after ten minutes, the bike slowing to a halt. She kicks her bike's break to the ground and pulls out a bottle of water, gulping it down.  She  wipes her mouth clean and puts the bottle back into place, then resumes her journey, heading over to the nearest town. Days later, she winds up washing the wheels of her bike clean, getting rid of the stain for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As for the streak on the bike trail...a  Zigzagoon discovers it.

Now before you is a forest of grass, each blade like a palm tree casting shade down upon the dirt and occasional boulder.  Or as they would be known to most normal people, medium sized pebbles.  Worry flashes through your brain for a moment, but then vanishes. You would be worried that Pokemon may be roaming this tall grass, but in reality it's only tall to you.  Still, in your current situation it would be best to be cautious.  You steal your nerves, shake out your leg, and start the trek.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk is fairly uneventful, at least until you get about halfway to where to grass shortens again near the riverbank.  While you walk, storm clouds start to fill the sky, and at the halfway point it starts to rain.  Water pours from the sky, maybe a heavy drizzle for you a time ago but now each drop is a gigantic bullet of water.  You find yourself dashing from blade of grass to blade of grass, several times almost being smashed into the now soaked dirt by a rouge droplet.  You can't stay very long. Each blade bends under the weight of the droplets and a second hit on one you were under would be a cold falling blast.  Fortunately though, you find that this has greatly increased your pace of motion, and it takes you about ten minutes to clear the last half of the rush, where the grass begins to shorten again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you're faced with a new question.  Originally you were just going to the river and figuring it out from there, but now you need to find cover from the rain.  There is a fairly large tree (by normal standards, not just your new perspective) that would cover you from the rain and give you a bit of needed shelter and rest. Unfortunately, it would require dashing a fairly large distance in which you could be hit by a droplet and probably get hurt a fair amount.  On the other hand, you noticed a fairly tall pink flower just on the edge of the grass that could supply cover as well, without you having to be in shorter grass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thunderous splash comes from above, causing the blade of grass to almost touch your head.  You've been thinking too long, it's time to move.  In the heat of the moment you choose...</span></div></div>",

With your leg injury, you don't feel like you could dodge any sudden raindrops, and honestly, you've taken too many risks for one day.  You decide to take the safe route, slinking along the edge of the tall grass to reach the pink flower.  It takes you a few minutes of dashing, but soon you fling yourself against the yielding, dark purple stem of the flower.  Rain pounds down above you and you let out a sigh of relief.  Finally, after this crazy, nightmare of a day you have time to rest.  You stretch out your injured leg and lean back against the rather large stem. Stem is a bad word for it actually, it's more like a tower. It's odd, you feel like you've seen flowers like this before, with this color and shape, and this stem almost like a...body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a loud and sudden bang.  You've realized your mistake too late.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air around you is filling with a yellow fog, too quickly for you to hold your breath.  As you inhale, you're wracked with cough after cough, and can feel your body start to lock up.  At first, your fingers and toes, then your arms and legs, finally you're stuck, posed slightly curled and completely paralyzed by the Stun Spore cloud.  As the yellow fog dissipates, the \"flower\" begins to stand.  Behind you the ground rumbles as a Vileplume slowly rises, a Vileplume the size of a hotel building, red dot eyes staring at you.  The normally cute Pokemon that could barely come up to your waist loomed over you with a curious simile.  To an outside observer, this is just a cute little Pokemon observing its well earned catch.  But to you, this was a terrifying god, deciding your fate while you could do nothing to fight back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVileplume took a step forward, so that the bug she had caught was between her feet somewhat.  Even though this was dumb enough to get caught in her stun trap, you never know when the paralysis could wear off.  The bug was the most interesting she had ever seen though, very unique looking if not the brightest thing.  \"Vileplume?\" She asked, wondering if this was some kind of Pokemon she had never seen, but it didn't respond.  Her hand grabbed it roughly and tightly so it wouldn't squirm out, and opened her mouth.  A bug isn't any good if it doesn't taste as unique as it looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to scream with pain within the giant flower's hand but can't.  It's grip is too tight, causing your bones to creak and the air to be forced from your lungs as it held you before its gaping maw.  Normally it could barely eat one berry at a time but you would be pitiful compared to a berry, so it will have no trouble with you.  You can't move or scream, you simple are tossed into it's mouth like a pellet of food, directly onto its huge tongue.  Around you you can see a few small teeth. Funny, you would have never thought Vileplume would be a carnivore.  There is no time to muse however.  It's mouth shuts and you're slammed against the roof in an instant as the Pokemon starts to suckle on you, like hard candy.  Its tongue conforms to your body, coating you in thick saliva and rubs against every part of you.  Your face is ground against the roof of Vileplume's mouth, with occasional huge increases in pressure when Vileplume sucks.  The Pokemon knows you can't do anything and is going to milk you for all your flavor. Just as the spores start to wear off, you're tossed onto a row of teeth.  Facing upward, you watch the enamel above descend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVileplume was impressed by this bug!  Not only did it look cool, but it had a unique and delicious taste too!  It had both sweet and salty notes, culminating in one of her favorite tastes to date!  As she suckled on her treat, she closed her eyes and smiled, feeling the sun come out from behind the rain clouds.  What a great day for her!  She got to indulge in a tasty new kind of bug, and the nasty weather broke too!  After a few minutes of sucking, Vileplume felt the bug twitch a bit, and tossed it to the side of her mouth, bringing her teeth down a few times.  New bursts of flavor came from the critter, which gave an excellent finishing note as she swallowed.  Vileplume plopped back down on the grass, smiled, and began singing.  Maybe more of those delicious easy catches would come along.  That would make her day perfect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get to be the very best Pokemon trainer, but you got to be the very best food for this Vileplume, and that counts for something at least! For you, this is...</span></div></div>",

However, you don't get very far when the poochyena pins you down with its paw. You think that this is the end when the poochyena lifts its paw off of you. You stand up confused but decide to run now and ask questions later. As you start running again the poochyena again pins you down with its paw. It's then that you realize that it's playing with you. The poochyena ends up playing with you like this for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you have enough of this and when the poochyena lets you back up for the umpteenth time you turn around to face it planning to tell to stop this. However, before you can say anything the poochyena brings its tongue out and licks you. The poochyena smacks its lips and then licks you again. You don't like where this is going. The poochyena looks at you in different way, one that you don't like, and likes its lips. You realize with horror that the poochyena is going to eat you. You turn back around and start running for your life. Unfortunately the poochyena easily pins you down with its paw like it had done so many times before, but instead of letting you get back up this time it slurps you into its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself lying down on the poochyena's massive tongue as saliva pours over you and you are blasted by the poochyena's hot smelly breath. The poochyena licks you against the roof of its mouth and rolls you around on its tongue. This goes on for quite a while as the poochyena savors your taste. Eventually, the poochyena's tongue settles down and starts to push you towards the back of the throat. You scream as the poochyena tilts its head back and swallows you whole. You struggle in vain as you slowly travel down the esophagus. Eventually, you land in the stomach with a plop and continue your futile struggles even as the digestive jucies start to flow. You eventually pass out from exhaustion and lack of air which saves you from the painful process of digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside of the stomach the old lady in charge of the daycare gives the poochyena a stern lecture about eating the toys.

A yelp escaped your mouth as you stumble back from the shocking sight before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vul!\" the pokemon says in a rather cheery tone as six orange furred tails wag behind in unison. You couldn't believe just how this situation took a turn for the worse as you stood in front of the massive vulpix's face. \"e-errrr e-easy now.\" you stammer in hopes that this giant fox was able to understand you. The vulpix curiously tilts it's head to the right as if attempting to acknowledge your gesture and request. Within moments however it closes it's eyes and lets out another happy yip as its head began to loom downwards straight for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStricken with fear, you simple huddle up in a protective ball hoping with all your might that whatever was to come wouldn't be so painful. To your ultimate surprise, there was no sense of pain at all. no broken bones, no crushing, though you did manage to feel an extremely soft, warm surface huddle upon your side slowly moving rhythmically. As you shakily look upwards, to your shock the ginormous vulpix was gently nuzzling your tiny body with her left cheek. A long sigh soon escapes your mouth realizing that this pokemon meant no ill will towards you. As your body slowly began to lose its tenseness from earlier, the great vulpix continues to nuzzle your side while giving out low yet audible murrs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"h-hey now.\" you say as you couldn't help but chuckle and gently attempt to move her huge face away from your body. Within seconds, it soon returns it's head upwards to gaze down at you.

Upon impacting the ground, you nearly manage to fall flat on your rump from the force of her paws, though luckily manage to keep a steady footing. \"What's with the leap?\" You ask in utter confusion as you try to steady yourself up again. The Vulpix immediately lowers her head, as her six orange tails wag feverishly behind her. In seconds, her huge black nose stands before you as her hot breath blows past you in a rhythmic fashion. Just by the expression on her face, it was clear she was filled with an unprecedented happiness. Though, the reason for said happiness was still a mystery to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you ask, unsure why the Vulpix lowered her head down once again. \"Vul!\" she cries out once more before quickly turning tail and running off. \"h-hey!\" you shout watching as she makes off to the far side of a grassy patch. At first, you were contemplating whether or not you should run off in search for help over your strange size problem. However, reality soon kicked that idea right out of our head, when you remembered all the dangers lurking about. Even, if you did manage to avoid the now HUMONGOUS Pok\u00e9mon wandering about, there was no telling what fate would await if you encountered an oblivious person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around a second or so, you soon manage to see the Vulpix running back with some sort of round object in her mouth. Upon closer inspection, you soon identify it as an old withered ball. Once the vulpine Pok\u00e9mon finally returns to you, she opens her jaws to let the ball fall down mere yards away from you. \"Vulpix.\" she cries as she uses her nose to slowly roll the balls towards you. Not wanting to end up getting pinned under the sphere, you quickly take a step back to the side to avoid the oncoming ball. Judging by the current state of the toy, it seemed as if this Vulpix must've found it lying about somewhere. That or in worst case scenario, she was abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze up at the ball, her intentions finally became clear. \"You want to play?\" you ask while gazing up at her amber eyes. \"Vul!\" she cries out happily once more as her tails begin to wag.

As your body came into contact with surfaces that were both solid and squishy alike, your entire body was soon soaked within the great fox pokemon's saliva. After gasping from the dizzying set of actions, to you ultimate shock you began to feel the whole inside begin to tilt downwards.

Not that you are struggling anyway, knowing that falling from such height could mean your end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta flies outside the cave that, from what you can see, is actually a sort of temple situated on the sea. Meloetta flies  away from the temple and into a near forest, while the structure sinks in the depths of the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill firmly hold by Meloetta, you notice her flying up on a tree and sitting down. She stares at you for a bit, wondering what to do with you. After a bit, she gives you a long lick, tasting you.<br>\r\n\"Lo me!\" she literally sings, pleased by your unique taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat mixes with the saliva that stuck to your face as you pray that the Melody doesn't want to turn you into food. Meloetta is deciding what to do with you. Your taste is incredible, she could make a great snack out of you. But then... when the opportunity to keep a tiny human for herself will happen again? Very probably never. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long and hard decision, Meloetta looks at you and smiles...</span></div></div>",

And when will the chance to keep a tiny human happen again? Not in a short time, maybe never. Maybe that's the only chance she got. And decides to take it. Plus, you'll be surely more useful to her as alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the thinking, huge pokemon. Your heart is racing, the fear of what she wants to do with you keeps you paralyzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for the Melody pokemon to fix her attention to you. A slight smile crosses her white lips as she stares at you happily. Then, she starts moving you towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing she wants to eat you, you close your eyes, waiting for your doom. Which never happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the green headed pokemon pushes you into her cheek and nuzzles you.<br>\r\n\"Lo me! Lo me!\" she says in a singsong voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you can't understand a single word, you get that you're going to live... at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on the branch, the Meloetta holds you in front of her face.
