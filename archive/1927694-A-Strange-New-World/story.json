You immediately begin to wonder how you got to New York, but as you look closer, you see that this isn't the NYC you know. All of the inhabitants of the city appear to be humanoid animals! They walk like humans, have five fingers and five toes (You know this because a few of them aren't wearing shoes). But at the same they have fur all over their bodies according to the animal they are and the thing that worried you the most were the claws that some of them were carrying. After making all of these observations you then make another disturbing discovery... none of them are moving because they're all looking at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hear a lot of mixed questions from the crowd, the most common of which were 'a human?' and 'where'd it come from?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were worried to say the least but unsure of what to do. Eventually, a female wolf in a police uniform came through the crowd followed by several other officers you assume as they all had 'POLICE' in bold print on all of their vests and uniforms. The wolf, who seemed to be the one in charge, approached you slowly. She looked at you up and down in astonishment. It was at this point that you realized that she actually stood somewhere around ten or eleven feet tall while most of the creatures were only about eight or nine feet tall. There where a few around her height, but not many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Seeing this the wolf sighs before standing up to her full height again. \"I guess he doesn't understand...\" She then turns to a pair of leopards \"You two, bring him with us, we're returning to headquarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At that point you decided playing the 'blind and the lame' was no longer a good idea. The whole point of doing that was so that you could stay out of a lab or prison cell, and it turns out that your going to end up there anyway. Just as the leopards approach, you decide that it's time to go. You bolt between them and dive into the crowd. After you disappear into the crowd you stay on the ground in order to avoid being seen, because you know that even the slowest of them is easily faster than any human track runner, and while you were pretty fast... you knew that any one of them could catch you if you ran in the open. So you crawled through the assortment of paws, talons and occasionally tails as you went along. Eventually you reached the outside of the crowd. A few of which spotted you and started calling for the police to come and get you. However, you didn't stick around for them to arrive. You ran down the sidewalk and hoped that your head start would give you the advantage. It did for a while but it didn't take long for them to find out where you'd gotten to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Get him!\" The wolf called as she and the leopards came after you. You ran by several of the strange creatures as you went down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is stupid\" You muttered to yourself \"There's no way I'll out run them, I need to level the playing field.\" Seeing a building with a  revolving door to your right you decide that if top speed and size is their advantage, you decide to take that away from them you need an enclosed space. So you enter the building getting a few surprised gasps as you do. Suddenly you realize, you don't know where to go next, as your eyes dart around, you find that your actually in a hotel lobby. Glancing around you find the elevators. You sprint towards the elevator and slap the button, the doors open shortly after and to your surprise, its empty. You then turn around and start jamming the button for the fourth floor. You knew if you were going to escape, you would need to get yourself back down to the ground fast without breaking your legs, winding yourself or tripping. As the door for the elevator closed the wolf and her leopard officers had just entered the hotel. They turned just in time to see the doors closing in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's in the elevator!\" One of the leopards shouted as she pointed at the elevator you where in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's not as primitive as he wants us to believe...\" The wolf noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How can you tell?\" The other leopard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He knew how to work the elevator and he knew exactly what it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both of her subordinates were surprised but realized that this was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, you were now on the third floor and watching your back like your life depends on it, and for all you know, it does. You find a window at the end of the hallway your in. Quickly and cautiously, you made your way to the window and looked down to find a street view. You hadn't noticed it before, but apparently their idea of transportation wasn't too different from the world you knew. They had, garbage trucks, semis, sports cars, and anything else you would find in the human version of, well, the world. As you were observing the public transportation system of this world you felt something behind you. Before you could turn around you heard a feminine but commanding voice shout \"FREEZE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turned around slowly to find the wolf and her two officers approaching you from behind you. While she remained unarmed as far as you could tell, the two leopards were pointing what you assumed to be handguns at you. You slowly put your hands up in a surrendering fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmhmm... that's what I thought\" The wolf said as she approached you \"You're not as dumb as you want us to believe. You can understand me cant you?\" You narrowed your eyes and grunted in response knowing that they were on to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, cat's out of the bag. So what are ya gonna do now?</span></div></div>",

The strong-willed Kiba may be cooperating, but not just with anyone, and deep in your gut you feel that them pointing... whatever they have in their... paws, at you, is not a good start. However the wolf may be disgruntled, she hasn't made any aggressive moves towards you. She has only pointed out you were smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being taken to the station for questioning.\" She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You repeat. The context of 'being taken in for questioning' was completely and utterly wrong. \"You just found out that I'm intelligent, likewise, and as you said before, you don't <i>really</i> know what I am, a mythical thingy to you. Do you even know what I can do?\" You continue. The wolf looks at her officers for reassurance as they adjust themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the wolf could speak, you continued. \"I'm willing to cooperate, but don't take that as a 'best friends' thing; I've just discovered a new species for myself- literally every living, breathing thing I've passed so far seems to be different. I don't know where I am, and you don't know how dangerous I am-\" the wolf motioned for her officers to move forward. \"so don't come closer, yet.\" You sigh as you finish your sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a threat?\" The wolf responded, then shook her head, \"Fine, when we get to the station, I'll explain a bit.\" The leopards look at the wolf and then back to you. They are about four feet away from you. Her wording sounded off, as if she didn't even take the hint that she should be cautious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey- what do I look like to you? I don't look like anyone here, and I'm shorter, and different. No caution whatsoever? Just gonna, oh, take a mythical thingy in for 'questioning'?\" You said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me how to do my job- just-\" She sighs. One leopard pulls out a handcuff, and then realizes you won't fit, and you'll just slip out of it. So you're just guided between a triad of animals.</span></div></div>",

He notices a garbage truck about to pass by, and thinks to himself \"Am I really considering this?\" A second after he thinks that, he launches himself out of the window. Now free falling down to what seems like certain death, he lands on top of the garbage truck with surprisingly great accuracy and breaks his fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe i just did that and survived\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the wolf and her constituents are in absolute shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he just....?\" one of the leopards started to say in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he did\" the wolf interrupted in an annoyed tone. \"We have to find that human and fast. We have no idea what he's crazy enough to do... (sigh) this is going to be more complicated than i anticipated.\" the wolf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my arm\" Kiba said while riding atop the garbage truck. He had already traveled about 6 miles on the truck and nobody had noticed. That was partly due to the fact that he had disguised himself with the many unique trash items piled around him. It was a very disgusting place to be, especially because the smell itself could make someone pass out, but it was a much better alternative to the prison cell he could be in right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope i didn't break it\" Kiba said under his breath. \"I need to get home. I don't know how i ended up here but i have a feeling this has to do with something bigger than me.\" Kiba thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as he finished thinking that, the garbage truck came to a hard stop. It had arrived at what seemed to be a landfill of some sort. It was dark outside by now so it wasn't all too easy to see. It definitely looked like a landfill though. The only weird thing about it though was on the far left side. It almost looked like a large modern style house. It was completely white with more than enough windows wrapping around what seemed to be a living room. An extensive marbled driveway adorned by a perfectly symmetrical row of detailed topiary. It even had a grand infinity pool on the right side! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of person could possibly live in such a nice house right next to a landfill?\" Kiba thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was observing the grand house, Kiba notices a limo driving up the marbled driveway to the front doors of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that?\" Kiba thought to himself as he was trying to straighten himself out of his crouched position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the limo had appeared to be a nine tailed fox in a business outfit. She was even bigger than the wolf he had been encountered by earlier, only by a couple of feet, and she gave off a cold aura. Her golden eyes were masked by a set of frameless, oval shaped reading glasses which had a light tent of purple. She wore purple business slacks and a blazer to match, her foot paws could be seen poking out of the bottom of each pant leg. Under the blazer, she had a white shirt and purple tie. Her hair was brunette and stopped at about her shoulders. Behind her, nine regal tails swayed about in a calm yet unsettling manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe very confidently walked from the limo to the front doors of what appeared to be her house. Instead of opening the doors and going right into her house though, she stopped right as she touched the door handle and gazed in your direction. Afraid of being seen, Kiba resumes his crouched position but just because he can't see that well, doesn't mean he can't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Is something wrong miss?\" the <br>\r\nchauffeur asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Hugo... But do you ever get the feeling that someone is watching you?\" she asked the chauffeur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am\" said Hugo the chauffeur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you wouldn't\" said the fox in a rushed tone \"nevermind me, you're dismissed for the day\" the fox said as she opened the door to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you ma'am\" Hugo said as he turned to get back into the limo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the fox was inside her house and the chauffeur had driven off, Kiba straightened himself again. The garbage truck revved it's engines and began to move forward into the landfill. After scoping out the area and observing that there was no one else out and about, Kiba decided to jump out of the garbage truck into a nearby pile of garbage. He scanned the area around him, looking for something useful, and happened to find an old mattress propped up against a pile of garbage. It even had a small makeshift canopy built over it. Kiba looked around once more to see if whomever built this still lived there. After waiting in a nearby pile for about fifteen minutes, Kiba concluded that it was safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it wouldn't hurt to camp out here until the morning.\" Kiba reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, he went to go sit up on the old but surprisingly comfortable mattress and unintentionally dozed off into a light sleep.</span></div></div>",

A grey and black raccoon was watching him with an expression that could only be described as suspicious. He was wearing a dirty blue t-shirt and denim blue jeans. He looked like he would've been a couple of years older tan Kiba. But it was hard to tell, given the species gap. He had black fur around his hands and eyes. His tell had stripes of both grey and black fur like you'd expect to find on most raccoons. His eyes were brown and his fur was mangy and unkempt. \"What in the world do you think you are?\" The raccoon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um... human?\" Kiba replied, unsure of the reaction he might get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Human, huh? Never heard of one of those.

A thought then crossed his mind <i>\"This raccoon may be a bit crazy. But he probably knows more about what's going on around here than I do...</i> Kiba then turned to the raccoon, \"Actually, I was wondering if you could tell me who lives in that house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The raccoon gave you a perplexed look, \"You mean that mansion? That's Mayor Deluma's place. Everybody knows that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba shrugged and chuckled awkwardly, \"Sorry, I'm not from around here. I'm trying to get home and I was wondering if she could help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I guess that would be why I've never seen an anthro like you before.

Was he a criminal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't know,\" The raccoon replied as he shrugged his shoulders, \"But I don't have time to be answering these questions about things that concern city folk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Er... okay?\" Kiba shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can stay here for now, but don't think your gonna live here. I got family coming into town tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see,\" Kiba muttered, \"Then I'll be on my way by the end of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The raccoon nodded, \"Hmph, see that ya are!

She had brown skin with a white underbelly. Several sharp teeth lined her maw while a rather sleek and subtle find protruded from her back.overall she had a rather slim and sleek form. But it was also clear that she was also a predator. From the large hands with clawed fingertips to the golden eyes that seemed to pierce through time itself, every feature on her told Kiba he did not want her to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The human watched and waited.

Turning to see if he'd been spotted, he found the shark was still in the water busy with her swimming. Kiba quietly crept away from the door and found himself in a lavish living room. Bookcases lined the walls, a massive home theatre system served as the centerpiece, several marble statues stood around the room in various enclaves and recesses; some of which were actually of Deluma herself it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Conceited much?\" Kiba asked under his breath as he eyes the one of the statues.

He cast another glance toward the back door to make sure that he the shark woman was still outside. The splashes in the pool indicated that she was still swimming and he was clear to head up. The human ascended the stairs like lithely and silently as though he were only a shadow. Upon reaching the top of the stairs he found himself at the end of a large and long hallway. Their were two door on either side and one at the very end. He then realized that he was standing in the center of another intersecting hallway, putting two more doors two his right and left at. Each about thirty feet away. There were a total of seven rooms to search up on this floor alone. But the Kiba also knew that he wouldn't have to search all of them, he just had to search until he found the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Given the layout of this hallway and how conceited and prideful Deluma seems to be, I'd bet that it's that door at the end of the hall,\"</i> He thought as he made his way towards the door. Every few steps he'd check behind him, fearing that the shark or Deluma herself might make an unannounced visit. After what felt like several minutes, he made it to the door only to find it locked. Jiggling the knob and putting a little force behind the door he realized very quickly that he wasn't going to get in that way. \"Argh.... what now?\" He muttered as he leaned against the wall and shut his eyes to think. However, he found it difficult to do so with The air conditioner blowing just behind him. His eyes then shot open as he spun around. A tall wooden cabinet sat in the wall in front of him, and below it, there was a large grate. Feeling around the edges and looking at the frame itself, the human realized that it was a pop-out, meaning with enough force he could pry the grate off and replace it without anybody knowing. He positioned his fingers in the grate in an attempt to pull it off using his nails to grip it, but quickly realized there was a far better chance of him ripping his nails of than pulling the grate out. He sat and thought for a moment before his eyes lit up with an idea. Feeling his pockets he reached in and found what he was hoping he still had; his keys. Using his keychain bottle opener, he pried the right side of the grate off. After working his fingers under the frame he was able to easily pop the grate out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking into the cool, dark hole he took in a breath of air, \"Here we go,\" he murmured as he climbed in sideways. He then pulled the grate up with the arm closest to it and used both hands, gripping it with his finger nails, to pull it loosely back into its slot. He then turned to begin crawling down the dark passage. Inside the duct it was cool, dark, loud and windy. Kiba moved along slowly, feeling out a few feet ahead of himself as he moved along. The metal floor felt grimy and cool to his touch as he crawled painfully along with his knees digging into the steel that lie beneath him. He suddenly came to a halt when his hand struck a metal wall. He then felt the airflow change as it was now also being drawn in from his left and his right. \"The air is different here, its being drawn up. Looking to either side of him he saw a light on each end. He opted to turn left, given that from his position outside the vent that seemed to be where the office vent would have been located. After a few seconds he makes it to the vent grate and starts to push it out. When the vent grate falls to the floor with a less than quiet 'Clang' Kiba finds...</span></div></div>",

He needed to be in Deluma\u2019s office not her bedroom. He turned to go back into the vent before he paused. He began to think that maybe this wasn\u2019t a <i>total</i> waste. After all, most people kept their valuables close. Some people even slept with there most treasured keepsakes under their pillow. After the thought lingered in his mind for a moment, Kiba began tearing into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dThere has to be something,\u201d He muttered. He checked the closet, the dresser drawers, the rugs and even under the pillow and found nothing. The human ran a hand through his hair as he stared at the mess that he had made. In all his effort he didn\u2019t turn up a single useful clue that could help him. He was still just as confused and lost as he was the night before, only now he was actually in the bedroom of the person that was hunting for him. Figuring the best thing to do would be to cover his tracks, Kiba began putting everything back the way it was when he found it. It took time, but eventually he finished. Just as he was turning to leave, he froze. He found the shark woman from earlier standing in the doorway with a toothy grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dHiya!\u201d She says in a bright and pleasant tone. Her hair is black with orange highlights and hung down at shoulder length, while her eyes have an orange color along with slitted pupils. She was tall, far taller than you were. She was seven feet tall, at least. Of course, that was about how tall Deluma was so no surprise there. A large tail could be seen swaying behind her while she flexed her webbed hands along with her clawed digits at the end of them. \u201cSeems you were busy,\u201d The woman continued, \u201cIt\u2019s rather inapropriate to go through someone else\u2019s belongings without permission. Though, it is nice that you cleaned up after yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba remained on edge, he inched along the wall. Trying to keep his distance from her while slowly making his way to the vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The shark smirked and casually swung her tail to the side before resting it against the vent. \u201cWhat\u2019re you gonna do now?\u201d She asked as Kiba scowled at her. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d consider giving yourself up? That would be the more reasonable thing to do, but after what I saw on the news last night I doubt that you\u2019ll be doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba sighed, \u201cOkay, you caught me,\u201d Ray sighed as he began walking towards the shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The shark frowned somewhat putout by the sudden surrender, \u201cWell... that was dissapointing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, no sooner than the words left her lips did Kiba throw a pillow at her face. Reacting out of instinct the shark caught it while Kiba dove head first and slid between her legs and out of the bedroom door. Of course, it doesn\u2019t take long for the large predator to register what\u2019s happened, but by the time she does, Kiba is already halfway down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The shark runs to the first step before stopping and taking a few steps back. By now, Kiba is almost down to the last step when a rush of wind and large shadow glide overhead. The predator that he thought he had outsmarted was now crouched in front of him at the bottom of the stairs. She grinned at him in an almost playful manner, \u201cWhat else do you have up your sleeve?\u201d She asked as she took a step toward him. Kiba bolted over the side of the railing and made a run for the back door. He could hear the aquatic huntress chasing behind him as he ran through the house. He reached the backdoor and turned the handle. But just as he opened the door, a large gray hand planted itself on the door above his head and slammed it shut. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave now! We\u2019re just starting to have some fun!\u201d The shark chuckled. The human turrned to run off again but found himself caught by his shirt collar. \u201cNow then, I think we should get to know each other better...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, she soon remembered that she was in a public setting and on duty. She knew that you were an incredible discovery (to them at least) and this was history in the making for her world, but as an officer, duty came first. She took a brief moment to compose herself before regarding you once more. \"I have to take you into custody now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up at the wolf dubiously, \"Custody?\" You ask, \"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf, seeing you were frightened, tried to calm you, \"it's not that you've done anything wrong, it's just that I'm concerned that some of the less civilized or more questionable citizens here in this city may take advantage of you being defenseless and disoriented.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see....\" You reply confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" The wolf gave a gentle smile and stood back up to her full height.

The crowd and officers turn to see who had spoken. Not far from where you were, a limo had pulled up, the back door was already open and standing before you in a business outfit was a nine tailed fox. She was even bigger than Luna, only by a couple of feet, and she gave of a cold aura. Her golden eyes were masked by a set of frameless, oval shaped reading glasses which had a light tent of purple. she wore purple business slacks and a blazer to match, her foot paws could be seen poking out of the bottom of each pant leg. Under the blazer, she had a white shirt and purple tie. Her hair was brunette and stopped about at her shoulders. Behind her, nine regal tails swayed about in a calm yet unsettling manor. Her voice was very smooth and calm, yet it had a powerful resonance behind it. \"Allow me to introduce myself; I am Silvia Deluma, and I own everything in this city and the region around it.... Including you,\" She stated with a toothy smile. She then leveled her head and peered down on you through her glasses while extending a hand toward you, palm up, \"and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(From this point on you will become one of three characters, each of which has a different personality and skillset)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba Lockheart- Adventurous and very athletic, hates to be contained and loves to explore. He's kind to everyone he meets unless they're hostile towards him. He has a strong will and never backs down from a challenge no matter the odds. Though headstrong and very defiant at times he can be smart and rather strategic which sometimes surprises those he meets given his typical behavior. He also has a very curious natur which more often than not gets him into trouble. He tends to be a 'solitary tiger' or 'lone wolf' for the most part having trust issues from previous experiences. However, just because he doesn't like socializing doesn't mean he doesn't know how, and once his trust is gained, he opens up willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil D'laundie- Cautious and reserved, he's a very peaceful person by nature and has a sense of humor that can be seen even in the face of a dire situation. He likes to problem solve and sometimes actually invents devices out of whatever he can find to aid him. Despite the fact that he likes to avoid fighting, he isn't afraid to fight if he has to defend himself. He's very modest and easygoing, but hates dishonesty and won't tolerate anyone pushing him around. While he can be curious, he also has a strong sense of caution that will prioritizes his well being over indulging his curiosity. He also is a lot less likely to start a fight that he can't win than he is to surrender and wait for his opportunity to turn the tables. He's not incredibly social as he tends to be shy around new people, but he warms up to most after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra Westfield- A strong willed and high strung girl who comes from a family of acrobats. While she never actively took up the family business, she still retains her skills as a gymnast. She's very sarcastic when she becomes annoyed (which happens frequently) but she's also smarter than she seems. Having been through many survival training courses (she has an ex-marine grandpa) she is most at home in the woods. If she's faced with a fight or flight situation, she's more likely to run. When she chooses to fight, she likes to fight on her own turf in an area she either knows well or has prepped beforehand. She's a bit of a loner so she lacks social skills but she's not at all a lone wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm giving you one last chance to follow my orders before I decide to have <i>you</i> arrested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna started to open her mouth to protest, but instead she closed it before sighing. \"Let the record show that I strongly disagree with you're actions,\" she stated sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Noted, now get on with it\" Deluma snapped with a dismissive wave as she turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna turned to face you and knelt down to you, \"I'm sorry,\" She whispered. \"But this is the only way I can help you for now...\" She put a pair of handcuffs around you're hands but left them unlocked. You looked up at her confused. \"As soon as you're told, make a run for it. Find someplace you can stay hidden, I'll find you when I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But where am I supposed to go?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna gave you a warm smile, \"I have faith in you my little human. It's been said that you're kind are clever and adaptive, though physically inferior to our kind. I sense that you are not one to give up easily... you'll find a way.\" Luna then turned to a female Doberman anthro and motioned for her to come. When she reached you, Luna whispered something in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I understand Captain, I'll take care of it\" The Doberman replied before walking over to you. She was a head shorter than Luna, but still two heads taller than you. She grasped your arm and walked you toward what looked like a prison van. You resisted, not wanting to go without a fight. The Doberman officer looked down at you with a small smile, \"Tell me human, do you really think you can fight against my strength?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll never know unless I try\" You growl at her, \"Besides, you  don't scare me! I refuse to just roll over and admit defeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doberman's smile faded and was replaced by a stern frown, \"That attitude could be the death of you,\" She warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not ready to die,\" you admit causing the Doberman to tilt her head in curiosity, \"But I'm not afraid to die either! I'm not so attached to the fear of dying that I'm willing to live in submission. I'll keep fighting and surviving right to the bitter end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doberman actually looks shocked at your words. After a few seconds pass, she cracks a wry grin, \"I can see why the Captain likes you so much! You're so high spirited... its amazing really. I really do hope we get to see each other again.\" The Doberman continues to walk you towards the van, but just before she gets there, she pushes you while at the same time yanking the cuffs off of your wrists. You turn around dumbfounded, but you then realize what was happening. She was going to free you all along, she was simply testing you, trying to see what you would do if she bullied you a little. \"Now's the time to run,\" She advised. \"Oh, and Mercy! I expect you to remember that word the next time we meet... Kiba Lockheart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stare back at her wondering why she would say that, \"But what does that have anything to do with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The human's escaped!\" The Doberman called, \"I need backup!\" She then turned to you and gave you a small smile as if to say 'good luck.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nod to her and turn to run down the street as several German Shepard officers come chasing after you. <i>\"I'll never out run them on a long stretch like this, gotta level the playing field\"</i> You think to yourself as you duck into an alley. The alley was slightly narrow, but nowhere near narrow enough to stop you're pursuers. You then spot a fire escape on the side of one of the buildings you're between. Deciding its your best chance of escape, you leap into the air and cling to it before climbing it like your life depended on it, which it kinda did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's on the fire escape!\" One of the officers shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't let him get away!\" Cried another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you climb the escape, you immediately notice a problem, these fire escapes were designed for anthros, and as such their bigger and the bars you're using to climb were spaced much further apart which in turn slowed you down. The German Shepards on the other hand were having no problem at all and gaining on you. You think you're in trouble until you notice an open maintenance grate at the top of the escape. When you make it through the grate, you slam it shut behind you and take off you belt to tie it shut to the top of the escape, double knotting it for safe measure. \"That outta hold'em for a while,\" You mutter before running off across the rooftop, with only the moonlight shinning on you're back. Coming up on a gap between the buildings you leap across the gap, tucking and rolling as you hit the ground on the next rooftop over. \"Huh, who know that freerunning would actually save my life?\" You pant while looking over your shoulder expecting the police to be on you're trail soon. As if on cue, you hear an echoing snap and a resounding metal clang behind you. You knew that they'd broken through you're makeshift lock and they'd be hot on you're tail within the minute. Unfortunately, you were so busy looking behind you that you failed to see the skylight in the roof in front of you. You tripped over the edge of the skylight before falling though it. You fell into what looked like a grocery store, but that wasn't the biggest thing on you're mind at the moment. You came crashing down on a shelf towards the back of the store. The force of your body falling on the shelf caused it to collapse, but it did break your fall. You lay on the ground staring up at the window you fell through while surrounded by the remains of the shelf and bits of broken glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You survived the fall, but the question is, how bad are you hurt?</span></div></div>",

You knew that you'd seriously hurt your ribs, if you were fortunate it was just a bruise, worst case scenario? You'd broken a rib or two. Your upper back probably had a scrape or cut somewhere on it. It probably wasn't too deep, but the blood you were leaking would make it pretty easy for those German Shepherds to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While you were still counting your problems and figuring a plan, yet another problem cropped up. A loud squeak signaled a door opening which was followed by a click.

You grimaced as you held your right hand over your rib cage and broke into a light jog. You were coming up on what you thought was an exit when the door you were headed for was flung open. Another anthro stood in the doorway, but you dashed to the left and down one of the aisles before you got a good look at it. \"Oh, this just keeps getting better and better,\" You growl to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey!\" The male voice called out, \"Any sign of 'em from your end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nothing yet, but somebody's definitely here,\" A female voice replied.

You creep down to the end of the aisle and get ready to turn the corner when you see her, the anthro that was standing in the doorway from before. She wasn't looking in your direction at the moment. From what you could tell, she was definitely not your average everyday anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you escaped the police, but you're not out of the woods yet. Out of the frying pan and into the fire. Question is, what kind of anthro is hunting you now and more importantly, can you get away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing her hesitation and snapping back into reality, you decided that now would be a good time to run. You stumble as you turn to run up the aisle in the opposite direction. Of course, this action causes the dragon to snap back to her senses before she begins chasing you down. You come to the end of the aisle before you make a sharp left turn.

You keep low to the ground as you weave around displays and clothing racks. You hear the dragon's footsteps slow and then stop. <i>\"She's waiting for me to make a move,\"</i> You thought as you sat still under a circular clothing rack. <i>\"Now what?

After what seemed like an eternity of sliding around corners and running down dark aisles, Terra found the emergency exit at the back of the store. She slammed into the door and flung it open. You followed close behind. The back of the store led out into a dried up drainage canal bathed in moonlight. On the other side of the canal sat a quiet neighborhood. To the right was what looked like a sizable park  and to the left was a large chainlink fence that ran across the canal. Behind it was the edge of the canal and the back side of several buildings like the one you'd just come out of.</span></div></div>",

You try to muster the strength to get up but before you can attempt it again you hear voices and footsteps coming towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm telling you I know what I heard, something definitely broke over here\" A somewhat deep feminine voice insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And I'm telling you that you're imagining things\" A lighter feminine voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not good...\" You mutter as you groan and attempt to sit up yet again. through much pain and effort you manage to get yourself into a sitting position. You then crawl to the nearest shelf (that's still standing) and start using it to claw you're way back to your feet. It's then you notice that you're pant leg has deep red streams running down it, which indicated that you were bleeding. You're shirt also hat a blotch of blood on you're left forearm. \"That's just great...\" You mutter. You start trying to get yourself as far away from the voices as you can but  you can barely walk, let alone run. Before you even make it out of the aisle, someone turns the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll bet its those rotten kids again.... no good pups with no discipline, always getting into trouble,\" The deeper voice speculates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're probably right,\" The second voice sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your almost around the corner, but before you can make it, the two anthros round the corner. Both of them stare at you wide eyed and shocked. One is a polar bear. She's dressed in black jeans and a red t-shirt. Here eyes are blue and she had blonde hair the flowed down to her shoulders. She had to round ears on top of her head and a black nose at the end of her thick snout. Her body in general was thick, but evenly proportioned. The other anthro was a red fox. She had golden eyes and black hair tied back in a ponytail. Like the bear she also had a black nose at the tip of her snout. However she was nowhere near as thick as the bear was and was also considerably shorter. She had two pointed ears at the top of her head and a long bushy tail that at the moment seemed to lay still. She was wearing a white, pinstriped button up shirt with black pants and a red apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that what I think it is or is it just me?\" The polar bear asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well if you're imagining it then so am I...\" The fox replied as they continued to stare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a moment, you forget that you're injured and try to run. You're only able to take a couple of steps before you fall to the ground and cry out in pain. You try to get up again but you just can't find the strength, so you begin crawling. You don't make it far though before the bear and fox come up on either side of you. The fox got on her knees beside your head and ever so slowly, she reached out to touch your arm. Seeing this, you irritably clenched your teeth and grunted at her before moving you're arm away from her. But you winced as this caused you pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Calm down!\" The fox chided, \"You're hurt, let me take a look at you.\" She reached out again and gently grabbed your arm before pulling back the sleeve a carefully as she could. She gasped as she looked at you're injured appendage... must've been worse than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's not good at all...\" the bear said as she watched the fox look over you're wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can we help him?\" The fox asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't think he trusts us... Or wants our help. Besides, the police are going to show up here any minute for him anyway. I can hear the sirens as we speak... he was probably running from them to begin with\" The bear sighed as she crossed her arms \"I can only imagine that Deluma gave the orders for his capture, she's all about exploiting rare opportunities and what rarer of an opportunity than to get you're hands on a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well we can't just hand him over to them!\" The fox exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And why not?\" The bear asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know what they'll do to him! They'll lock him up in some secret lab and poke him and prod him. He'll never see the light of day again!\" The fox cried as she grabbed you by your torso and held you against her own. \"The poor thing can't even walk, there's no way he can defend himself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bear stared at the fox, and then you... \"Man... having a conscience can be a real pain...\" She sighed. \"Do you think you can keep him at you're place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fox shrugged, \"I don't see why not. My mom would be happy to help me look after him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok, let's get him to the delivery van. We'll hide him in one of the long boxes.\" The bear knelt down and carefully scooped you up in her arms. She as she carried you to another part of the store your vision began to darken. She glanced down at you and apparently noticed you were losing consciousness, \"You'd better not die on us, if you conk out, you'd better wake up again.\" That was all you heard before you passed out into a dreamless sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next morning you stir in your sleep, your eyes flutter open... but where do you find yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It doesn't take you long to figure out you're in a bedroom. It's pretty basic, there's a dresser, a nightstand and of course the bed you're sleeping in. You  realize the bed you're in is huge, definitely not for someone you size. You throw the covers off of yourself, you find your midsection, left arm and your leg have been bandaged while your shirt has been removed. \"I don't understand, why would they help me?\" You ask yourself.  You try to sit up, but the pain it causes makes you want to just lie still. <i>\"I can't do that!\"</i> you think to yourself as you continue to push yourself up through the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The door to the bedroom opens and the fox from the night before is standing in the doorway, when she sees you a panicked expression crosses her face. \"What are you doing!?\" She demands as she rushes to the bedside, \"You can't sit up yet! You need to rest!\" She gently places a paw on your chest and gradually adds pressure, trying to coax you back down. However, you resist not wanting to lay down or succumb. Obviously the fox sees that she's causing you pain (most likely from your facial expressions) but she also sees that you're not going to lay down willingly. She glances around the room before doing the only thing she can think of, \"MOM!\" she shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Within seconds, a white arctic fox comes running up to the doorway. \"What's wrong sweetie?\" She asks. She as brown eyes and long black hair, like the fox sitting next to you she also has two pointed ears sticking out of her hair which is let down over her shoulders unlike her daughter's ponytail. Another difference you notice is that she has two tails instead of one. She's dressed in a blue t-shirt and black jeans with her paws at the bottom of each pant leg. From your point of view it looked like she had a few inches on her daughter in height, which meant she was somewhere around eight and a half feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm trying to get him to lay back down but he just won't! The more I try to force him the harder he pushes!\" The younger fox frantically explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh? It seems we have a fighter on our hands don't we?\" Her mother replied with a smile. \"Here, let me handle it sweetheart,\" She says as she walks over and replaces her daughter at the bedside. You start to give her a defiant glare but she just smiles and wraps one of each of her tails around your wrists and gently starts to slide your hands forward. Slowly but surely, the pressure of your upper body weight is being shifted to your back and abdomen. You can't maintain your upright position and slowly start to lay back. You fight it though, tightening your stomach muscles to slow your decent to the mattress like a wrestler refusing to be pinned. \"My, my... you are a feisty one aren't you? It's no wonder that you survived that fall with a spirit like yours!\" The white fox chuckled. \"Lay down and rest, no one's going to cause you harm here. We'll take care of you, you've done a fine job of surviving. It's time to rest now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her words were so gentle, but you didn't know who she was or where you were. There where questions that had to be answered, you couldn't afford to sleep yet. Unfortunately, you found that your body was agreeing with the fox woman. \"No... I can't sleep... Deluma will... find me...\" You moaned trying to resist the urge to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The white fox shook her head and laid your head on the pillow before putting a finger to your lips, \"Shhh... she won't find you, not if we have anything to say about it... now sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Have to... keep moving...\" You murmured before once again, succumbing to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have to say...\" The white fox said as she stood up, \"He's quite the feisty fighter. I've seen quite a few strong willed kids in my time but none like this one. And he's a human no less, I must admit that if I were in his shoes I would have surrendered long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should've seen him last night! He actually tried to run from us!\" The younger fox exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her mother shook her head, \"The poor thing, he's been trying so hard to survive and stay ahead of the Deluma and her police that he's run himself ragged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm going to stay and watch him in case he wakes up again,\" The red fox stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think that would be wise, who knows what he would attempt if we didn't watch him. I'll go and see if I can make him something to eat\" The white fox decided as she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow soon do you wake up? A few hours or the following afternoon?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sit straight up in the bed and not too long after that, pain begins coursing through your body. You groan in pain putting you're weight on your good arm's elbow to support yourself. The red fox rushes over immediately and gently tries to lay you back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shh... You're okay, just lay back down...\" She says as she uses one paw to support you're back and the other to carefully press on your chest to force you back down. You decide at this point, if they wanted to hurt you or turn you over that they would have done that by now. Of course, that still doesn't mean that you trust them... not completely anyway. Once you're down again the fox stands up straight and looks down at you with compassion in her eyes. \"So... are you hungry?\" She asks. You don't say anything and look away from her but she persists, \"Do you have a name?\" She asks. You continue to look away from her quietly, \"I heard you talk already right before mom put you back to sleep so I know you can,\" She informs you. You still don't reply, eventually she gives up and starts to leave. You decide that you can't just ignore her, and you don't want to be on bad terms with anyone else. You're already on bad terms with Deluma and the police force, look where that got you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am a little hungry,\" You quietly admit.

Thank you...\" You reply, not sure how to react. \"I... don't mean to be rude, but could you tell me where I am and who you are... and... what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fox anthro grins at you, \"I'll tell you what, how about a deal hmm? I'll answer any question you can think of for the next ten minutes. After that you have to answer all of my questions. That sounds fair right? So do we have a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Deal\" You reply with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well what would you like to know first?\" The fox asked, as her tail swayed from side to side calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's your name?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How rude of me not to tell you!

Though they did search the store for you and they know that you were there, but they have no clue where you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And once you got my back here you treated my injuries...\" You realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira nodded, \"You were banged up pretty bad, you were lucky not to have broken anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You then have a brief flashback and recall your fall... \"Yeah, not one of my finer moments...\" you admit. \"I have one more question... why help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira looks shocked and taken aback, \"Why?\" She asked, \"You were injured, defenseless and being hunted down.

You needed to find out what was going on and start working on a way to get home. \"I escaped them once, I can do it again\" You state confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya deadpanned while before leaning down so that her snout was level with your face, \"You weren't injured when you escaped the first time, and you only got out of that mess with the help of my daughter and her boss.

At the same time though, you knew that if you could find a place to lay low you could still manage on your own without involving anyone else in your problems. That's what really bothered you the most about the whole situation, you hated that these two anthros were having to go out of there way to care for you. You didn't want to bother them with your troubles any more than you already had. Besides that, you hated the fact that you were having to depend on them, you were an independent person. It pained you to need to rely on someone else. Not because of pride or ego... but because you genuinely felt that if you relied on someone too much, you'd either become a burden for them or be shattered when they suddenly weren't there for you anymore, regardless of the reason. With these thoughts swirling around in your mind you felt that you had to leave this home, you couldn't leave the situation as it was, \"I think I'll be fine, so long as I find a place to lay low and make sure that I cover my tracks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya didn't reply right away, but instead seemed to think for a minute before a sly look briefly flashed across her muzzle. It was only there for a moment before it was replaced by a disappointed expression, \"Well...\" She sighed, \"I guess I can't change your mind. I may not agree with you're decision but its your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira stared at her mother in disbelief, \"Mom!

Shira had washed them for you and returned them to your bedside when you had fallen asleep the night before. You carefully put your shirt and jeans on so as not to aggravate any of your injuries. The good news there was that because anthros were animal based, they naturally had an instinctual knowledge of plants and the way the body works. Because of this, the natural remedies that they came up with and their treatments were far more effective than they were back home. So injuries that should have been in the early stages of healing, were actually in their last stages. Despite this advantage, you still had one or two injuries that would impede your physical performance and cause you pain but nothing that would keep you in a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once dressed, you make your way out of the room that you'd been bedridden in for the past three days, when you exit the room you find yourself in a hallway with carpeted stairs leading downstairs to your left. The hallway continued on you right with two more doors before hitting a dead end at a window. You head down the stairs and find yourself at a wall when you reach the bottom which forces you to turn to your right. There you are faced with another hallway that has one open entryway on the left and another on the right. And at the end of the hallway you find Tonya standing in front of what you assume to be the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I take it your all set to go?\" She asks with a faint smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\" You reply. \"Thanks for everything you've done for me, I mean it. I can't tell you how much what you've done means to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya gives a dismissive wave before giving you a warm grin, \"Oh it was no trouble at all dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you sure you won't change your mind about staying with us?\" Shira asks from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn around to find her standing in the hallway behind you, she looks sad... but there's something else about her expression that you can't put you're finger on. It seems almost like she's showing a bit of... remorse? You dismiss it from your mind, \"Yes, I'm sure. I've burdened you two enough and besides that I need to figure out where I am and how to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, if that's the way you feel...\" Tonya sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nodded, \"It is...\" You walk towards the door, but Tonya doesn't move. You think its odd but ignore it as you reach for the doorknob. Before your fingers can even touch it, one of Tonya's tails moves in front of the doorknob preventing you from touching it. \"Um... could you please move so I can go?\" You ask as politely as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry,\" Tonya says as she shakes her head, \"No can do sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait what?\" You ask in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya shrugged before explaining herself, \"I'm not letting you leave this house so that Deluma's officers can hunt you down and drag you away to who knows where.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We've been over this though!\" You reply, \"I told you that I'd be fine and you said that if I wanted to leave, then that was my choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya nodded, \"That's exactly what I said. I said that I couldn't <i>change your mind</i> either. But I never said that I wasn't going to <i>stop</i> you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stare at Tonya in disbelief, \"So what you're saying is, unless I can get past you you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"-Going to keep you right here in this house where its safe...\" Shira finished, \"For you're own safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We can't let you go out there on your own in good conscience... this is <i>our</i> decision,\" Tonya stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball's in your court, its your move.

But initially all you can come up with are disadvantages to yourself. Tonya starts to slowly advance towards you and away from the door. You see this as the opportunity that you'd been waiting for. You see a small gap between her and the wall. You figure that if you can stay low enough, you can use the size difference between you and her to your advantage. You sprint for Tonya head on, planning to break left at the last possible minute with a dive. Tonya spreads her arms and legs to block as much of the hallway as she can. You don't slow down though, when you get close enough you dive for the gap between her body and the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh! That's quite clever!\" Tonya admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your expression saddens slightly as you think about how they must feel. They're only trying to protect you and your about to- \"Oof!\" Your shot into complete disarray as you feel something connect with your chest. It didn't feel hard, it actually felt like someone hit you with a pillow. But the force behind the impact was so strong that it stopped you in midair and caused you to fall facedown on the ground at Tonya's feet. You look up to see Tonya lowering her left hand back down to her side. \"How'd you know I'd dive left?\" You ask as you get to your feet and retreat to a safe distance where she couldn't reach you... or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't,\" Tonya admitted with a sheepish smile, \"I just used my tails to cover the areas I couldn't.\" Her smile then faded and turned to a sly grin, \"If you want to get through this door your going to have to fight me.\" You must have looked reluctant because she actually laughs, \"Oh don't worry dear, you won't hurt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well... if your sure...\" You reply as you charge up to her. Before you can even reach her though, her tails actually extend in length. You don't have any measuring tape handy on you, but you'd guess that they were now about twelve feet in length. \"What in the-\" You cut yourself off was one of her tails makes a low sweep for your feet. You stop immediately and pull you feet up off of the ground so that your basically crouching in mid air. Her second tail comes straight for your mid section and you drop to the ground on your stomach to evade it. It then comes down on you like a newspaper squishing a bug on the table. You roll out of the way and jump back up on your feet. Once your on your feet you find Tonya herself closing in on you to pounce on you. You backstep to avoid her form which now covered the area that you were standing on a few seconds ago. You would think that because she's anthropomorphic, she'd be as awkward as a human would be on all fours. But to your surprise she actually seems comfortable and closes the gap like a normal fox would. She stalks up to you faster than you can dive out of the way and while your still moving your body she actually goes back to a typical standing stance before back handing you with her left hand. She didn't hit you too hard, but she still knocked you off of your feet and through the entryway to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You fall with a thud onto your back, but you keep your momentum going and yourself backwards like a ball and back onto your feet where you once again assume a defensive fighting stance. \"Impressive,\" Tonya notes with a genuine spark of interest in her eye, \"I wasn't expecting you to recover so quickly,\" She says as her tails strike out at you, one after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And I wasn't...\" You pause to duck under one of her tails, \"Expecting your tails... to... become tentacle whips, WHOA! JEEZ!\" You exclaim as her tails begin rapid firing at you, aiming to knock you onto your back again. You back step away from her once again and bump into something soft. You turn your head to find Shira standing directly behind you. She grabs you right wrist, but you move your body away from her before she can get your left. She sweeps her foot against your feet in an effort to make you lose your footing, but you use the arm that she's holding to support yourself. Eventually, she yanks you towards her before wrapping you in a bear hug and tackling you to the ground all in one swift motion. Now, your pinned facedown to the ground underneath her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya's tails recede to their normal length as she walks over to where your pinned. From your point of view, all you can see is a pair of white paws with black claws. \"Now then...\" She begins, \"If you couldn't get by Shira and I, how are you going to avoid the entire police force?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You grunt in annoyance knowing that she's right. There were only two of them, one of which didn't really even do anything. And on top of that, you were in your element, a tight enclosed space where your size was your biggest advantage. You struggle to get up and squirm and writhe underneath Shira, but you can't get her to budge. In fact, she laughs because you somehow tickle her with all your movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't feel too bad dear,\" Tonya continues, \"You actually did a lot better than I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah!\" Shira added, \"You were way more agile than those humans in the books and the stories!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you gave it your best go right? And you managed to impress the two vixens. But you still lost, however the question is are you ready to accept that or will you continue to struggle?</span></div></div>",

Most of what she listed was common sense stuff like 'don't go outside' and 'stay away from open windows.' The rest of the night proceeded relatively quietly. You all sat down and ate dinner together, which was pasta. You loved pasta, and the fact that Shira's mom could cook, made it that much better. Shira and Tonya would ask you the occasional question about your life back home and what you thought of their world in comparison. You answered their questions to the best of your ability, but most of them where viewpoint questions, so there really wasn't a right or wrong answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After dinner, Tonya officially declares it bedtime. \"But I'm not tired, and its not even that late...\" You argue. Tonya then gives you a sly and confident look that says 'you can get in your bed or I can put you in your bed, choose wisely.' At that point you decide to reevaluate your stand on the matter. \"However, getting a goodnight's rest is important for humans with injuries.\" You then excuse yourself from the table and head up to your room.</span></div></div>",

You really hadn't had an opportunity to think about it before, but now that you were safe and everything had slowed down a bit, you were able to fully grasp the gravity of your situation. You honestly couldn't sleep, seeing as this was the case you rolled yourself out of bed and quietly slipped downstairs doing your best not to wake either vixen. When you get downstairs you wonder around for a bit until you find the living room. It had two large couches in it and a coffee table as well. There was a large cupboard on the wall which you assumed to be some kind of entertainment center. There was only one window in the room and it had blinds and curtains draped about it so that it was safe for you to sit in the room without fear of discovery from the neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sat silently for what felt like hours before tears started to stream from your face as you realized that you could be stuck here for the rest of your life. However, that wasn't quite as bad as knowing that where you came from your life wasn't exactly picture perfect there either. In fact you were having a difficult time there as well. But at least where you came from you didn't have an evil anthromorphic kitsune with the strength of ten men out to get you. While you were lost in thought about what to do, a noise from the hallway startled you. You snapped your head up to find Shira standing in the doorway wearing white pajamas with a urgent expression on her face, \"Kiba!\" She hissed, \"What are you doing down here? If mom finds you out of bed she'll flip and... and....\" Her expression changed from urgent to concerned as she saw the tears in your eyes. \"Hey, what's wrong?\" She asked as she approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wipe your tears off your face and into your sleeve, \"Nothing,\" You reply, \"I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira raised an eyebrow at this as she continued to draw near you, \"If you were a wolf that lie might've been more convincing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm just thinking, that's all...\" You assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"About what?\" She presses as she sits down next to you while her tail wraps around your midsection and pulls you a bit closer to her while the tip of her tail rests in your lap. You can hear her heartbeat as your head is now pressed against her ribcage with both of your arms pinned to your side while one of her arms is wrapped around your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stuff,\" You answer almost nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira frowns and shoots you a glare, \"Alright, I'm done playing catch a tiger by the toe,\" She states flatly, \"Why were you crying and what's keeping you from telling me?\" She demands sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was just thinking about what my life is going to be like here and if I'll ever get to go home,\" You tell her \"Though I'm not sure I'd be better off there,\" You mutter under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean by that?\" Shira asks. Apparently your last statement was loud enough for her sensitive ears to pickup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, where I come from I'm not exactly doing all that well. I lost my job and my girlfriend, my siblings have no respect for me and my parents either don't care or don't know how what they say affects me. Not that any of that really matters because I may never get home to see my family ever again. And on the flip side how am I supposed to live here? I'm physically outmatched by nearly every occupant that lives in this world. Its a miracle that Deluma hasn't caught me yet. I feel like I'm all alone... no friends or family, and no other members of my kind to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira whimpers a little, similarly to the noise a puppy might make before turning and wrapping you in a hug, \"I'm so sorry, I don't know why or how this happened to you. And I can't promise you a way home... But I promise that we'll take care of you, we'll be your family here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You aren't sure why but that seems to make you feel a lot better. \"Thanks Shira,\" You reply as you try to return her hug the best you can, but lets face it; her arms almost wrap around your frame twice and her body about completely covers yours. You can't help but smile as you think about how silly it must look for an anthro to be hugging a human two thirds of her size that's sitting next to her. \"This would look so awkward to someone walking by,\" You quietly chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unbeknownst to either of you, Shira's mom was watching and listening to the entire exchange from just behind the wall in the other room, \"It doesn't look awkward to me...\" She whispered with a warm smile before heading back to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Living with the two foxes has definitely gotten easier for you. Shira's mom; Tonya is pretty easy to predict for the most part... she's a mom. However, because she's a mom, she still has that whole 'no matter how old you are I have a way to deal with you' thing going on. So there are times when you know she has something planned, but you're never quite prepared for it. That being said, she's also a fox... so... yeah... playful/impish/cunning is all natural to her. Though, despite all this, Tonya genuinely is a kind and loving person albeit a bit strict at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira's story is similar to her mother, again she's a fox, so the whole playful/impish/cunning thing is still there. However, she's also her mother's daughter, which means that she completely understands when you want to defy her every now and again. Primarily when you sneak out of the house. You're really not supposed to but its hard not to. You're cooped up in there all day everyday with nothing to do. But when you do sneak out to explore or just to get out for a bit, Shira usually covers for you. That's a double edge sword though because she also blackmails you from time to time with your 'extracurricular' activities. Though in the end, Shira isn't unlike the older sister you've always wanted but never had. You often spend time together when she comes home from work and watch movies late at night when she has the time and occasionally, you even team up against her mom to win arguments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Today is the start of your second month living with the two anthros whom have become your family in this strange new world. Currently, your reading a history report report to Tonya while she takes down notes and grades the reports, Tonya was a teacher so she often brought home papers to grade. You, having nothing better to do, sometimes read the reports to her so that she can easily grade them and you can learn about the world you live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, that was the last one Kiba,\" Tonya said as she got up and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good,\" You replied as you handed her the paper, \"I'm starting to get board of reading these honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya chuckled a bit as she got up from her desk before approaching you and ruffling your hair with her paw, \"Well don't worry, I have some current event papers coming up pretty soon that I'll have to grade, and I'm sure that there'll be a lot of reports on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You grin a bit, you feel somewhat like a newly discovered superhero. But you know in reality that your closer to a fugitive. \"It'll be a welcome break from reading all of this stuff about the 'Wolf and Lamb Treaty' and 'The Battle of Stray Alley'\" You scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya laughs and nods before walking  out of her bedroom and heading to the kitchen, \"Make sure you have an appetite tonight, I'll be cooking a lot for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I will,\" You promise as you head upstairs, \"I'm just going to take a quick nap before then!\" You call back. You head to your room and close the door before locking it. When you turn around you find Shira standing directly in front of you grinning down at you. You  yelp in surprise and nearly fall over, \"Shira! That isn't funny, you scared the life out of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm... you look pretty alive to me\" Shira chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh ha-ha very funny,\" You reply flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Consider this payback for the time you rubbed that balloon all over my fur when I was asleep,\" She says as she walks past you and unlocks the door before slipping out of it. You immediately walk back over to it and close it. You then head over to the window, grabbing one of Shira's hoodies off of the bed along the way and making sure the coast is clear, you climb down the side of the house using the gutter drain pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once you hit the ground, you don the hoodie and scamper around the house to the front yard. You easily climb over the fence and shove your hands in your pockets before walking along the sidewalk quietly. Its funny really, if you were to take your hoodie off right where you stood, it would only be minutes before a police squad was coming around the corner for you, but put on an oversized hoodie, hide your hands and face and everyone assumes your an anthro. You laugh to yourself about the concept before heading down towards the ocean. That was where you went when you snuck out the other times before hand, it was so peaceful and calming to watch the sea and listen to it and with night fast approaching, there was almost nobody there. It took you about an hour to make it to the beach. Once there you stood near the waterline and watched the waves roll in as the sun sank below the waves. You were never able to do this where you came from. Honestly it was a welcomed distraction from all that was currently going on in your crazy messed up life. You watch the waves for a little longer before someone calls out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey you!\" They shout. You turned your head keeping your face hidden well within the shadows of the hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it that's calling for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By the looks of it, you think he's from some kind of S.W.A.T. team. He's wearing a tactical vest and utility belt. He's also wearing a pair of black field pants and tactical boots as well. He begins to approach you and as he does, you notice that he's only about an inch taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good evening,\" He says as he approaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good evening,\" You return. You're not sure if he knows whether you're human or not but you figure its best to play it as if you were an anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What brings you here tonight?\" He questions as he stops a few feet away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The view and sound of the sea,\" You reply, \"It puts me at peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see,\" The lynx replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And may I ask what brings a field officer here on this night?\" You inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think you already know the answer to that <i>human</i>,\" The lynx stated with a smirk. You don't say anything as the wind blows between the two of you and the sound of the waves lapping at the shore continues as you stare each other down. \"I guess I should explain that I'm with Deluma's H.R.T. or the Human Recovery Team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not standard police I take it,\" You return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not at all, in fact the regular police don't even know what we do. They just know to get out of our way when we're coming,\" The lynx replied. \"But enough about me, you my friend have avoided the police for over a week now. That's a feet in itself, but you've managed to do better than that and kept yourself fed and healthy it looks like. What bothers me is that I just can't understand how such an average looking human's managed to do all of that on our turf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Average looking?\" You ask, then it hit you. He's with the Human Recovery Team, he's probably seen a couple of humans before... which would mean that your situation was not an isolated incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes,\" He replied, \"I've had to hunt and catch many humans who were unusually athletic or strong... but you appear to be average.\" The lynx then sighs and shrugs, \"I guess it doesn't really matter how you did it, in the end all humans are the same; afraid of harm and death.\" He then begins walking towards you and pulls out a pair of handcuffs from his belt, \"Well, let's get this over with. Give me your hands...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gonna have to pass on that thanks,\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh your resisting, what a surprise,\" The lynx says with mock shock. However, as he takes your hands and tries to put the handcuffs on you, you snatch both of your wrists out of his hand and deck him in his jaw. The lynx staggers backwards and drops his cuffs before holding a paw up to his jaw to see if you'd drawn blood while still staring at you in disbelief, \"You hit me...\" He murmured, \"You actually hit me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By now your hoodie had become useless, and as such you cast it off of you. \"Well what did you expect?\" You demand as you glare at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lynx snapped out of his stupor and put his cuffs away, \"Honestly? I expected you to come quietly like all the others... or try to run away from me along the shoreline... but you're the first human who's ever hit me... it doesn't matter though, you'll give up like all the others in the end. But if you don't, I'll be forced to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You grit your teeth and narrow your eyes at the lynx, \"I'm not ready to die...\" You admit causing the lynx to sprout a smug grin, \"But I'm not afraid to die either,\" You continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lynx' grin faded at hearing your stern declaration, \"That's brave talk coming from such an inferior creature,\" The lynx spat \"I think its time you learned your place in the world human.\" He drew what looked like a baton which extended into a staff or rod type weapon with a tazer at its tip. You could easily see the ark of electricity flowing between the two prongs at its tip. He then pointed the dangerous end of the weapon at you, \"Last chance to give up,\" The lynx warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Funny,\" You report, \"I was about to say the same thing to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just remember you brought this on yourself,\" The lynx growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Take your best shot,\" You spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lynx ran toward you, charging you like a knight with a lance. You waited until the last possible second to dive to you right while the lynx charged over your footprints in the sand before sliding to a stop on his feet. He turned to face you, but by then you had already begun running back towards the suburbs. He growled before giving chase. You knew that with the way things were currently going, you weren't going to outrun him... and now everyone on the streets is staring at you like when you first came here. But you can't afford to pay attention to them, you need to focus on what you're doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, just a recap; S.W.A.T. lynx trying to capture you, running through the suburbs on the sidewalk to escape and every anthro that sees you feels the need to stop and stare at you... Did I get everything? Oh yeah, that's right! And your not even supposed to be out here because your forbidden from leaving Shira's house... Man... when it rains it pours huh? So what are ya gonna do? You know that you can't out run this guy.... and your not sure if you can fight him and win...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But let's face it, the smart play here is to keep moving and only fight when necessary. That being said, you keep moving along the street casting a glance over your shoulder every so often to check his progress, you were only barely able to keep ahead of him, but you suspect that he's holding back for some reason. You return your attention to navigating through the pedestrians and lamp posts ahead of you. You cast a glance over your shoulder once more to find that your pursuer isn't behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before you can even begin to wonder where he'd gone you feel a harsh impact from your left side. You feel like a snowplow hit you as you crash through the window of the restaurant you happened to be in front of. You bounce across a table and onto a bamboo chair while crushing it in the process and  landing on a hardwood floor and slide across the ground along with shards of broken glass and pieces of bamboo until you come to a stop in the center of the restaurant. All of the patrons have stopped eating and turned their attention towards you, They're not who you're worried about though as you find the lynx walking in through the door. You slowly get to your feet and hold your right arm as it was sore from the impact against the glass window you went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lynx looks you up and down for a moment before showing a small smile, \"I'm impressed, you have good instincts human.\" Your confused by what he means and he obviously sees this so he continues, \"Most of your kind would have tried to make their bodies stay still or stop after taking a fall like that. What they don't realize is that they put all of the force and weight of the impact on whatever part of their body they land on. You, however, allowed your body to roll with the force that I hit you with and therefore distributed the force of the impact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You grunt in response, <i>\"He must've hit me from the side when I was looking for him,\"</i> You think as you watch him wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now then,\" The lynx continued as he drew and extended his tazer rod once more. \"Now then, lets end this before I <i>really</i> have to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You glance around looking for someway to defend yourself as he approaches as you back away from him you feel something bump against your foot. You look down and find the pieces of bamboo from the chair you accidently broke. The ties that were holding the chair's form had broken, but the bamboo was still intact. You quickly grab two pieces of bamboo each equal to the length between your fingertips to your elbows and brandish them like swords. <i>\"The bamboo is light but strong, it won't break easily and on top of that its a type of wood which means that it wont conduct the electricity from the tazer should I strike its tip...\"</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Still refusing to surrender?\" The lynx replied momentarily put out by your sudden defensive posture. He then renewed his approach, \"It doesn't matter whether you run or fight,\" The lynx stated before raising his rod above his head and swinging it down on you with both arms. You crossed your bamboo 'swords' in an 'x' and stopped his rod just above your head. He drew back and attempted to thrust you in chest which you blocked again using a single bamboo pole, deflecting the dangerous tip away from your torso. The lynx growled and faster than you could've anticipated he lunged at you while still drawing back from his last attack. His shoulder smashed into your chest sending you into the wall on the far side of the restaurant. You shake the dizziness out of your head and glance up to find the lynx charging you holding his rod like a lance like he did on the beach you roll to your right as he plunges his rod into the wall causing it to break in half. You take the opportunity and rush up to the lynx before slamming the bamboo stick in your right hand against the side of his head cracking it on impact. He yowls in pain before falling onto the floor. You take the opportunity and run out of the front of the restaurant as multiple stares and gasps follow you out of the door. When you reach the door you find a crowd of anthros had gathered to watch the fight between you and the lynx. You didn't stick around for a post fight interview, but instead ran off toward Shira's house praying that you don't wind up on some news channel and hoping that that lynx was the only one they sent after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Right then, as the chapter implies there are two possible outcomes to the upcoming confrontation. Before I go any further you should just throw any hope of winning out of the window or into the garbage... like right now... 'cause it ain't gonna happen. Have you done that? Good! Here's the thing... Kiba a.k.a. you... is a bit of a boxer... when I say a bit I mean he knows the basics of boxing, and because he's fairly agile and rather quick on his feet he is capable of taking on some of the smaller anthros and winning and against larger opponents, while he generally won't win he can definitely take a hit... just... not very many. The other thing to keep in mind about this story over all is that the anthros are not as creative or adaptive as humans. For example, if you come to an open door with no lock but there's a hammer nearby, you might smash the handle on the outer side of the door and then proceed through it and close it... effectively locking it on one side (No handle means you cant open the door once it latches itself shut.) Or if you come to a locked door, you might pick the lock with a bobby pin or a paperclip. These are solutions that would never occur to an anthro simply because they lack the ingenuity and creativity that humans have. Of course, they make up for all of this in strength, size and natural ability depending on the anthro. I'd tell you more but then we'd be getting into storyline spoilers and who wants that? Well, here are your choices choose wisely and you might find yourself some allies that have more in common with you than you'd believe.</span></div></div>",

So you branch off and decide to take an alternate route back to Shira and Tonya's house. There's a wooded section between where you are and the house. But its double the length of your previous route. But at this point, the distance is the last thing on your mind, you're more concerned with ridding yourself of any extra attention. The woods are somewhat difficult to navigate, lucky for you there happens to be a few trails that lead to the opposing end of the trails... however, that also meant that every now and then there was an anthro on these trails and it would be rather dangerous to run into a less than pleasant one in the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Things are going smoothly for you as you jog along the trail, you've been in the forest for a little over twenty minutes, and if you can keep your pace up it shouldn't be more than another thirty minutes to get back. You slow to a walk to conserve your energy and pause to survey your surroundings. <i>\"Doesn't look like I was followed...\"</i> You think to yourself before continuing on your way. Broken beams of moonlight shined down on you from the trees above. As you walked along the faint dirt path you got thee distinct feeling that someone was watching you, you felt a chill run down your spine and that's when you realized it. The crickets weren't chirping and there weren't any sounds of any animals fleeing from you... which meant something else had already scared them off. \"I really hope I'm just being paranoid...\" You groan to yourself as you do your best to pretend that everything's normal.... well.... as normal as things can be for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well what do we have here?\" A voice echoed through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I hate it when I'm right,\" You mutter as you stop walking and begin searching for the source of the voice while holding your ground. The owner of the voice was female, no question about that, but there was also power behind that voice. It sounded like it was coming from someone who demanded respect and got said respect whether you wanted to give it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Looks like a human, all alone in the big bad forest,\" The voice continued with a hint of mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who are you!?\" You shout while continuing to scan through the treetops and nearby bushes searching for anything out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who am I?\" The voice echoed, \"An interesting question with many answers. But the which is the answer you seek I wonder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean?\" You demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I could ask you the same question,\" The voice replies, \"Do you want to know my name? Are you interested in my personality? Is it perhaps my social life that you're asking about?

You close your eyes and sigh, \"Sam I presume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You certainly are a perceptive little thing aren't you?\" Sam laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You spin around to find a lioness, She was huge and not just in the height department. She had tone muscles and her arm alone was about as thick as one of your legs. She was yellow in color with blonde hair that hung over her shoulders and yellow eyes. Two rounded ears stuck up above her hair while a long yellow tail swayed from side to side behind her. You backpedal to put some distance between you and her while taking in her form. You notice that she's wearing a denim jacket with a tight black t-shirt underneath it which stops just above her navel. from her waist down she's wearing a pair of loose fitting jeans that leave her four large toes one each foot exposed as she's not wearing any shoes. She stands at about double your height and was definitely aware of her advantage. After sizing her up you notice that she's doing the same to you, <i>\"Probably a list of vulnerabilities to exploit...\"</i> You think grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So how do you want to do this? Will you come quietly or will you resist?\" Sam inquired with genuine curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've got somewhere to be, and your in my way,\" You reply somewhat bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm... must be an important engagement, but you failed to answer my question,\" Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I will resist if you try to stop me,\" You declare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam tilted her head with a puzzled look, \"You are not afraid of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Afraid? No... Concerned for my wellbeing? Yes\" You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see, well you'll be happy to know that I'm to deliver you to mayor Deluma alive,\" Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"'Alive' and 'in one piece' are not the same...\" You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"True, but perhaps you'll yield to me before any unnecessary injuries?\" Sam offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not the type to put my health before my goals,\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam gave a small smile, \"Interesting, you told me a moment ago that you were concerned for your welfare, yet now you risk it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You took up a boxing stance, \"The way I see it, if I lose and you take me to Deluma I'm in trouble anyway and there's no doubt in my mind that she'd kill me on a whim... on the other hand if by some off chance I win or escape, probably the latter... I get to live another day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam nods in understanding before sprouting a grin, \"You seem to be a bit of a gambler... I like you human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I have to say there's nothing like a civilized conversation between you and the 'Grim Reaper'. Maybe not the conversation you'd want to have but at least its civilized right? Now the question is who makes the first move? You or Sam... either way your gonna escape.... but the question is, how bad are you gonna come off at the end of this encounter? It all depends on who makes the first move.

When you get to her you try for a left hook, hoping that your fist will connect with her ribs and get you some kind of result. Sadly though, this is not the case as she easily uses her paw on that side to stop you punch in mid swing. You scowl in frustration, you knew this was going to be a losing battle to begin with but now its really starting to sink in. Suddenly your fist starts to throb as Sam begins to slowly squeeze it in her palm. You feel as though she might break it if she keeps  this up, and she very well might. From your point of view, her paw is so large that it looks like its actually consuming your fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will you give up now?\" Sam asked casually. You scowled as a drum beat picked up in your mind followed by a guitar, as if someone was playing the theme song for a action sequence. You placed your free hand atop of Sam's paw which is slowly crushing your left hand and using your right hand as leverage you jump off of the ground and rotate your body so that your feet are positioned just in front of Sam's muzzle and give her a powerful double kick to the face. She immediately releases your hand and you fell to the ground clutching your aching arm... it hurts but you don't think its broken. \"I'll admit,\" Sam spoke as she recovered, \"I didn't expect that... you drew blood, very impressive.\" As you watch her you notice the there's a faint trail of blood trailing down from her nose. \"But I wonder how will you'll do if I take the offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You scramble to your feet and just as you get to your feet, you find that she's already looming over you, <i>\"She's fast!\"</i> you think to yourself as you through yourself backwards to avoid a backhanded swing from her right paw; the same paw that nearly crushed your hand moments ago. She then swiped at you with her left paw horizontally, you ducked under it feeling the rushing air just above your head as her paw passed over you. She then swept one of her feet against your legs, sending you tumbling though the air, though disoriented you instinctively crossed your arms over your chest just before a huge weight smashed into it sending your body rocketing backwards. You bounced across the ground twice, rolling like a ragdoll before your back slammed into a tree. When you hit the tree you were about five feet off of the ground, so after the initial impact you fell to the ground before groaning in pain. Your vision was hazy and your body felt heavy. You felt yourself beginning fall asleep but you shook the drowsiness out of your head, <i>\"How in the world am I supposed to survive against that!? Another attack like that and I'm done!\"</i> You think as your vision clears. You shakily attempt to stand, but even doing that sends pain surging through your body. Against your protesting body, you  force yourself to stand... \"Still nothing broken,\" You mutter to yourself as you shift all of your limbs and muscles experimentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm truly impressed human,\" Sam admitted, \"I thought you would've been unconscious after that but you've managed to maintain you consciousness AND stand, I'm beginning to understand why the police are having such a hard time catching you but what I can't understand is where you get the strength from...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't just... give up, but...\" You pant as you ready yourself for another attack, <i>\"I can't fight her and I can't outrun her, all I can do is evade her and hope that a miracle happens.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam pauses briefly, waiting to hear what you'll say next, \"But what?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But I know I can't win either,\" You admit grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam nodded in agreement, not smugly or condescendingly but as if acknowledging a simple fact of life, \"All the more reason for you to stop resisting and turn yourself over to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry,\" You reply with a faint smile, \"But I refuse!\" You shout as you throw a branch that you'd found laying on the ground. Sam easily swatted it aside but when she did she left her right side open and by the time she realized it you were already within striking distance. You lower yourself as low as you can to the ground without falling while running and drive your shoulder into her right knee. She winces in pain as her knee recoils backward further than it naturally could. Sam swipes at you with her claws but you manage to skirt around her attack and get behind her. Using her loose fitting jacket you climb up her back and somehow manage to get your arms around her neck to put her in a chokehold. She begins to gag, but this is short lived as she encompasses your face with one of her paws and literally rips you off of her back and tosses you to the ground. Your body does a full flip before you hit the ground on your back, the air is forced from your lungs and most of your strength is gone after taking that last hit. You're pretty sure that she probably could have crushed your skull or splattered you across the ground, but you assume that since she did neither, she really is trying to take you alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You...\" Sam started, \"You're more resourceful and resilient than any human I've encountered before. Your spirit is unbreakable and you adapt unlike anything I've seen yet.\" By this time you'd gotten to your feet, but you were so tired and sore that standing in itself was a chore. \"However at the end of this you must realize your limitations, after all, you're only human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Wow, a line that transcends dimensions...\"</i> you think to yourself. You then realize something that you never thought about before, \"You're not a cop are you?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I feel that its a bit too... restrictive for me,\" Sam admitted, \"I'm a bounty hunter by trade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Great... so now you were being hunted by the police, that secret human hunting group AND you had to worry about bounty hunters now! \"This day just keeps getting better and better,\" you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You put on quite a show little one... but now your mine,\" Sam said as she approached you. You backed away from her but it seemed like for every step back you took, she took another two forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually your up against a tree and have nowhere to go as she looms over you. As she begins to reach out for you shadow literally dashes between the two of you before grabbing you and darting off into the woods. It happened so fast that you were still processing what happened, after getting over your initial shock, you realize that an anthro has grabbed you and slung you over their shoulder. You look up and see Sam hot in pursuit, but you 'rescuer' is far more agile than she is and easily out maneuvers her weaving in and around trees, across branches and over logs. Eventually Sam gives up while glaring at you. That solves that problem but now you have another potential threat... who's carrying you? And what are they planning on doing with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so you survived the fight! Congrats! And on top of that you almost held your own against an anthro! Even if she was going easy on you, that's still an accomplishment, not to mention you did it without breaking anything! But now the question is... who's got you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was dressed in a black hoodie and a pair of  baggy cargo pants. It made sense, with clothes like that, narrowing down who she was without a good look would be pretty hard.

I won't let you!\" Shira told the both of the two bots. \"Well lets do our most-\" Then the two would be interrupted with a flick from Shira. \"That was odd very odd I think we might run into more of them if we stay here much longer.\" You tell Shira. \"Agreed lets get back to the house and quick I think I hear more foot steps and it might be some of Deluma's goons!\" She tells you and you both get out of the sewers quickly.</span></div></div>",

You need to find something to help you blend in. As you move through town you spot what looks like an oversized blanket draped over a railing in front of a shop. You grab the covering as you pass by and cover yourself with it like it were a cloak. As you begin to cross into an urban environment, you find that you get less stares; your camouflage seems to be working and the fact that its dark out also helps. After another twenty minutes of dashing through the suburbs you find yourself in Shira's backyard. You scale the side of the house as quietly as possible using the gutter drain for handholds and crawl over the edge of the roof and onto the shingled rooftop. You sigh in relief as you crawl in through the window before closing it and collapsing on your bed and closing your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as your settling in though, you hear a knock at the door, \"Can I come in?\" Tonya asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your eyes shoot open before you leap off of the bed, \"Uh... just a second!\" you call before discarding your new 'cloak' and tossing it underneath the bed. You then slow your breathing as much as possible and try to keep the tiredness off of your face as you open the door. \"What's up?\" You ask nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya gives you a smile, \"Oh nothing,\" She says, \"Just checking on you, so, what've you been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh... uh... I've been taking in the scenery of the sunset,\" You state which wasn't a <i>complete</i> lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For three hours?\" Tonya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was contemplating the turn my life took when I came here afterwards,\" You return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya crossed her arms, \"I see,\" She replied but where did you get that bruise on your arm from?\" She asks as she nods pointedly at your right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Must've been from when that lynx pushed me through that window...\"</i> You think to yourself. \"Oh, I didn't notice it...\" You muse as you look down at your arm, \"It must've happened when a fell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You fell?\" Tonya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You didn't hear it?\" You asked, \"It happened not too long ago but I though you would've heard it... guess it wasn't as loud as I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess not,\" Tonya replied. There's an awkward silence between you two before Tonya sighs and leans against the doorframe, \"Before you make this any worse for yourself you should know, that I know, that you know that you're lying to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You give Tonya a confused stare hoping that you can call her bluff by dragging out the conversation and playing dumb, \"So... I know, that you know, that I know that I'm lying?\" You ask, \"I'm just trying to understand this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't play games with me Kiba,\" Tonya says as her tails flare up behind her and she straightens up, \"Now I'm going to ask you this once... Did... You... Leave... This... House?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've never left this house...\" You reply solemnly. But a withering glare from Tonya prompts you to quickly add on to your statement, \"More than twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya groans and shakes her head, \"Kiba! You know you can't do that!\" You quietly look away from her.... \"What if something happened to you and you got caught? Or what if they followed you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was careful! I'm always careful!\" You reply in an attempt to defend yourself, \"I've never once come back without making sure that I wasn't followed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya's face goes blank before being replaced with an expression that could fit the definition of 'divine wrath'. \"You said 'never once' just now,\" Tonya growled, \"That would imply that you've left the house on <i>multiple</i> accounts...\" She surmised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You kicked yourself for not being more careful with your wording, but then you saw Tonya's expression... \"Ooooh heaven help me...\" You groaned under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kiba.... I understand that you've been feeling pent up in here for the past couple of weeks, I really do...\" Tonya started with an unnervingly calm voice, \"But that does not justify sneaking out of the house and running around out there like nobody can see you! It puts you at risk and it puts us at risk!\" You wanted to shrink into nothing, you hadn't meant to put anyone at risk... you just wanted a little fresh air is all. Tonya sighed, \"I'm upset with you but I'm glad you made it back safe... I was very worried about you and so was Shira...\" Tonya replied as she calmed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry,\" You reply say quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll figure out how I'm going to punish you for this later... but right now I need to know that you weren't followed home,\" Shira stated while looking at you with a piercing gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wasn't followed, I'm sure of it,\" You stated. Shira gave you a dubious look, \"You are the only family I have now... I know that if the track me to you I'll have nowhere to go and we'll all be arrested so I made sure nobody followed me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira stared you down for a few minutes before sighing and resting her paw on your head, \"Good\" Was all she said as she began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Before you go,\" You call after her causing her to pause, \"How did you know I was gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smirked at you before continuing toward the stairs, \"You made the news,\" She called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After she's out of sight you hear the doorbell ring. Shira answers the door and there's a brief exchange of words in which your name and species is mentioned before what sounds almost like an argument breaks out. You get curious and decide to get a little closer and do some investigating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, so you made it home in one piece... yay... Buuuut you're in trouble with your 'mom' and now there's a new agency after you aaaand someones at the door talking about you... there are a lot of questions that could be asked but right now the big question is... who's at the door?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If you guys like this story and want me to keep writing then drop me an email.

You knew that voice, you'd heard it somewhere before... but you just couldn't place it. You crept down the stairs to get a better look at whoever was at the door, after a bit of crawling and contorting yourself you finally got a good angle that prevented you from being seen and allowed you a view of whoever was at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you squint to get a better look at the figure in the doorway, you find not one but two anthros both of whom you recognize. You're mind is flooded with flashbacks of when you first came to this world. Your first contact with the police force and Deluma... and the two anthros that helped you escape. \"Luna?\" You mutter under your breath. She must've heard you because her head swiveled as she searched for the source of your voice. Shira glanced back at you and gave you a death stare wondering what you were doing. \"Let them in!\" You whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She stared at you like you'd lost your mind, however her mom walked up to the doorway before gently nudging her to the side. \"Good evening officer!\" Tonya exclaimed as she clasped her paws together, \"Is there something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, not at all\" Luna replied, \"The detective and I were just looking for a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And you think your he's here?\" Tonya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know he is...\" Luna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya raised an eyebrow before crossing her arms, \"And what makes you so sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You said <i>he</i>, I never said whether my friend was male or female,\" Luna replied with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya hung her head before giving a slight chuckle, \"Oh my, you are good... Please come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira glared at her mom in surprise, \"What are you doing?\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya simply smiled before patting her daughter on her shoulder, \"Don't worry about it sweetheart, everything will be fine.\" The four anthros continued to walk and talk on their way to the kitchen with Shira not sure of what to make of the situation while her mom seemed perfectly okay with all that had transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the wolf and the Doberman moved deeper into the house house, you waited for them to make it into the kitchen before quietly descending down the stairs and heading towards the kitchen doorway. You catch the group in mid conversation before everyone stops and looks at you. Luna cuts herself off in mid sentence before walking over to you and standing within arms reach of you. She gives you a warm and gentle smile before kneeling down to your level. She ruffles your hair and pulls you close for a hug, \"Hello my little human!\" While she's hugging you, you notice that Shira's tail has flared up and she's crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doberman, whom you'd recognized from your escape approached you just as Luna released you before standing back up to her full height. \"Hello there Kiba Lockheart, I gave you a word to remember, do you recall what it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You briefly wonder what she's talking about before it hits you, \"It was Mercy wasn't it?\" You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She gives you a toothy grin before ruffling your hair like Luna did, \"I'm flattered that you remembered my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You smile at her while Shira continued to stare at you in an irritable fashion. \"So...\" She started, \"What exactly is your relationship to <i>'our little human'</i>\" She demanded. You could tell that this whole situation was bothering her but you kinda understood why. It was like having a best friend that you've known forever start hanging out with somebody else more than you... that would make anyone jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Actually, they helped me escape the police and Deluma when I first got here.

Otherwise she wouldn't be so intent on finding them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna sighed, \"At any rate, we still don't know how to find the other two humans so for now all we can do is protect the one we've got,\" She said as she looked toward you at which point you were sitting on Shira's abdomen and subduing her with a belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya nodded, \"I suppose your right... but I don't think we should tell any of this to Kiba... at least not until we have something solid to go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mercy looked taken aback, \"Why not? Doesn't he have a right to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not if it puts him at greater risk,\" Tonya replied, \"He's already feisty and somewhat brash as it is, keeping him inside and out of sight is hard enough. Could you imagine how hard that would become if we gave him something to go out and look for? Like say... a human or two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna nodded, \"I don't like keeping him in the dark about this but your right, with his personality, keeping him from searching for them would be difficult to say the least. And it would put him right in Deluma's grasp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before headed out, both of them walked over to you, Luna bent down and ruffled you're hair a bit before standing upright and grinning down at you, \"Try to stay outta trouble, alright?\" She chuckled before tapping your nose with one of her claws and walking out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she walked out Mercy came up to you and scooped you up in a big hug before giving you a warm smile and patting you on your shoulder, \"See ya soon,\" She said as she followed Luna out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya waved goodbye and smiled to the two until she closed the door. She then regarded Shira with a stern glare, \"Grounded for the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira's eyes bulged and her ears drooped, \"MOOOOM! Tomorrow's Saturday! That's when I do all of my shopping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tonya crossed her arms, \"Then you can thank me for saving you some money by keeping you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You snickered a bit drawing the attention of both canines to you, \"He snuck out!\" Shira exclaimed, \"Doesn't he get some kind of punishment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You just let me worry about that,\" Tonya replied, \"But for now, its time to change his bandages.\" She said that last part with a devious grin. While you had recovered for the most part, there were a couple of wounds that were still tender to the touch and still healing, hence the bandages. They were on your back and shoulder so you couldn't change them yourself, which meant either Shira or Tonya had to help you. The problem was, no matter how gentle they were it still hurt like the dickens, and in light of the previous events, you were willing to bet that they'd use this to their advantage. You don't waste time standing around and bolt out of the room, but you don't make it far before Tonya's twin tails wrap around each of your legs and trip you. You fall to the ground with a grunt before Tonya begins to drag you to the bathroom. \"Shira, could you bring me the antiseptic?\" Tonya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira grins and walks into the kitchen while Tonya uses her tails to reel you into her bathroom, you claw and kick trying to get free over her tails. Eventually she gets you in and repositions her tails so that they're coiled around you like ropes and your arms are pinned to your side. \"I'm back,\" Shira calls out as she enters the bathroom, \"All I could find was this old bottle of... <i>rubbing alcohol</i>\" she stated with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess that'll have to do,\" Tonya replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You felt your shirt being rolled up by Shira, \"By the way,\" She whispered in your ear, \"I'm not at all mad at how you outted me about that movie thing, so don't worry about me taking revenge by taking advantage of the situation, m'kay? I'm just doing this because it has to be done,\" You could practically hear her smiling as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shira, I swear one day I'm gonna get you- Yoooouuusshshh\" You howled as Shira ripped the first bandage away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She leaned toward you and put a hand to her ear \"Sorry, I didn't quite get that.\" She continued changing the bandages and sterilizing the wound. Though she was gentle in reapplying the new bandages, she made it painfully clear that she was rather bitter about you getting her grounded as she removed the old ones and sterilized your wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhh, siblings, no matter in what dimension, country, or city... you'll always have that love-hate-rivalry thing going on. So life's good... ish for you all things considered... but what about Deluma? What is it that she's plotting? Maybe we should pay her a visit?</span></div></div>",

As she did she heard a knock at her door. \"Yes? Who is it?\" She asked in an irritated and tired tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A gruff voice replied from behind the door, \"I've brought you the human you asked for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deluma immediately set her papers aside and looked up at the door, \"Oh good,\" She answered, her voice taking a more pleasant tone, \"Please send him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The door opened and a middle aged man was roughly pushed into the room, \"H-hello Mayor Deluma...\" He shakily greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello Tom,\" Silvia replied, \"Please come in.\" Tom carefully nodded and did as he was told. He heard the door slam shut behind him as he went further into the office. \"Please,\" Deluma implored while gesturing to the two chairs sitting in front of her desk, \"Have a seat.\" Tom did as he was told and sat in one of the two vacant chairs. Once he was situated, he stared timidly up at the Mayor's towering form. \"How are you Tom?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom thought about his response carefully, he was a prisoner against his will. He'd been tortured and forced to bring other humans from across time and space to this accursed world where they would either serve Deluma or suffer her wrath. He lived in constant fear of her and all of the other anthros that inhabited this world. He was stripped of his dignity and technology with no hope of going home... he wanted to tell her that he was horrible, that he wanted to go home. He wanted to jump on her desk and shout how angry he was at her... but he knew that whatever relief he'd gain from that outburst would be very short lived. So he told her what she expected him to say, \"I'm doing well... how are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deluma sighed and took her glasses off, exposing her golden eyes, \"Honestly Tom, I'm a little distressed and frustrated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom was confused, he still didn't even understand what he was doing there, but he guessed it had something to do with how she felt. Not knowing what else to do he asked the obvious question that she'd left for him to ask, \"What has you feeling that way?\" He inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deluma stood up from her desk before walking over to her window which overlooked the city. \"I don't know if you're aware... but your device has brought three new humans to our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom shrugged, \"I was aware that it was <i>supposed</i> to bring three new humans to our city, but I wasn't sure if it actually did the job as they never appeared at the target coordinates that you provided me with.\" Tom was a quantum physicist by trade, and he'd invented a machine that would take him to other worlds and parallel dimensions. However, he never could have predicted that it would bring him right to Silvia Deluma's doorstep. He came prepared in a powered armored suit to repel any threats... but he hadn't considered the possibility that the trip to the world he was now trapped in would damage said suit. Deluma took advantage of the opportunity and seized him. She then made him an offer that he literally couldn't refuse. He was to modify the machine to bring her more humans with more ideas and technology that she could use and sell for her own benefit, she would then dispose of said humans when they were 'no longer of use'. Tom had so far outlived every human he'd brought to this world, only because Deluma needed him to work the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"See, that's what distresses me Tom. I gave you the target coordinates and the machine sent them to open and public areas where the whole world could see them and then they were afforded the opportunity to escape,\" Deluma explained while keeping her back to him and staring out of the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see,\" Tom replied, \"That is rather-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"-I suppose...\" Deluma interjected, \"What this means is there's a malfunction somewhere in the machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom nodded, \"It probably has to do with the targeting sensor. I'm sure I can figure it out with a few-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deluma then cut Tom off again, \"But then of course that leaves one other explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And what explanation might that be?\" Tom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deluma spun around and gave Tom a neutral look, \"You reprogrammed the targeting sensors and sent the human's just within reach of me while setting them up for a fair chance of escape.\" Whatever pleasantness was in Deluma's voice before had faded into bitterness as her tails began to flick about behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't deny that it is in fact a viable conclusion...\" Tom admitted, \"But why would I do something that would put me at risk like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deluma bared her fangs and growled at Tom, \"That's why you're here. I don't know, but I'm very interested to know what made you think you could cross me and get away with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I'm done putting innocent people in harms way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deluma smirked, \"You were going to die the minute I found out you were working against me, I just wanted to know why you did it. For a short while I thought that you might have been expecting help from someone outside of my influence... but it looks like I was worried for nothing.\" Deluma then got up and stretched before looking at her watch, \"Oh!

Tom backed away from her but he didn't get far before two of her tails lashed out and wrapped around his ankles before yanking him to the floor and dragging him back towards Deluma who was licking her lips in anticipation. He clawed desperately at the carpet out of instinct but it did very little in the way of stopping him. Eventually he found himself hanging upside down and face to face with Deluma, \"Funning thing about humans...\" She grinned, \"Usually when you 'dispose' of someone, its a chore... but humans make it a pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At hearing this Tom grimaced before smashing his fist into Deluma's jaw, \"You monster!\" He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deluma flinched at the sudden attack but maintained her hold on Tom, she scowled at him before wrapping a tail around his waist, effectively binding both of his arms to his sides.

You slept, had a dream you couldn't remember and then woke up after sunrise. You decided to just be lazy for a moment and lay in bed, not like you had a pressing engagement or anything, right? It was then that you heard noise coming from the room next door; Shira's room. You didn't think much of it first, but then you realized that more than likely, today was her day off. You leapt out of bed and scrambled towards your dresser where you kept the clothes that Tonya had bought you (Some were from the store Shira worked at and others were picked up by Tonya at the anthro equivalent of a thrift shop). You hurriedly grabbed some jeans and a t-shirt and flung your bedroom door open. Just ahead of you, Shira had stopped to look at you after getting only one foot out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira stared at you and then down at the bathroom at the end of the hall, \"Don't even think about it,\" She warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You glared at her, \"You know I can't let you go first right?\" You asked. The fact was that Shira was a fox... that being said, an anthro with fur will typically take twice as long in the bathroom as a human <i>because</i> of their fur. But Shira was also a girl, which meant that her showers were double the length of the typical anthro of her species. Long story short, what this meant for you was if she got into the bathroom first, there would be no hot water to shower with and you wouldn't be able to use the restroom until she was done... thirty five minutes later... This resulted in you and Shira fighting over the bathroom on mornings when she was off of work and at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira inched a little further into the hall, \"You know you can't stop me,\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You took a torturously slow step out of your room, \"I don't need to <i>stop</i> you, I just have to get into the bathroom <i>before</i> you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira smirked and took a step towards the bathroom, \"Not gonna happen shrimp.\" Without warning, Shira turned and made a break for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thinking fast, you balled up your t-shirt and threw it just ahead of Shira's face. The shirt opened up like a parachute and blanketed her face, the result was immediate as she stumbled into the wall and fell onto the floor. You took the opportunity to run past her, you're goal was nearly in sight, but before you got too much further you felt a paw grab your right leg causing you to fall as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira then bounced up and barreled towards the bathroom, \"Nice try,\" She chuckled as she ran past you. But you noticed that she was still on the rug that sat in the middle of the hallway. You quickly got to your knees and gave the rug a hard tug, tripping the vixen up a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You took that time to capitalize on your latest move, you sprint over Shira and into the bathroom. Shira was still getting to her feet when you ran through the doorway. She charged at the doorway in an effort to get through the door andd knock you down before you could lock her out. \"Oh no you don't!\" You called as you slammed the door shut as fast as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira's face fell as she saw the door closing in slow motion, \"Noooo!\" She shrieked. You were able to close and lock the door just before the desperate vixen crashed into it with a loud thud, \"Ow!\" Shira cried as she fell to the ground in a crumpled heap and massaged her sore snout with one paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You pumped your fist in victory, \"Nice try,\" You commented, making sure that it was juuuuust loud enough for Shira to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You could hear Shira growling on the other side of the door, \"I swear Kiba, if there's no hot water left by the end of my shower I will crush you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You chuckle a bit to yourself. You knew for a fact that she would have hot water at the beginning of her shower, but you also knew that there wouldn't be any hot water by the time she was halfway done. '<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, life's never dull with you is it? You get to savor victory in the form of soothing hot water and a non damp bathroom to take a shower in. The question is, what happens when you get out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's bigger than you, more stealthy than you and let's not forget that she's faster and stronger too. But you do have one advantage, you're a human. You can adapt to the situation. You know that she's expecting you to try to slip by her quietly and into you're room. So you decide to surprise her by doing the exact opposite. You fling the door open and dash toward you're room, you don't stop, look back or slow down. You slam the door as soon as your inside and lock it before slumping down against it. Less than two seconds after you locked the door you heard heavy footsteps followed by a loud thud which is enough to send a jolt through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira let out a small moan, \"It's just not fair...\" She groaned before slinking off into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You chuckled to yourself, \"Life isn't fair! Get used to it!\" You heard Shira's muffled growl through the door but knowing that she couldn't get you, she left to take her long and presumably cold shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For the rest of the day it was business as usual, nothing special happened. Tonya left for work and you and Shira were getting along just fine and watching television. Shira was sprawled out on the couch and you were leaning up against it, just in front of her, every so often her tail would hit you in the face, whether she did it on purpose or not you couldn't tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An hour or two rolled by and then there was a knock at the door. Shira rose up to answer it and found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm... visitors? Here? At this hour? Well... actually it makes sense for them to visit at this time of the day, so disregard that last question. Anyway, who was at the door?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's a little taller than Shira, maybe about a foot? She's got long white hair that reaches down to her mid back. She had grey eyes and wore a black tank top with denim shorts.

Get off of me! What do you think you're doing!?\" Shira bucked and writhed, trying to get the slightly larger anthro off of her, but the cat proved far stronger than the canine as she remained the dominant fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Find him,\" The feline ordered, \"A hooded figure entered the house, it closed the door and ran into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You had just gotten up and were headed for the entryway where Shira was when you found a gray hooded figure in front of you. It was about your height and there was a set of ears poking up through the top of the hoodie the figure wore. It stood there in blue denim jeans and a plain black hoodie. The figure then motioned for you to follow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shook your head, \"No I'm good here, thanks.\" The figure motioned for you to follow a second time. \"Look, I'm not going now get outta my way!\" You try to push by the figure, but it pushes you back and blocks you're path. \"What? I gotta go through you first?\" You ask. The figure nodded once and then got into a fighting stance. \"Right, of course,\" You muttered as you got into your boxing stance. You inch toward the figure and throw a punch but it easily ducked your punch and returned it with an uppercut. You staggered backwards, you weren't by any means a world class featherweight boxer but you knew a thing or two, and the punch that just landed on you was not the punch of an amateur. You decided to take the defensive and planted yourself while squaring your shoulders and guarding your face with your fists. The figure on the other hand, charged you. You figured if you could dodge its initial attack, you could follow up with a counter attack. The figure leapt impossibly high and threw its knee at your face. You ducked and avoided the knee, but before you could even turn around, you felt a force constricting around your neck, making it difficult to breathe. It didn't take long for you to realize that you were in a headlock. You desperately try to pry your attacker's arm from around your neck but you can't seem to find the leverage you need. You're vision was starting to blur, you had to think of something quick! You decide to let gravity help you with your problem. You leapt into the air before hitting the hard wooden floor on your back, sandwiching you're attacker between you and the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaaaan it looks like you're in for the fight of your life! The audience came expecting a blowout... BUT THIS IS A BRAAAAAWL. So the question for right now is... can you find a way out of this headlock or do you pass out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You decide it'd be better if you use the situation against the shadow (That's what we'll call the 'figure' for now. I don't want to keep referring to it as 'the figure' and its a little too early to reveal who said 'figure' is, so we'll just call it 'shadow' for the time being.) Shadow clearly has the advantage, and it knew it. So you decided to take it a step further by giving shadow exactly what it wanted. You slowly let your body go limp while holding your breath and closing your eyes. You just sat there, motionless. Eventually, shadow released you from the chokehold. The minute it did you rolled over and pinned it to the ground, you didn't think it'd be able to do much now that you had the advantage. But to your surprise and disadvantage, it bucked its  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0torso and threw you off. You rolled off of shadow's body before getting back to your feet. In the struggle, you noticed that shadow's hood had come off. You were surprised to find that there was what looked like a 3D shadow of a head with black cat ears poking out of the top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two of you stood there staring at each other, \"What are you?\" You asked. Shadow for its part came at you again making a dive for you. You managed to dodge to the side and center yourself before shadow came back with a series of punches and kicks. You moved backwards steadily, avoiding or deflecting them as necessary. It was clear that you were outmatched as far as fighting goes, shadow; whoever and whatever it was, had advanced knowledge  of hand to hand combat and you did not. <i>\"If this keeps up I'm toast\"</i> You thought as you felt your back hit a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're coming with us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You glanced over to the doorway to find the leopard standing there.

The shadow let out what you could swear sounded like a feminine grunt. \"Who are you!?\" You shouted, more irritated than anything else. But before you could say or do much else you felt something grasp your shoulder. You glanced down at your shoulder to find a large white paw on your shoulder. Before you could react, it firmly grasped your shoulder before tossing you across the room. You slammed into a wall on the opposite side of the room. Shadow recovered before err... expressing 'herself' (at least you think its a she) to the snow leopard. It was like watching a television on mute. The gestures were there and the body language was clearer than words could ever be. Apparently, shadow was upset at the leopard for intervening and taking said intervention to such an extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The snow leopard however, seemed unfazed and remained neutral as she shrugged her shoulders before approaching you. You attempted to skirt around her, but she managed to catch you by your arm and hoisted you off of the ground. You flailed desperately as you tried to get loose, but to no avail. Before long you shadow holding a rag up to your face. You initially swatted it away with your free hand but the leopard brought you down and pinned you to the ground, allowing shadow to easily hold the rag over your face. You found it very difficult to breathe, no doubt thanks to whatever it was the rag had been dowsed in. Slowly but surely, you were losing consciousness, and this time you weren't faking it. Slowly, you began to wake. Your vision returned to you slowly, everything was blurry at first but after a while it cleared up. You were able to see that you were in a bedroom. It was most likely a guest bedroom given how basic it was and the lack of personal items and knick knacks. You tried to get out of the chair but you found your arms were tied to the armrests, You attempted walking but found the chair to be far to heavy for you to even consider lifting it, never mind walk with it. Suffice to say you weren't going anywhere, all you could do now, was wait. Of course with you being, well, you, sitting and waiting simply wouldn't do. You struggled against the restraints with all you had. You twisted and turned in an effort to tip the chair and at one point you even resorted to attempting to chew through the ropes, eventually though you just settled for resting for a while. Whether your a trained spy or an outraged kid, sometimes you just have to accept that there are some situations you just can't control. All you can do it sit tight, refresh yourself on what you already know, and wait for an opening... regardless of how boring it might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm, well I'll be honest, I always hated the waiting game. It's soooo boring, it's like a torture in itself... but its not like you don't already know that, right Kiba? So you're waiting, what happens when that door opens? Who comes through it?</span></div></div>",

It walked in and looked you both up and down. Shira grabbed you by the back of your shirt and pulled you behind her before growling at shadow like a dog would at an intruder. But to both your surprise', shadow put its arms up as if to show it meant no harm and backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's not necessary,\" A voice called from behind shadow. After a moment an anthro lynx walked in. He was short and honestly kinda geeky looking. He wore gray cargo shorts and a plaid button up shirt. He had a pair of large round glasses on his muzzle and to top it all off he was even wearing shin-high white socks along with classic black and white sneakers. He stood at the six foot mark and had a very light body build..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know who you are or why we're here... but we've had our house broken into, been kidnapped and tied up. So from where I stand its completely necessary!\" Shira snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lynx adjusted his glasses and stepped back a bit, \"I can see your point, but we had our reasons for doing what we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira growled at the lynx again while making sure to keep you close behind her, you were standing just behind her arm and you could feel her tail touching your back; probably to make sure nobody tries to get you from behind. \"What reasons could you possibly  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0have for doing this to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" The lynx started, \"First and foremost, we wanted to make sure <i>he</i> was safe,\" He stated while pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My brother?\" Shira returned coldly, \"He was perfectly safe until you barged into our home and hauled us out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds to me like he <i>wasn't</i> that safe if we were able to take him from you without your consent,\" The lynx stated. You could tell by the way Shira's body tensed up that she wanted nothing more than to tear that lynx apart for what he'd just said. But the only thing that kept her from doing just that was the fact that he was right and she knew it. \"But I wasn't referring to his safety from threats <i>outside</i> of your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The what kind of threats <i>are</i> you referri-\" Shira cut herself off as she realized what the lynx was suggesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sure you realize how rare humans are. You could even say they're exotic.

She seemed to calm down after seeing the concern written on your face. Both the lynx and shadow looked on with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After taking a deep breath Shira stood upright and tossed a glare at the lynx, \"I would never do that to him.

She had ice blue eyes and wore a pair of secretary's glasses atop her muzzle. Her body build was thick, much thicker than Shira or Tonya's but you had no doubt that she was in shape by the way she carried herself. She was clothed in a black skirt that stopped just short of her knees along with a white button up long sleeved shirt which had both top buttons undone. The tiger turned to the lynx, \"You two may go, we have a lot to discuss so please ensure that we will not be disturbed.\" With that, the lynx and shadow left the room, closing the door behind them.

On the flip side of that, Shira knows you well enough to know what your thinking, so when it comes down to it 'he who is the fastest shall be victorious'... or something like that.

Computers and screens lined the walls, tables with various colored chemicals spread upon them in beakers and test tubes sat at the back of the room, and in the center of the room was what looked like a robot. It was humanoid and about six feet tall in appearance. It was suspended by chains under its arms and a hook on its back. It reminded you a lot of the wing gundam; a machine from an anime you used to watch. But there were several differences. The faceplate was white and featureless with the exception of two darkened 'eyes'. Besides those, the only significant feature was that at the base of the jawline one either side of the head there where what appeared to be fins that extended vertically one either side, each one stopping a few inches over the head which gave the appearance of almost foxlike 'ears'. The body itself had no real special features with the exception of its wings which seemed to com right off of the wing gundam. The overall color of the machine was blue and white. Its torso was blue while all other extremities with the exception of the wing were white. You also notice that on its shins where what looked like air intakes, most likely for additional thrusters underneath the feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You walk around the machine for a few moments stricken with awe before you bring yourself to ask the question that plagues your mind, \"What is it?\" Shira, who was also shocked by the discovery snaps her attention over to Sandra who'd been watching the scene with an amused smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We call it EF-01,\" Sandra explains as she moves so that she's standing face to face with it, \"This machine, according to what we've uncovered is actually an armor... a powered suit... or as it's known in our database, an exoframe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What was it designed for?\" You ask as you step behind the 'exoframe' to get a better look at its wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It was designed to help humans fight on equal terms with anthros,\" Sandra replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira exchanged glances of surprise with you, \"How can that be? Nobody from where Kiba comes from has any idea we exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sandra nodded, \"That is true... but Kiba and this exoframe did not come from the same world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean?\" You ask, suddenly losing all interest in the exoframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"EF-01 was discovered here, in our world about two weeks ago,\" Sandra continued, \"However, carbon dating places it back approximately two hundred years in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that even possible?\" Shira asked, \"It looks more advanced than anything I've ever seen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"While I do play a serious role here I also work at a museum. Lately, we've been doing a little research about our history as well as a little digging around in the sand and dirt both literally and metaphorically,\" Sandra explained. \"Over the past year or so we've been finding strong evidence that humans once coexisted in this world with anthros. In addition to that, we found that the humans that were living here were actually indigenous to this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, they naturally lived here?\" Shira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's correct,\" Sandra confirmed as she nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't understand, if they naturally lived here... then why was I brought here from another world filled with only humans while this one has anthros as the dominate species? Shouldn't we be native to where I came from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sandra sighed, \"Actually no, you're native to this world like we are, or more accurately your ancestors are. It appears that they did the reverse of what Deluma is doing now. They invented a device to take them to another world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira's eyes lit up, \"So that must be the world that Kiba came from, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sandra nodded and grinned, \"Precisely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But... if that's the case, why did the humans leave this world to begin with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sandra frowned and adjusted her glasses, \"Well, unfortunately while we are still in the process of trying to confirm it, we do have one prevailing theory. Anthros and humans went to war with one another... which unfortunately is why this exoframe was created.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow... Didn't see that one coming, that was like a sucker punch to the crotch! Somebody needs to go back and rewrite those history books because they left that part out!

She focused her eyes on you, \"The only reason you beat me, was because you were too unpredictable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You scratch your head in confusion, \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before anymore could be said, the snow leopard that broke into your house to kidnap you walked into the room. \"She's upset that I apprehended you and not her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You and Shira exchange confused glances while Sandra smothers a grin, \"The human there is known a Terra while the leopard is Sarah. They have been a part of our more... public actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In other words kidnapping humans?\" Shira questioned with a bit of venom in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sandra nodded, \"When necessary they sometimes do bring humans who may be in danger to our facility here. Though I have to say while their techniques and strategies are refined, they lack... tact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira scoffed, \"That's an understatement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You had been listening to the conversation between Shira and Sandra while at the same time thinking about Terra and Neil. You wanted to get to know them more. Did they get brought here the same way you did? Did they have a plan to go back? How long had they been here? What other anthros did they meet and befriend? You were lost in thought as you began to lean up against a wall when Sandra reached out and grabbed you by the shoulder and gently tugged you away from the wall, \"Please be more careful about what you touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look behind you to find a large red button, it looks like the kind of button you press when everything has gone wrong and you're all out of options. \"What does that thing even do anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Actually its pretty neat!\" Neil interjected, \"Its actually a precaution. In the unlikely event that any less than civilized individuals make their way down here and try to steal our resident exoframe this button can be pressed to seal them out by closing fire doors to all entrances of the hangar. It also leaves a way out for the pilot of the exoframe. Since its a flight type, the ceil'n has an escape shaft that can be used to leave the facility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before anymore can be said, a loud alarm sounds briefly before a voice comes over loudspeakers, \"Attention in the facility, would the director please come to the control room immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sandra's normally (From what you've seen) cheerful disposition changed to a grim and serious one. She then turned to you and Shira, \"Come with me,\" She says as she leaves the hangar. You and Shira glance at each other before running after Sandra, followed by Terra, Neil and Sarah. She leads you down a series of hallways until you come to a room that reminded you of the mission control room at the Houston Space Center. There where news feeds, social media sights and video recordings all over the screens. Various anthros manned different stations, each busy with his or her work. Finally, a bear walked up to Sandra before handing her a piece of paper and going back into the controlled chaos of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's happening?\" Shira demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It seems that Deluma is attempting to bring another human from their world to ours,\" Sandra replied while reading the report she'd been handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before anyone could ask any more questions or say anything else a male badger sitting at one of the consoles turned in his chair to face Sandra, \"I have a confirmed visual!\" He called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Put it up on the main monitor,\" Sandra commanded. He nodded and punched a few buttons on his console before the image of a young girl appeared on the screen. She was on the sidewalk in front of a store. Many anthros had stopped to stare at her, much like they had when you first appeared. The girl seemed to be somewhere between fourteen and sixteen years old. She looked scared and lost as she ran into a nearby alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We have to help her!\" You shouted more out of urgency than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sandra glanced down at you out of the corner of her eye before returning her attention to the matter at hand, \"Do we have any responders in the area?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Only one ma'am, but he's two miles away and there's an seventy five percent chance of exposure,\" An otter on the other side of the room replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sandra growled and clenched her fangs, \"There's nothing we can do for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nothing you can do!?\" You demanded, \"You have a whole organization here and your telling me you can't save that little girl because-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because we'd be exposed!\" Sandra snapped, \"Don't you think I want to help her!? But if I send someone in and they are discovered helping her then the organization will be put at risk of being exposed and if that happens then we won't be able to help anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You opened your mouth to argue, but you couldn't. You knew what she was saying was perfectly logical and made sense. You could only clench your fist in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She's right,\" Terra replied. You turned to find her standing behind you with her arms crossed and a neutral expression across her face. \"All we can do is wait and hope for a miracle. If she by some stroke of luck manages to escape Deluma's grasp then we can go in and scoop her up. But for now, all we can do is watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turned to Neil who sighed sadly and nodded, \"We've got no choice. If Deluma's people find the anthros responsible for helping humans like us, then they'll track them back to this organization and we'll all be finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You grunted in anger before turning and leaving the room, \"We've all got a choice,\" You muttered. Shira seemed to have felt the same way, however she did not voice it as she quietly followed you out of the room. You stood with your arms crossed in the hallway as Shira approached you from behind and put a hand on your shoulder. \"I can't just stand by and let this happen,\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira sighs sadly and rubs your back in an effort to comfort you, \"I know its hard to accept but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You pull away from Shira and look her squarely in the eyes, \"Let me rephrase that, I'm not going to stand by and let this happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira's sympathetic expression changes to one of concern, \"What are you going to do?\" She asks with a mixture of concern and weariness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm going to save that little girl,\" You reply solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira rolled her eyes in annoyance, \"Yeah, I got that but <i>how</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm going to use the exoframe,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOho snap! You're about to have a legitimate ironman moment! The question is will Shira sympathize with you and help you, or try to stop you out of concern for your safety?</span></div></div>",

It was currently resting at the center of the panel which was faintly glowing in a bluish hue. \"Must be some sort of biometric release or something,\" You mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shira blinked at you as you stood back up from your crouched position, \"Bio-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Its a hand reader,\" You explained, \"A lock that reads your hand to make sure you're the person who's supposed to access whatever is locked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You'll have to tell me more about that later, but right now you need to get moving,\" Shira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right,\" You nodded, \"So how does this thing work?\" You mutter as you walk around to the front of the exoframe. The front of the suit has been peeled away, granting access to the inside. \"Do I just stand in it?\" You ask as you step backwards into the armor. The moment your back touches the inner back plate of the suit the armor begins to close over you. \"Oh god...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kiba!\" Shira shouts as she runs towards you, presumably to pull you out of the armor but is unable to reach you quickly enough as the mask and visor close over your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For the first few seconds, its like being in a metal coffin. Its quiet, dark and hard to hear anything happening outside. After a few moments pass however, you hear an artificial, female voice. <i>\"Human presence recognized, startup engaged.\"</i> All you can see is numbers and letters flashing across your field of vision. Before long a diagram of the exoframe is displayed, highlighting various parts and giving percentages and detailed schematics. This goes on for a while until eventually your vision of the outside world fades into view, though you can tell that your looking through a camera of some sort. Albeit, a camera with extremely high resolution, but a camera no less. <i>Startup complete, unit functionality at seventy three percent.

As you streak across the sky, you decide to ask the question that's been bothering you, \"Computer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My designation is Assessment Aid Vector Analysis Algorithm, or A.V.A.A. for short.\" The computer or more accurately A.V.A.A. informed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shook your head and chuckled, \"Yeah, no that's not gonna do it for me. I can't remember all that much less say it in a moments notice. I think I'll call you Ava instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that going to be my new designation?\" Ava asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes it is,\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok then, Ava...\" Ava replied as if trying to decide whether she liked the name or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ava, why is it you sound so human?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's my programming,\" She explained, \"I was designed to adapt and interact with the pilot to get an understanding of what he or she may need. Part of that included my 'human' nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see,\" You mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're approaching the human signature,\" Ava announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where exactly is it?\" You inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In an alleyway, located on the north end of the city... She's not alone. Four anthro signatures have been detected in the vicinity and are rapidly closing in on her,\" Ava warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's the distance between her and the closest anthro?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thirty five feet and closing,\" Ava replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You gave a quick nod, \"Ok, can you land us between it and her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Understood,\" Ava replied. You felt your body shift into what would have been a standing position if there was solid ground beneath your feet. You drop down into the alley and Ava slows your decent with the thrusters. When your feet touch the ground, you are standing in front of four German shepherd anthros with police uniforms on. Behind you, stood a frightened young girl. Upon seeing you the police hounds flinch and two of them even take a step back, but they renew their approach after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This meant that you were still well below the height of the average anthro.

If you wish to speak, you'll have to notify me so that I can reengage the external speaker. Otherwise, you'll just be talking to yourself...

However, before he could touch her you grabbed his wrist, moving only your hand and maintaining your position. The officer looked at you with surprise. He tried to retracted his hand but you maintained your grip before repositioning your body so that you now stood directly between him and the child. At that point you released his wrist with a rough shove. \"I think that gave him the message,\" You remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Message?\" Avaa inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If I can avoid in engaging in a direct conflict then so much the better,\" You explained, \"But I want to make it clear to both the police and the child that she is under my protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All four of the police officers took aggressive stances toward you, \"It appears that they've received you message. It also seems that avoiding direct combat will be out of the question as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It seems so,\" You replied as one of the officers charged you. He seemed unaware of your enhanced strength as he dove in. You responded in kind with a powerful punch. Your fist landed square on the side of his muzzle. His eyes widened in surprise as he staggered backwards. You refused to give him the chance to recover though as you followed up with another punch from your other fist. This one, finding its way to the center of his abdomen, causing the canine to drop to the ground while groaning in pain. The moment you looked up you found yourself being snapped backwards as if some kind of invisible net had entangled you and yanked you away from the downed anthro. You felt your back slam against the alley wall. When you regained you line of sight you found another officer holding you up against the wall by your throat, or more accurately the throat section of your armor. You grasped your attacker's arm with both hands before steadily applying pressure. Initially the German Shepard seemed to simply ignore your subtle attack. However, as you increased your pressure it's effects began clearly showing on his face. Eventually, he exchanged his hold on you for the satisfaction of tossing you across the ground like a tin can. You recovered quickly and got to your feet. You were a little sore but otherwise unhurt, the odds were three on one and you weren't sure if they'd called for backup or not. Part of you said the smart thing to do would be to take the girl and get out. But the more prideful part of you wanted to make them pay for attacking the poor girl and just for the sake of finally being able give them a taste of their own medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can call it and bail or you can stay to finish what you started, but you can't do both. What are ya gonna do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You paused for a moment and looked around yourself before realizing that the nightmare was in fact a reality. You really were stuck in another world where humans were no more than a fairytale. \"Oh...\" You mutter dejectedly, \"Right... not a dream...\" You swing your legs out of bed and position yourself so that your sitting on the side of the bed.

Shira couldn't help but snikcer at your reaction, in turn you were prompted to glare at her.

As Kiba fell he covered his face to minimize the damage. After falling on the cold hard street he felt a set of arms lift him up and put him back on his feet. Shepherd officers stood on either side of him as they dragged him back to Deluma. Calming himself for a moment, Kiba waited for the officers holding him to loosen their grip. After a few seconds of good behavior they did just that, at which point Kiba bolted forward again. He escaped the grip of one of the officers, but the other was able to keep a hold on his arm. With his free arm, Kiba managed to land a hit right on the snout of the canine that still had him. Unfortunately though it only served to make the anthro angry. Before he knew what was happening Kiba was thrust to the ground on his knees and felt a sharp pain strike the back of his head before his vision became blurry and eventually faded into a black abyss. As he opened his eyes the remained glossed over and unfocused. His mouth hung partway open muttering groans of confusion and <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sound of chains clattering nearby came to Kiba as he resurfaced from the darkness to consciousness. As he opened his eyes the remained glossed over and unfocused. His mouth hung partway open muttering groans of confusion. The pain in the back of his head had dulled, but it was still there. His vision was still hazy and his memories were erratic, incomplete and out of order as were his thoughts. As he instinctively moved a hand to place on his aching head he found himself unable as he felt his arm jerk to a stop and heard a metallic clang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha-?\" He muttered as he looked down at his hands to find that his wrists had been shackled and he was chained to the floor. His memories then began flooding back to him all at once. Both relevant and irrelevant memories washed through the human's mind like a tidal wave. His eyes refocused themselves as his pupils dilated, his slack hands balled into fists as they pulled at the chains anchoring him in place. He tried to rise to his feet but found himself unable as he discovered that the chains holding him only granted him enough slack to allow him to stand partway before they went taught and rendered him unable to move in any direction other than down. \"No! No! No!\" Kiba shouted \"This cannot be happening!\" He yanked and twisted in his chains. He tried lunging forward, then launched himself backwards. He sat down to rest for a few seconds before trying to simply stand up and use his leg muscles to break the chains, but he quickly realized that even if it did work, he couldn't do it without breaking both of his wrists in the process. He twisted, jumped, lunged and writhed for half an hour before he fell into a sitting position panting and out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you done yet?\" A voice asked from somewhere in the room.</span></div></div>",

But of course since humans aren't really around anymore I can't study them.\" Deluma explained, \"So imagine my surprise when one just popped up in a bright flash of light, right in my living room. It turned out that he was a scientist from your world. Apparently, he was experimenting with a new technology to transport people and supplies over large distances. Obviously it hadn't worked out quite the way he imagined it would. It turns out that he'd reinvented the same device that allowed humans to leave this world in a mass exodus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It was a teleporter...\" Kiba realized, but his astonishment soon turned to rage when he realized how he had come to be trapped in the world he was pulled into, \"And now you're using it to bring humans from my world to this one! Why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why does anybody do anything? To benefit myself, that's why,\" Deluma laughed. She then snapped her fingers causing several lights to shine down on Kiba and illuminate his new room. It was barren. Concrete walls, ceiling and floor. A single bed and basic bathroom. It was at that moment he realized he was in a prison cell. \"Aside from that, the other reason is to satisfy my curiosity. I want to know everything about your race. I want to understand them, learn how they can be useful to me and of course... learn how to conquer them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba's eyes widened, \"You... want to conquer... my world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deluma grinned, \"Yes I do. I believe I've already told you... I own everything in this region, including you, this city... and a private military corporation.

And they'll all live under my rule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"One lone PMC won't be able to handle something like that, anthros or not,\" Kiba argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deluma smirked down at him, \"Of course not! I'm a business woman. I'm closing deals with some of those other wealthy anthros I mentioned earlier. It'll take some effort and doing, and of course we'll have to fine tune the teleporter... but it won't be long before we're able to use it to send our troops all over your world in an instant and take the humans by complete surprise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why tell me all of this?\" Kiba demanded, \"Do you plan to kill me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If I were going to do that I wouldn't have you in chains...

I need to know what they're capable of and gauge their physical strengths and weaknesses. So I have you, I'll put you through tests of strength, endurance and of course intellect,\" She finished as she tapped her forehead with one of her index claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I won't cooperate,\" Kiba replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh I think you will,\" Deluma returned, \"Because if you don't, you will be the last one to suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Kiba asked with a quizzical expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deluma tilted her head to look at the steel door that allowed access into your cell, \"Bring her in.\" Two German Shepards opened the door and dragged in a human woman. She had fair skin and looked to be in her early twenties, she had black hair and wore denim jeans with a white tank top. You couldn't really tell much else as she was kept a fair distance away from you. \"There are four other humans here besides you, this is one of them,\" Deluma stated as she gestured to the girl they'd brought in. \"If you refuse to cooperate with the tests, attempt to escape, refuse to obey commands or annoy me, <i>you</i> will not be punished, <i>they</i> will. As far as how they're punished, that depend entirely upon my mood. I might let them slide every now and again, then again I might have a bad day and decide to break a bone or two... or...\" Deluma licked her lips, \"I might get hungry and indulge my more... predatory nature...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You monster!\" Kiba shouted as a thrashed in his chains, \"And you expect me not to fight this?! Or are you just looking for an excuse to kill humans and torture my conscience for your own sick and twisted amusement!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"On the contrary! I <i>expect</i> you to,\" Deluma replied, \"That flame of defiance that burns in you is what I find myself absolutely enthralled by! From the moment I met you, a strong will and lack of fear combined with an agile body and strong bones is what has set you apart from the other humans I've seen thus far. I'd be a fool not to expect some level of defiance from you, but I expect you to be smart enough to know when to reign yourself in... otherwise, I might lose my temper and take it out on someone... who isn't as strong as you are...\" Deluma replied as she cupped the young human girl's face in her hand. The girl silently cried and tried to look away but was unable. Deluma then released her and waved a hand to the two officer holding the poor girl. They nodded and dragged her out of the room, \"So then, do we have an understanding?\" Kiba said nothing, he could only glower at Deluma with disdain. \"Good!\" Deluma smiled as she walked out of the room, \"Be sure to get plenty of rest! You're going to need it~\" With that Deluma left the room and locked the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Kiba had no doubt that she was watching his every move from some hidden control room, as always. <i>\"You're goal is to make it across the finish line by any means necessary,\"</i> As she finished her sentence a spotlight shined down on the finish line which consisted of a thick green line across the concrete floor on the other side of the room. <i>\"Keep in mind, this course was designed by humans so the obstacles will be a bit more... interesting compared to what you normally face,\"</i> The mayor warned as Kiba's shackles released him of their own accord. <i>\"You may begin.\"</i> The entire room was then lit up by an array of lights. It was nothing more than a long, concrete, rectangular box. He was normally were dumped into a water tank, forced to carry weights or violently shocked while attempting to navigate a maze. But this seemed rather tame in comparison. However, he remembered Deluma's warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So there's hidden traps littering the place, is that it?\" Kiba asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Why don't you go for a stroll and find out?\"</i> Deluma returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba didn't bother replying. Subconsciously, his focus was locked onto the finish line. But somewhere, he was aware of the situation he was in and he wondered if he'd ever find a way out of it. He started to casually walk towards the opposite end of the room, but midstride in his fourth step, he burst into a sprint. As he sprinted across the floor he felt something strike the toe of his shoe causing him to trip and stumble before he fell onto his side. <i>\"It's been a month now...\"</i> He thought as he got back to his feet and continued his sprint toward the finish. As he ran he noticed random squares of floor began depressing themselves into the ground. His sprint changed into a spirited game of hopscotch as he traversed the changing landscape. <i>\"This wasn't the life I was meant for, but...\"</i> Kiba's thoughts were suddenly interrupted as a large section of ground shot skyward in the shape of a cylindrical pillar. Unable to stop himself, he put his arms up to protect his front side as he glanced off of the side of the pillar. <i>\"...Suicide isn't an option, and I'm not in a position to escape without endangering the others...\"</i> A few more pillars shot up from the ground, Kiba juked and sprinted around them with ease. <i>\"Engaging Deluma head on isn't an option either, she's got dozens of guards and in a one on one fight I'd be crushed....\"</i> There wasn't much space left between him and the finish line. Kiba began his final sprint when a series of walls began rising out of the floor. The first couple were easy for Kiba to vault over. However, towards the end, the last few rose higher than the human could jump, forcing him to climb atop the walls as the rose and leap from one wall to the next. <i>\"Looks like I'm in another now win scenario yet again, dead if I try anything and doomed if I don't...\"</i> Kiba chuckled to himself as he dropped down from the final wall and crossed the finish line <i>\"Story of my life... or... whatever's left of it anyway.\"</i></span></div></div>",

There\u2019s not much to listen to, but Kiba tries his best anyways. It\u2019s about numbers. Kiba sighs, the room opens in front of him and the normal guards come out and escort Kiba back to his cell. Hours pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sits there, angry with his options, and disappointed that he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. A scowl forms on his face as he thinks of Deluma and her annoying voice telling him what to do and threatening him if he doesn\u2019t. Across from him, when he looks through the glass screen in the door, are the humans that Deluma keeps threatening to kill. Deluma seemed to have gotten two more humans. Obviously there was the first from before, then eventually a man in an older age was brought here, then a young girl who couldn\u2019t have been more than fourteen. A Definite pattern between these people is that none of them were expecting to be here, all of them dressed for different occasions. THe older man had short, gray hair and was dressed for golf, and the girl looks like she was just ready for school, <i>she</i> was just brought here a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them were startled when the door to the hallway was opened. Kiba gets up and jumps, catching the lip of the glass\u2019 frame to hold himself up. He looks through the small window to see two anthros holding another human. A fifth human. He doesn\u2019t struggle when they lead him down the hallway. The anthros stop between Kiba\u2019s door and the opposite door. They communicate and turn their attention towards Kiba\u2019s door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith flawless reaction, Kiba lets go and backs up from the door. It opens and they toss in the human. He stumbles a bit but doesn\u2019t fall. He turns around just as the door closes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Kiba, right?\u201d The man guesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, how\u2019d you know?\u201d Kiba responds. He then answers his own question, \u201cDeluma right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Where are we.\u201d The man says. He turns around again and faces Kiba. Kiba finally gets a good look at the man. He has glasses, and wears a polo that looks like it belongs in a college. He wears normal pants and running shoes. \u201cMy name is Niel.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor one thing, all I know is that we\u2019re stuck in a cell together. And if you\u2019re in here, it must mean that maybe Deluma decided you were fit for tests.\u201d Kiba explains to the best of his knowledge. \u201cAcross from us are the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe others\u2026 yes Deluma said she\u2019d\u2026 she\u2019d kill them if we didn\u2019t comply, right?\u201d Niel whispers, he walks over to the door and realizes he\u2019s too short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Kiba grunts. Niel seems to be inspecting the door, and the whole room in fact. Kiba stares at him while he goes around. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are <i>you</i> doing?\u201d Niel retorts, \u201cI\u2019m inspecting the room.\u201d Niel explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? I\u2019ve checked, there\u2019s nothing here but what you see.\u201d Kiba sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d Niel responds. Kiba shakes his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou trying to escape? You\u2019ll get <i>them</i> killed.\u201d Kiba repeats. Niel doesn\u2019t respond. After minutes of inspecting the room, Niel pumps his fist as if something good happened. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d Kiba accuses sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can open the door- pop it off in fact, it would fall anyways.\u201d Niel mumbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready? I can see why Deluma put you in here with me then\u2026\u201d Kiba exclaims. Niel walks back to Kiba. \u201cYou\u2019re really smart.\u201d Niel nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know if she knows how smart I really am, which is good, we can use that to our advantage\u2026\u201d Niel mumbles to himself. \u201cI\u2019m done looking around, actually.\u201d He says normally. Kiba looks at him with an idle expression. Suddenly Niel looks like he\u2019s about to fall. \u201cI should have just sat down when I got the chance, they chased me for so long\u2026\u201d He wobbles over to the wall and Kiba checks to make sure that Niel won\u2019t fall. He sat down, fidgeting with his glasses. \u201cWhy are {i{you in here, Kiba?\u201d He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught off-guard by the question, he says \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I was the most fit?\u201d Kiba makes a gesture towards the other humans, \u201cDeluma probably considered that an old man couldn\u2019t run, a young girl wasn\u2019t fully developed, and\u2026\u201d Kiba pauses, \u201cActually I don\u2019t know why the woman is in there. She looks to be the same age as me. And with these walls I never got to ask her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Kiba had done answering Niel\u2019s question, Niel had fallen asleep. He shakes his head. \u201c<i>Not like I\u2019ve been talking to myself for months or anything\u2026</i>\u201d Kiba thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few hours later and Niel had still been asleep. Kiba, being the strategist that he is, has well learnt the times that the guards came to get him for testing, and knew that they were coming soon. He looks over to Niel who seems to be peacefully unaware of his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Niel.\u201d Kiba says. He gets up and walks over to Niel. He stands over him. \u201cNiel.\u201d Kiba says more sternly. He crouches, slightly annoyed. \u201cNiel!\u201d Kiba exclaims. He shakes the heavy sleeper. Niel wakes up startled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Niel gasps. Kiba rolls his eyes. Niel looks around, \u201cSorry.\u201d he apologizes to Kiba. Kiba nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet ready, they\u2019re about to take us to a test.\u201d Kiba explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA test?\u201d Niel asks. Just then, the door to the concrete room opens and four anthros flood in. Kiba helps Niel up, who looks slightly perturbed. Two anthros grab Kiba, who doesn\u2019t struggle. Niel tries to copy Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are taken to the same room Kiba is tested in. They\u2019re forcefully shoved into the room. Deluma\u2019s static voice floods the room again. \u201c<i>You know the drill, Kiba.</i>\u201d She says. Niel looks around the room for something. \u201c<i>However, Niel, you\u2019ve got to find out for yourself.<i>\u201d There is a menacing chuckle on the other side of the microphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d Niel exclaims. Before Kiba starts walking forward, he turns to Niel, who\u2019s crouched down near the door. Niel places a hand on the wall, obviously inspecting something. \u201cKiba come here.\u201d He beckons. Reluctantly, Kiba scoots over to him. \u201cKick right here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>What are you doing?</i>\u201d Deluma exclaims with a worried voice. Kiba looks around and smiles. Niel just found something important. Kiba turns to kick the wall with all his might. Unexpectedly, the surface crumples from the force of his kick, in fact, his foot got stuck. Wires and sparks flew everywhere and immediately everything went black. \u201c<i>What is-- no, no, N-!</i>\u201d Deluma\u2019s angry protests were cut short. Kiba yanks his foot out of the wall. Alarms were blaring and echoing through the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! Let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d Niel exclaims. Kiba couldn\u2019t believe this was happening, he was going to escape! As he exits the testing room, however, he remembers that the other humans would need help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNiel wait!\u201d Kiba shouted, Niel was down the left hallway a bit. He turns around. \u201cThe others- we have to help them! This way!\u201d Kiba turned and sprinted down the hallway to the right, Niel following. After multiple twists and turns, (and thanks to Kiba\u2019s knowledge), the two finally end up at Kiba\u2019s cell. Luckily, they had not run into any guards. Niel was panting and heaving, clearly he doesn\u2019t run. The door across, the others, was open. Kiba rushes in to see the humans all looking around, anxious and afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked to Kiba, \u201cYou\u2019re- you\u2019re Kiba right?\u201d She exclaims. He nods. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain right now, because I don\u2019t know myself, <i>he</i> knows, but he\u2019s outta breath. We have got to go, now!\u201d Kiba explains. \u201cCome on!\u201d He yells. The three humans rush over to Kiba and Niel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoung man,\u201d The old man gets Kiba\u2019s attention, he then looks into Kiba\u2019s eyes with a relieved expression, \u201cThank you.\u201d He nods. The child stays silent, too scared to say anything. Kiba motions for them to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiel, the old man, the woman, and the child were all following Kiba through this maze of corridors. Kiba suddenly stops. The rest abruptly stop as well. Kiba turns around. They were just ahead of the exit. There were always guards there, in fact, a whole squad. Kiba looks on at the four with a lost expression, mouth agape. He has lead them into a dead end\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiba?\u201d The young girl whispers. Kiba looks down at her. \u201cI wanna go home.\u201d She says, tears start to form in her eyes, her face turning red. Kiba kneels down and meets her at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Kiba comforts her, though stuttering. \u201cJust-...\u201d Kiba suddenly gets an idea. It was a big risk. He stands up as the woman hugs the child. He turns to Niel and the old man. \u201cNiel, make sure you all get out.\u201d Kiba commands cryptically. Niel looks puzzled for a moment, but the old man saw through Kiba immediately. The old man was about to protest, but Kiba had already taken off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i></i></span></div></div>",

Looking up, he sees the exit, guarded by multiple anthros who are armored up. Kiba breathes in, relaxing for a moment before he acts, planning his actions. The door was large, about twice as big as any normal anthro, and the room was large. There are many corridors leading to this gargantuan room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe surges forward, running as fast and as noisily as he can. \u201cHey! Over here!\u201d He shouts. A couple of the guards were visibly startled, but the majority were able to keep their head. They all run forward as Kiba darts out of their vision. Two of them stayed behind to guard the exit. Kiba grunts. Leading most of them off, he hopes for the best that the others are able to make it out. They run behind Kiba, hoping to catch him. No one shoots, even though they have guns. Kiba runs into the test room, and the oblivious guards rush to get him. With his experience, Kiba is able to gracefully dodge the jutting platforms and pillars that obscured the exit door. The guards on the other hand, were stumbling and shouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba makes a full circle. Almost out of breath, he sees the four humans with Niel in the lead. Kiba\u2019s heart sank when he realized that there were still two guards left at the front who were well hidden. They were about to get the jump on them, but Kiba yells, \u201cWatch out!\u201d and runs forward. The two guards, a bat and a shark, were surprised for a moment, but they turned their attention to Kiba. The old man pushed the three others forward and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa\u2019ll ain\u2019t just dealin\u2019 with a youngster, ya gotta deal with me too!\u201d He yells. The guards prepare to be attacked from two sides. Kiba tackled the shark with full force, battering him down to the ground. The old man does the same to the bat. Niel works a nearby control panel, fidgeting and pressing buttons to hopefully open the door. The bat pushed the old man off of him, but the shark has a harder time dealing with Kiba the boxer. The shark attempts to use his training to get the human off, but Kiba is smarter than that. The shark shoves Kiba off and tried to gain his balance, but Kiba, instead of simply backing off, gets up and slams the shark back to the ground. The old man was being overpowered by the bat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha!\u2019 Niel exclaims. A large ring goes off, and everyone covers their ears. (except Niel for some reason.) The four who were fighting each other stop their tussle and look towards the door. The old man scrambles out of the bat\u2019s reach, and Kiba gets up off of the shark. The huge door opens from the sides, like a hangar. Niel is ecstatic in his achievement until he looks over to the others. Light floods the large room. Kiba runs forward and tackles the bat from behind, effectively having disabled both anthros from getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo!\u201d Kiba commands. Niel tries to protest saying that the door is about to close and they can\u2019t leave without him, but Kiba is dismissive about it, \u201cGo now!\u201d He shouts angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know where to take them, Kiba! We\u2019ll come back for you!\u201d Niel exclaims, then leads the other three humans out.</span></div></div>",

You get low to the roof and crawl towards the edge to get a look at the anthros that had just come out of the house. Peeking down over the edge of the roof you find that this house actually has a swimming pool in the backyard. In the pool, there was a shark anthro. She looked about as tall as Luna. She had black hair with bright orange highlights and orange eyes with slits for pupils. She had a shark like tail and dark grey skin. Her belly, neck and palms were light grey though. Her hands were very human like, but on her feet she had three large toes rather than five average sized. She had small claws at the tips of her fingers and toes. And atop her head she had two long, pointed, fin like ears with a small earring through one. She was wearing a black bathing suit that exposed her belly, arms and legs but everything else was covered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the hammock, a young, teenage looking anthro tiger was laying back in the shade. She wore a plain t-shirt with a loose khaki button up shirt (which was unbuttoned) with a pair of blue jeans. She had long black hair and yellow eyes with slits for pupils, just like the shark. Her fur pattern was that of a typical tiger; orange and black with a white underbelly and chin. She wore no shoes leaving her paws exposed as she swayed in the breeze with her hands behind her head and her tail lazily swishing about. You figured she was about you're height, if not a bit taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I dunno,\" The tiger said, \"I think there's a human out there somewhere.

Apparently, they were already discussing about what they just witnessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, I heard that, Sarah, what do we do?\" Mira responded. She looked down back at Sarah. Sarah looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should investigate.\" Sarah said, eyes gleaming with exitement. Mira rolled her eyes and and sighed. She got out of the pool and gestured towards the door frame. Apparently, you can hear footsteps as they enter the door. You glance down, twisting your neck at an angle, you see no signs of life.

You looked down to see if there could be anything to jump onto, you see a ledge. But  among it was a larger drop than you expected, about 3 stories up, in anthro height. Sweat starts to form between your hands and the pole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the hand started to shake the pile, causing you to slip. You let out a small yelp, covering it with your free hand quickly. Your spine tingled with scarce fear. You look up and see the pair of eyes looking down at you, both with shock and exitement.

Falling in air, your hands attempted to reach for the pipe, but with no avail, your eyes widen and shock takes over you. Your spine starts to pulse with that small electric shock you get while riding a roller coaster. With intensity, you scream in terror, surprised from falling suddenly. For a moment, it seemed funny to you, a grown man, screaming? Two seconds later, you fall and hit the ground, the archway of your back by which you see when you bend over hit the ground first, sending a wave of pain through you. Then the rest of your body follows, and finally, the back of your head hits the concrete that surrounded the area of the pool, your vision starts to repeat itself. From your perspective, you keep seeing what you saw milliseconds before you hit your head, this happens 3 times. After your head recovers from its enitial shock, the pain flows through you and you try to scream, but your lungs wouldn't help you. Gasping for breath, your lungs wouldn't work for you, they felt crushed. With only being able to look up, you see the still shocked and now very upset expression of the orange and black tiger's face. She looks down at you with a deathly cold stare, eyes widened, as if she had killed someone. Turns out, she is bigger than what you saw before. Mira rushed up to the edge, but you did not catch her expression as you started to black out...<br>\r\n<i>Your favorite song starts to play in your head... you felt your eyes tearing up, you fear these are your last moments...<br>\r\nYou can feel blood dripping out of your mouth, rolling down your cheek to the other blood patches, you start to feel the warm blood you are laying on... you start to close your eyes...<br>\r\nYou are loosing conciousness, the song gets fainter, and finally your mind goes blank...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait, your alive?

Your body feels weak and what little movement you can manage causes you considerable pain. In the background you can hear a steady beeping coming from somewhere nearby. \"<i>What happened, and where am I...\"</i> you wonder. Just as your vision starts to clear up you hear a door open and close. Even in your current state, you know that someone is in the room with you. You hear footsteps moving toward you, they seem to stop right next to where your laying. Not long after that you hear what sounds like humming and some kind of faint scratching sound. You blink a few more times and find that you can see clearly enough to make out where you are. You were in a large room with white walls and a single window. You yourself were laying in a bed, a hospital bed to be precise. This also explains the beeping noise that you've been hearing. Without moving your head, you look to your left where you'd heard those footsteps stop and find an anthro collie standing by your bed in a nurse outfit. In her hand was a clipboard which she was currently writing on, which would explain that scratching noise from before. She seems to be paying more attention to the monitors than to you. Suddenly, all your memory comes back to you. Showing up in this strange world, the police coming after you and even falling off of that rooftop. How you survived that was beyond you... but you definitely didn't want to be in the hospital if the police were chasing you. Police departments and hospitals go together like T.V's and DVD players. They don't always have to work together but they are more than willing to do so and share information happily. Information like when someone running from the police checks into a hospital room with major injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your situation wasn't good, and it was getting worse by the second as your heart monitor was picking up your accelerated heart rate. By the time you realized this, you found the collie nurse looking down at you with wide eyes. Your first instinct was to get out of the bed. You were able to sit up and set one foot on the ground before pain shot through your body. Unable to do anything but cry out you fell back onto the bed. The pain slowly subsided as you laid back on the bed. You started to get up again but the nurse dropped her clipboard and held your arms against the bed, preventing you from sitting up. \"Shh... you need to rest. As far as we can tell you cracked two ribs and fractured your right shin. You've got a contusion on the back of your head too along with a bruised trachea along with countless other bruises all over your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"And now I know why it hurts to move and breath,\"</i> You thought as you remained still so as not to cause yourself any more pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now I'm going to let you're arms go,\" The collie warned. \"You won't try to run again will you?\" You shook your head as she slowly removed her paws from your wrists. \"My name is Cindy, I'm assigned to watch over you. The doctors have done all they can for you and expect you to make a full recovery. But for you to do that you must rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh perfect, you've been immobilized and hospitalized at the same time.

It doesn't matter if your the strongest, or the smartest, or the most acrobatic-- when you're above such a high height, you <i>will</i> be frightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze for a moment, and try to breath-- that was a thrilling adventure. There's still the matter at hand, the two anthros who are now on the roof. There is a very fast way down, and the way down would be to parkour. You are no acrobat, so you look to the window. When you try to open it, it's locked. You curse under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that?\" Mira exclaims. \"Someone's definitely here!\" She says. The tiger immediately runs back down the stairs, but stops. \"Stay here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, whatever...\" Sarah said. She wanted to go back to swimming, but now she's on the hot roof. She mumbles under her breath, \"I'm a shark, not a lizard.\" She grunts. You hear thunderous footsteps fly down the stairs, and a door opens at the bottom floor. Mira runs out and looks around. Eventually, she sees you and gasps. You curse under your breath once again for letting yourself be seen. Was there really anything you could do about it anyway? I mean, you would have to get down eventually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, you hear the room's door unlock. There are curtains on the other side of the window, and to your left and right are no window-sills. You get ready for anything, but your hair stands on edge with your back to the open space below you. The curtains fly open. You meet the gaze of the two anthros who chased you. You've got a better look at them now, but they're just as surprised to see you... at least, the shark is. The tiger, <i>Mira</i>, expected to see you there. You see her slowly unlock the window, and try to open it. She opens her mouth to speak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you push the window open and land on Mira, who shrieks because of your sudden outburst. You roll off of her as she tries to get up. Sarah blocks the doorway, attempting to grab you. You juke her by dodging her arms. You roll under her legs and she doesn't expect it. Just as your about to get out of their grasp, something large hits you in the back of your head, completely stopping your forward motion. You look up to see the shark's tail had beat you down. You land on your stomach, pushing yourself off the floor, you try running again. Mira tackles you and pins you down. Apparently she got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going anywhere!\" Mira exclaims. You struggle to get out of her grip, but she simply overpowers you. You grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" You scowl. You have no intention of being turned in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that, we're not going to hurt you.\" Mira growls. You immediately stop struggling. That growl was was of annoyance, and in your position, you don't want to have another stronger, larger anthro against you. \"We're with you, and we don't want to hurt you-- now if you want to not be captured by Deluma's stupid goons, then I suggest you stop struggling.\" She calmly states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do so, and she gets off of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" You ask, obviously defeated. Mira starts asking you almost everything she can think of. It's repetitive, but you three get along over time. The three of you discussed about how and where you'll be going... except it wasn't your decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, instead you land on a soft almost cushion like surface before splashing into the water. You were'nt prepared for the airless environment and accidentally took in a short breath of water. You struggle to hold your breath against your body's natural choking reflex as you head for the surface. You break the surface of the pool before sputtering and coughing the water out of your lungs.

You look up to find the shark anthro; 'Sarah' staring down at you. \"Going somewhere?\" She asks with a neutral expression.

The fact was, if they were really going to out you, they wouldn't be trying to keep you a secret. And if they wanted to hurt you, they would've done it by now.

You blush at the fact that her breasts were actually pinning the back of your head down. She's about up and you still haven't made any attempt to flee. After a few mor seconds she moves completely off of you and sits on her knees behind you. As you sit up, Mira darts right up to your face and stares at you with wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Mira begins barraging you with questions from 'how'd you get here?'

Kiba, is it?\" Sarah asks, \"You woke up in the central city in an intersection and the police chased you down on Deluma's orders. You escaped the city last night and made it here to the suburbs where you stayed the night on Mira's roof, then you woke up this morning and slipped and, well... Here you are. And on top of all that you have no idea what brought you here... Is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             You nod, \"That's right... I have no clue on how to get home either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"Wow,\" Sarah replied, \"I've had bad days, but nothing compared to your troubles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"You poor thing!\" Mira cried before giving you a huge bear hug that came close to crushing you. But her fur was so warm and soft, you didn't care. After a while she broke her hug and glanced over at Sarah. \"So what now?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"Well,\" Sarah mused....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You felt her paws grasp your shoulders and firmly center you as Sarah opened the bag, she then looked at Mira before simply saying 'switch'. Faster than your eyes could follow, Mira and Sarah switched places. Now it was Sarah who stood before you with the open bag and Mira who held you in place. \"In... You... Go!\" Sarah hissed before lifting you up and stuffing you into the bag before zipping it up. Before you can even register what's happened, you find yourself laying on you're side with your knees in your chest. It's dark and smells like damp clothing in the bag. You're jostled a bit as the bag is carried inside. After a few minutes the bag is opened again, you find Sarah standing in a pair of loose denim jeans and an orange tank top. She then drops her damp bathing suit on you along with another set of clothes. You grimace and then push them aside before staring up at her perplexed. \"What?\" She asks, \"You're in my bag, if I've got to lug you around in it, you're going to have to share it with my stuff.\" She then zips the bag up again before hoisting it up and shouldering the strap. You feel the bag lurch into the air before bouncing against a semi soft object which you assume to be Sarah's side. The bag then starts to rock from side to side, indicating she's walking. Inside the bag you feel her stop and you hear what you think is the front door open. Before she moves any further though you hear a muffled voice call to Sarah from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, An otter woman that's slightly shorter and much thicker than Sarah boards the bus and moves toward the seat that Sarah's bag, more importantly you are occupying. Sarah is too busy looking out of the window to notice that the otter anthro is sitting down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill she move the bag?

The rest of the ride is relatively uneventful. You find your shoulder and foot starting to go numb because of the awkward position you in. At one point, you peak out of the zipper, you can't see much. From what you can tell, Sarah is occupying the seat directly above you as your view is taken up by her calves and feet. To your surprise, the bus suddenly comes to a stop and you watch as Sarah's legs turn toward the aisle and her knees bend toward the ground. not long after that a gray clawed hand reaches under the chair for you before you feel the bag sliding along the floor towards the light. Sarah slings the bag over her shoulder and quietly exits the bus. When she gets onto the sidewalk she starts headed toward what looks like an old neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"She wasn't kidding about this being a bad neighborhood...\"</i> you think to yourself as you see several shady and hooded figures walking around.

You readied yourself for anything, but that turned out to be unnecessary as Sarah's clawed hand lashed out and wrapped around the Hyena's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The bag stays with me,\" She growled, \"Now, you're going to turn around and walk away from me and keep your filthy paws off of my bag, or whatever my hand touches next, breaks.... Got it?\" Sarah squeezed the hyena's neck to prove her point. Both hyena's nodded vigorously before she roughly shoved the one in her grasp away from herself and watched them scurry off. \"Hang in there pipsqueak, we're almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wanted to yell at her for calling you a pipsqueak... AGAIN... but you remembered her words to you earlier and in light of the most recent incident, you decide its best to heed her warning. After walking a few more blocks she comes to a decent looking, two story brick house. She knocks on the front door, movement can be heard from within the house before the door opens. Standing in the doorway was an anthro wolf with shoulder length red hair. But you can't make out much more than that from the limited vision offered from your vantage point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sarah! What a surprise!\" The wolf says, seeming excited to see her friend. Her began wagging and her breath came to her a little quicker. But as if she realized something her whole demeanor changed as her tail dropped and her breathing returned to normal, \"Wait, why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I need a favor from you...\" Sarah replied without skipping a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course you do,\" The wolf sighed before stepping aside to let Sarah into the house. you felt Sarah walk into the house and through a couple of rooms before she came to a stop. \"So what is it that you need?\" the wolf asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You felt Sarah hoist the bag into the air and you suddenly felt a hard surface under you, \"I need you guys to watch this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is it?\" Another female voice interjected \"It's not stolen is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, Amy it wasn't stolen. I just needs to be looked after for a while,\" Sarah retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well what is it?\" The wolf asked. Sarah grasped the bag and unzipped it allowing you to spill out onto the table she'd apparently set the bag on. The wolf gasped as she looked down at you, \"Is this? Is he the same human from last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pretty sure he's that one... unless there's another human running around that we don't know about,\" Sarah replied. Looking up at the wolf you see that she stands a few inches shorter than Sarah, putting her at around seven feet even while Sarah stands near eight. She had red hair that ran down and draped over her shoulders. Atop her head she had two pointed ears poking out above her hair. She wore a black t-shirt with a broken heart in the center of it and black jeans. Her eyes were ice blue and she had a black nose at the end of her snout. She regarded you with curiosity and what you took to be confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you want us to watch him?\" The second voice asked. You turned your head to face the voice and nearly jumped out of your skin. This anthro was out of the ordinary even for this world. She was a hybrid; part shark and part fox and stood a few inches above Sarah. She had brown fur all over her body, including her tail. She had long brown hair that ran down to her mid back and just below her breasts. She had two pointed and furry ears. The fur inside each ear was green. She had a canine snout and a black nose to match at the end of it. Her eyes were bright green with slits for pupils, and her underbelly was a cream color. She had a dorsal fin on her back and a shark like tail extending out behind her. She had claws on her hand paws and foot paws. She stared at you somewhat blankly before yawning. You notice that inside her mouth she has fangs like a canine, but on either side of her upper jaw she has two teeth like a shark on either side  that hang down and make themselves visible, even when her mouth is closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sarah nodded, \"That's right, keep him fed, healthy and safe. That's all I ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Suppose we do this,\" Haylee muses \"What's in it for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll cook for you, every night that he's here and well,\" Sarah returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haylee's ears perked up and her tail began to wag, while Amy went from blank and drowsy to sharp and alert. \"So... if we watch him, and take good care of him. You'll come over here and cook for us every night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's right\" Sarah replied as she crossed her arms. \"Do we have a deal?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amy looked over at Haylee who was vigorously nodding at her. She then turned her attention back to Sarah, \"We do,\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good, I'll be over tomorrow night to cook some steak and salmon for you two,\" Sarah says as she helps you off the table and onto the ground. You stare up at her questioningly, \"I know what your thinking,\" She says with a warm smile, \"But these two aren't what they seem. It'll just take time for you to warm up to them. Try to get along with them, and stay out of trouble.\" She then cast a stern look in Haylee's direction, \"Take care of him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh we will\" Haylee replied. With that, Sarah turned and walked towards the door. You watched as she opened it and disappeared into the night, closing the door behind her. You then feel a looming presence behind you and turn around to find both anthros looming over you with different expressions on their faces. Amy's was one of apathy while Haylee had a mischievous grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're alone with the two anthros that are supposed to be your guardians, what now?</span></div></div>",

That being the case, I'm afraid that the motion has been passed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wonderful,\" You mutter while looking down and away from Haylee and cursing your luck, which is actually ironic because you don't believe in luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haylee brought a furred finger underneath your chin and gently but firmly guided your head so that your gaze met hers. You notice that she had bent over so that the end of her snout was a no more than a foot away from your nose. \"Oh, now don't be so negative. This'll be a great opportunity for both of us! You'll get to explore your new 'home' and I'll get to see what a clever human can do and possibly, what he tastes like...\" She said as she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're not serious!?\" You blurt out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haylee shrugs, \"Who knows? Don't let me catch you and you won't have to find out. How's that for inspiration?\" She laughed as she put her hands on her hips and stood upright. \"You've got a twenty second head start, better get moving.\" That was all the motivation you needed to get your legs moving. You were currently standing in the dinning room. You run out of the dinning room and into what looked like the main hallway. You find the front door to your right and stairs to your left, in front of you is the living room where Amy was watching television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell what will you do now? You just found out that one of your so called 'protectors' might actually eat you, and now she's forcing you to play a game of cat and mouse... errr... wolf and human, against your will. Well, it could be worse right? And she won't really eat you.... will she? Well you don't want to test that theory so you've got a choice to make. You could hide in the living room where Amy's watching T.V. or you could head into the unknown and see what's upstairs... your call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You don't even know if there is a back exit in there. You rely on yourself, \"Ya, perfect, when she leaves, I will dart into the kitchen. I should hide in one of the doors.\" You take a few seconds, reflecting on how this will play out. A couple seconds felt like minutes to you, which, you start to take literally, you get up and crouch ready to flee from behind it.A bang startled you, the noise was opposite of the kitchen door, you see a remote roll out a few feet in front of you. You look up and see that Amy threw her remote in boredom of not finding anything to watch.<br>\r\nHaylee pokes her head out of the doorway leading to the kitchen, seeing the back of your blonde hair behind the couch. She smiles, then she crouches, silently. You were so intent on the sight of the remote, you didn't notice her about to sprint towards you. You glance around, looking to see if the wolf, Haylee, didn't notice the noise. You gaze in almost horror as you see her sprinting towards you. You jump up and instinctively start running though the doorway that led you to the stairs. Your feet start to feel like your gliding up the stairs. You glance behind yourself as Haylee is sprinting at the bottom of the stairs, you make it upstairs and there are five doors, you run to the one at the end of the hall, not knowing what room you are going in. You leave the door open without  noticing, then you hide behind a bed, hoping for the best.<br>\r\nHaylee is smart,she goes to the first open door that she finds and she looks into the room. You hear her sniff and see her smile, she closes the door and locks it. <br>\r\n\" H-how does she know I was here?\" You think. You are terrified at the fact of what she said before you started, 'playing', though it was obviously her decision. You didnt even have a choice in the matter. You start looking around for some idea of escaping the room, but you end up finding nothing, as she is now towering above you. You look up, you were sitting, so this makes you feel as if you were only a tenth of her height now<br>\r\nShe starts to giggle, \"Look what I found, my prey!\" She bends down toward you in a mocking motion, <br>\r\n\"I thought humans were supposed to be adaptable, I guess I was wrong,\" she shrugs, \"well, I do get to know one thing...\" She smiles. You look up, almost like you know what she was going to say, you started to get fearful. \"W-what would that b-be?\" You stutter anxiously, you didnt want to find out.<br>\r\nShe picks you up with her arms, both holding you so you could not move YOUR arms, she then uses her tail to grapple your legs together.<br>\r\n\"How they taste.\" She smiles, opening her mouth so you can see her giant maw. You struggle indefinitely, trying to escape, you start to let out a yelp, but her thumb covered your mouth before you can. Haylee twists you in an awkward way, she takes off your socks and shoes, and you start descending into her mouth. Your yells were muffled by her thumb, you are halfway in her mouth, you are starting to black out in fear, you try struggling one more time, with all your might, but alas, it does not work. Eventually  you are down to your head. You faint, losing conciousness.<br>\r\nAbout one hour later, you wake up. Where are you?</span></div></div>",

You find yourself staring at a ceiling in a bedroom while laying in a large bed. Your vision starts to clear when the events of the day came back to you in a tidal wave of memories, the latest of which was the most frightening. Even more frightening was the fact that the same anthro who had been consuming you earlier was at the foot of the bed watching you. You bolted upright and crawled back against the bed's headboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The white wolf chuckled, \"Settle down, you're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-you ate me!\" You shouted as you held yourself against the headboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haylee put a finger to her lips and glanced at the ceiling as if she were in thought, \"Mmm, I think 'sampled' would be a more accurate description. See, after you passed out, I released you and carried you in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You relaxed yourself from your position on the wall, \"Well, don't ever do that again!\" You ordered. You secretly hoped that your assertiveness would make her reconsider turning you into a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haylee giggled at your request, \"I promise nothing,\" She stated with a sly grin. You rolled your eyes and sighed. \"However, what I will say is that you are safe here. There's a reason Sarah brought you here, we'll take good care of you.\" You sighed again, there wasn't really much you could do about the personality of the wolf, but at least you were safe with her. \"So,\" Haylee continued, \"Tell me about yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shrugged, \"There really isn't much to tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haylee gave you a deadpan look, \"Really?\" She asked raising an eyebrow, \"You're a mythical creature from a parallel world on the run from my government and there's not much to tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well when you put it that way, it makes me sound more interesting than I really am.

Then to your left there was a closet, filled large t-shirts and sweaters, with brand names you don't recognize, as you have come from a different place. You continue with the white-furred wolf practically 3 feet away from your face, contempt with listening to your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" you pause with Haylee still looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I dont think I ever climbed a ladder...\" again, you pause, apparently you lost a bit of your memory, or simply, you just haven't drank anything or eaten at all for the past day. But you continue on with your story, needing to rephrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Sorry about that, I have my memory mixed up, what happened was I escaped the cops, got onto a big truck, got off near Sarah's place, and soon I ended up here.\" You say, almost half heartedly, your story really did not appeal to yourself, as you left out a couple of details, most likely. But on the other hand, Haylee was very happy to hear the story. You think, <i>wow, for me to not have much detail, and she gets exited over it?  She either gets the whole story or was too exited too actually listen.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds very interesting!\" Haylee remarked, but she still had one more question. She was about to say something, then Amy walks in. Literally bored fro  watching tv, her face of apathy turned into concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haylee,\" Amy said, quickly, obviously realizing something, \"how long do we have to actually take care of him again?\" She waited for a response from  Haylee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,  did you catch if she said anything, Kiba?\" Haylee questioned while turning her head to face your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh, no. I did not catch anything.\" You say. Then you start to ponder that thought. After a moment, you start to find it funny how you are practically being taken care of when you are 22, but then you realize that you have no idea about what this world is like and decide to keep your thoughts to yourself for now.</span></div></div>",

A couple hours later, you are dozing off to sleep, but you fall to your right and bounce back up, you were sleeping while sitting up, which was somewhat funny to you in a way. You end up deciding that it really would be best to get some sleep. You lie down, relaxed. And you go to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in a dream, there was haze all around you, but you could make out this vision. A anthro you had recognized before was standing in front of you and two... kids? Humans! Woah, this came to you as a shocker. From what you saw, one of them was a little girl, most likely not even over the age of 9, and the other kid was a boy, clearly the age of 14. The anthro standing in front of you had her fists up protectively, ready to fight what seemed to be, Deluma? This dream is getting weirder and weirder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you wake up from  your dream with a flash of light glaring into your eyes, you squint over and see a lion anthro pulling out what seemed to be a white cloth. You jump back, doing an unexpected summersault over the bed. You land perfectly on your feet and take a second to process what just happened. The lion anthro statted to get ready to leap over the bed and you weren't ready for that yet. You both wait a couple of seconds, staring awkwardly into each others eyes. You were looking up, and she was looking down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments went by, both of you were waiting to make a move. She jumps over the bed first  whilst you dashed to the left and sprinted towards the door, you make it to the door handle before something grabs you by the back of the shirt and throws you across the room, upon hitting the desk and lamp  you yell in pain. You attempted to get back up, but the lioness was too fast for you. She shoved her paw that held the cloth into your face, you try to breath but faint due to the cloth's material. Amy and Haylee rush into the room and are greeted with the sight of you being slung across the anthro's shoulder, who was just about to jump out of the window. (This situation could have been a bit better) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow furred anthro jumped down and landed perfectly onto the ground, running into the streets, Haylee attempts to chase, but Amy pulled out her phone and started to dial someone quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is this scene going?

It's for me to know and you to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You really hated that line, \"Well then answer me this one question, what happens if you can't find a buyer for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lioness paused and thought for a moment before answering, \"Then I suppose you be more useful to me as food\" She stated before leaving the room and locking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stared down at the handcuff that held you prisoner in the center of that room, \"I have got to get out of here,\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you're in a world of trouble now. This is one nightmare that you just can't wake up from. What to do, what to do?

If you add the fact that this particular anthro was a freakin' powerhouse, your odds of winning plummeted even further. That being said, you decided on your first plan. You wrapped your t-shirt around your hand like a bandage before climbing up the pole that the handcuff was attached to, and with some difficulty and a lot of effort you unscrewed the light bulb using your shirt as a makeshift oven mitten. This dropped the visibility in the room to nil. However, you knew that after a little time in the dark room, the lioness's eyes would adjust, and she would eventually find you. This left you a very small window of opportunity to get out of the room quietly and without being spotted. You pressed yourself up against the wall close to the door. You waited for what felt like hours. After several minutes, and just before you went stir crazy, you heard the door unlocking. This was it, your chance to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lioness opened the door staring into the dark room, \"Hm, light must've blown out\" She growled to herself. She then walked into the room. You took your opportunity and silently made your escape as you slipped through the door. You made your way down the hallway and found yourself in what looked to be a living room. You glanced around and found a bar with an open kitchen just behind it. From the look of things, you'd say you were in an apartment. But now wasn't the time to figure out where you were, the priority was getting away from the lioness, you could focus on getting back to Amy and Haylee after that. You quietly crept over to the door you believed to be the front door and opened it. Unfortunately it was the door to the master bedroom, you sighed but before you could turn around and try to find your way out you heard a loud roar, \"Clever trick human, I don't know how you escaped but I know you won't elude me for long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Change in plans,\" You muttered to yourself as you slipped into the room and closed the door. It was a basic room, it had a large bed, a closet and a bathroom. You ran into the bathroom before closing the door and locking it behind you. You glanced around for anything that might help you out of this mess, and that's when you saw it, a sliding window above the toilet. You climbed on top of the toilet and slid the window open sideways, You find yourself looking out from the fifth floor of a apartment building, \"No way I can get down there and find a place to hide before that anthro finds me...\" You start looking for an alternative, if you couldn't run, you'd have to hide. You found your solution in the form of an open window one floor below you. You looked for some kind of handhold to get yourself down there and you found a steel rain drainage pipe to your right. You stretch yourself out of the window and reach for the drainage pipe when you hear the bedroom door slam open through the bathroom door as the lioness searches her bedroom. You stretch yourself further and reach for the pipe. After straining for what felt like forever, you are able to grasp the pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A loud thud behind you signals that the lioness has reached the bathroom door, \"Aha! I know your in there! If you come out now I promise not to hurt you, if you don't... All bets are off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At this point you figure its now or never. You grip the pipe with your one hand and get ready to swing over and cling to it. You silently count to three before flinging yourself out of the window and clinging to the pipe. You crash into it but manage to grip it with your legs and free hand before sliding down it like a firemen's pole. You apply pressure to stop yourself just above and to the left of the other open window. You hear a loud crackling noise above you, which told you the lioness was now in the bathroom. Again, counting silently to three, you threw yourself towards the open window. You manage to catch the ledge of it with your hands. With the help of the adrenaline flowing through your veins, you were able to scurry into the window and close it. You then jumped off of the toilet which was positioned directly below the window and had a quick glance around. You exited the bathroom and entered the master bedroom. It was basically the same as the lioness's. You were going to head for the exit when you heard the doorknob turning, but it wasn't the doorknob for the bedroom as that door was open, it was the doorknob for the front door. You quickly dashed under the bed in the master bedroom as the door opened and a par of white and black furry paws came through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh... what a killer day at work!\" A female voice groaned, \"I think I'm just going to go to bed and be done with it!\" You saw the paws approach the bed before they simultaneously left the floor and an invisible weight landed on the bed causing the springs to creak and groan above you. After a few moments you heard the woman snoring soundly, and not too long after that, you were out cold too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She did alright, but she didn't really have anything going for her that would guarantee she would stay in office. But suddenly, out of nowhere she opened up her own chemical and technology labs. Both were done separately from her political life. The thing is though, you don't get paid that much to be mayor and she wasn't inherently rich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So the question is, how did she come up with all of that money?\" You mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Natasha nodded, \"I wondered the same thing, it turns out that one of the government officials is actually a family friend of hers.

Anyway, before either lab was even finished being built, they started spitting out all kinds of products. High efficiency internal combustion engines, solar powered lights and battery chargers, cellular phones, night vision goggles. There's plenty of other stuff that she's had made in that lab too, and she's profiting from it all. The problem is, these products and concepts are virtually alien to us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But not to a human!\" You exclaim as you catch on, \"You think she got her hands on a human and had them come up with all of this stuff for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's exactly what we thought, so we put someone inside the police force here to get close to Deluma and investigate her, while I kept my distance and reported from afar,\" Natasha paused and smiled, \"You might know her as, 'Captain Luna Barker\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your expression turned neutral, \"Your kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She also happens to be my cousin,\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So she's a cop that's also a spy for the government and happens to be your cous-\" You cut yourself off in mid sentence before throwing your hands up \"Sure! Why not? It's not that farfetched compared to everything else so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anyway, she's gotten close enough to find out that there were several humans that Deluma has brought here. But she hasn't seen any of them for herself. All she has to go off of are the miscellaneous items and markings laying around Deluma's office and in some of the corners of the city hall every now and again. She's definitely doing a good job of keeping everything tidy, or at least she was until you and the other two showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That explains why Luna was so awestruck when she first found me,\" You not as you remember her face when you first met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So to wrap this up, Deluma seems to be pulling humans from your world to ours to make them work for her so that she can have them invent new technology and profit from it by selling the rights of said technology to the public. She's using a good chunk of that profit to pay off a few government officials to keep her in office. I'm here to shut her down, but I can't do that without clear cut evidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What about me?\" You ask, \"Aren't I 'clear cut evidence'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Natasha sighed, \"Unfortunately not, you literally appeared out of nowhere. So as of right now, your appearance and that of the two other humans' are just 'random anomalies'. If I tried to hang Deluma on that she'd easily find a way out, and then she'd know we were on to her and make my job even more difficult than it already is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what do we do?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For now,\" Natasha said as she sat down next to you and pulled you close to her, \"We keep you safe and hidden. Until we can explain how Deluma is pulling humans from your world to ours we can't do much about her. The only other thing we can do is keep an eye out for those other humans, and try to find them before Deluma does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sigh and nod in agreement, \"I understand, but what about my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Friends?\" Natasha asks. You briefly explain how you were kidnapped from Haylee and Amy's place and recount the events leading up to that very moment. \"I see... I'll track them down and contact them, I'd rather not move you in public so I'll see about having them come here to see you.\" You nod and thank her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, lots of developments... So, Deluma is a crazed, power hungry, cut throat business tycoon... who knew? Well I guess deep down we all knew but, well you know. So you survived the lioness, made a new friend <i>and</i> managed to uncover Deluma's plan all in forty eight hours.

This peaks your interest, then you think about how many humans actually were needed for Deluma's twisted actions. What happened to them? How are they getting here? How did you get here? You stopped thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggh!\" you sigh, facepalming yourself. This whole scene felt so... clich\u00e9. Like this has happened before in movies, but you were experiencing the real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where you sat, you could see the almost the whole apartment. You were sitting at a wooden table where its edge reached just above your ribcage. Glancing around, you could see the occasional shadows from under the entrance to the door. There was a beautiful white vase filled with a type of flower you don't recognize... you shoulda paid attention in that herbalism class you took. Back to the point, Natasha had a kitchen that you could peer into where the counter is just below your field of view and you could see hints of the counter opposite of it. The paint was tan, it relaxed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for 7 hours, thinking of things to do to keep you entertained, so to speak. Like, you picked up at the flowers to inspect them, and then you sat on the couch, only to get back up again. You explored the rooms of the small apartment, keeping away from the windows and possibly closing then when you could. If you walked up to the west window, you could veer your head to the left to see the end of an alleyway and on the opposite side, a locked chain fence that connected the two complexes together. Further down, there was another street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Natasha left, to collect your newfound 'friends', she gave you a password so that you knew it was safe to unlock the door for other anthros who were working with her. The password was, Kabob. No idea why, but I guess that was the code-word, as awkward as it was...  2 hours later, you hear a knock on the door.

You hear scuffling outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, umm, K-kabob!\" said the shaking voice of a woman. You perk up to this word. You peel through the spyglass to see a human girl who looks like she is scared, she was holding her arms around her waist. She had golden blonde hair that reached past her elbows, her eyes were pale green, but keen. She was constantly looking over her shoulder as if in search for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, get in quick!\" you quietly rush. The door flung open surprisingly fast but very silent. She ran in, head low, you brush past her to glance outside the hallways, you could hear running footsteps and some voices shouting. You don't take a single second to close the door, you locked it and moved a nearby desk in front of it. It took a lot of effort, but you managed to do it, considering it was as high as your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman twisted around, falling down onto the floor pre-emptively. She glanced around, it was very dark in the house now, because of the time. You were reminded of that when the light turned off. Literally, the lights just shut down for some reason, and the whole building's power shut down! You take a glance at the girl, she was pretty much your age in looks. You were 22. She looks up at you as if she were scared, while on the other hand, you were dumbfounded by the sight of another person! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your name Kiba?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! How did you know?\" you respond, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Natasha, right? Was that her name?\" she replied. Yes, Natasha, this came back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you know her? Did she tell you everything?\" you ask, walking towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she didn't. but she had Luna bring me and Neil here so you and her could explain. Natasha said you and Luna knew everything.\" she informs. You were put on the spot, I guess... wait, Luna? And another human! This was good news for you, but you took it as more confusion to the mix. You crouch down with one knee resting on the carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is Neil?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some guy that I met before some, thing, tried to get us. We found out her name was Sam before Natasha saved us.\" she quickly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, your confusing me,\" you reply, \"Luna and another person?\" you continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" she said. She was starting to get wound up. You need to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, calm down, explain slo-\" you attempted to say before you heard someone slamming on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"KABOB, KABOB!!! LET US IN!!!\"</i> shouted an anxious voice from outside of the door. <i>\"Come on!\"</i> said another, you recognized this voice as Luna, so you sprinted back towards the door, shoving the desk aside. The door swings open as you see two shadows run past you, one was your height, and one was an anthro's. You slammed the door shut, and then you turn around to see Luna and what you think is Neil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want answers, but everything is dark, there are four of you, and there seems to be some group of anthros chasing them. In general, us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

She motions towards an open window. The girl follows Luna closely. You and Niel do the same. Niel is getting out the window, a large, stable window, when the door bursts open. Niel flicks his head towards the door, shocked. He's stunned. You pull him off the ledge, and the 4 of you continue down the railing. Luckily, some buildings looked the same, so going down an apartment railing was simple.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n             Luna jumps the last step, and remembers that the 3 smaller humans could not survive the jump if they, well, had jumped. \"Jump down! I- I'll catch you!\" Luna shouts with confidence. Her job was to protect us, and so she will. The blonde haired human female, who you never asked for a name, jumps down first. She squeals, but Luna catches her swiftly. The other anthros who were chasing the four of you are close now, just above by one level. Niel's hesitation to get out of the window stalled time. Now only one of you can get down there with Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             You look up, and see the armored anthros. They each have a sort of weapon you can't make out yet.

But that yell was of surprise. The girl looks up to you and sees the anthros in armor grab you. Kiba Lockheart was not a pushover, nor was he going to allow anyone but himself to take a risk. Luna catches Niel perfectly, his glasses bounce as he is let go. Luna, your protector, looks up in astonishment, and regret. She couldn't save everyone, but you did help her with saving one more. The anthros are violently dragging you back up the apartment stairs while you're kicking and punching. You're not going down without a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"No!\" The human girl screams, she puts her hands to her mouth instinctively. \"Kiba!\" She yells once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Kiba why?!!\" Niel yells. Almost in sync with the girl. Luna motions her hands around the other humans, and leads them away. The girl doesn't resist, as she's seen too much. Niel tries to push back and go to Kiba. He sees Kiba being pulled back into the apartment window, glass scraping away at his legs as he's being dragged away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"We'll come back for you, Kiba!\" Luna yells.

The girl follows Luna as Niel hesitates to leave. Meanwhile, with your status, you've been trying to get out of the grip of these four, larger, equipped anthros. They're not the cops that tried to capture you the first day, but they look very similar due to the belt and armor they're all wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Let go of me!\" You yell angrily. You kick one of the anthros who is holding your leg, as they're carrying you via one anthro to limb. It hits the anthro in the chest, winding him. He looks angry and for a moment you regret what you did. This, bull anthro, looked to be the angry one out of the four. He drops your right leg, but pushes forward, making the other anthros move as well, looking back to see what's the trouble. The bull elbows you in the chest so hard you start black out. You become less resistant, focusing on trying to breath. You grunt in response and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Now why'd you go and do that? You know that might've killed it. Deluma wants the humans alive, for now.\" One of the anthros say, you catch it before you get hit again by the bull anthro, but this time, in the ribs. You black out.</span></div></div>",

You squirmed writhed and twisted as she walked, but your malnourished body against her agile and much larger frame did little more than annoy your captor. \"If you keep that up I'll have to do something about it and it won't be pleasant, so do us both a favor and just relax, besides... if I was really going to hurt you I would have by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You paused for a moment to think about your situation, she had a point; there was no reason or incentive for her to lie to you.

You've been trying to get the chains off of you, but you were only able to chip the wood it's attached to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the room shuffles a bit. You swing your attention to the door, it actually scares you for a moment, but you're not gonna be eaten today! You ready yourself for the lioness, prepared to defend yourself with whatever you can do. The handle unlocks and the door swings open, light finally flashing into your eyes for the first time in a while. The tall, dark shadow of the lioness stands there. You hear her stomach grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what time it is.\" She growls with a certain hunger in her voice. She walks forward, ears shoot straight up. \"After tasting you earlier, I just couldn't wait. You're so much more worth in food than money.\" She says. You sit up and it puts some slack onto your chains. Your eyesight hasn't adjusted to the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me!\" You yell angrily. You kick at her, but she simply stands out of reach. She turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cats can see in the dark, so I don't even know why the light's on.\" She says simply. You barely adjust to the light as she closes the door, chuckling. You make another attempt to get out of your chains, it won't work. It's dark again, and you can only see her eyes. They stand above you at a staggering height. You see them move down to your eye level before you feel the chains come off your hands. You take this as an opportunity to swing blindly. You push yourself up onto the wall and find a corner. You don't hear her move, but you can hear her growls and purrs and grumbles. With her constant noise, you can hear her. When you blink it doesn't make a difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off!\" You scowl assertively. She laughs. You're slammed against a wall and lifted up. A paw grips your throat and another holds you up. You slam your hands against the furry arms that are choking you. You see her eyes right in front of yours as you feel a punch hit you in the stomach. You stop your kicking and try to breath... <i>is this it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... I always wondered what humans tasted like.\" She purrs. You feel her sharp tongue lap your face as she growls. Her breath is overwhelming as she envelops your head.

You're practically malnourished, but not so much that you can't defend yourself. The light and her saliva blur your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your hands up--!\" A strong, feminine voice yells. You hear scuffling and the stomping of shoes scatter around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right-- all right!\" The lioness retorts.

You stop swinging your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start saying some of the names of anthros you know, hoping that one of them is her.

Mira?\" It was very unlikely. \"Luna?\" That's it, no more names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna?\" The voice asks. \"She's-- yeah, I know her.\" She said convincingly. You hear a growl and a tumble. Did the lioness just-- they're fighting! You hear the thuds and growls of them fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one's mine!\" The lioness roars. \"No cop is gonna take it away!\" She continues, you hear the tearing of fabric, and the rippling clink of a metal plate. You try to get up, looking around. You still can barely see, so you wipe off the saliva with your arms. A little better, now you just gotta get used to the light. A paw grabs your leg as you tried to walk, the lioness' claws dig into your left leg. You yell in pain as you fall. You're pulled back a little as the paw is torn off of you. You try to get up again, your eyes have adjusted to the light. You limp towards the door, a single tear of pain forming in both of your eyes. That hurt! It pisses you off a lot. You look back to see a husky fighting the lioness. There is a slight glimpse of a badge on the husky's shirt. How'd they find you in time? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble out of the doorway and into the hall, looking left, there's a window, and to the right is a larger room.

Tch--\" You try to say, you put your hand against your head. She looks to her right. What position are you in to argue? Your head is pounding, and both your leg and shoulder are bleeding. You want to find that lioness and beat her up-- you're so angry. Actually, many emotions are flowing through you at the moment, ranging from anger to fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here-- well, I mean, just wait here for me.\" She asks, she seems to care about what's happened to you. Not like you're going anywhere anyway. \"The person who held you here is tied up and locked in the bathroom.\" She gets up and walks out.

You don't fully trust her, but she seems to trust you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard to believe she came alone. Then again, have you ever known of an 'agent' who doesn't have a mission?<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours go by, it seems there's not much to do other than wait. Natascha is not here yet, and that lioness' angry shouts are not getting any less annoying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you stop and shut up for a while?!\" You yell at her. With all that yelling, it seems that loud noises are indifferent to the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out! I have other business to attend to!\" The lioness' dampened yells pierce through the crack under the door. You jump at that, pushing yourself back up onto the wall. \"I know that stupid husky left, but you're still mine! When I get outta here, you're food!\" She growls. She pounds against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus...\" You mumble, you hear the knob being twisted, it's still locked-- wait, is she out of her ties?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming for you, and I haven't eaten in a day!\" She scowls. Can you just get a break once in a while?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you try to hide?<br>\r\nOR<br>\r\nStand your ground... well... not like you're gonna move, but you can just stay there and rely on that door...</span></div></div>",

Haylee looks around the door to the kitchen too see an upset Amy, crossing her arms and clenching her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why'd you go and do that?\" asked Haylee, as her eyes darted around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There aren't any shows... UGH!!\" Amy grunts. \"Geez. Don't they ever come up with anything good anymore?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psht, who even watches tv? We've got wifi.\" Haylee responds as she pulls a device out of her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are thankful that you never moved, because your hair would've definitely been in Haylee's sight. Might as well be silent for now. <br>\r\n----<br>\r\nA bit later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out!! Oh my god! How does a thing like you hide so well!\" Haylee shouts in frustration. Hehe, you've got her now, though, you've had the dedication of staying in one spot for almost 20 minutes. You're kind of cramped and your muscles are starting to tighten, as if you were crouching. Oh wait... you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forgot when she said the game would be over. Nice memory there bub, but then again, did she say anything? You start to ponder this as you hear the tapping of a phone. It's Amy. You're sort of bored at this point to have been hiding like that for a while. Crouching, breathing soft, staying still... <i>just like prey.</i> You know what she was playing at, which it does make you ponder once again... \"what he tastes like\". It's been repeating in your head for quite some time. It almost feels like you've been behind this couch for a whole millennia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny enough, Haylee walks out of the kitchen for the third time in 10 minutes. Good thing you didn't pick the kitchen to hide in, because that would be like a spec. ops mission level of hide and seek. Now you're just playing with the back of the couch. It's made of a different material than you know of, and it's very... slick. Slick like leather, but it's not sticky and it practically glides your hand across when you touch it. Like, Dopey trying to hold soap, but your hand is the soap bar and the couch is clumsy. But that's where you're wrong, as the couch looks simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're exploring the couch's backside, you slide your hand across the back-end one more time. You slide your hand too far and end up sticking out behind the couch. Unluckily for you, Haylee was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" She exclaims, as she starts to sprint towards you. You get up as quick as you can, frightened momentarily, and adrenaline kicks in. Haylee dives towards the couch, and ends up sliding over it. You get up and run around, now you're both on opposite ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and her make eye contact, her fangs slightly showing from over-excitement, your eyes widening and darting around the living room. Wolf and human, fits the description perfectly. You see the kitchen door on Haylee's side, and you know the exit to the stairs is behind you. '<i>Maybe I cou-</i>! You tried to think, but Haylee starts coming towards you. Kicking off, you run behind towards the exit, Amy tries to move her head around the two of you to see the tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move it!\" Amy whines, motioning her paws to dart the edges. Clasping the edge of the wall, you use it to propel yourself towards the stairs, but suddenly, you trip. Looks like being cramped for a while stunned your movement a bit, continuing on, yet slower, you get to the top of the stairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, there are 5 doors... but before you could pick one, Haylee jumps the final step to the top of the stairs and grabs onto your legs, with her huge, wolf-like paws. You practically fall like a baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHA-!\" You exclaim. Bracing for your fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Haylee yips gleefully. She uses her knees to get up and her huge paws to drag you back. Your arms sting, but you had found a way to swing them around a door frame. She lets go of your legs suddenly. You use the chance to get up, but get interrupted again because she picks you up and pins you to the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh!!\" you mutter, now you're facing her, and she is to you. Her fangs look to be widened in her large, wicked grin. You can smell her breath as she talks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, \" she inhales quickly, \"I've gotten you. Gosh! You hid amazingly! Now though, *huff* I've got my prey!\" She huffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa- wai- wait wait! What?!\" you get out quickly, but she stuffs your head into her mouth. Struggling ferociously, you try to get your head out. You scream, but it's muffled. The feel of the wet, slimy tongue against your face feels weird, but her teeth are brushing against your back, and it's giving you a soft, tickling feeling that sends a chill down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!!!\" You scream, yet again it's muffled. This is unearthly. How is this even happening! You had no time to think, and panic is attacking you. You strain your fists and tighten your fingers, pushing against her huge paws holding your arms in place. This isn't working. She shovels you in further. Arms feeling slimy, and your neck and head being pushed against by her soft, large throat. There is nothing you can do but kick the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are terrified, screaming, this is not the Kiba you know, you're stronger than this, man! You are... you're... no.

You bolted upright and crawled back against the bed's headboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         The white wolf chuckled, \"Settle down, you're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Y-you ate me!\" You shouted as you held yourself against the headboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Haylee put a finger to her lips and glanced at the ceiling as if she were in thought, \"Mmm, I think 'sampled' would be a more accurate description. See, after you passed out, I released you and carried you in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         You relaxed yourself from your position on the wall, \"Well, don't ever do that again!\" You ordered. You secretly hoped that your assertiveness would make her reconsider turning you into a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Haylee giggled at your request, \"I promise nothing,\" She stated with a sly grin. You rolled your eyes and sighed. \"However, what I will say is that you are safe here. There's a reason Sarah brought you here, we'll take good care of you.\" You sighed again, there wasn't really much you could do about the personality of the wolf, but at least you were safe with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Safe, but sore. It hurt to have been violently stopped in your tracks, bracing your fall was easy enough, but you still hurt. How long had it have been since... she ate you? Gosh, that's weird to say, considering it's just not physically possible for humans. How could an anthro do that... wait, no, that's a question for another day. You look at your arms, elbows, they have small bruises. Haylee finally notices what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Oh... \" she looks out the window for a moment, frowning with regret, \"sorry about that. It's just, you're a weird thing from a completely different universe or something. I didn't mean to hurt you.\" Haylee apologized sincerely. You think about it for a moment, you debate if your sustained bruises and rigid, stiff legs are forgivable things. After all... maybe you should forgive her, better to make friends with, well, the only anthros who have been nice to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Will you forgive Haylee?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Extra note, the first paragraphs are from a different line by Metra, the same thing happened, just differently.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You figure there's probably more rooms up there than downstairs which would make you a bit harder to find... or at least you hope that's the case. You dart up the steps with some difficulty, remembering that they were made for anthros. When you make it to the top of the stairs you find a wall to your left, a closed door directly in front of you and a hallway with three doors in it that dead ends to your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ten seconds left!\" Haylee shouts from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You open the door to the room in front of you but you don't go in. Instead you move quietly down to the end of the hall and open the last door you find. The door was already cracked so you slip into the room and leave the door the way it was when you found it. You sigh and catch your breath for a moment before turning around to survey the room. The room itself is painted purple, you find a large crescent moon painted on the ceiling and small stars dotting the borders of the walls. The bedspread is purple as well with small crescent and full moons worked into the stitching. You find a large mirror next to a door which you think is the closet and a window beside the head of the bed. You continue to observe the room when you here an unsettling sound from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ready or not, here I come!\" Haylee called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sigh and shake your head, \"What am I even doing here?\" You wonder. You silently stride to the window and open it. You find that it actually sits just above part of the roof over the first floor as you are greeted with a view of slanted, overlapping shingles. You tentatively step out of the window and onto the roof before closing the window behind you. You can't get it to close all the way, but you really don't care. It's not like they'll notice or care if you're gone. You look out ahead of yourself and find that the next housetop isn't too far off. You stand up and get a running start before jumping over the gap between the rooftops and landing on the house next door. You glance back at the window you'd exited out of earlier, \"I'll come back... but I need to go where I can just be alone for a bit...\" You scale the housetop and get to the other side before getting a running start and leaping to the next house. You continue doing this for some time, occasionally changing direction. Eventually you find yourself panting and decide to rest on the next house you land on. When your feet touch down you sit down on the slanted rooftop and lay back against it. You stare up at the sky wondering if you'll ever get to go home. You really wanted to, but you knew that in reality the odds were that you probably wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, back at Amy and Haylee's house, Haylee was still looking for you. It had been around twenty minutes since you left, and Haylee was running out of places to look. \"Hmph... that human is a lot better at hiding than I gave him credit for. I thought for sure he'd be in Amy's room since the door was open...\" Haylee muttered. \"I've looked all over the place upstairs and downstairs but I just can't find him... The only place I haven't checked is my room.\" Haylee shrugged as she climbed the stairs again and headed for the end of the hallway. She pushed the door open and turned on the lights. Her room happened to be the room you were in right before you escaped her game through the window. \"Alright, you won... you can come out now\" She called, expecting you to pop out from some dark corner of her room. But you didn't, she sighed before looking under the bed and then in her closet. She kept looking and tore apart her room until she noticed that her window was cracked. \"I never open my window,\" She muttered before walking over to the window to close it... however before she closed it she noticed a pair of small footprints on the roof. Her eyes widened as she realized why she couldn't find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Downstairs, Amy was lazily laying on the couch watching her favorite show when Haylee's head popped into her view and blocked the television from her sight. \"Haylee... you're in the way...\" Amy grunted as she tried to watch the show around the wolf's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry Amy, but I have something important to tell you...\" Haylee replied as she bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amy paused and stared at the wolf expectantly, \"What is it?\" She asked in her standard, neutral tone. She then glanced around the room before focusing on Haylee again, \"And where's the human? I thought you were watching him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haylee bit her lip, \"About that... I think he may have, sorta left the house without telling me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amy blinked at Haylee as if trying to comprehend what she had said. Amy gritted her fangs before sitting up on the couch, \"Define 'kinda, sorta' and 'left the house'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haylee gave a sheepish laugh, \"Definitely and ran away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You lost him!?\" Amy shouted in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, yeah...\" Haylee admitted, \"But he couldn't have gotten far!\" She quickly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How far is 'not far'?\" Amy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A couple of blocks give or take?\" Haylee replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In other words he's still in the neighborhood but we don't know where exactly in the neighborhood... right?\" Amy hissed through gritted fangs. Haylee nodded shamefully. Amy shook her head. \"Come on, we've gotta find that kid before someone else does.\" With that, the pair dashed out the door. </span></div></div>",

You solemnly gazed up at the sky which was beginning to fill with more and more clouds by the second. You hear the rumble of thunder in the distance before you feel the sprinkle of raindrops on your face. You sigh and close your eyes before cover them with the back of you hand. \"This is someone's cruel idea of a joke...\" You mutter as the rain begins to pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What makes you say that?\" A curious female, almost childlike voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's just to ridiculous to be anything else,\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe its just bad luck?\" The voice suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't believe in luck\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then what do you believe in?\" The voice inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know anymore,\" You answer, feeling defeated. You're about to sigh when you realize that for the first time in your life. You talked to yourself and got a reply. You remove your hand from your face and open your eyes and find a raccoon anthro staring down at you with a curious expression on her face. She has teal eyes and brown fur that covered most of her body and a bushy tail with black and brown stripes. She was wearing a pink tank top that exposed her midriff and black runner's shorts with pink tennis shoes. She had black hair that stopped just above her shoulders and wore a tennis visor (basically a baseball cap without a top) that sat just under her large pointed ears. Her underbelly was a cream color as were her forearms, while her hands/paws were black with teal polished claws at the end of each finger. The bottom of her muzzle was also a cream color and her eyes and the top of her muzzle were covered by black fur that formed a 'mask' on her face (typical of a raccoon fur pattern). You leap up and make a dash to jump off of the rooftop and over to the next one to make an escape. However, in your haste you completely for get about the rain. Its made everything slick, and while you may have been ok jumping <i>off</i> one rooftop that didn't mean you were ok <i>landing</i> on the next one. When you touched down on the next housetop you slip and fall belly down on the roof. You begin to slide off of the roof feet first, you glance down at your feet just in time to watch your shoes disappear over the edge knowing that you'll follow and probably die from the fall... or break several bones in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just before you go over the edge, you feel something engulf half of your fore arm in its grip. You look up and find the raccoon girl from before holding on to you with a inquisitive yet concerned expression on her face. She hefts you up the roof and sits down on her but with her legs spread apart and pulls you to her so that your sitting between her inner thighs and your back is resting against her torso. Her arms wrap around your chest and stomach as you try to catch your breath. \"Are you ok?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nod you head as you try to respond but can't seem to find the breath to do so yet. You can't see her face but you're sure she's looking at you worriedly. Once your breathing regulates you verbally answer her to calm her mind, \"I'm fine,\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighs in relief, \"I'm glad... I thought that you might have gotten hurt when you slipped or when I pulled you up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I'm ok... really\" You try to assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two of you sit quietly in the rain for a little bit before she breaks the silence, \"You should believe in yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look back at her confused, \"I... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She responds by hugging you tighter before repeating herself, \"You should believe in yourself. Earlier you told me that you weren't sure what you believed anymore, but I think you should believe in yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sit there wondering what she means by that when you feel a soft weight resting on your head. \"I should believe in myself huh?\" You muse, \"How can I do that when I can barely survive in this world without people like you snatching me out of the fire every five minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm...\" She hums, the vibration of her voice actually vibrates your skull causing you to realize that weight you felt earlier is her head, She's holding you like some kind of teddy bear. \"Well, if you won't believe in yourself, I'll believe in you!\" She decides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um... thanks?\" You reply, not sure how to feel about what just happened. \"I don't mean any offense but, who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My name's Kathy, but everyone calls me Kat\" She replies with a bubbly and cheerful voice, \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm Kiba,\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nice to meet ya Kiba!\" She says, \"So are you that human that everyone's been talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Probably...\" You sigh. Before you can think about anything else, a question pops into your head, \"Hey Kat? How old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm eighteen!\" She happily exclaims, \"How old are you Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Me? I'm twenty one...\" You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two continue chatting for a bit until someone spots you... Oh don't look at me like that... You're the only human on this world sitting on a rooftop with a raccoon girl holding you like a teddy bear in the rain... how could you not get spotted? Anyway, the question I should be asking is who spotted you?</span></div></div>",

Finding out that I've gotta take care of a trouble magnet didn't exactly make me feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, that's all well and good,\" You interrupt, \"But what about her?!\" You ask as you gesture to Haylee. \"She hinted at EATING ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amy crossed her arms and stood upright before giving Haylee an irritable stare, \"Please tell me you didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well... maybe a little... but I would've let him out!\" She insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now everyone in the room was awkwardly staring at her. Amy shook her head and sighed, \"From now on no more running away...\" She said as she glared at you, \"And I promise,\" She continued as she softened her face, \"To be more... welcoming.\" You nodded quietly, she gave a quick nod herself before turning to Haylee, \"And you... try to behave yourself. And if you say your going to watch the kid then WATCH HIM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Haylee sighed and rolled her eyes, \"Fine, sure whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good,\" Amy said, satisfied with everyone's answers.</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long for you to fall asleep after the day you'd had. Within a few minutes you were sleeping soundly in a dreamless sleep. Later that night though, you were stirred awake, you groggily opened your eyes and glanced over the room, nothing seemed to have indicated that it was morning, and you were still sleepy. It wasn't until you tried to get out of bed that you felt two furry arms constrict around your stomach and chest. You tried to turn  yourself to see who was holding you but you couldn't. You tried to get out of bed, but you couldn't do that either. Whoever was holding you had a strong grip on you. Eventually the grip loosened just enough for you to slip out of your captor's grasp. You slid out of bed and turned on the lights to find Kat laying in your bed, she slowly stirred in her sleep before waking. At first her expression was blank, and then concerned when she noticed you were missing but when she saw you by the light switch she gave you a tired smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kat, what are you doing in here?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Amy told me to sleep on the couch but I couldn't sleep. It felt hard and lumpy and it was cold downstairs too. So I came up here to sleep with you...\" She explained. The way she spoke made it seem like she was a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shrug, \"Well ok then... I guess I can sleep on the couch-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No!\" She shouted causing you to jump a bit, \"I don't want to sleep up here by myself. I slept by myself last night and the night before that... and I don't like it. I get lonely at night, please sleep next to me? Pretty please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Now she's really starting to sound like a child,\"</i> You think to yourself as she stared at you with misty puppy dog eyes. You meet hold your gaze with her for a while longer before giving in, \"Fine, fine... ok...\" This makes her very happy as her expression changes to one of pure joy and relief. You turn out the lights and crawl back into to bed. The second you lay down Kat wraps her arms around you like your nothing more than a teddy bear to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the two of you settled in, Kat sighed happily, \"You have no idea how lonely I've been for the past couple of days. Being on your own is hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know the feeling,\" You murmur as you stroke one of Kat's arms. You find it odd how something nearly twice your size is afraid to sleep alone, but you understand how she feels. She's never had family, and the only place she could call home was off limits for her now, if you combine that with the fact that she was never really raised then its not hard to see why she acts the way she does. Eventually you feel sleep creeping up on you once again, you mumble a 'good night' to Kat as sleep takes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kat's ears twitch and her lips curled into a small smile, content with your company and happy that she's found a kindred spirit she too began to drift to the dream realm. \"Goodnight... big brother...\" She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were barely able to catch it, but you heard her response just as you fell asleep, \"Big... bro.. ther?\" You mumble.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A cold breeze surrounded you as you stood, shivering, you walk over to the lamp and turn it off. Now, the problem was the window, you close it shut. The breeze of the wind stopped. There was silence... <i>nothing...</i> you keep gazing out the window, and you see the silent neighborhood, dark, the moon shining upon every surface it touched. You relax, the -apperently- stunning view was nice, but you were only on the second floor. You think for a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I thought I did turn off the lights.\" You think to yourself  but then you look back at the window, looking out into the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to feel warm, quite literally, taking in the sight of the view. But wait, a few moments later, you realize something, that warmth wasn't coming from you! Someone was behind you! You start to notice big furry paws, moving slowly around your head,  you don't turn your head, to avoid suspicion to glance at the paws. They were not Haylee's, Amy's, or Kat's, they were yellow.

You stop and jump up, you feel the chain of the lamp, and pull. You step back, looking at the anthro standing before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro was a yellow furred lioness, she was tall and she had blonde hair, just reaching past her shoulders and her eyes glared at you, they were yellow. She was also, you noticed after looking a second time, very strong, her arms were about just as thick as one of your legs. She was wearing a black suit, obviously to avoid detection when in the dark. You walk backwards some more, she is looking at you as if she was determined to do something. She is rushing forward, staring you down intensely, you open your mouth to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-kat!\" You stutter, obviously loud, the lioness swings at you. You dodge to the left, hitting the corner of the room, you continue sliding to the left, trying to dodge all of the lioness's punches and swings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KAT!\" You say a little louder, she is obviously still asleep. Seeing as you are tired too, you think of a way you can try to get out of the lioness's line of fire,  you end up dodging her punches still. Finally, you hit the desk, and you fall over with it among the lamp, the desk hit the floor with an unmistakable noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Who?\" Kat flings up, looking around, the lamp had broken into a bunch of shards, some cutting into your skin. But hey, your a tough guy, the glass doesn't seem to bother you, but from  the shock of the fall, you definitely know this happened. The noises were blasting through the house, waking everything that was living. The yellow furred anthro was still attacking you. She pulled out a cloth, some white patch of material, and jumped on you. Her hands hit your face, generally near your mouth, and Kat saw the lioness strangling you! Kat was scared and ran out into the hallway, flinging the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy!! Haylee!!\" She cried out, getting the two's attention. Back in the room, you tried to breath, but when you inhaled the material that was soaked into the cloth, you started to immediately go to sleep without even getting her off of you. Kat rushed back into the room  and dropkicked the anthro that was now about to pick you up. You could not catch the rest of it, as you finally had fallen asleep due to the material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, you wake up in the same spot that you fell asleep in.

You get up, moving the blanket that was on you and as you glance around, and the room is empty. There was a slight ring in your ear as your right eye started watering, you rub it and your vision is clearer. The sun hit your face as you see the window open, giving a pleasant breeze,  but man, you were cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing your eyes fixed upon was a bed, the one you slept in. Your vision was better after rubbing your eyes. There, beside the bed, you see Kat sitting in a chair that was propped up against the wall.

She opened her eyes, and she jumped up looking at you. She was so happy to see you, ok. Especially after what... happened? What actually happened?  She practically tackled you, hugging you tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big brother!\" She squealed,  tears were running down her eyes. She was so releived, that she did not realize she was forcing the air out of your lungs. Spinning around, she was lifting you out of the air. She set you back down as you regained your breath. You did not know why she was so exited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I thought you were gonna DIE!! Thank you, thank you, thank you for not!\" She shrieked with joy. Die?

You glance at the blanket and back at her. She is just a kid at mind, so she wouldn't know the situation you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" You asked, calmly. She explains everything to you in a heartbeat. </span></div></div>",

You'd rather not think of <i>what</i> they'd eat, but of how <i>much</i> they'd eat. Best option, because you're starting to get hungry... but how would you get over there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe... wait, nocturnal animals go out when dark... and day ones go out... there's a moment where I could dash to the school. Morning! Just when the sun goes up I need to make a dash for it!</i> Perfect! Just the plan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's morning time, it seems to be a <i>very</i> cold day. What's the weather even like here? It was normal yesterday... not it looks like it's about to rain. The cold is keeping you awake, so not all is bad. You can barely see five feet in front of your face. At least you know no animal can see through fog! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prepare yourself to run, you know that there may be some early-bird students there already. Let's try to stay out of sight, shall we? You find a way down the house and scamper to the school, jumping from bush to bush as you go. You stand near the entrance and take a quick look around... into fog. All this condensation hides your scent... or at least you think. You dive behind the wall and enter the school's walls, but not the actual building itself yet. You look around and try to find some sort of direction map-- but you can't. You are literally out in the open for all to see, yet, no one can see in this fog...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the large building that was the school, and you look to see no one there. The lights are on and there's no fog in the building. You scan your surroundings to see many signs showing you where to go. Now, you're lucky not to have been spotted-- yet, so you need to make the most of it. You run down the hall to find the directional symbols indicating where to go. Being the strategist that you are, you find a perfect course to get to the lunch-room/cafeteria. Immediately you start in that direction. There seems to be no one here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run by a clock, '7:34', given when you went to school... eight was about the time it started. The halls are so long-- and wide... and tall. It also seems that the indoor lockers are also somewhat larger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach the lunchroom when you realize-- the lunch attendants-- they'll probably be there. Damn! All this planning, and yet you get stopped by the last thing you expected. our stomach grumbles, and you are thirsty beyond belief. <i>O.k., o.k., find a fountain, and find a way to the roof... simple.</i> At least, it <i>sounded</i> simple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps in a couple of corridors, and you avoid them swiftly-- a fountain! You spot a fountain and run to it, disregarding whoever may be in the crossing section. You get to it and drink for a while. The best thing you've had in a day. You exhale happily, and quietly. It was then that you realize someone was watching you. It was a single person, a bird anthro. He looks at you with an astonished face. His beak opens, he doesn't know what to do. You see he's holding an instrument and has a backpack on. Green feathers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" You say, you immediately run backwards and away from the bird. You hear the scratching of his talons as they shuffle on the hard, smooth floor. Welp! Let's hope he was too stunned to say anything. You think back to the layout of the school, and thanks to your strategic brain, you remember where the roof entrance is. It's in the Janitor's Closet. You run there and, thankfully, you are able to open the door. You scramble up the miscellaneous shelves and get on the roof. You take a deep breath and try to calm down. The brisk cold hits your skin again, now indifferent thanks to last night. It <i>is</i> very cold... maybe you could grab the fire blanket you saw and use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go down and grab it, only to come back up again, onto the school roof. You make sure the latch is closed before you try to get acquainted with the roof. You'll probably live here for all you know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold is a breathtaking reminder that not only are you on some other planet, you're also inferior to literally everything in this world. <i>Maybe</i> you could take on a shorter anthro that was your size, or a taller one where you had the drop on them... with a metal pipe... and protective gear... and they were alone... no luck, huh? You sit against a vent, looks like it's gonna be foggy all day. Wait, it looks like the ground is a bit darker than you remember... a bit-- wetter. You look up. Water lightly splashes your face as you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one of those days...\" You mumble. You find a way to attach the fire blanket to two very close vents, essentially creating a roof. You huddle up next to the warmer vent. You haven't slept in a long time... y'know, this actually... feels... really nice... you close your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall asleep really quickly.</span></div></div>",

You could see the building you were on the night before, but not past that. Let's say you could see about two-hundred feet in each direction. You stretch and yawn. Best sleep you've had in two days. It's still day, but it's slowly becoming dark. You crawl out of your <i>rather small</i> abode. You get up and walk over to the front of the school. The students are leaving, some getting into differently shaped cars as they drive off. You can see some of them talking, but you're so high up you can't hear anything but vents, or any loud cars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be a perfect time to leave, the lunch attendants would've gone home a while ago. Only teachers would still be there, but what's a teacher when you can simply avoid them? You go back to the hatch. You open it slowly and silently so no one can hear. You climb down to see that the brooms have been taken. You slowly open the door back into the school. No one in the halls. You look both ways before darting to the lunch room. You are hungrier than you've ever been in a long time. If you can't get any food, you may just starve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slow down around corners, you may have a place to run too, but if you're caught it won't last for long... no one is in the lunchroom. You open the door to find a large, beautiful mess hall. You see the counter where anthros would get their food and you run over to it, closing the lunchroom door behind you. You slow down as you walk towards the glass. You see no food in the empty holes that large quantities of food would be in. You grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for hot food...\" You groan. Your stomach cramps and you lean forward. You wince a bit, wheezing ever so lightly. You calm down and move around the counter and head for the drooping plastic that led to the kitchen. You smell food, but it's just aftermath. You salivate at the opportunity. Looking around, you see boxes almost as tall as you, brown cardboard, wrapped in a plastic lining. You ignore what it says, because you're so focused on trying to find something. You spot a small box, it looked to be a carton of sorts. You grab it and inspect it... suspicious, but you can't tell what it is. The side of it is labeled with English, or 'Zoplage', and it reads to be an unknown word. Must be an anthro thing... you open the carton. It was one of many where you pulled it out of, so no-one except a very perceptive lunch-lady would find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't smell bad... but it doesn't smell good either. There's a date of expiration on it-- it expires about twenty days from now. Good... but is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry it? (It may have a side effect of knocking you out... I don't know why but I think that's a side effect-- don't ask me why I think that--!)<br>\r\nOR<br>\r\nThrow it away, look for something else. (Let's be safe on this one.)</span></div></div>",

You groan, your stomach hurts from the hunger. You stumble through the kitchen, looking for <i>anything</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere! You spot some... fruit? Never mind that, it's in a basket and it looks scarce, like multiple students took a fruit each. You grab the basket quickly and dumbly. You grab the most eatable-looking fruit and bite into it. You ignore the taste, regardless of however good or bad it is. You greedily chow down on the fruit. It's the best thing you've had in days now, and your vision starts to clear up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you ate the fruit, you threw away the cores, pits, and whatever seeds were in the fruits. You decide to not grab fruit for later, as it would go rotten the next day. Would you know that? No, of course not, you're just guessing at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sneak back down the hallway, you haven't drank since this morning-- despite the rain. You look around the hall this time, the image of the shocked bird anthro still fresh in your mind. No one here. You grab a drink from the same fountain and navigate your way back onto the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeat this process over the course of three weeks. On the weekends, you could sneak in. They never seem to lock the janitor's closet and it also feels like the roof is non-existent to everyone. You are barely living and you feel as if this might just be your life at this point. The school was such a good hiding place, even the police that patrolled the area never thought about looking in their high-school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you sit atop the roof, under your hideout. It's grown since the first night. Over time you realized that the students actually may need the fire blanket more than you do in a dire situation. You relieved your inner tension after finding a type of fabric in the school's art classes. You were able to get enough wood and scrap metal from the school's crafts classes to create a better roof, and you have memorized the school like the back of your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven't had anyone to talk too... for a long time. A month almost. You may be strong-willed, and somewhat of a lone wolf, but you're not one to go a long time without anyone <i>at all</i>. This sucks. You dare not to go outside of the school though, cops still roam the area for humans... and maybe you specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up to the sound of a bell. The morning bell. Dang it! You missed your chance to get water. You rub your eyes. Sitting up, you find that the morning looks better than it has in a while. It's fall, or at least it seems like it, the leaves on miscellaneous trees have turned many different colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's nothing to do-- other than going back to sleep. You simply lay back down, waiting for the day to end. Normally you'd do something to entertain yourself, but recently there's been an upcoming of a long break. Definitely not summer, but an anthro-related holiday break. Maybe something to do with their history or simply just a break in general. You worry that they might not get a shipment of food because of this long break. It actually started to snow yesterday-- light, fluffy snow. It was only for about an hour, but you know this may spell bad things for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suggest it to be some sort of winter break, meaning you'd have to double up the amount of sheets you have and not rely on the vents for heat. You don't sleep, but you do watch as the sun practically drags on the day until sunset. Over time, you wake yourself up and get ready for a massive break for things. You may be hungry, but you're smart not to grab anything more than a ton of food until everyone leaves. If you dared try to sneak anything large like more wood or cloth from the craftsman section of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree weeks has given you enough time to plot the layout and times of the school. You may be on the roof, but your strategic mind has gotten you a ton of information. Very rarely would you sneak down and steal binders-- you always put the student's binders back before they notice. By chance though, you stole a completely unused one and grabbed whatever paper you could find to make a calendar, draw a layout, and lay down the times of teacher's shifts. Not only teachers, but specifically the anthros who work the lunch room. This helped you so that you could virtually never be caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings and you go on the routine food run. You make sure no one is following you... but you can't get this one noise of scratching tile out of your head. You constantly look behind you for that scratching noise. Grabbing a box of labeled food, you make sure to grab a flat of water. Perfect, just enough for this long break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run back into the janitor's closet and onto the roof. You make a sigh of relief as the feeling of being followed subsided. You set down the flat of water and box of food. You believe night would be a good option to go back into the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours later you get to watch the beautiful sunset. Given-- it may be shattered a bit by the buildings on the ground, it's still beautiful in its own way. You lean against a resident vent, thinking about your life. After a while, you get so lost in thought that you didn't notice the latch opening. You stand looking at the sunset until you hear a thud. <i>The latch!</i> You whip your attention towards the vent and see a familiar sight. It's that bird-- from weeks ago! You stand there, gawking at the green bird. He looks at you with confidence in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, hoping to find an unnoticed exit, but there's nothing you can spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it wasn't my imagination!\" He exclaims. He seems happy to relieve himself of his doubts, at the cost of scaring the life outta you. You don't know what to do, but you get ready to defend yourself. You stand in a defensive position. He notices this and immediately changes his expression to fearful. \"Hey, hey, I'm not gonna tell anyone you're up here!\" He blurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" You wheeze, you haven't talked in a while. He stutters a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I watched you over the course of three weeks-- \" He admits. You are stunned at this. \"I didn't say anything because I didn't know what to do-- so I thought about it for a while-- and-- I wanted to help you.\" He explains. You slowly let go of your defensive position, the anthro is just a teenager really. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You ask, your voice is a bit better now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-- you've been living in horrible conditions, I've got no friends, and you're a mythical creature living in hiding.\" The bird tells you, he sounds like he's trying to convince you to do something. <i>Coming up here must've taken a ton of courage... wait--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone else know I'm up here?\" You ask sharply. He shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only I know. Not even the wolves in school know about you being here. Nor the teachers.\" He says. You are a bit relieved at that... but what does he want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Kiba.\" You explain. The bird notices your setup by the vents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Lano, and to think about it, it's becoming winter. You won't be able to survive up here during then, because they're going to lock every entrance to the school. Power will be out... no shipments of food...\" He says in a slow way, like he's gonna say something else. \"I can offer you a place to stay in secret, in turn, you can tell me about you-- and where you came from...?\" He seems to drag away at the offer, he's shy and doubting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to think about it for a moment... and you admit it will be hard to live here... \"Why do you want to help me?\" You question curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know-- if I knew a creature such as you were living in horrible conditions and I could've done something about it, I couldn't stand that.\" He admits strongly. You find it hard to believe that an anthro wants to help you. A strong breeze whips by both of you and harshly reminds you that Lano's right. You look at your setup and back at the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine-- sure, I'll agree to that.\" You reluctantly admit. He smiles... or at least it looks like he does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Lano exclaims. He's obviously happy with your decision. \"The only problem now would be about how to get you around... and not get you caught by anyone...\" He mumbles under his breath in thought for a moment. He stands two feet taller than you. You look around and take a good view of the area. Lano walks up to you. You watch him as he gets closer. You get a better look at this bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly goes down and comes back up with a rolling backpack. <i>New backpack huh?</i> You immediately realize how big the backpack is and what he might be thinking. Lano walks to you, bringing the backpack. He examines you and then his backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could work. You can fit. Since this was the last day before our big break my backpack's pretty much empty.\" He offers with pride of his result. You think for a moment... this was weird but it could work...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tYou\u2019re silent for a moment. Your gaze switching between the green bird and his backpack. This is ridiculous, but it\u2019s not like you have any better ideas. Honestly, this isn\u2019t your only option, you could just say no and run around again, but why do that when the bird is offering to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHehe\u2026 this is weird huh?\u201d Lano pats the back of his head, \u201cI agree.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cO.k.\u201d You reply. Lano opens the backpack using the zipper. You step forward, awkwardly. You\u2019re going to get into a backpack\u2026 a rolling backpack\u2026 that a green, anthro bird owns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh\u2026 well I mean, do you want help?\u201d Lano asks. You look up at the bird and nod. As he helps you in the backpack, you could swear you saw a blush on his face. The backpack starts to zip up, and before the zipper catches your hair you brush it away from the top of the backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cO.k., now\u2026\u201d Lano says. A couple seconds go by, you hear nor feel the backpack or Lano move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre we good?\u201d You ask, slightly muffled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry, but we gotta do this again.\u201d Lano replies. You tilt your head at the statement as he unzips the backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe\u2019re on the roof.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou wait. You feel the constant roll of the backpack, and you\u2019re leaning on some papers and one schoolbook. It\u2019s a large, brand-new schoolbook, and it\u2019s a math book, it seems. Hard to read when cramped in a dark backpack. You hear Lano\u2019s footsteps; these are the same steps that made the scratching noise, so he <i>was</i> stalking you, eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe growing crowd of students seemed to disappear a bit. \u201cI\u2019ve got to grab my instrument.\u201d Lano says, as if to himself. You don\u2019t know if it was directed to you or not, but now you know. A minute or two later you hear the sound of opening cabinets and other students tuning their instruments. You know the sound of a tuned instrument since you\u2019re sometimes entranced by the music made by anthros. <i>Yeah, that\u2019s some pretty good music.</i> You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHave a good break, teacher!\u201d Lano calls, presumably to a teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou too, student!\u201d The deep-voiced teacher replies, copying the student-teacher joke. You hear something smack. You wonder what it is until you hear Lano mumbling under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDamn it- it\u2019s Mr.Stan- not... \u201c Lano mumbles, then sighs. Turns out that Lano can curse. There is a large sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<b>\u201dDon\u2019t forget, students must return their textbooks before they leave for break.\u201d</b> The announcement cuts off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh! Oh. Oh\u2026\u201d Lano states. You realize the book you\u2019ve been laying on has to be returned. A bit of you feels untrustworthy to Lano still. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got this.\u201d He says. His voice was suddenly a lot louder and you jumped. (As much as you could inside a backpack). \u201cSorry!\u201d Lano whispered clumsily. A minute or two later, Lano sets the backpack on its stands. You hear the backpack unzip and a green-feathered hand reaches down and slides a book from out of the backpack. You hope to god no one saw you..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere\u2019s a bit more space, except for a few miscellaneous folders with different designs. The backpack is closed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou think Lano attached his instrument to the backpack, because every bump of the sidewalk that bounces, you feel a thump. It\u2019s been a while, no more loud voices of young anthros, and no more ventilation whirring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cO.k., Kiba, my house is close.\u201d Lano whispers in the direction of his rolling bag. You don\u2019t reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA couple moments later, you hear the twist of a doorknob. A healthy echo rings throughout a large space. An anthro house. You\u2019re suddenly lifted off the ground with a grunt. The sudden feeling of being carried is weird. The next motion makes you feel as if you are going up a flight of stairs\u2026 which was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe steps stop and a door opens. You hear it close.. Lano sets the backpack on the floor. You breathe in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlright, we\u2019re here. My house.\u201d Lano announces. \u201cNo one is here but us right now.\u201d He says, trying to act nonchalant. You shuffle in position, as it is very cramped in a backpack. There is a zip and you look out of the backpack to see a room. The room is very large, because anthros <i>are</i> large, and it almost amazes you. His room is almost as tall as the school hallways. The walls are dark green, as is complementary to Lano\u2019s color. Interesting that there would be a desk. Most children don\u2019t have desks in their room, but more a dresser, or a t.v. on a shelf of sorts.  There\u2019s a bed with a logo, and it looks hastily made. The floor is carpet, you guess that\u2019s because of the fact that Lano is a bird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou stand up and step out of the backpack like a master contortionist performing for an audience. To be honest, you would\u2019ve preferred to sit on the rough, hard concrete than a cramped, jumpy backpack, but no matter. You take another glance around the room, and see the door, which is white, and a closet. This, to Kiba, might have just been the most boring room to exist; Kiba would go crazy in such a boring room. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do not disappoint me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course madam Deluma. The blood hound has already been called. consider him ours.\" Luna saluted as Deluma leaped of. With her presence gone Luna relaxed considerably. \"we have a 10-20 I'm on the corner of Main and Houser. I need the bloodhounds search and recovery squad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Affirmative commander Luna.

Patiently waiting for your opportunity. eventually you see one. a large delivery truck comes by. when it stops at the light you roll underneath it. Hanging on for dear life. allowing tic to take you to the beach near the cove. as you approach the beach you realize that you may have made the wrong call. Anthros littered the beach a group of reptiles laid out to the east soaking up the suns warmth. while on the other side. Anthros of all kinds played volleyball. A group of dogs played Frisbee. you sat behind the sign wondering how on earth you where going to make it to the water unnoticed.  You decide to sneak past the reptiles as they are mostly asleep, or you hop at least to lazy to care about you. quickly u run past pilfering some snorkeling gear you find laying buy a lizard who was fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"ya snooze ya loose.\" he shifted as you spoke causing you to make a mad dash for the water. where you proceeded to outfit yourself with the snorkeling gear. You swim along admiring the reef and all the beauty it provided. your arms and legs burn as the grotto was much farther off than you had though but eventual you make it. swimming up you notice two Anthros sitting in the cave talking one was a rabbit. She had long and curly blond hair tan fur with brown spots and streaks scarcely adorning it. her eyes where blue you cant make out the other Anthro. you stay hidden behind some rocks. you cant help but to think this one might not seem so bad.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Coral dotted the entrance. The tunnels curved to the left before shooting up. Accending rapidly, gulping air into your burning lungs as you reach the surface.

However the equipment is far to large for you to even attempt to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0you turn around when you hear a scream.

You freeze as you see the other anthro hovering over you. She was obviously female. She wore a two piece wet suit. Her skin was a blue grey with black strips. Where as her stomach was a light blue as where the bottoms of her hands and feet. The Tiger shark wasn't big standing at seven feet she barely towers you. She had a dorsal fin on her back. As well as additional fins on her forearms and legs. She had white hair just past her shoulders and amnethist eyes.

Her house was two part. She had \"the lair\" the cave of tunnels below leading to the cave where you first met. The caves had been smoothed out. Lighting fixtures, bookcase and pictures lined the rooms giving it all a very modern and comfortable look. You pause and look at one to looks like a family portrait.

But, you don't know what to expect in the first place, because you're somewhere you don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Oh, that's where you're wrong. You're very, annoying. You'll learn to behave eventually.\" Deluma states as if it's fact. She steps closer, looking you up and down, and if Deluma wasn't a lady, you'd almost feel violated with the way she was watching you. You step back. <i>Oh, you ain't gonna touch me, 'Mayor Deluma'.</i> You think. She starts to talk again, while walking forward. You continue to walk back. \"I won't say it again, what is your name?\" She says, with violence in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        You debate on telling her. <i>I'm Tera Westfield.</i> You look to Luna for help, she looks back, and neither of you know what to do.

Deluma looks back at Luna, expecting for her to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Well?\" Deluma says, trying to calm her tone as she does not want to make a public scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"This is a police matter. We have to take her into custody.\" Luna starts. \"We have a job to finish, Mayor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Not anymore. Humans are not anthros. Mythical, if you ask anyone. Humans should be put in labs and studied.\" Deluma commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"I can tell you about humans all without you or anyone experimenting on me, thank you! That is rude!\" You exclaim. Deluma flashes you a dark face, while Luna glances at you with shock. You catch Luna's face and realize you may have said something wrong, as you look towards Deluma and start worrying. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                        \"Take her to SD labs, now Luna Barker! Your job is on the line.\" Deluma says, gritting her teeth. Luna protests, but she eventually submits and <br>\r\n commands her officers to arrest you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        Moments later, you are forced into the back of the police car with Luna right behind you. You want to run so badly, you don't comply. You attempt to fix your hair, but you know your hands are cuffed, and now you have a ton of loose hairs messing with your eyelashes. At least Luna isn't so bad... in fact she was fascinated by you. Her huge paw covers your left shoulder, beckoning you to get into the back of the police van. You can tell she's uncomfortable as she constantly shifts around. Suddenly, you're pulled in front of her, and your mouth is covered by her right paw. You give a muffled scream, but you're forced to look up into the face of Luna, who is trying to shush you. Luna takes one more glance around, no one is looking, not even Deluma, who's distracted by two other officers who are bending to her needs. Luna looks down into your frightened eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Shh! Be quiet, ok? Listen closely if you want to get away...\" Luna whispers, her wolf-like face bent over to tell you something. Now that you have a good look at her face, she actually looks cute, like a real wolf. Realizing she is not up to anything bad, you calm down. She takes her paw off of your mouth. \"I can't tell you everything, but for now, I'm going to unlock your handcuffs, when I do, start running down that left alleyway. I'll fake a scene for you to get away.\" She finishes, while unlocking your cuffs. You nod, getting ready to run. <i>Wait... </i> The cuffs unlock. She pushes you away, almost tripping you with the sheer amount of anthro strength versus your own human body. You start running, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Officers!\" Luna shouts after about 5 seconds, giving you a head start. Deluma spins around, looking at Luna, then... to you. \"The human i-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Get that human!!!\" Deluma orders, pushing the four unaware officers with her tails towards you. They look around then look to you, realizing that you probably got away. 3 of them start running to grab you, Luna follows as well. Luna is attempting to keep up the act. She does a good job, as even Deluma is convinced.  The last officer left is stunned, obviously he must be a new officer. The shark-like anthro shuffles at his belt as you're about to head down the left alleyway. You are very fast for a human, making do with the 5 - 6 seconds Luna generously gave you. Running by through the alleyways, you can't help but feel that even the trash cans are a bit overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        Deluma is furious, making fists with her hands and slamming the car door as she gets in. Deluma rolls down the window, and shouts to the last officer left. The shark-like anthro pulls out a pistol-looking thing out of his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Shoot it if you have to, but just get it into the lab!\" She yells. The officer jumps at her tone, putting a hand against his heart like he just had a jump scare. He looks down at his pistol, he has an excellent grip on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"But ma'am, I- I don't want to hurt a creature so rare! I mean, do you even know what would hap--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Your job is on the line, cadet, now get moving!!\" She shouts, rolling the window up again. He opened his mouth to protest, but eventually he runs towards where he saw the others run. He stops for a second, considering his options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"The human went down Zolpa street, target is continuing to climb the building at Zopla and Barko street.\" The radio on his vest says. He jumps again, but this time, into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        You jump off the top of the trashcan, and grab onto the bottom rung of the apartment ladder. The 3 officers and Luna were unable to get you. They easily grab onto the ladder and start chasing. Luckily, regardless of being in a completely different... universe, you know that the buildings around the area look very familiar. Looking down, the anthros are just under you. You won't be able to get to the top in time. So you look across the way. Another ladder, far. You keep looking down and across, debating on taking the jump. Luna sees what you're doing, and tries to tell you to stop, but you already took the jump. The other 3 officers look in awe as you jump across. Thanks to your amazing gymnast background, the jump was easy. You slam your feet onto the metal platform, taking a roll and slamming your back against the hardened metal poles. You get up, attempting to ignore the possible bruises you just received. The officers don't know what to do. You start to running down the ladder, as you are on the other side of a fence disconnecting the two ladder platforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        You jump off the bottom rung and land in a rather soft pile of trash. You're not away yet, but you have a ton of time. You expect that those four officers are not the only part of this huge cities' police force. You run around the corner, and you look around. Luna got you to run, but what now? You start continue past the horrified, shocked, and even dumbfounded faces that stare at you. There are no officers in sight, but, a peculiar thing dawns you. Another human, just across the way.  He looks to have glasses. You want to talk to him, but as he is on the opposite side of the street, you can't reach him. Both of you are causing quite a scene. But you notice something... he's grabbed, and pulled into the nearest alleyway. He doesn't make any sounds, but you don't know why. The sight of this very quick appearance stops you in your tracks. You <i>must</i> help whoever that was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       Looking both ways, you dash across the street. There seems to be nothing bad, focusing on the human with the glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"Stop right there!\" Yells a shaky voice. You freeze and look around, now you are open in the street. You catch sight of an officer, they seem to resemble what you think to be a shark. He has a gun! He now has your full attention, but you want to run and find out what happened to the human. \"Get on the ground!\" He obviously looks and sounds young... must be a cadet. Nevertheless, you don't want him to shoot you. Cars are now stopped, as this scene is about to unfold. The officer's walkie-talkie starts picking up feedback, he picks it up with one of his hands and tries to speak through it. You take this chance to decide what to do, as you have not gotten on the ground. <i>Things just keep getting better and better...</i> What do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Run towards the other human's last location...<br>\r\n                OR<br>\r\n                Try to reason with this nervous cadet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                (Spoiler: The gun is simply a pain mechanic, it works like a taser, but it wont stop you completely from completing what you want to do. The first choice will get you shot, but you will still get away, as the cadet is too surprised he actually shot his gun.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>                          You immediately start running again. This startles the shark-like police anthro, and he jitters for a moment. You hope with all your heart that he doesn't know how to shoot that thing. Alas, he takes aim quicker than a sailfish on steroids. He shoots his gun, and what looks to be a bullet comes out. It hits you in the leg, left leg. Good thing you're right dominant! You drop and catch yourself on a car, screaming in pain. <i>Did I just get shot!?</i> You wonder. Looking down at your leg, you are very surprised. There is no bullet hole, but there is a coil attached from the piece to the officer's gun. You yank it out while taking a glance up. The shark is completely stunned. He is just purely in shock that he actually shot someone, and it was reflex! You continue running towards the alleyway where you saw the human with glasses. The shark anthro comes to his senses and starts giving chase, but he's a bit too far now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         Practically limping around, you have gone into a completely new alleyway. There are many bystanders who are now looking around, gasping and whispering to one another with questions along the lines of: 'What was that?' and 'Was that a-'. No one could finish most of these questions. Every time you pass another scared anthro, you can't help but feel like one of them is about to grab you. The alleyway was empty, and the shark anthro is extremely close now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         You're pulled from behind, letting out a shriek, yet muffled. By now with the amount of times your mouth has been covered by different anthros, you practically expected that of all things. You're pulled into a door as it's being shut. Jerking around, you attempt to get out of this suspicious person's grip. Large, furry paws cover your face, and another arm seems to have wrapped around you. As if pulling you in for a hug. A rather violent, unsuspecting hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"I've lost --em, --- don't --ow wh--e the hu--n went.\" a voice says outside. Must've been the shark police officer. Obviously the voice was null, thanks to the closed door. The arms have you in a tight grip, and now your back is shoved against a larger body. You feel a hard vest against your back. Tears are forming in your eyes as you've just been constantly violated and forced around by these larger, animal-like creatures, but you still fight this grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Stop it! We're trying to help you!\" The feminine voice whispers, right above your head. You slow your struggles. \"You're safe, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Yeah, don't worry, she's not gonna hurt us.\" Another voice adds. This voice was a man's voice. <i>Us?</i> You stop struggling. The grip loosens. You make this your chance and you force your way out of the grip. Spinning around, you can't see anyone. It's completely dark. You catch a reflection on something at your height level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Who are you?\" You demand, yet in a quiet manner. Someone steps forward, into the light. A human, it's the one with the glasses! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"I'm Neil, Niel D'laundie. This is Agent Howlings.\" Niel states, gesturing towards the large anthro, who just steps forward and into the light. It was a husky-looking type anthro. She had blue eyes and dark hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Natasha Howlings. That's my full name.\" She mentions. You sigh, and you take a breather, but it was hard to breath when your leg hurt like someone just put your leg on fire... in fact, it felt like it was being electrocuted, burned, frozen, and on top of that, slightly impaled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"I'm-- Terra Westfield-\" You manage to squeeze out, there is so much pain in your left thigh. \"I s-saw you get-- augh!\" You shudder. You pull up the left side of your gymnast shorts a bit, as you were in the acrobatics chamber when you were put here. There's a small amount of blood protruding from your thigh. You wince at it, as Niel gasps. You fall backwards a bit, finally hitting the floor. Niel rushes forward to help you. Natascha looks around in her -now more noticeable- vest. \"I saw you g-et pulled out of th- the street,\" You inhale sharply. \"So I tried t-- to find you-\" You try to finish, but now you feel like you can't get anything more out than audible pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"What happened?\" Niel asks with anxiousness. He tries to sit you up against a nearby wall. With him this close, you can see his face more clearly. He looks so- great, considering he is the first human you've seen within this whole disastrous situation. Obviously he does not know what to do. Natascha comes closer, kneeling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"I think she was shot. But I don't know what it is. Deluma keeps coming out with these new things almost every week... must have been something new.\" Natascha explains. She looks at you. \"What happened?\" She repeats Niel's question. She still looks to be at an astonishing height. Probably seven to nine feet tall?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"It looked l- like a taser--\" You cry softly. You rub your eyes with your right hand, clenching your left hand in response. Natascha tilts her head like a confused puppy. Niel looks to Natasha as he is about to explain. For some reason, the pain is spreading into your left side, under your arm and around your hips. You can't move your left leg now. And the pain has stopped spreading. You're crying to much to hear what Niel is saying to Natascha. \"It f-eels like I'm - burning, stunned-- I can't--\" You start to explain, Niel and Natascha turn to look at you. You inhale sharply again. \"I can't move my leg--!\" You bawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"We've got to do someth-\" Niel tries to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"I know! Just-- wait here with her. If what you said is true, Deluma may have made a twist on this 'taser'. We should not move her until we get a doctor to help. And luckily, our agency have a few people in their back pockets.\" Natascha cuts in. Niel listened. You feel tired, from both running and being shot. You start to close your eyes, but Niel shakes your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Don't go to sleep! We don't know what Deluma did.\" Niel starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"This place is safe, you stay here with Terra. Niel- I know you are very trustworthy, regardless of just meeting me. So, don't. Leave. This. Building. Got it?\" Natascha says to Niel. She now regards that you are too distracted to consciously listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"How long are you going to be gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"About a day, over there is some food and water. I hope our anatomies are close enough that it will do.\" Natascha says, pointing over to a small box in the corner. How'd that get there? She must know this place like the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Ok. But what if someone tries to get in?\" Niel responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"The door is locked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"If they- do, get in though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Here.\" Natascha finishes. She pulls out a baton looking thing. \"This will electrocute anyone you hit, be careful.\" She hands it to Niel, and he practically uses all his might to hold it up. There is a switch on it, presumably to turn it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"I- I just-\" Niel tries to say. Obviously he is just as confused and lost as you are in this world. \"Thank you, for, well... just helping us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Don't worry, I'm here for that.\" She says in a kind, soft tone. She gets up, and heads to the same door you came in from. our eyes have adjusted to the light but are still fuzzy from your tears of pain. You are shuddering. Belting weakly as you keep trying to stay awake. The door makes a really light flash, and just as fast as it came, it left. The police were gone, so she was able to walk out perfectly. The door locks. Now, it's dark, with one small window too keep in light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Niel- please, don't leave me. I can't do anything by myself- I-I-\" You ventilate. He looks to you in a sad, yet caring way. He shakes it off, and comforts you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Don't worry, what was your name?\" Niel asks, obviously he wants to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"T- Terra.\" You get out. Niel sits down beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Don't worry, Terra. I won't leave you. But I need you to stay awake. Who knows what may happen if you fall asleep... how about this, tell me about yourself?\" Niel says shyly. He noticed how tired you looked, and how red your face was from bawling. But now you're a bit calmer. You start to have a headache. You want to fall asleep so badly... but Niel is right. You <i>don't</i> know what would happen if you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"I- I used to be a gymnast.\" You start. Eventually you tell Niel all about your gymnastics career, and how you still look beautiful with all the hair products you use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        About an hour later, you and Niel have stopped talking. There's really nothing to do. Sitting for such a long time has gotten you very tired... this is your choice. You decide if you fall asleep. It is and will always be your choice to fall asleep or not. So... do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        Stay awake, you are probably hungry or something.<br>\r\n                        OR<br>\r\n                        Try to sleep, Niel has a close eye on you, so you probably won't succeed.</span></div></div>",

Not being able to move has its disadvantages. He is sitting on a crate about half his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Niel?\" You beckon. He snaps back into reality and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Yes, Terra?\" He replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Do you know if there's any edible food here?\" You ask. You feel very tired, and hungry, and thirsty. That was just enough to keep you awake for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Yes, right here.\" He says. Niel gets up and walks over to you with a box. It was a pretty big box. He opens it and reveals different kinds of packaged food. \"I don't know if any of this is good for us... but if you're hungry she said this is what there was for the time being. Oh, and here.\" He hands you a water bottle, it was made of glass. Impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"Thank you, Niel.\" You say. You hug him, and he is purely stunned. Probably doesn't get many girls. He eventually hugs back. After fixing his glasses, he walks back to his crate and sits down. You swear you saw a slight blush come from him as he pulled away. He's smiling. Afterwards, you dig into some of the miscellaneous foods. You leave him a big part of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       <i>Later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       You feel so much better, thanks to staying awake. You couldn't see as it got dark, but Niel was vigilant; regardless of his personality. Looking up, you see that he dozed off in a funny position. He had his head drooping over the side of the massive crate. You start trying to get up now that he isn't telling you to sit down. You don't know what happened to your leg, but you can't move it. The pain subsided, but now you're very sore from staying awake on the cold, concrete floor. While moving, you notice that you had a blanket on your legs. <i>Aww... thank you Niel!</i> You pick the blanket up and move it to your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       Time to move.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       You put your arms out and stretch them, then suddenly you were preforming acrobatic stretching routines. You push against the ground and use your right leg to pick yourself up. Yep, your left leg can't move. You use the random shelves that were in place to support yourself over to Niel. His glasses fell on the floor, so you pick them up and put them next to him. You tap his shoulder and you shuffle his hair until he wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"Wha-- oh, hey Terra, I just had this scary dream...\" Niel says drowsily. He squints at you and he says, \"Wait, Terra? I don't know any Terras...\" He looks around. \"Oh, we're still here. Complete strangers in a strange world. How delightful...\" He mumbles. You chuckle and find his hand. You give him his glasses after wiping them off with your shirt. \"Wait-- how are you walking?!\" He exclaims, you now have his full attention. He sits up and puts his glasses on, accidentally bumping himself in the head with the large baton-looking device. Looks as if he fell asleep with it in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"The pain is gone, so I decided to try and walk. It's morning.\" You say with glee. \"Rise and shine, glasses!\" You joke. He looks at his clothes and chuckles. You two talk for a bit. You end up convincing him to help you set traps. You constantly feel like you're being watched, and you felt that putting up traps around the door and the few scattered windows would make you feel comfortable. Niel helps make it your guy's turf. You sit back down in your spot after a good bit of moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"So. What now?\" You ask Niel. He doesn't know what to say and shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"Meh, I really can't say. To be honest you made a good point, an anthro could sneak into this room at any mome-\" He is cut off by a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"Hey, it's me.\" Says a familiar voice from the other side of the door. You hear the door unlock before you can react. Niel jumps up, with his baton in hand. The door swings open and you two are happy to see the familiar face of Natascha. There's another person with her, an otter-like anthro. The otter is about a foot smaller than Natascha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Thank god it's you, Natascha.\" Niel sighs. You look up to see them and smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Hi!\" You exclaim. You're very cheerful regardless of your situation. The otter rushes into the room and looks around. Niel jumps back and out of the way. The door shuts and Natascha turns on a light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Oh, that would've been nice to have.\" Niel mumbles sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Sorry, I forgot to tell you.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"It's o.k.; it's actually good you didn't tell us. Think about it.\" Niel replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Good point, Niel.\" She states. The otter anthro whipped out his bag, it had a medical cross on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Don't mind him, he's very diligent, conscientious even.\" Natascha explains. The otter hurries over to you and kneels down. He's dressed in a white t-shirt and soft, dark blue pants while carrying a very discreet medical bag. Niel slowly heads over to observe the otter doctor. The otter doesn't speak, but he makes eye contact with you, then back to Natascha. \"Oh, yes that's right.\" Niel looks to her. \"He doesn't speak.\" Niel looks back at the otter, and the otter to you. You stay with a fixed vision onto the otter. \"His name is Fallo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        He lifts up your left leg with his larger, fluffy paws. You look at him nervously. He looks up and slows down. He looks you into the eyes and you immediately think that he's very concerned. You nod and show him where you were bleeding. He opens his mouth then closes it. Then Fallo starts shuffling through his bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Very interesting...\" Niel says. Fallo pulls out a gauze and applies it to your leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"I can't move my left leg, it's as if it's paralyzed.\" You explain, Fallo looks up. \"I don't feel anything there, or well, anywhere in my left leg.\" You finish. Fallo looks up to Natascha, who's now standing over and behind him. Niel is crouched along with you. Thinking about it, you forget that you feel captured. You wanted to be an acrobat to feel free when you move... and now your leg is stunned. Of course it isn't broken, it's straight, you just don't know what is wrong with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"What should we do, Fallo?\" Natascha asks. She is equipped with the same vest as yesterday, but you notice that over it, she's wearing a different shirt, as if to blend in with people. Fallo stands up and pulls out a phone. You can't tell what he's doing as the two anthros are just so ridiculously tall to tell. Niel has been looking at you, gripping your hand. Now... you know his name and all, but he's still a stranger. He may feel differently about you, so you let him hold your hand. You look back up and see Natascha nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"Terra, I'm smart, and I'd have to say this has stumped my knowledge of human anatomy. I don't know how your leg is stunned, but I will find some way to help.\" Niel assures. You look back down to the only human you've seen in one and a half days. You smile and hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"Fallo, there's still one more human we know to be out there that we know of. What about that one?\" Natascha asks. Fallo looks into her eyes with reassurance. He must be good with facial expressions, because whatever he just did, he convinced Natascha. You're sure of that, as Natascha walks out. She comes back in with two large coats. They were pretty bland coats, literally no color and both have hoods. Niel stands up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"Hmm. I think we're supposed to wear those, huh?\" Niel guesses. Fallo nods, he takes the coats and hands you both one. You put yours on with some effort, while Niel just puts it on in two seconds. Fallo kneels down next to you. He puts his paw on your left shoulder. You look into his eyes again. He starts to pick you up, putting his left arm around your legs, and his right around your torso. Niel looks at Natascha. \"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"We're taking you to our facility. Terra needs to stay there while we figure out what happened. Niel, you will stay there too, Deluma wastes no time when she becomes ambitious. We cannot risk having you two here while there is still one more human out there.\" Natascha explains. Fallo holds you against his chest, carrying you. You feel a bit small in his arms. The four of you exit the building and get into a car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         You are driven to the facility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         Eventually you are put in a room that resembles a hospital's room. Fallo stays with you while he figures out what is stunning your leg while Natascha and Niel meet with Natascha's boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         Fallo is on a computer, there are multiple things skewed about this room you're in. Things such as: small glasses full of liquids, different kinds of medical supplies, and just pure clutter. Fallo is typing away at the computer he's on, he seems very focused... try to talk to him? I mean... he doesn't talk but surely there might be some way for him to tell you about where you are or why humans are considered mythical. You decide not to talk to him. But y'know... you must surely be able to go to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         \"Hey, Fallo.\" You say, trying to get his attention. He looks up as he straightens his back. \"Can I sleep?\" He looks from his computer to you then your leg, obviously thinking something. He nods. \"Thank you.\" You say while smiling. He gets up and looks around the room for something. Fallo hands you a pillow, a rather generous offer. \"Thank you again!\" You repeat He smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          Soon, you doze off.</span></div></div>",

He stops talking after a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Stay right there. You are under arrest-- or whatever Deluma said.\" The anthro responds. Does he know what he's talking about? He probably doesn't get why you need to be captured. Many anthros stop to look at this rather sudden scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Do you even know what Deluma wants me for? Because I don't.\" You point out. He keeps his gun pointed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Uh... for running from the police-- yeah, that's it!\" The young officer said. You shake your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"That's a good point, but that's not what I'm getting at.\" You retort.

Now you don't know how to get to the other human. Different anthros have covered the entrance to the alleyway. Those bystanders may not be the officers, but they sure are tall enough to discourage you from accomplishing your goal.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n                     \"Come on! I don't want to go into a lab! What do you think they'll do to me in this 'SD Labs' of yours?!\" You yell. You're very angry considering the amount of acrobatic skill you'd shown back near those other buildings that stand at your right. Many faces swing back and forth between you and the officer. The officer looks around nervously, debating something. \"Please don't-- I don't belong here.\" You continue. That's right, wherever you are, you did not belong there. The officer keeps his hand steady. A couple of bystanders step forward and into the street. You look around. <i>Maybe they can help me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"Hey officer.\" Someone says. The officer looks over to see a strong looking bear anthro. He looks into the shark anthro's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"Back off, this is a police matter.\" The officer states. From the other side, a fox anthro speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"Are you even an officer?\" The fox states. You see the officer breaking. If he is as new to the police as you believe, then he must be getting nervous thanks to the public. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"Yes-- back down.\" The officer states. You move backwards a bit. \"Hey! Don't move or I'll shoot!\" He yells. <i>That escalated quickly...</i> You stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     \"Don't shoot it!\" An unidentifiable anthro shouts. Soon, multiple anthros are on your side. They start crowding the police officer as he protests and yells at them to back off and 'it's a police matter'. There is a ton of yelling. Two police vehicles clear around the corner behind the crowd. One is a large police van, and another is just a car. Police step out of the vehicle. You swear you could see Luna, but you don't take any chances and start bolting down the street, yelling 'Thanks!' and 'Thank you(s)' to anyone who could hear. Even though some anthros came to your defense, some still sided with the shark policeman. Many different anthros try to grab you as you elegantly duck and dive under and around them. This all leads into a fight that breaks out. Some police manage to escape the lock of the crowd and give chase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      You are small, but you run fast thanks to your gymnastic abilities. Quite literally you'd do flips to avoid some still-in-motion cars. There are many ways to get away... you must choose quick! While running down the street, you see to your left that there's an incline and beyond that is a large vehicle. <i>Wait?!</i> There's another human on there! But you can't exactly get to that human at the moment, but they're on the back of a truck--  presumably catching a ride. There's another large vehicle behind it, but with the different logos and such, you could tell it won't go in the same direction as that other human. You can climb on some conveniently jagged walls to leap onto it... but to your right there's another way to get out of your situation. To your right is another large street, crowded with more cars and unaware anthros who are going about their business. They must not know what was going on around the corner. Do you continue running to your right? Or do you try to get onto the bus behind the other human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     Left! (You will have to do some hardcore parkour, but you'll get away.)<br>\r\n                     OR<br>\r\n                     Right!

You're in a full-blown sprint now. Looking at these anthro-fied cars makes you want to do the cinematic thing where you run along on top of the cars, jumping onto each one as it's near. You scrap that idea as the cars are too big to jump onto. You run onto the sidewalk, bumping some anthros while running. About four seconds behind you are some cops. It seems that wolves are not as fast as you think. Pedestrians look at you then to the cops. There is a good gap between you and the officers in chase. You can hear their thunderous footsteps against the cement, but you can't look back to see them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      You're at another difficult choice-- left or forward.

You doubt the structural integrity of the building. You'd for sure find a place to hide, but it's two stories. The floor may be somewhat unstable. To your left-- a subway entrance.

You don't have time to react as you get to the top of the stairs. Off in the distance are dark clouds. You could run in the direction of said clouds. Left of the subway exit was the street, with parked cars. The uproar you caused stopped cars for complete city blocks.

You are shocked, he forgave you?! Without pause you turn around and sprint down the sidewalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall animals are going crazy, pushing and shoving each other at this point for no reason whatsoever. It seems that the only people that have a cause to make commotion are the ones a couple blocks over, the ones that are surrounding the cops. You sidestep and jump over miscellaneous objects and what appears to be broken glass. You hear roars and screeches. You see some animals have gotten out of the craziness by sliding into the alleyways. Loud honks and the sound of breaking glass seems to deafen everything else. You duck under random claws and shift your weight to get ready to continue running. Thunder goes off in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here you!\" A loud and hoarse yell grabs your attention. By this point you were crossing a street. You look to see the multiple-tailed mayor. Deluma. Your eyes widen and you start running faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" You yelp as you jump over her swiping tails. Deluma roars and jumps to tackle you. You squeeze <i>just{/} under her arms and continue sprinting down the street once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here!!\" She screams as she recovers. You're out of sight by the time she gets up however. You're sprinting so fast that you can feel the wind between every square inch of your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are shouts of anger and shouts of, what sounds like, rebellion. Maybe this town was in deep doo-doo before you got here anyway. If they hate the mayor then you completely agree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes about an hour to finally reach the outskirts of town. There are helicopters roaming the whole city. The outskirts are normal and don't have angry mobs. The authorities have completely forgot about the three humans that were running through the city. Three humans. You, the one with glasses, and the one with the overly-large jacket. You were able to find a small street that hid you from the animals, and you followed it. It is lightly sprinkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hits you that you've been sprinting for almost an hour, and you don't feel so well. You scan the area to find a lonely house. It's for sale. Your vision gets a bit blurry and the distant feeling of a headache roams around. You breath heavily and slow down to a light jog as you near the house. You go around the side and over to a backdoor. It's a nice-looking house with a backdoor. You walk up to the backdoor and your training kicks in. You pull out the very loose hairpin that, surprisingly, stuck to your hair. You bend it and shove it into the lock. You stop picking the lock to lean against the door for a moment; You <i>need</i> to lay down. You lazily fidget with the lock and it opens. You stumble in and close the door, remembering to take your hairpin out of the lock. You carefully investigate the empty house, and with checking the last room, you fall over and catch yourself on a doorknob. You close the door. You use your training once again to tear a strip of rugged carpet off the floor, and test its strength, then you use it to tie up the door and the window. There's no way anyone is gonna get in here. You walk over to a wall and slowly drag yourself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" You sigh. You put a hand on your head and massage your scalp, you've got a headache. It's raining now too. The sky is gray and slightly darker than normal. Shuffling in place, you notice that you might have pulled a couple of muscles trying to get out of harm's way. After a couple of minutes your eyes have shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">You wake up in your bed, yawning. The events that had occurred in your dream were simply ridiculous, and it felt like forever. You smile knowing that you used your training effectively. You silently thank your dad for helping. You stretch to see your soft pink pajamas on. You sit up in your bed and scoot over to look at the clock. It's a normal seven a.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice.\" You say, your voice sounds a little more optimistic than usual. You don't seem to focus on your room's details that much as you look over towards the window.<br>\r\nThere's a calming, simple light flooding the room. You feel ecstatic as you stand up. You notice something that you didn't feel before- you're wearing the same clothes as in your dream. You quickly check your hair and it's all messy, you gasp and look around the room, the same colors on the wall were there just as they had been before you went to sleep--! You glance back over to the window and you see that it's smaller, and tied up. There is a knock on the door and you spin to see it open.<br>\r\nYou see the angry face of Deluma, her uniform is dirty and her fur looks matted. Her tails enter from the door from different angles. You shriek and push your back against the wall, the bed was no longer there. Her figure seems to grow darker and her eyes start to glow red, her tails grow in size and cast long shadows across the room. You close your eyes and curl up in a ball as if you were five years old.</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp and jut forward, clutching your heart, that was a nightmare alright! You quickly calm down. It's light out and it's no longer raining. You slept for a long time. You roll over and push yourself off the ground. You feel sore, but the headache is gone! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the jingling of keys and the sound of a door opening, you realize you've outstayed your welcome. You quickly head over to the window and loosen the knots and ties with a single pull. You rush over to the door and repeat. You crumble the two equally long straps of carpet into your pockets and crouch. You slowly open the door and peer out. You don't see anything but the empty house. You do hear talking though. If it's for sale, these people would have to be salesmen. You look over to the door that you entered last night and slowly start creeping to it. You close the door behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My shoes are soaked, honey.\" A female voice whines. You get closer to the exit door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry, are your socks dry?\" A male voice replies with care. You notice a desk that was by the door, there are a couple of water bottles there, and a plate of cookies. Guess you didn't see it in your tired stupor. You've seen those things before when your family moved. You grab two water bottles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here are the stairs, custom built, there is an option for a private suite in this section of the house, it's this way.\" A quirkier female explains. You slide through the backdoor and close it. You carefully walk around the house and into the backstreet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a bit hungry, but you can handle it thanks to your training. It's a big city, and you don't know where you are or what you're doing. There were two other humans, maybe they were caught. Maybe they weren't... you for sure don't know what happened to the one with glasses, but you think that the one with the overly large jacket got away. He looked and sounded tough, and he didn't call for help when you accidentally forced him into a tight situation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</i></span></div></div>",

Even though the creature is huge, he can\u2019t handle two people. You\u2019re pulled out of the animal\u2019s arms and immediately start running. The officer tries to chase you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can speak!\u201d One officer exclaims to another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were talking about it on the radio-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large sound echoes through the tunnels, it\u2019s a train! You run to the side of the track, and jump up. You look back down to see that the man you rescued needs help again. You forget that you\u2019re more agile. You reach a hand down and pull him up <i>just</i> in time for the train to pass, hiding the both of you. Further ahead, the officer had scrambled up, relief spreading across his face as he is out of harm\u2019s way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exchange glances with the man. \u201cMy name is Kiba.\u201d he huffs. The both of you are out of breath, and it took you until now to realize this. \u201cYou?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerra.\u201d You reply, \u201cWe should start going, the train won\u2019t be here long.\u201d You finish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Terra.\u201d Kiba says. You nod. The two of you get up and start jogging down the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, you\u2019re both in near-complete darkness, and you\u2019re both sitting down, a couple feet inbetween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you know where we are?\u201d You ask Kiba. He looks at you with a slightly annoyed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I know? I have no idea.\u201d He replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, I thought you knew, your jacket makes you look like you\u2019re cool or something.\u201d You say. He chuckles then takes a moment to look at his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, where do <i>you</i> think we are?\u201d Kiba repeats your question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You answer. You shuffle in place and feel a slight bump in your pant leg. Suddenly you realize that you were getting ready to visit an out of state campground, because you had friends who worked there. It was a small, handheld LED flashlight. You reach into your right pocket with some effort and pull it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Kiba asks. You smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a flashlight.\u201d You say giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you have a flashlight in your pocket?\u201d He questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like being where I can\u2019t see, or places I don\u2019t know\u2026 and I was going to a campground back at\u2026\u201d You stop talking when you click on the small flashlight. It doesn\u2019t turn on. \u201cWhat?!\u201d You exclaim. You smack the back of the flashlight a couple times. \u201cI just bought this damn thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere batteries included?\u201d Kiba asks innocently. You glare at him and he looks the other way shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Your expression softens. Sighing, you put it back into your pocket. Nevermind that then. You doubt that the creatures around have the right batteries\u2026 or batteries at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what should we do?\u201d Kiba asks as he prepares to get up. You admit you have no idea. \u201cWell, we could try walking.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d You agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like forever until you hit a section of the tunnel where there\u2019s a split. Although, one of the ways is blocked by large, jagged rocks. The train tunnel you\u2019re in is shaped like any normal one you\u2019d find. However, it is large, so large it seems to fog when it gets cold\u2026 which it is now cold now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think happened here?\u201d Kiba asks. You shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it collapsed? Looks like that\u2019s what happened.\u201d You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they just haven\u2019t gotten around to fixing it then.\u201d Kiba says. \u201cWell I guess we\u2019re going left now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey, it\u2019s brighter down there!\u201d You exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy be happy about that? With what we know, that could just mean trouble.\u201d Kiba quickly retorts. You sigh and agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s probably late.\u201d You say. Kiba pulls out his phone. \u201cWha--! Yo--? You had that the whole time?!\u201d You whisper sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt We just escaped death, Terra.!\u201d Kiba replies sharply. You roll your eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s about 12:00.\u201d He announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 it felt like they were actually trying to capture us. Since we didn\u2019t harm anyone, unless you did,\u201d You look at him. He frowns and shakes his head no, \u201cGood, then they had no reason to shoot us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re innocent.\u201d Kiba says. It occurred to you that you were talking as if the creatures were human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are intelligent. I think. They had cars and stuff.\u201d You say. The both of you continue walking, the lights seem so far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it feels like I never left the city. Do you think they\u2019re just as advanced as we are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we in the future?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but how though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo we can\u2019t be in the future, everything is too relevant\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if the creatures are humans, and to them, <i>we</i> look like the creatures?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we were the creatures, why would they try to tackles us down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we <i>are</i> smaller than them\u2026 cops are also supposed to be brave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot all of them are, I know a couple that were distant relatives of mine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis conversation continues until the two of you stop talking. You\u2019re close to the train exit. It dawns on you suddenly that there could be nocturnal type creatures walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Walking</i>.\u201d You think to yourself. You tap KIba on the shoulder and you both stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s late, do you think there will be nocturnal creatures?\u201d You whisper. Kiba smacks his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah, you\u2019re right. What should we do?\u201d Kiba whispers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, wait, you stay here for a moment, I will go check.\u201d You say. The two of you are close to the train exit. You can see the colors of Kiba\u2019s jacket again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no that\u2019s too risky, I\u2019ll go.\u201d Kiba says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No why?\u201d You retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026. er, I uh, I should do it anyway.\u201d Kiba answers you shyly. You swear that you see a blush but you can\u2019t tell in this lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook I have training, Kiba.\u201d You whisper sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell- I\u2019m a boxer so-\u201d Kiba starts speaking. Out of the corner of your eye, you see the train exit, and a couple tails. You see that there are creatures lined up as if to get on a train. You don\u2019t hear anything other than Kiba\u2019s voice and distant talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut Kiba off. \u201cHey, look.\u201d Kiba stops talking and looks in the direction you\u2019re pointing. \u201cThey look like they\u2019re about to get on a train. Come on, let\u2019s get up on the side.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nods. \u201cAlright, yeah.\u201d He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you get up on the side, of course, you had to pull him up again, because he couldn\u2019t jump up there without help. A large sound goes off in the distance. It\u2019s the train. After a moment, it stops. The creatures that were lined up get onto the train. It then picks up its speed and flies by the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, the distant talking fades. There can\u2019t be any more than a couple creatures left in the subway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have an idea for what you can do. You alone will sneak around and try to find batteries and have Kiba wait for you. Your training will 100% keep you out of sight, and they won't hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerra, I have an idea.\u201d Kiba states with confidence.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Animals can smell you. Even if you got around unseen, your scent, <i>my</i> scent, could easily be tracked. They must know we're here, not because of smell, but because we had caused a scene at the other station. Wouldn't it make sense that, in not their police, their cameras to work?\" You stare at him with a mix of interest and disgruntlement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Their cameras work, but not all of them are dogs-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're <i>animals!</i> Not just dogs, <i>animals!</i> We have to make a distraction, which I wouldn't be opposed to doing.\" Kiba buts in harshly, finding difficulty in not raising his voice above a whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for batteries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Batteries? Batteries are your concern right now? I thought we were trying to find a way out of this place! We can get batteries when we're above the surface, Terra... Terra's your name right?\" He argues doggedly, you didn't know whether to feel stupid or thankful, but he was right. To the surface was the better option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... come on, what are we doing then, Kiba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba still had his overly large jacket, which would pass him off as a kid. It had worked previously until your sudden intervention. Frankly, without there being much notice to his apparel to the police, he could still pull it off without bystander attention. What Kiba was going to really do, you couldn't know. He left out a few details of his plan, you were apprehensive about the whole ordeal, the fear of him being caught or abandoning you was strong, but his logic was flawless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were to head back into the cave and wait for him to return with another jacket, or cover, or something, to pass you off as a younger creature as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark. Cold. You huddled against the cold stone, where the collapsed tunnel entrance was. It was your decision to wait <i>here.</i> Kiba had suggested you stay close, but he agreed that maybe it was safer, until he returned, that you stayed where both of you could meet. Though it was still distant to you, this small grouping of rocks felt better to stay with than those massive aliens, and also you could just crawl into a small space to conceal yourself from sight if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the silence of darkness and creeping of low temperatures were your friends. You wish that you were at camp, with your friends, with the familiar, warm smiles that you were expecting to face rather than wherever you are right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight crunches of gravel grab your attention. You peek over the rocks and look around, your eyes having been adjusted to the darkness already, though still it was hard to see. A tingling fear gripped at your chest, you wanted to call out for Kiba, to make sure that you were safe, but you had to be vigilant and silent, <i>he</i> was to come to <i>you</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still here?\" Kiba whispers loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You reply, he flinches, not expecting a response from his far right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the jacket,\" he says, holding out a blind hand, and a ridiculously oversized piece of clothing, \"come on, let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting on the jacket, which made you look like a dude, which didn't matter much, the two of you carefully made your way back and up into the subway entrance. The two of you made a smooth exit and had found your way to the surface. Now all you needed to do was either figure out where you were or figure out where you could get batteries, obviously the former first, but above else you and Kiba were in need of a place to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kiba stood together in a lone alleyway, both of you hidden in the shadows of the huge buildings, debating whether to split or walk together. No matter which, you both were to meet back here.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You skid around to your right, immediately heading to the tunnel. Looking behind you and in front of you, there are no trains coming at the moment. Your footsteps gain a large echo after about five seconds within the tunnel, and your breathing also echoes. You don't know where you're going, but you know you're going down a tunnel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, the cops are pushing past people to get to you. People are making shocked remarks and angry snaps at them, then they realize they're cops. Back ahead of you, the tunnel seems to stretch on and on. You're a good distance in the tunnel, running on the very thin slip of sidewalk there is. Your height gives you an advantage as you hear one of the cops trip and fall onto the tracks. You know this because you looked behind. You keep running since the cops are still in chase, and you start to get tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stop... yet.\" You mumble whilst running. You speed it up a bit to gain some distance, but suddenly it just goes completely dark. You stutter along the walker, trying to stay in your balance. You hear feedback and a click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human heading towards the eastern entrance, send backup, it's fast.\" The officer exclaims quickly into his mic. Your eyes are barely adjusted, but your ears work. The officer had sent a quick, simple relay that stroke a bit of hesitance and fear into your safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only hear your subtle, small footsteps now. You feel as the cold air surrounds your body and chills your arms and legs and face. You stop moving. You look back and forth and then unto the tracks themselves. Multiple pillars spread out to keep the heavy cement and stone that the city is on top of. You press your back against the wall and slowly drop down. Your legs touch the cold stone below and you jerk your leg up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cold...\" You whisper aloud. You fix your hair, and fix your messy clothes a bit. Girls like to keep up a certain standard, unlike guys, so you take about five minutes to fix your hair and tidy up. When you're done, you simply hold up the thin, plastic thing you barely call a comb. You think about what just happened. <i>Whew... I just, I think I--, I don't know where I am, do I? Ran away from some weird, tall creatures dressed in cop outfits and had fur on them.</i> Some had talons too, and claws... and teeth... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean your head back and close your eyes, curling up to keep warm in this very cold, foggy, dry tunnel. It was big enough to encompass a small fog. Must be raining above, but with the thick cement, you can't really tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour goes by, the cops must have been waiting for you to come out of one of the entrances, but then again, there could be more than what's ahead and behind, because tunnels usually split. You slowly open your eyes, not having slept, but have rested. You get up, and you realize that curling up on cement has made your tailbone a bit sore. Along with literally every other joint in your body. You continue forward, hoping to find a different way out. These train tracks seem to go on forever, but then again, the height of these inhabitants <i>also</i> seem to go on and on forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk for another twenty minutes when you hear the very, <i>very</i> subtle sound of footsteps. Heavy, dull, yet very quick footsteps. You can't tell where it's coming from, but you start running. The other footsteps suddenly get really loud, and they're fast. You gasp as you suddenly trip over a crack. You stumble a bit, but manage to grab onto a pipe, breaking your fall. You push yourself off of the pipe and run again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose the cops once again. But this time, you're hungry, and thirsty. Tired, and cold. You <i>need</i> to do something. The darkness persists, and it's hard to adjust. You slowly walk, the crack you tripped on hurt your leg, and thanks to adrenaline, you didn't feel it until now. You limp down the tunnel, even with your past experience to be able to deal with these situations, there is simply nothing you can do, nothing you can use, just- nothing. A tear forms down your eye. You close them for a moment to rub them... and you freak out when your foot hits doesn't hit the floor, but hits air. You swing your hand to try to find something to grab, but it ends up in you turning around for nothing, and you fall backwards. You wince as your back hits a hard slope, and you tumble down into a small opening. You brace your head and curl up-- at least, you try to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as you tumble. You can't even see anything. '<i>Help!</i>',you cry in your head. You roll down the dirty slope, hitting miscellaneous things on the way. Plants and small rocks start to fall too, and roll with you. You finally stop at the bottom of the slope. Dust flutters around you as you groan in anger. You slam your fist against the ground. \"Son of a...\" You mumble under your breath. You roll over and sit up. You put your hand against your head. You feel your legs and arms to make sure nothing is injured. Your back feels sore, but nothing was injured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to you that a small crack in the subway did more damage to your leg than what a tumble down a slope could do to <i>anything</i>. You chuckle a bit. You grunt as you stand up. It's so dark, you can't see anything even if your eyes adjusted. You look around. The silence rings in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly hear a ripple of water. You blindly look towards the water's general direction. You take a stance and slowly place one foot in front of the other, so you don't trip down another slope. You continue until your foot hits the ice-cold water in this dark place. From a subway, to a tunnel, to this... cave? Who cares. Cupping your hands, you grab water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While running, you see that the house has a tall, rickety fence and a large caution sign on it. There is a small fence gate with a lock attached to a metal chain that secures the door. You can't climb that! You take a quick glance behind you, there are three large wolf-looking anthros chasing you. <i>Wait, no, that one's a dog.</i> You look forward again, you're about 20 feet away from the house. There's a large rhino-looking anthro walking by the house, conveniently next to the smallest part of the fence. You realize you might have to use that anthro to hop the fence. You hesitate, but you're 5 feet from the rhino. He looks at you, eyes widening. You jump behind him, grabbing onto his shirt and pulling up. It boosts you <i>juuust</i> enough to hop over the fence. Sadly the rhino falls backwards thanks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"Sorry!\" You grunt, it took a lot of effort. The three officers end up crashing into the fence, they are not tall enough to get in either. They break through, falling on one another. Two of them yelp while one hits his his head on a mailbox, knocking em' out. You are now on the porch of this very, very old looking house. You glance back before going into the house, one officer is tending to the one still on the ground while the other is halfway across the yard. You enter the house. It's unlocked so you're able to get in. Closing the door, you jump to reach the lock and lock it. That gave you some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       You don't look downstairs and immediately run up the stairs. You open a couple windows at the top to make it look like you jumped out. The floors creak really loud, but there's nothing you can do about it right now, you have to find a place to hide! You hear banging on the door, must be the officer. There are four doors into different rooms. You're not a strategist... or a fighter.

You catch a glimpse of the room to your left-- a closet! Rushing in, you close the door behind you and jump into the closet, closing that as well. About four hours go by before you don't hear anyone in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       Opening the closet door, you see that the anthros have searched the room you were in. It's good that they didn't check in the closet. You sigh, relieved that you got away. Feeling your body, you notice that you feel sore after being in a standing position for a while. You stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"Yes!\" You whisper, pumping your right fist in triumph. You skip over to the window in the room, no cops, but there's still a very identifiable break in the fence. You chuckle. You sit on the bed in the room for a while, about ten minutes so you can leave. You think that staying here would not be the best idea so you get up. Passing through the doorway you hear how loud the house sounded when you took a step. <i>I see why the last tenants didn't want the house anymore.</i> Suddenly,  your foot gets caught in a broken plank. \"What the f- oh. Just a board.\" You gasp. Your heart skipped a beat for a moment. You yank your foot out of the broken floorboard. You hear a loud creek-- and then it goes silent. Hesitantly, you take another step. The floor completely breaks from under you! You scream and fall backwards, landing on the bottom floor. You lay on a large pile of wood that was once the floor above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"Aughh-- that... sucked.\" You groan. Large clouds of dust flutter around the bottom floor. You open your eyes to see one last piece of wood falling, straight on your head. It knocks you out.</span></div></div>",

Rain also meant that he would sleep well when night fell and hear the splashing footsteps of his pursuers. It had been three years since he'd arrived here. He was a sixteen year old high school student who's biggest problem was the beating the rival school's sprinter. Now, he was a nineteen year old survivor. He spent his days moving from alley to alley avoiding police and other 'stray humans' as anthros called them. When he initially arrived he was scared and confused, he sought help. He found it in the form of a German Shepherd police officer. The officer dropped him off at a shelter for humans where they were taken care of until they were adopted by an anthro family. The shelters weren't that bad, and for the most part, humans were well taken care of. It was like staying in a hotel. Of course humans weren't allowed to leave and there was a curfew that basically locked humans in their rooms at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, the status of humans AFTER they were adopted that was the problem. They were either adopted and treated very well or adopted and treated horribly. Either way, the best that a human could hope for was to be adopted as a pet, and there was only a fifty-fifty chance of that happening. The idea of someone's pet or slave didn't appeal to Tom. So the first opportunity he got, he left the shelter and never looked back. He'd been living on the streets ever since. He adapted quickly, learning to stay ahead of police and detectives and to avoid fellow humans who had turned to raiding people like him. Trust no one, speak only when necessary and keep moving... those were the rules he made for himself and those were the rules he followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The police treated stray humans like escaped convicts. Capturing them was a priority, but if a citizen caught a stray, they were within their rights to keep it. Tom had his fair share of close calls with both, and tongight would be no different, or at least... he hoped it wouldn't. Unfortunately for him he held the record for the longest free roaming stray. Most strays only went for a few months before they're caught, but Tom had been a stray now for over two years. Various police officers and detectives had turned finding a catching him into a competition, and he was the prize...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were the only two things that he had left of his old life. The cap had the 1990's Disney channel emblem stitched on the front of it, while the cloak resembled a lightweight rain poncho, though it was made of fabric instead of plastic. It was a gift from his father who'd bought it for him after he one day complained about being cold at the start of a track meet at school. He didn't want to wear sweats as he'd eventually shed them after he started to warm up, so his father bought him a cloak. He then shouldered his shoulder bag and walked over to a nearby window where he slipped out and quietly scaled the drain pipes to get to the roof of the abandoned building he was staying in. He quietly walked along until he came to an old air conditioning unit that sat at the edge of the building and watched as the rain fell onto the city from a cloudy grey sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It brought him peace, he found something soothing about the gray sky and the constant tapping of the rain against the stone rooftop of the building and the concrete streets. Even before he was brought to this place, he loved to run in the rain, there was just something about having his hair matted down and water running down his face as he splashed though puddles along old dirt running trails and sidewalks. As he reminisced and remembered, his mental oasis was shattered by the sound of a tactical boot stepping in a nearby puddle. Tom's eyes snapped open as he leapt off of his perch and dropped off of the side of the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The German Shepherd that had been closing on him ran to the edge of the roof and looked down expecting to find a lifeless body lying limp on the street below. But he instead found tom dashing down a fire escape. \"All units, target is headed down to the street on the North side of the building!\" He called through his radio as he climbed over the ledge to give chase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom's shoes touched down on the sidewalk walk with a wet 'splat' after leaping over the last flight of stairs. He looked to his left to find a very familiar Doberman running towards him with a very smug grin on his face, \"Terran...\" Tom muttered to himself, his face full of distaste as he spat the name before running in the opposite direction. It wasn't long before the street behind him was filled with officers trying to run him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doberman continued to give chase with his squad of officers, \"This time! This time, we have him!\" He told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A squad car pulled itself directly into Tom's path blocking the street from him. Tom however, sprinted even harder before throwing himself across the hood of the car and resuming his sprint.</span></div></div>",

A cigarette poked out of of the front of her lips and black hair framed her face as she gave the human a cool and even stare. \"You don't belong here hun,\" She stated, \"It'd bother my conscience if somethin' were to happen to ya in here, now get outta here before someone worse than me finds ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Too late for that,\" Tom replied with a dark sullen tone as he looked towards the back hallway he had come in through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fox turned to follow his gaze and caught a glimpse of the first German Shepherd that had followed the human into the bar before she grabbed Tom by the front of his shirt and cloak and pulled him over and behind the bar.

He unscrewed the bolts holding the vent grate in the ceiling, he then opened his bag and rummaged around in it until he found a pocket knife. He put an ear to one of the walls of his room and after determining that nobody else was on said room, he began carving a hole in the wall with some effort. He stepped back to admire his work when he finished. He could clearly see into the next room, and with a bit of effort, even cross into it. After that was done Tom went out onto the balcony, he found that while he had access to the street, being so high would make it a difficult escape tonight as he was three stories up. Thankfully though, Tom had a rope in his bag for just such an emergency. He took the rope out and went to the neighboring room where he laid it on the balcony, he then tied one end to the railing and left the rest where it lay. With his prep work done, the human flopped down on the bed and closed his eyes keeping his bag close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Two hours after Tom had dozed off, a leopard followed by two mice entered the lobby of the motel. All were dressed in navy blue tactical suits and all were armed with an array of both lethal and nonlethal weapons adorning their belts. An assortment of tools also joined the weapons around their waist lines. The raccoon, who'd been reading his paper, set his news article aside as the group approached his desk. \"Where is he?\" The leopard asked in a cool and collected tone. His green eyes seemed to glow under the 'police' baseball cap he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Room 302 on the third floor. He looked tired so he's probably resting...\" The raccoon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The leopard nodded, \"I see, well let's go have a look then.\" With that, he and the two mice climbed the stairs to the third floor. The trio of anthros quietly moved down the hallway steadily approaching room 302. Their advance was brought to an abrupt halt when the leopard raised his paw in a closed fist signalling the other two to stop. \"Remember,\" he warned, \"We want him to come with us quietly and peacefully. The last thing we want is Terran getting wind of this and scrambling a squad our way. If you you can't talk him down, bring him down as quickly, gently and quietly as possible.\" Each mouse gave a single nod showing they understood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom's sleep was interrupted by a firm knock at the door. He growled as he turned over and rolled out of bed, \"Housekeeping!\" A feminine voice called from the other side if the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom froze, <i>\"I just got here, there's no freaking way that housekeeping service in a motel is that fast,\"</i> Tom slung his bag over his shoulder and went out onto the balcony. He gave the rope a test tug before swinginging his leg over the railing and sliding down the rope to the street below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Outside of room 302, the mouse that had knocked on the door waited patiently for a reply, but none came. She turned to the leapord who dipped his head in a single nod prompting her to kick the door down. Expecting to find a surprised human, the anthros were shocked to find an empty room. A hole remained in the wall where Tom had cut his way into the other room, the ceiling grate hung open swaying slightly under the breeze of the A/C, and the sliding door to toe balcony sat completely open. \"How'd he know we were coming?\" The female mouse asked as she surveyed the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And which way did he go?\" The other mouse asked as he shined a flashlight into the open A/C duct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He played us!\" The leopard muttered before reaching up and touching a button on his earpiece, \"Sierra, he slipped away from us, have you got anything on your end?\"</span></div></div>",

She too wore the police uniform that her counterparts were in, though she had less equipment as her role was fairly obvious. Her golden eyes keenly focused on Tom, who was on high alert but proceeding at walking pace through the crowds of anthros and the occasional stray or pet human. \"I have a visual on the target, should I maintain surveillance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The leopard shook his head, \"Negative, pursue and detain the target. We can't risk the local police getting a hold of him before we do. Expect heavy resistance, but be gentle on him, we'll follow you're signal and catch up to you as soon as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Understood,\" The cheetah replied as she stood from her crouching position and stared down at the human who had become her prey. \"Alright mister 'Shadow Ghost,' let's see what you've got.\" The Cheetah bounded down the building landing almost weightlessly on the ground, startling a few bystanders before she darted down the side walk in a light spring, to her at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom silently walked down the street. He kept the bill of his cap tilted down to hide his face from oncoming pedestrians. Making eye contact provoked curiosity, and curiosity led to investigation which in turn led to pursuit.  Something Tom was less than fond of. Tom glanced behind him to make sure he wasn't being followed. To his surprise, he found a police cheetah closing in on him. <i>\"Probably responding to a call...\"</i> he thought as he turned and continued walking. After a few seconds he looked again, she was much closer this time, her eyes zeroed in on him. \"Or maybe she's coming after me!\" Tom muttered as he began sprinting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stop human!\" Sierra called as she continued to close the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh yeah, no doubt about it,\" Tom muttered sarcastically to himself, \"She's coming for me.\" Tom ducked into the local mall which happened to be nearby. Several gasps and murmurs greeted him as various anthros stared at him. He didn't stop to entertain them, but moved swiftly to the escalators instead. He froze as he rode it to the top with a string of mall shoppers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the time Tom had reached the halfway point to the second floor, Seirra had burst in to the mall. She glanced ins the ground level, searching for any sign of her target. \"Kid gets around pretty quick,\" She quietly admitted to herself.</span></div></div>",

He knew that if he could blend in with the crowd then he'd be home free. As he reached the top of the escalator Tom glanced back down at the entrance to check on the cheetahs progress. At the moment he turned, so did she. Both of their eyes met. Timed seemed to abruptly slow as they stared at each other, Seirra's eyes widened as realization dawned on her. Tom's pupils shrank as that very same realization flooded his mind and just as abruptly, time began its normal flow again when Seirra dashed toward the base of the escalator and shattered the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By now Tom had reached the top of the escalator and was making his way to the nearest exit as fast as he could. He glanced over his shoulder to find Seirra leaping over a sheep woman at the top of the escalator and making a beeline straight for him. The human pushed himself to go even faster, but he was already at his limit and it was nowhere near fast enough to keep him ahead of the cheetah. Tom made a sharp right turn and found the doors that led out to the parking garage. He heard the sound of claws scrapin g the tile behind him and knew that his pursuer was close. Tom ran full force into the door with his shoulder, not even bothering to stop and open it. In that very instant he felt an explosion of force hit him from behind. He felt a large hand latch onto his left arm and another arm entirely, wrap itself around his torso. He and Seirra tumbled across the concrete ground in a tangle, the initial advantage Seirra had deteriorated as the rolling and bouncing from the initial collision had broken her hold on the boy. She grasped at him while he struggled to maintain his momentum in an effort to break away in a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually the pair came to a stop in a struggling heap. Seirra had again managed to maintain the high ground as she held Tom face down on the the cold and damp ground with his left arm pinned behind his back and his right arm held firmly in Seirra's paw pointing straight into the air. Tom knew there was only one viable solution to break free and that the odds of it working were almost as ridiculous as actually trying it in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seirra looked up into space for a moment before speaking, \"I have the target secured, I had to be a little less than gentle with him.... regrettably... but he seems alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good work Seirra, we'll be there in thirty seconds, just sit tight,\" The leopard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sierra nodded before turning her attention back to Tom, \"Sorry about the rough treatment, but you weren't exactly leaving me with a lot of options. I'd let you up if I could be sure that you wouldn't run....\"</span></div></div>",

Tom looked up to find the leopard and two mice from before. He wanted to fight, run anything to get away... \"This cannot be happening...\" He muttered quietly. The cheeta; Seirra, couldn't help but feel a pang of regret over his grief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well done Seirra,\" The leopard said with an approving nod. The mice ran over and each grabbed one of Tom's arms and waited for Seirra to release him and move away before hoisting him to his feet. Tom met eyes with the leopard, his deep green eyes emitting a sense of duty but also a sense of tranquility. \"You've been on the run for quiet sometime now haven't you?\" The leopard asked, \"It couldn't have been easy to survive on you're own for so long while avoiding us. I'd like to commend you for that.\" It seemed like he wanted to say more but a look of annoyance crossed his face as his ears flicked up detecting something that clearly bothered him, \"Terran...\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eight German shepherd police officers came running through the parking lot to surround you and the officers holding you. After they were all in place Tom found that Terran was the officer in command as he marched into the circle of officers surrounding him. \"I hate mondays,\" Tom growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terrain clapped his hands as he stepped forward to inspect Sierra's catch. \"Well done, well done indeed.

How many trespassing violations he's racked up? He's lucky we're being so gentle with him. I should be locking him up with the other criminals, but I guess a holding cell will have to do until we figure out what to do with him. Alright, let's pack him up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terran's officers started to move in on Tom. Unsettled by Terrans words, Tom began to struggle and growl like a caged animal at the officers that approached, slightly surprising the mice that held him. \"Belay that order,\" The leopard called, everyone in the vicinity froze, even Tom. \"Thank you for you're assistance Seargant, but we'll deal with the boy ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This boy has been a thorn in my paw for the past two years, I will deal with him as I see fit,\" Terran argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The leopard shook his head, \"I'm afraid not, we may be under your jurisdiction. But you are still under the law.

His thoughts were interrupted when he felt a gentle but firm nudge. He looked over his shoulder to find Mr. Kivaul waiting for him to enter the house. The leopard gave an amused smile, knowing that the human was debating on whether he should attempt escape or play along with the arrangements that had been made for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom growled initially, but then relaxed himself and sighed, <i>\"They're not leaving me with any options here but to go along with the ones they've set in place... can't say I blame 'em though.

As Tom walked into the entryway he heard the door behind him shut and lock.The home was a relatively large two story house with stairs that led up to the second floor. The floor Tom currently stood on felt like a soft, spongy material. He thought it was odd but it wasn't the most pressing matter on his mind at the moment. No, that would've been the large anthro panther that came out of the kitchen which was located at the back of the house, opposite of the entryway that he was currently standing in. While Seirra was only a head taller than Tom, the panther and leopard were easily two heads taller and much broader. She was dressed in denim jeans and a light blue t-shirt and predictably had black hair which was draped over her shoulders, however, a fair amount of it ran down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Glad you made it home safe dear!\" She exclaimed in a very motherly tone.

Both of which had just zeroed in on him. \"Oh my!\" She exclaimed, \"Who might you be?\" Tom's face scrunched up in confusion as he looked to the leopard behind him, assuming that he was the on being addressed, as unlikely as it seemed. He could tell by Mr. Kivaul's expression that he was having a hard time containing his laughter. Tom then felt a paw gently turn his face back to its owner, \"No sweetheart, not him. I was talking to you.\" Tom was stunned, in all the time that he'd spent in this world, he'd never heard of an anthros acknowledging a human as an actual person.</span></div></div>",

With you being as quick as you are and Terran making life harder for everyone... Still, Raylene is right, as she always is. If we're going to get you to trust us, we have to build a mutual trust, something we can't do if you don't even know our names.\" He then pauses and gestures to himself \"My name is Matthias Kivaul, I run a team as part of a special unit designed to deal with incidents that the normal police would be ill suited for. There's very little that surprises me anymore, but you certainly managed to turn quite a few heads, including mine and Terran's. He's been talking about making you his personal servant for some time now. We were worried about what might happen to you if he were to get his hands on you behind closed doors. Fortunately, you being so resilient and hard to catch allowed me to convince the mayor to put us on this assignment since the normal police were so 'ill suited' for catching you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So... you came after me... to protect me?\" Tom asked. He found the statement something of an oddity coming from his own mouth, given that he'd covinced himself nobody was on his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Exactly!\" Seirra interjected. \"I guess now's as good a time as any to introduce myself,\" She sighed. Though it wasnt a labored sigh, it was more of a relaxed sigh. \"As you've probably already heard, I'm Seirra. I work on my dad's squad. Usually I hang back and let them do their thing and if they need me somewhere in a hurry or a target slips away from them, I get involved.\" She smiles at you in a friendly manner, \"Of course, you've seen that process firsthand havent you? I gotta say, youre pretty fast for a human, tough too. It's not hard to see how youve gotten as far as you did on without help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You have to be when you're on you're own or you won't survive...\" Tom stated in a matter of fact tone. He wasnt angry or sad, it was just a fact of life for him. Seirra however, found her heart breaking for the human as what he'd discribed was essentially a life of solitude in an arena where it was either sink or swim with no second chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But... that's so lonely...\" Seirra murmured quietly. Her parents seemed to pick up on something that Tom would never admit. He was tired of being alone. But he'd been alone for so long it was possible that while he was aware that he felt some sort of void, he didn't know what the cause of said void  was. Raylene and Matthias looked at each other making a silent vow that they'd restore the hardened survivor before them to the happy person that he was once before.</span></div></div>",

Hesighed and stretched before rolling onto his side. He jumped a little when his eyes met with a pair green eyes. Tom blinked, \"Um, hi?\" Near the beside stood a small red panda anthro.

He put the key into the lock and door to his room. He then turned and locked himself inside. He quickly surveyed the room, his eyes settled on the window. Opening the small sliding plate of glass he found that it led out into a small alley behind the motel. The window itself would be a tight squeeze, but if he sent his bag out ahead of himself he figured he'd fit. Just as he was slipping his backpack off of his back he heard a loud banging on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello?

And outside, the officers could hear his struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's in there!

Tom was nearly out of the window when he heard the door collapse and fall to the floor with a wooden 'clack'. He was about out and pulling his legs through when he heard several footsteps entering the room, \"The window!\" A male voice shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Grab him!

The face of a cheetah appeared in the window, staring at the boy with a mixture of frustration and pity. Tom then turned and left dashing down the street, knowing that he had a head start as they'd have to go back out and around the building to continue the chase. But he also knew, with a cheetah on the team, his head start wouldn't mean much if he was within visual range. He also was acutely aware that his lead would diminish relatively quickly considering that the average canine or feline anthro could run about two and a half times faster the average human.

They'd yet to notice him as they were talking to an anthro lioness who seemed distressed. \"I'll look at that as the glass half full...\" Tom muttered as he skidded to a stop and darted down a side street. As he ran through the few pedestrians going about their business, he caught something odd. There were was a bloodhound anthro and a large rat anthro. Both were walking towards a gray van. The odd thing about it was that one of them was carrying a small bear child, and the other was dragging a much older lioness towards the van who was violently struggling to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let me go!\" She cried.

Crap, now I've got a moral delima. On one hand if I stop and help I could very well get caught or killed... And if I don't then I'll have to live with the guilt...\"</i> Releasing a long and frustrated sigh Tom looked at the empty street to freedom, \"The smart thing to do would be to say 'not my problem' and leave.... But the right thing to do would be to try and stop them...\" He muttered as he turned his head to meet the teary eyes of the young lioness as she was dragged away to meet her fate.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I catch him off guard and get that kid loose, he'll have a harder time trying to subdue me plus a lioness teenager rather than me having to protect and carry the other kid,</i> The human reasoned. As he charged along, Tom realized that he was going to be at a disadvantage right from the beginning given that both kidnappers were anthros with claws and fangs, not to mention one of them had two feet of height on him. <i>\"I need to a better hand... or I'm gonna end up betting my life and losing!</i> As Ray got closer he noticed a metal pipe laying in the middle of the street next to a fist sized chunk of brick. <i>\"An ace and a king, just the kind of cards I was hoping for...</i> Snatching up the chunck of brick in his right hand and the pipe in his left, Tom was now right on top of the Rat. With a grunt of effort he threw the brick at the rat, hitting him squarely in the back of his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The large rodent turned and glared down at the lion girl, \"You little brat, throwing things at me now are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I am!\" Tom shouted, prompting the rat to look up just in time for the metal pipe to strike his snout. A metalic ring and sickening crunch could be heard as the rat howled in agony and fell backwards. But Ray kept running, headed right for the blood hound. Taking the pipe once more and striking the canine's knee and following up with a swift blow to his lower back. The bloodhound yelped and fell to his knees, dropping the small bear boy in the process. Tom tossed the pipe aside to catch the child in his arms, he seemed to be around the age of four. Tom then doubled back with the bear cub and ran past the rat, grabbing the lioness by the wrist in the process, \"Come on!\" He shouted as he pulled her down the street. At a foot or so shorter than Tom, The lioness had a hard time keeping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ngh, Please...

They'll definitely catch us before we get to the police... Time for plan B.\" Tom muttered. He then made a sharp turn towards a rundown building with a sign on the side that read 'condemened'. Once they were inside Tom climbed the stairs to the second floor. He froze for a moment, scanning the area and searching for a hiding spot. There was old and rotting wood everywhere. The floorboards were beginning to curl and break while most of the wall paper had begun to peel and other sections of wall were missing all together. <i>\"Ugh, no wonder the place was condemned. Better find a pace for these two to hide...</i> He then settled on a nearby bedroom and dragged the lioness into the room. \"Here... take him and stay in here,\" Tom ordered as he handed the boy to the lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you going to do?\" The girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom smiled deviously, \"Throw a house party.\" With that, Tom crept out of the room and back toward the stairwell. He peeked over the side of the railing to find the two criminals cautiously entering. After some thought, Tom stood and ran into the open. He then froze and looked down at the pair feighning a look of shock on his face. He then ran back the way he came and waited for the two to come up. As he expected, they took the bait, and just as the rat reached the top of the stairs, Tom lunged at him and firmly pushed him. The rat lost his balance and with a yelp, fell back down the stairs, bouncing as he went until he painfully struck the bottom where he groaned and lay motionless. However, the bloodhound had made it up the stairs and was now directly in front of Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You've caused us a lot of trouble human,\" The dog growled as he swiped at Tom with his claws and missed by inches as Tom threw himself backwards. Tom rolled off of his back and onto his hands and knees to recieve a swift kick to the gut from the bloodhound. The human tumbled across the floor resisting the urge to throw up. His attacker came at him once again, but this time Tom was able to counter as he leapt up into the air and grabbed a rafter beam to hang in mid air above the punch that the dog threw and deliver a kick to the side of his snout from his suspended position. The large canine staggered backwards until the ground gave out beneath one of his feet, causing his paw to fall through and become stuck. Tom sighed in relief as he watched the kidnapper struggle and writhe to get loose with no success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tom gets over to the two people he rescued. It was then that he found another reason that this was a bad house, there was a ton of mold on the walls that he didn't notice before. He snarls in disgust. Knowing he has been living on the streets, even <i>he</i> wouldn't let a house get <i>that</i> dirty. Looking over to the lioness girl, he realizes that she got her leg stuck in the floor, almost quite like the hound did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up at Tom. \"Sorry.\" She says apologetically. <i>That's annoying</i>, Tom thought to himself. Tom walks over to her and starts to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crackling sound could be heard, and a tumble of wood. \"Search the house.\" A muffled voice commands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit-!\" Tom exclaims under his breath. \"Sorry!\" Tom exclaims to the girl. He lets her go and rushes to a nearby window. It is broken and there are miscellaneous shards of glass scattered around, and even <i>in</i> the floorboards. Tom shakes his head and pushes himself to climb through the window, regardless of it being two stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a leg here- he might be above!\" Someone exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an unconscious anthro down at the bottom of the stairs.\" Another voice relays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yep- cops!</i> Tom says in his head. He's been in situations before where he's had to jump through windows, this time was no different, however, looking down Tom notices that there were anthros waiting for him! <i>Oh no, they knew I would do this!</i> Tom realizes. He's used his trump card too many times. Tom looks around once more to find a ladder for an apartment building <i>just</i> across from his standing. Tom jumps, he can make this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out!\" The teenager exclaims. The hound from before tosses himself towards the window and catches Tom by the legs. Tom was able to grab the rungs of the ladder but now he had a dog trying to kill him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Let go of me!\" Tom yells surprisedly. This catches the attention of the anthros below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting it this time!\" The hound barks. Tom kicks at the hound's face, which only makes it angrier. The hound digs his claws into Tom's legs. Tom gasps and suddenly he gains a burst of rage. Tom swings his legs in an attempt to get the hound loose. It works. Tom scampers up the ladder and looks back to see the hound being apprehended by anthros with guns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom climbs up the ladder and gets to the top of the roof. This was something he hadn't done in months, run on the rooftops. Tom prepares to run, and gets ready to jump to the next building. Tom kicks off and jumps to the next roof. He stumbles in the landing and continues. He lands on the second roof but- his legs buckled beneath him as he lands. Tom grunts in pain as he tumbles violently across the landing. He can't continue. The wounds he sustained recently begin to kick in as the adrenaline wears off. At least they can't catch him now, if they suspected him to jump out the window, they can't be able to expect Tom to jump over roofs to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm good, I'm good...</i>\" Tom whispers to himself. He lay down on the bright concrete, leaning his head against the ledge of the building. Tom notices a red stain on his pant legs. Blood. He winces. \"<i>Great.</i>\" Tom moans. After a couple of minutes, Tom simply decides to sleep, because there's not much he is able to do.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for him, it was in the wrong direction. The floor splintered around his paw before shattering into a hole big enough to consume his entire leg. Now down to his hands and knee, the large dog found himself in an awkward position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom smiled at his luck as he returned to the bedroom to retrieve the children. His plan was to have them walk out to the police, while he watched from a safe distance. He'd leave once he was sure they were going to be alright. However, that idea quickly went out the window when he found the teenage cat had somehow ended up with her foot caught in the floor as well. Tom stared in disbelief as she gave him an abashed and guilty expression. She had managed to hold on to the bear cub though at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I'm sorry..\" She whimpered,  \"I got nervous when I heard the fighting a-and wasn't watching where I was stepping and I-I guess I stepped in a hole that I didn't see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom inwardly sighed in annoyance, He took the bear cub from her and moved him into his left arm while extending a hand to pull her out of the hole. The lioness reached up and firmly grasped Tom's hand prompting him to pull her out using both his weight in conjunction with his arm strength. She yelped as she stumbled out of the hole and onto the floor with a thud. \"I... don't think I can walk. I may have sprained my ankle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom's eyes bulged as thought they were going to pop, \"Of course you did,\" He groaned. \"Alright...\" He sighed. He turned to the bear cub and then back to the lioness. <i>\"How do I carry them both?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few moments later, Tom walked out of the condemned building carrying the lioness on his back piggyback style while carrying the bear bridal style. Since the lioness could still move her legs and was the heavier of the two, Tom opted to put her on his back having her use her arms and legs to keep a hold of her human mount, leaving both of Tom's hands free to carry the bear. It was a long and tiring walk, but after a few moments, the trio emerged from the side street. After a moment of hesitation, Tom reluctantly walked towards what were now two otter police, a bear officer and a wolf officer with a police van and of course the lioness mother, who was crying uncontrollably. As Tom soldiered on toward what he was sure would be the end of his free life, the lioness on his back cried out for her mother. The older lion's ears twitched before she slowly looked up at her daughter who was being carried by a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sonya?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The teenager called out once more, \"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sonya!\" The larger lioness leapt up and rushed toward Tom at unreal speed. So fast in fact that Tom paused out of surprise before he found the younger lion squirming to get off of his back. Carefully he allowed her to slide off as he knelt to the ground. The police; seeing the sudden commotion hurried over to investigate. As the two lions embraced one another the otter and bear police came over to you while the wolf officer approached the lions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Isn't that the other missing child?\" One of the otters asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It is,\" The other replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll take care of him,\" The bear interjected. \"I'm close friends with his family,\" He explained as he reached down for the innocent and rather clueless bear cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The officers then began moving back over to the wolf and the lions. Tom listened breifly as the began comparing notes and sorting facts. As they did this, he decided it would be a good time for him to dissappear. Quitely and slowly, he backed away from the group of police and turned to blend in with the rest of the population, but not before he was out of earshot of the last peice of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How did you get away?\" The bear asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We didn't, not on our own,\" The younger feline replied, \"That human over- Wait, where'd he go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of the officers turned to find Tom was gone. Tom turned his head ever so slightly as he walked away to make sure that he wasn't being pursued. As he did this however, he nearly walked right into the unit that had been chasing him beforehand. The bold letters 'SCS' were printed on their vests as the moved from the opposite end of the street towards him clearing the crowd before them as they searched. The team consisted of the cheetah he saw before along with a rabbit, jackal and german sheppard. At this point Tom was more annoyed than anything else. Before he could make a move, he was tackled from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You screwed up our score big time human, now you're going to pay for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom recognized the voice as belonging to the rat from berfore. The foul rodent turned Tom to face him as he rung the human's neck. Tom began to twitch and thrash before realizing that the rat's groin was above his right leg. With a grunt of effort, Tom smashed his right shin into the rat's unmentionables. The rodent's beady eyes widened before he staggered backwards and dropped his victim. Tom on the other hand hacked and coughed for a moment before catching his breath. The rabbit officer tackled the rat without hesitation while the german shepard approached with handcuffs to assist his teamate. Tom, having caught his breath was now staggering to his feet in an attempt to evade capture. However the cheetah was faster as she collided with him from behind. Tom reacted quicker than she expected though and was able to keep her hands from wrapping around him. Both anthro and human were broken apart by the impact of the ground, the cheetah having rolled a good deal further than her prey. Tom leapt to his feet brushing the pain aside before trying to make his escape only to be pounced on by the jackal. He dodged her initial ambush, and while she prepared for a second the wolf officer pounced at him. Tom dropped to the ground to evade her, causing the wolf to overshoot her target. However, the jackal jumped on him before he could run again. The wolf also returned to make certain that Tom didn't get away again. The jackal rose to her feet while the wolf kneeled beside you and held you on the ground to ensure the boy couldn't scramble away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not so fast hero,\" The wolf chided with a gentle smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom scoffed, \"So this is what I get for playing the 'good guy'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf chuckled as her sharp hearing picked up the boy's slight outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom's attention was suddenly drawn to the pair of spotted paws on the pavement before him. He craned his neck up to find the cheetah smiling down on him, \"Nice to finally meet you, though I wish it didn't have to be this way. Why don't we all have a little chat, hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that the adrenaline was wearing off all the injuries he'd sustained throughout the day were now asserting themselves with a vengeance. The lioness or rather, Sonya, jumped upon hearing your strained outburst. She looked at Tom curiously, \"A-are you hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom shook his head, \"Its nothing, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sonya was unconvinced, and opted to lift his shirt. Considering that his hands were chained to the lamp post and that he'd spent almost all of his energy combined with how much pain he was in, there really wasn't much he could do to stop her. Sonya gasped when she saw his battered and bruised body drawing the attention of the officers and her mother who had been conversing with them. They turned to find several scrapes and bruises littering the human's upper body. Some fresh and others seemed to be a few days old others even older than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He needs medical treatment, now.\" The wolf stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My office is nearby,\" The older feline suggested, \"I'm a doctor, I was on my way there before... well, you know.

He looked down to find himself under covers on a medical examination bed. Though, to be fair, it was comfortable. Tom sat up and instantly felt a wave of moderate pain ripple through his abdomen.

He could also feel more bandaged wounds on his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see your awake and alert,\" A strong masculine voice noted. Tom looked up to find a formidable looking anthro lion walking into the room in a white lab coat. \"I must say, you're the toughest human I've ever seen. You must have gone months without getting any medical attention with the exception of your own field medicine. There are even a few anthros that wouldn't have lasted as long as you did under your circumstances.\" Tom remained silent as he watched the lion wearily, unsure of his intentions, \"Still though, we all have our limits... and you're no exception to the rule. We'll keep you here for observation for now, it's the least we can do for what you did for our daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"So he's the girl's father...\"</i> Tom thought as he watched the lion approach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It truly was a rather intimidating sight.

Tom sat quietly contemplating his situation, he thought about how he could escape. It wasn't an ideal time for him to be doing anything too risky with his wounds, but the only other option was to stay and see how the situation played out. Waiting to run until the last possible minute seemed to be the best move. Tom's planning was interrupted when he heard a knock at the door.</span></div></div>",

I've been running for two years, nobody has offered to help me and everybody wants to snatch me up to use me for whatever whim of theirs I might suit. The police want me as a trophy!

But the lioness was stronger and he wasn't in any shape to put up a real fight and quickly realized that this was the first display of compassion that he'd been shown in over two years. He stopped fighting as his eyes widened and his mouth hung agape. The lioness began gently stroking the back of his head as she tried to soothe him. \"Shh, I'm here. It's alright now, nobody's putting you up for adoption.\" Tom's lower lip began to quiver as his brow furrowed before he burst into tears and hugged the lioness tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been trying to get his hands on him for quite some time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a sort of life goal for him, a lot of the other units are also anxious to \u00e2\u0080\u0098meet\u00e2\u0080\u0099 him.

They walk like humans, have five fingers and five toes (You know this because a few of them aren't wearing shoes). But at the same they have fur all over their bodies according to the animal they are and the thing that worried you the most were the claws that some of them were carrying. After making all of these observations you then make another disturbing discovery... none of them are moving because they're all looking at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          You hear a lot of mixed questions from the crowd, the most common of which were 'a human?' and 'where'd it come from?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          You were worried to say the least but unsure of what to do. Eventually, a female wolf in a police uniform came through the crowd followed by several other officers you assume as they all had 'POLICE' in bold print on all of their vests and uniforms. The wolf, who seemed to be the one in charge, approached you slowly. She looked at you up and down in astonishment. It was at this point that you realized that she actually stood somewhere around ten or eleven feet tall while most of the creatures were only about eight or nine feet tall.

The title being pretty self explanatory didn't really leave any room for speculation as to what they were going to do next. However, the question still loomed; what did they want to know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anyone who's ever been interrogated or knows anything about interrogation knows that there are several options for either side to use. There are also several different rules that all depend on who you're dealing with. If you're <i>being</i> interrogated by thugs or criminals, you're only useful as long as you know what they want to know. As long as your useful though, they can't really afford to do away with you, though that won't stop them from trying to beat the answers out of you. It's never any fun to be tortured but the longer you can endure it, the longer you live. If they find out that you don't know anything or that you've given all the information you have, you can expect to find yourself in a shallow grave. The rules are a similar with police, though the stakes aren't as high. Police have rules they have to follow. They can make you uncomfortable, they can threaten you, they can feed you false information to make you second guess yourself... but they can't kill you or beat you with a plank of wood until they break it. If you play you're cards right and feed them bits of useful information for deals or favors that benefit you, you can take a little information and go a long way. Of course if they find out you're lying or you don't have any information to give, you can expect to find yourself in a prison cell pretty quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba lurched upright in his chair as the door swung open and a bloodhound walked in along with a husky. Both were in police uniforms, the husky was female and the bloodhound was male. The bloodhound dropped a few files on the desk before dropping into his seat while the husky took her seat with much more poise and etiquette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll get right to the point,\" The bloodhound stated, \"You are an unregistered human. You look like you're... what? nineteen? Twenty one? Twenty two maybe?\" He shrugged. Kiba's expression shifted from neutral to annoyed as he realized that dealing with the bloodhound was going to be less than pleasant. \"Honestly who cares? All we know is your older than a ten year old and there's no record of your existence and we want to know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba sat back in his chair and forced a calm and neutral expression onto his face, \"And why should I tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because,\" The husky interjected, \"Your answer and how cooperative you are will determine what we do with you in regards to your living arrangements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Or,\" The bloodhound barked, \"It could determine how we punish you or execute you... pretty straight forward really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Of course, dealing with a police force that has no problem executing you can be a bit of a problem. Especially when the only information you can give is a story that no one will believe. That's when the game changes, it becomes less about the actual interrogation and more about buying time to figure out how to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Kiba replied, \"When I was a kid, we were poor. I grew up with my family in a refugee camp. One of your kind would stray in now and again just looking for a place to stay the night. We were fine with that, no harm no foul is what we believed. It wasn't an ideal living condition for anyone but we got by. But one night some thugs came and tore the camp apart and lit it on fire. Burned everything to the ground. I got separated from my family, they didn't make it out in time...\" Kiba paused as he sighed. \"I'd really rather not tell the rest of this...\" The husky looked sympathetic toward you, while the bloodhound only scoffed at your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine,\" The bloodhound muttered while waving his hands, \"Skip ahead a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba nodded, \"Thank you, anyway I basically lived as a thief roaming from small town to small town and stealing what I needed to survive, no more no less. I found a job in a human settlement a few miles from here and I worked there for a while. During one of my shifts working at the warehouse I felt ill and the next thing I knew I woke up in the street here where that wolf officer found me.\" When Kiba finished his story he knew the odds of them believing it was a longshot. Especially because of the fact that he'd told the wolf he knew nothing of the anthro's hatred toward humans, which was probably common knowledge everywhere in this world as was the reason behind it. Still, if nothing else he'd hoped that their checking into the story would buy him time.... if they bought it that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's an interesting story kid...\" The bloodhound replied, \"Plenty of holes and wiggle room here and there but for the most part that's pretty viable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We'll need a moment to go over what we've heard and check into your story,\" The husky stated, \"We'll be back in a moment.\" With that the two canine's rose and left the room.</span></div></div>",

He looks at you dubiously taking a seat in the chair in front of you. He's dressed in a police uniform just like all the other creatures. However, he is much larger than any of the other ones you've see thus far.

Come to think of it, it may have been a little longer than that give or take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have no clue about what happened here,\" You reply emphatically, \"But I'd be a lot less confused and very appreciative if you could fill me in,\" You continued with a hint of irritation slipping into your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bear nods, \"Alright, lets start with where you are. This is New York City, as you can see, it's populated by anthros such as myself. There are humans here and there, but they live either in hiding or under the care of the few anthros who don't actively hate humans. I myself don't mind humans, what the past generation did has nothing to do with the current generation. It's unfair to blame them the way that most anthros do to be honest.\" The bear sighed and looked away for a moment, \"By the same token, what your kind did to our past generations... well, that was something that tends to leave scars for generations to come....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't open the file, but instead he simply rested a hand on it, \"My race; the anthros did not come to exist out of chance nor are we a product of evolution. We were created by humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stared at the bear in disbelief, \"Humans created you? Why? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As I said, we were not a product of evolution. But we were not always anthromorphic creatures. We were once an animalistic race. Some of our subspecies were avian, others were bipedal primates and many were quadruped mammals. We were driven by only instinct for the most part and it is believed that we were not sentient beings capable of the thought we are today. Humans were at the top of the food chain and lived in cities much like the this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look down at your chained wrists in thought, \"What your describing... sounds a lot like where I'm from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bear grunted in thought, \"Does it now? If you're telling the truth and that really is the case then that would mean that the events that led to the world you see today haven't occurred in 'your world'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What events?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The creation of anthros to start. Through experimentation on our predecessors, humans of the generations of old created anthros. It was a process that took several years. Some were injected with chemicals and drugs that caused immense pain, others were forced to undergo genetic manipulation. Most of our predecessors did not survive the tests... the ones that did though, they became what you see before you today. Eventually a substantial amount of subspecies had been amassed and created through genetic manipulation. Humans; curious of their potential, began to teach them how to read, write and speak. This though, was ultimately what led to the downfall of civilization as humanity knew it. The anthros that they had been testing, experimenting on, killing... and teaching had learned to strategize amongst themselves. Eventually they escaped and disappeared into their natural habitats according to their subspecies, the jungle, the wetland and of course the seas and deserts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course,\" You replied as you tried to wrap your head around what your hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"After a few years of hunting and tracking down the anthros, the humans found them. But what they found wasn't what they expected to find. What they expected to find was a small group of anthros scared and confused. They'd expected some resistance, but they expected to handle it easily. But they found several subspecies of anthros, they worked in tandem to fight the humans in what is known to most as guerilla warfare. The humans quickly learned that the anthros had multiplied and while we have a limited aptitude when compared to humans, our aptitude for learning and adapting was higher than the humans anticipated. Given our... natural advantages, our predecessors were easily able to overrun a large portion of human cities and eventually most of the humans were imprisoned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And the rest?\" You pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Any involved or suspected to be involved in the experimentation and torture of animals and anthros alike were killed. Others were put under slavery and the rest fled, some became freedom fighters and others simply became ghosts and disappeared,\" The bear replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So everyone wants to kill me because of what the humans native to this world did to their ancestors?\" You ask in irritation and disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's about right,\" The bear replied. He then opened the file, \"And these are the pictures of the anthros that didn't survive the experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You gasped in shock, several of them were mutilated while others looked like they'd starved to death wasting away into nothing more than skin and bones. Others looked as though they'd been beaten to death and there were those who were simply dead without any extraordinary evidence. \"This is... wrong...\" You breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's barbaric is what it is,\" A feminine voice interjected. You snapped your head up to find the wolf standing in the doorway. Her arms were crossed and her expression was neutral. Her golden eyes pierced through you as they observed your every move, \"Detective, give us a few moments alone if you'd please.\"<br>\r\nThe bear nodded and started to gather up the file on the table, \"Leave those right where they are,\" The wolf ordered. The bear nodded and obeyed before leaving. The wolf closed the door behind him before taking a seat and staring you down. Her lips then parted before asking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It was at this point that you were able to actually take in the true size of the wolf as well as what she looked like. She stood well above the six foot mark possibly even near the seven foot mark. She had long black, curly hair that flowed down to her shoulders and striking golden eyes sitting atop her snout. Her fur was gray and well groomed much like her hair. And of course, she had a pair of pointed grey ears that sat atop her head though they were slightly obscured by her hair. She was dressed in what looked to be a S.W.A.T. uniform. Shoulder pads, elbow pads and knee pads were the basis for your assumption. Her fingertips were exposed as she wore a pair of fingerless gloves. The story was similar wither her feet as her claws and toes were exposed but the rest of her foot was covered in some kind of heavy duty wrap. The last thing the struck you was her size, she was easily twice your size and not in terms of height. She was simply larger than you, you didn't doubt that her palm could encompass your face like an NBA player's would encompass a basket ball. By the same token, you had now doubt she was as lean as a track sprinter. She was definitely well-suited for her role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're right on both counts, however as I said before... I'm not from here. This.... this... this world is all wrong. Nothing makes sense here,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf stared you down for a few moments before sitting down where the bear once was, \"Normally, coming across a human wouldn't be a problem because humans know to either stay out of the city or make themselves inconspicuous. Otherwise, there is a group of humans who are very militaristic and bent on subduing the anthro race. As you've already seen most anthros don't take kindly to humans. Personally, I don't have a problem with them. My job is simply to keep the innocent safe regardless of their species, what happened in the past has nothing to do with you and I here and now. If you are telling the truth, you will be placed under police protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay...\" You replied slowly, \"So-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"However,\" The wolf interjected, \"I cannot ignore possible threats. If you are with the group of humans I mentioned earlier and/or you have hostile intentions toward this city's inhabitants then I'll have to deal with you as a threat. If you lie to me and I find out your lying, I'll deal with you personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And what does that mean?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know from first hand that human's have very vivid imaginations...\" The wolf mused, \"So imagine me angry with you and then imagine what I might do to you.\" A look of mortification flashes across your face prompting the wolf to nod, \"It looks like you understand the gravity of the situation, so I'm going give you a little more useful information. If your story is true it would mean that you've never seen an anthro before, so it would stand to reason that you have limited knowledge on us and our capabilities correct?\" You nodded, \"Then before we begin the interrogation, you should know that I fill the role of an interrogator because of some of my unique abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean?\" You inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tell me,\" The wolf prompted, \"What do you hear, see and feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shrug, \"I feel cold and hard handcuffs restraining me to a table. I hear the sound of an very quiet air conditioner and I see a rather intimidating anthro wolf if I'm perfectly honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf nodded, \"My senses are significantly heightened when compared to yours. I can see your pupils dilating, I can hear your breathing, I can smell the fear rolling off of your body and I can feel your arms trembling against the table because of the adrenaline running though your veins. If you lie to me, I will sense it through the changes in your body, just think of me as a biological lie detector... but more accurate.\" You nodded solemnly. \"Now, this will be your first, best and only chance that you will have to tell me if the story you've been sticking to thus far is a lie and if your working with anybody who would threaten anyone else's safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've been honest with you since I got here,\" You replied, \"I find it hard to believe that I could be suspected of hurting someone like you...\" As those words left your mouth, you noticed the wolf's expression change for the briefest of moments from neutral to what you thought was surprise. You have no doubt that if you'd blinked you would've missed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very well then, let's begin,\" The wolf replied. The next few hours consisted of you being interrogated. She asked you questions about your life, questions about what you'd seen since your arrival and sometimes she'd ask you random questions about totally unrelated subjects. She also asked you some of the same questions more than once and every now and again she'd fill in the answer for you with an answer you'd already given her or one that she knew was different from what you'd already told her and then she'd ask you to confirm the answer in both cases. It was obvious that she was using more than just her abilities to determine whether you were lying, she was also trying to see if you'd change any of you're answers. After four hours of questioning the interrogation mercifully came to an end. At length, the wolf sat back in her chair and stared at you with her piercing eyes which seemed to glow even under the bright lights of the room you were in. You stared back at her taking in her expression, searching for even the slightest hint of what she might be thinking, and you were sure that she was doing the same. Time almost seemed to come to a stand still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" The wolf said as she stood up effectively shattering the silence of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright what?\" You asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf crossed her arms and stared down at you with a neutral expression, \"I believe I've decided on what to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Out of the dark square in the ceiling fell two black canisters which clanked as the hit the metal table. Less than a second later, the canisters began hissing before releasing an odd gas. One released a black smoke while the other released white smoke. You found yourself gagging and tearing up, but you couldn't smell anything. The wolf that was with you stood up immediately and kicked her chair aside. She took up a fighting stance as if she were expecting an attack. After a few more seconds you couldn't see anything, everywhere you looked the hazy smoke distorted and clouded your vision. You then felt the chain holding you to the desk go taut before slackening. Your lifted your arms from the table and though you couldn't see them, you could feel that they'd been released from their bindings. It was then that you felt something grab you underneath your arms and pull you upward. You could only assume that you were heading up into the ceiling vent where the attack had originated from. It wasn't long before you immersed in the darkness of the vent where you felt yourself being dragged by your arms as you're savior dragged you through the duct while you recovered from the gas.

All of these details were of interest to you and brought several questions to your mind, however, there was another detail that stood out above all others, these ninja where human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While you were happy to find yourself in the company of your own species you also realized that these three humans have just infiltrated and extracted you from what may have been the most secure facility in the city and you still don't know what their motives are. And given that the police were actually considering protecting you, going along with whatever it is they had in mind gave you pause. For all you know they're mission is your elimination. After all it was common knowledge that many ninja of old killed high profile and high priority targets both for peace and for the right price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is it that you want from me?\" You demanded. However, you were met with silence. \"Of course,\" You sighed, \"Ninjas don't talk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At that point, one of the ninjas walked forward and pointed at you before placing an open palm on its chest. You couldn't make out the genders of any of them as their garb did a good job of distorting their actual physical builds. You stared for a moment before you realized what the shinobi was saying. \"You want me to come with you?\" You asked. All three of the shinobi nodded in response. \"Why?\" You asked. You question was met by the lead ninja shaking its head. \"No?\" You asked in confusion, \"Do you mean you can't tell me?\" You're inquiry was met with a nod this time. Before you could ask any more questions. A loud thud echoed across the rooftop. Several anthros began crawling out of a hatch in the ground, most of them were german shepards, but they were all led by the wolf you'd met previously. The two ninjas behind the leader ran past you and drew short bladed katana and took up a defensive stance between you and the anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf ordered her officers to hold their positions as she walked forward, \"I know you mean us no harm. You're group has always been respectful and tolerant toward our kind and we have granted you quite a bit of leeway for that. However, I cannot allow you to take that human. He may not be of this world and if that is the case, we need to know what we're dealing with.\" None of the ninja moved except for the one that had begun communicating with you. It walked past you before standing directly in front of you and moving its arm in a horizontal slashing motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf stood up and her face flickered in an almost regretful expression, \"Is that your final answer?\" She asked. The ninja in front of you nodded, prompting the wolf to sigh, \"Then I'm sorry, I didn't want it to come to this but my duties are clear and you leave me no choice. The anthro officers began drawing their guns but before they could even raise them to line up their shots the two shinobi who'd drawn their blades tossed to metallic orbs into the air, each about the size of a baseball. The orbs flashed in a brilliant white and yellow light blinding everyone on the rooftop with the exception of themselves. You felt something hard slam into you stomach while you were blinded by the light and felt yourself beginning to fall to your knees. However, you never hit the ground. From what you could tell, someone was slinging you over their shoulder and carrying you. You presumed it was one of the ninjas. You would have resisted, but those orbs did more than blind you. It seemed that they had impaired your hearing and equilibrium all at once, turning you into a blind drunk capable of rational thought. You don't know what these shinobi had planned for you, but you were going to find out first hand whether you wanted to or not.</span></div></div>",

But you're equilibrium is still shot and the only images you can actually see are after images of what your eyes are able to catch a glimpse of as you're carried along. You buildings, rooftops, police lights and monumental drops to streets that you appear to be hanging over. You also notice that the stead vibration caused by your carrier's running stops all together when you are able to see these drops down to the street. <i>\"They must be rooftop jumping\"</i> You think as you try to piece together where you are and how far you've traveled, <i>\"But to carry me at this pace while jumping rooftops... I know I'm a little on the light side but still... The amount of strength and endurance that would require would be ridiculous.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You suddenly feel a jolt and all movement stops. You can hear a familiar sound in the background above the hustle and bustle of the city, <i>\"I know that noise... What is it?\"</i> You think as you hear it again. It suddenly strikes you, <i>\"Water! It's water lapping up against a seawall. I can smell the seawater too. We must be at a dock or near a harbor.</i> You then feel yourself being moved by two pairs of hands. The cold hard texture of old wood makes itself present by pressing itself into your backside as you're laid down. <i>\"I was right, we are on a dock...</i> You then hear something surface. Whatever it was it did it quietly, because you barely heard a sound. You're vision was still hazy and you were still off keel from the incident on the rooftop. You felt something being placed into your mouth. You resisted at first, but a gloved hand gently but firmly squeezed your cheeks and forced your mouth open. You felt something cold and rubbery fill your mouth making it a little difficult for you to breath. You then felt something cover you're face and the back of your head. After a few more seconds you pieced it together. A regulator had been placed into your mouth and a dive mask around your face. You began breathing through the regulator as the dive mask made it impossible to breathe through your nose. After a few more moments you felt yourself being helped to your feet. By now your vision had completely restored, but your balance was still iffy at best. Your blurry flashes of images became a steady flow of your current surroundings. Two of the shinobi had placed your each of your arms around their necks and were now walking you toward the edge of the dock that you were currently on. <i>What? Are they gonna try to tow me to where we're going... by hand? That's crazy!\"</i> You wanted to resist because you honestly thought you were going to drown, however somewhere in your nervous system between your brain and your legs your commands were getting jumbled up because your legs refused to support your weight and moved in a spastic kicking motion while your feet remained limp. After a few more steps the two ninja simply walked off of the dock and dropped into the water with a splash, taking you along for the ride. After submerging themselves you all sank deeper and deeper before coming to a stop at what you'd guess was twenty feet deep. The water was somewhat murky but much cleaner and bluer than you would've expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You continued to simply float in space waiting for whatever it was the shinobi seemed to be waiting for. You thought they were going to swim you somewhere themselves, but all they've done is descended well below visual range from the surface and waited. Suddenly, you saw a glimmer in the distance. You thought is was your imagination, but you had nothing better to do so you did you're best to see if you could find it again, and find it you did. Out of the blue darkness ahead of you swam an anthro shark headed right for you. You couldn't make out to many details between the water and goggles distorting your vision, but from what you could tell, it was female and wearing a scuba suit with black hair... at least that's what you thought you saw. Your initial reaction was to run, but you couldn't. <i>\"So this is it...\"</i> You thought, <i>\"I'm going to be killed by a genetically altered humanoid shark in the waters of an oddly clean harbor... man... that sounded oddly specific and ironic.\"</i> During all of this, some part of your brain was playing the music from the movie JAWS in your head. <i>\"Sure, why not?\"</i> You mentally muttered. As you made peace with yourself and prepared to become eradicated from the food chain, you noticed that the shark was slowing and the shinobi were calmly moving towards it. The shinobi pushed you forward as the shark reached for you. Upon her hands (if that's what they were?) making contact with your body, you felt yourself being maneuvered around so that your body was inline with hers. She then held you snugly against her stomach. Out of the corner of your eye you could see each ninja taking up a position near her shoulders before grabbing on to her. Once they had a secure grip she began swimming at a rapid pace back into the darkness from which she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were tired both physically and mentally. You may not have been doing any of the swimming or running. But your body has had adrenaline pounding through its veins for hours and you haven't had anything to eat in a good while either. Eventually your vision starts to fade to a black. You fight to keep your eyes open, but every time you blink your vision becomes increasingly blurry wand you become more and more drowsy by the second. Your Regulator starts to slip from your mouth when a black gloved hand pushed it back into place and held it there. You find one of the ninja had shifted its position from the shark's shoulder to her underbelly next to you. It was using one arm to cling to the shark's arm while it used the other to hold your regulator in place. After that your consciousness faded from you as the realm of sleep and darkness took over.</span></div></div>",

You're awake!\" Came a voice from the other side of the room. You looked over to find a woman in a white robe with matching white pants. What she wore was actually rather reminiscent of what karate students would wear during training. She was young, but older than you. You'd estimate late twenties if you had to guess. She had brunette hair and brown eyes. Given what she was wearing and her size, you assumed she was pretty athletic. Your mind didn't dwell on that as you were still preoccupied with how you'd arrived here and where exactly 'here' was. \"You'll be happy to know that you didn't have any serious injuries,\" The woman continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Serious injuries?\" You echoed as you looked down at your body. You suddenly became a little self conscious as for the first time since you'd awakened you found yourself in a robe similar to the one that the woman talking to you was wearing, the only difference being yours was navy blue as were your pants. You leapt to your feet and stare at yourself \"What in the- Who took me out of my clothes!?\" You demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I did,\" The woman replied casually as she approached you to do... who knows what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You what!?\" You exclaimed backing away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh calm down, I'm a doctor\" The woman replied waving her hand in a dismissive way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And what? I should just take your word for it?\" You demanded incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The woman smiled, \"Now your getting it! Now hold still, time for your sedative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are not sedating me!\" You growled. It was then that you realized you letting a little too much of your nature show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The woman's demeanor changed from carefree to surprised as she noticed your sudden change, \"A fighter eh? Given this sudden change in attitude I don't suppose that you'll let me do this quietly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You'd always had a wild side, it got you into tons of trouble when you were younger and caused you a lot of loss when you were older. You tried to keep it covered up and concealed. You tried so hard to be the person you thought you should be, you tried to keep all of you're emotions in check all the time... but the truth was that it just wasn't who you were. You were one coin with two sides... maybe now it was time to show both sides instead of pretending to be a false coin. \"No,\" You replied, \"I'm afraid not.\" You're confidence in you're athletic abilities had shown clear as day in you're defiant smirk as you finished that sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't say I'm disappointed,\" The woman replied, \"I never see any action back here, safe and tucked away behind the walls of our hidden home where the other shinobi return to after their missions have been carried out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And I've just been dying to know where here is,\" You commented. \"I don't suppose you'd be willing to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The woman grinned and shook her head, \"Afraid not, but I promise I'll be gentle with you.\" She then darted up to you with speed you wouldn't have believed her capable of. She was within arm's length of you when a syringe seemed to appear in her hand. You cringed as you saw it and grabbed her arm as she jabbed it at you before swinging her into the wall behind you while using the momentum to slingshot yourself a few feet away from her. She quickly shook off the impact and gave you a look that a teacher might give a student who'd solved an equation properly. \"Not bad, you could use a little work but your reflexes are impressive considering you've had no formal training!\" She growled as she launched herself at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>She's wrong</i>\" You thought as you jumped backward avoiding the needle's point and then followed up with a shoulder charge which she easily avoided forcing you to change into an upright stance and slide to a stop, \"<i>As an athlete, I've never stopped training. Both in official sports\"</i>you thought as you remembered an instant where you dodged a tackle in a football game, \"<i>And unofficial,\"</i> As those words hung in your mind an instance of you jumping from a building and onto a moving truck flashed through your mind. <i>\"And I can put it all to use here!\"</i> You thought as spun around to find your opponent bearing down on you. But more importantly, you noticed an open doorway behind her. You twisted yourself to the side to avoid the needle sending her arm shooting past you. She was quick to react however as she twirled the syringe in her fist and attempted to stab you with it. You noted the attack though and through instinct more than anything else, you were able to stop her arm before roughly shoving her in the back and sweeping your leg against one of her own. The maneuver left her face down on the ground. By the time she'd gotten up, she was just able to catch your left foot slipping through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry,\" The woman apologized to no one in particular, \"I underestimated him and I'm out of practice. I will get Kalin and we'll secure him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No wait,\" A deep but calm voice commanded, \"Let the twins deal with him. I'd like to see how he responds to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The woman nodded, \"Okay then, I'll leave it to them.\" The woman rose up and left the room. But as she left, the form of a large anthro wolf remained behind in the center of the room. He sat cross legged in a black shinobi robe. His eyes were a piercing gold and his fur was a black as his shadow. He remained sitting quietly in the room awaiting the outcome of the current conflict, \"I wonder if this human will be the one to turn the tides...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of the hallways were lit by candles and torches along the walls. \"This is nuts,\" Kiba muttered to himself as he tore across the hardwood floor. \"I need to find a quiet place to rest and plot my next move...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba glanced over his shoulder, checking for signs of pursuit but to his relief he found none. As he reached the end of the hallway he found a sliding door. With caution he opened the door before slipping through it and closing it without making a sound. Turning his attention to his surroundings, he found himself in a traditional Japanese garden. Cherry Blossom trees lined the inside of the courtyard while the center of the garden was taken up by a coy pond full of enormous and lazy fish who swam about as they bathed under the moonlight that lit the entire garden and courtyard, and in the center of the pond a large rock formation of some kind of black stone sat proudly above the water as if it were its own mountain surround by ocean. Deciding it was best to continue moving rather than to take too long absorbing the majestic sight, Kiba turned and began making his way along the inner wall of the courtyard that he'd entered through in hopes of finding an exit. The human didn't make it too far from his entry point as he felt an odd and subtle chill creeping down his spine. The kind of chill you get when you realize that your not alone when you thought you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trusting his instincts and the terrible feeling in his gut and heart, Kiba slowed his pace before turning to face the courtyard once more. Much to his displeasure and growing dread, he found a pair of twin shinobi standing atop of the stone formation that peaked out from the center of the coy pond. Both shinobi silently leapt from their perch and landed within an arms length of Kiba. Each stood patiently and quietly as they sized up the young man who had been clearly marked as the target of the shadow warriors. Kiba, fully aware that these were probably sent to capture him in response to his escape prepared himself for the inevitable fight that he would have to win for his freedom. A key feature that he noted of the two ninjas before him was that they were both anthro foxes. Neither wore shoes, opting to expose their paws rather than cover them with any type of protective covering. While they wore masks they only were partial masks, covering nothing more than each fox's muzzle leaving they're face from the muzzle up clearly exposed. One more thing Kiba noticed, was that these two anthros stood eye to eye with him in height....</span></div></div>",

There's no way I can't outrun them, I can't win in a fight against them either. That should be fine though, I just need to hold them off long enough to figure a way out of here...\"</i> Kiba frowned at his thoughts, <i>\"That sounded a lot easier than its going to be.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't suppose you could just let me go?\" The human ventured. The twin shinobi remained unmoving, offering they're silence as their response. \"I suppose I'll just take that as a no then?\" The foxes did not offer silence as their response this time but instead, as if awakened by a secret command they crouched into fighting stances. Kiba responded in kind, though he really didn't like his odds he was painfully aware that turning his back and attempting escape would make him an easy target. The fox on his left was the first to engage. It smashed into him knocking him on his back. Dazed and confused, Kiba tried to get his bearings and shake the dizziness from his head. He would not get the chance to do either though as his opponent was on top of him less than a moment after he'd hit the ground. He felt a weight on his chest and constriction around his throat. Clearing his mind and seeing clearly again he realized that the fox was now sitting on his chest and using its hands to strangle him. An grimly efficient tactic for a nonlethal victory. Kiba shifted his hands as he gasped for air and griped the shinobi's forearms in an effort to pry its hands from around his throat. The shinobi responded by shifting its weight from its knees to its hands, effectively crushing its victim's wind pipe under its weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba realized that while breathing may have been difficult before, it was impossible now, <i>\"This is bad... at this rate I'll pass out in a matter of seconds. I can't pry its hands off of me and I don't have enough oxygen in my body to throw it off of me.\"</i> It was then that Kiba saw his way out, a desperate and ancient ploy but still an effective one when executed by one with experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few more seconds passed, the shinobi fox noticed that it's prey's movements had begun to weaken and slow. What were once violent and explosive jerks and twists had become nothing more than half hearted flexes while his hands slackened and slipped off of its own. Feeling secure in its victory, the shinobi rose to its feet before grasping the human by his robe and hefting him off the ground. Kiba lay slumped in the grasp of his opponent as though he were only being held up by strings. His captor turned to its twin and nodded as if to say 'its done'. To its surprise though, the human that hung limp from its hands suddenly came to life before delivering a quick punch to its face. Stunned, the shinobi released the human before staggering backward. The two shinobi withdrew away from the human before taking up a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It seems that little human has more fight than we thought...\" A strong and deep voice mused from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both foxes charged the lone human in single file, one behind the other. Each drew a pair of daggers as they charged the human who prepared for the coming attack. Kiba easily dodged the first fox. The second however stopped just short of Kiba before taking a swipe at him. Kiba leapt backwards avoiding the knife's edge. But in avoiding the first attack Kiba had accidentally put himself in line for a second attack. Pain rolled across the human's back as the fox that he'd first dodged had slipped behind him before driving its knee into Kiba's back. Kiba gasped as he staggered forward toward the other shinobi which drew its fist back for another punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

After crashing on the ground Kiba struggled to stay conscience. <i>\"One punch huh? That's all it took?\"</i> A voice in the back of his head asked. It sounded like that of a young woman, however there was a very familiar feel to it. <i>\"How can I fight an anthro? Let alone two? If they want me, I can't do anything to stop them.\"</i> Kiba felt his body being lifted by the two shinobi. One grabbed his right shoulder and the other grabbed his left before dragging him down into the building once more. <i>\"You were the most stubborn and determined kid I ever had to deal with,\"</i> Kiba's eyes opened a little at the words he heard as he realized who's voice he was hearing. \"Sis?\" Kiba muttered, looking around as if to find the source of the voice. He found no one other than the shinobi who now eyed him suspiciously. Kiba sighed and hung his head, allowing his eyes to droop closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Surrounded in darkness, he waited for his fate. After a few moments he found himself sitting in a field of darkness with no light in sight. <i>\"Seriously? So this is it? You're going to sit here and give up because somebody punched you in the face?\"</i> Kiba looked into the dark looking around to find a young woman with long and curly black hair, green eyes and tan skin looking down at him with a disapproving smirk. She was dressed in sweat pants and a baggy black t shirt. \"Sis?\" Kiba questioned, \"Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where do you think we are?\" She demanded. She placed her hands on her hips before bending over and taking her right index finger and tapping Kiba's forehead with it. \"We're in you're head.\" She stood up and looked down at him before smirking again, although this time it was in a friendly matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what I'm getting out of this is that you're not real and I've gone crazy,\" Kiba muttered sarcastically before crossing his arms and looking away from his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm as real as you want me to be kiddo,\" His sister countered, \"And you're not crazy, you just need a little help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of the mental kind no doubt,\" Kiba scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, enough of the pessimism. It's really starting to grind on my nerves,\" His sister warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba sighed, \"Ok, 'Kayla'. Let's recount what's happened so far. I've been sent to some strange parallel world where the majority of animals have been turned in to anthropomorphic creatures who have the ability to learn and adapt like humans do. In addition to that the humans here are dominated by the anthros who hate them and both species are on the brink of going to war with one another. To make matters worse, I've been kidnapped by shinobi who are intent on keeping me here for god knows what and now I'm talking to a mental construct of my older sister in my own head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kayla nodded, \"Must be one of the days,\" She shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Get real!\" Kiba shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kayla sighed, \"Why are you giving up and letting them take you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because I can't win. There's two of them and they've got training that I don't. And on the off chance that I could beat them <i>both</i>. I'd still have an entire compound of who knows how many ninja standing in my way. This is the very definition of a no win scenario.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kayla laughed, \"And you are the very personification of will, Kiba. When things are at their worst like this is when you are at you're best. You never give up, and even if you have no formal training (which isn't entirely true...) you have experience, and your natural ability compliments your style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba stared at Kayla in confusion, \"My style?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kayla gave a tired smile and sighed, \"Honestly you can be so clueless sometimes. Think back to every fight you had with me that you thought you were going to lose... No... think back to every fight you ever had that you thought you were going to lose. Whether wrestling with me or fighting a bully at school. You never won every fight you got into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No...\" Kiba admitted quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But I don't remember you ever losing or giving up a fight either,\" Kayla added. Kiba's eyes widened in realization. \"You either won, tied or the fight was ended before a clear winner was decided. Do you remember why? It's because you never gave up, that's part of who you are. Your strength isn't in you strategic thinking, your speed or your physical strength...\" Kayla then knelt down and placed a hand on Kiba's chest, \"It's in your heart, there's a fire in here that refuses to go out no matter how badly the storm around it rages on it refuses to give in. I remember that time you had that accident in that mountain bike race, you were beaten and bloody, barely able to stand but you still pressed on... this is no different. If you're going to survive in this world you have to be strong enough to keeping moving forward or else you won't survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba nodded in understanding, \"You're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kayla scoffed at her younger brother's words, \"I'm always right. Now get up... GET UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba's eyes snapped open as he left the realm of his subconscious and reentered the real world. Both shinobi jumped slightly at the sudden change in their prisoner's condition. Before either one of them could react, Kiba snatched his arms away from his captors and planted himself. Both foxes stumbled forward before regaining their footing. Taking advantage of their recovery time Kiba opted to attack the fox on his left. He rushed forward before throwing his shoulder into the ninja's back causing it to stagger forward uncontrollably and slam into a wall. He then turned to deal a blow to the second fox who had already moved to attack him. With a drawn dagger, the fox swiped at his chest and shoulder. Barely able to stumble away from the blade's edge, Kiba managed to avoid the initial strikes. \"I'll never get out of this if I don't do something about that knife,\" Kiba muttered to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Settle down and focus kid,\"</i> Kayla's voice called to him, <i>\"Do what you do best, tire it out and take any openings you can get.\"</i> Kiba smiled and rushed forward, a move that surprised his attacker. Kiba was able to throw a quick punch catching the side of the foxes muzzle. Annoyed with the sudden burst of energy it's prey had found, the ninja dashed forward, attacking with a flurry of stabs. Kiba was able to keep ahead of them, jumping backwards and twisting his body to avoid the dagger's point until he felt his back bump into something soft. He felt a set of arms shoot up and under his armpits followed by a pressure on his mid back effectively pining him to the body of his newfound captor. The fox he'd been fighting now approached with the knife in hand, if he weren't wearing a mask, Kiba would've assumed that he was smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry, I'm not ready to quit yet,\" Kiba muttered before slamming the back of his head into the front of his captor's muzzle. The impact stung him, but it had done far worse to the ninja that had been holding him. A sharp and distinctly canine whimper could be heard followed by what sounded like a young woman groaning. As much as Kiba wanted to look, he dared not take his eyes off of his opponent.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ninja that had been attacking with the dagger darted up to Kiba faster than he'd anticipated before backhanding him across his face. Kiba staggered backwards before he felt a sharp pain in his back. He fell on to his stomach before glancing back to find that the fox he'd knocked down a few moments earlier had recovered and shed <i>her</i> mask. With hazel eyes and short brunette hair. She gazed at Kiba, her face devoid of any emotion save for the faintest hint of a frown on her muzzle. Kiba got to his feet, a dumfounded expression written across his face before he realized that he was under attack from <i>two</i> opponents. Spinning around in time to find a black gloved fist driving itself into his stomach. Kiba doubled over and gasped for air before his attackers knee came up and connected with his face. A coppery taste filled Kiba's mouth, he didn't need to touch his lip to know that it was bleeding. The female fox crashed into Kiba's back before grabbing both of his wrists and forcing them behind his back in a similar way that a police officer might. She then kicked the human's legs out from under him while pushing him forward. This resulted in the fox kneeling on the injured human's back with both of his arms subdued. Kiba writhed and squirmed beneath her, but despite his efforts he couldn't break free. The fact was that she had the dominant position and there was nothing he could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The second ninja; whos gender remained a mystery, cautiously approached Kiba's leg's to bind them. However, while the human may have been unable to stand or get free, he was still keenly aware that his legs were still capable of nearly a full range of movement. As the ninja knelt down to subdue the afore mentioned limbs Kiba swung both of his feet up so that the soles of his feet faced the ceiling. The result was a powerful kick to the face that neither of the foxes had expected. The fox on Kiba's back twisted her body to see what had happened, doing so meant shifting her weight which gave Kiba an opening. Kiba rolled the fox off of his body and got to his feet. THe other two foxes got to there feet as well, ready for the third round. However, before the fighting could begin... <i>again</i>... a gust of cool air swept through the room as one of the other doors opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Enough!\" Came a powerful and deep voice. All three combatants looked n the doorway to find a large black wolf taking up most of the frame. He had luminescent gold eyes and pitch black fur. He was clothed in a white robe not unlike what most karate students wore where you came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But master!\" The female fox exclaimed, \"You told us that we were to bring the human before you as a test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes Kara, I did say that,\" The wolf admitted, \"Unfortunately you failed that test. There is much that you have to learn before becoming a full fledged shinobi. You and your brother should go think about your fight with this human. When you realize how he defeated you and what you did wrong then you may come and see me.\" Both foxes nodded and bowed before going away, presumably to their rooms, leaving Kiba alone with the large wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So?\" Another voice broke in, \"This is the human?\" An anthro tiger paced around Kiba who at this point nearly jumped out of his skin. She was large, that much was certain. She rivaled the wolf back in the police station for height. But she was much more powerful. Her orange eyes seemed to burn with an intense heat. She wore black robes almost identical to the wolf's, only her paws were wrapped in tape. Her hair was jet black and fell down to her shoulders, and her fur was the typical orange and black tiger striped pattern. The fur under her chin and down the front of her neck was white as were the insides of her paws. While her hand/paws were taped she wore nothing on her feet. Her feet remained exposed to show their carefully cared for and deadly claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"How the heck did she get within an arms length of me without me noticing? She's huge! Nothing that big can move that quietly!\"</i> Kiba reasoned as he watched the tiger's movements, observing her as she observed him. She then paused in front of him before bending down to his level and moving so that her knows was inches away from his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stop it Samantha, you're scaring him,\" Another feminine voice called into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tiger named 'Samantha' rolled her eyes and stood up, \"He's fine, I just wanted a better look at him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's a human, not a goldfish,\" The voice chided. Just then, an anthro lioness walked in. She had hazel eyes and golden fur. her hair as similar in style to the tiger, but different in color as it was brown. Her body wasn't as well defined as the previous cat but she was no field mouse to be sure. She stood a few inches shorter than her feline friend, and seemed to be a bit more reserved. Kiba also noted that she was dressed in much more... normal clothes than the other two anthros. Wearing baggy denim jeans and a loose blue t shirt she stared disapprovingly at the tiger who now moved away from the comparatively small human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Relax Savannah,\" The tiger then paused before glancing over at Kiba, \"After all, if we're going to get along we need to be acquainted right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lioness cast her gaze over to the wolf who stood just ahead of her as if wanting him to reprove the tiger. The wolf, seeming to sense what was on her mind gave her a small smile. \"It's fine Savannah, its natural to be curious about something or someone new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Be that as it may,\" A deep but quiet voice interjected followed by the entry of yet a third anthro. This one was a raccoon, his classic gray and black fur pattern giving his typing away. He was clothed in a mesh exercise shirt while he wore baggy black sweat pants on his lower half. His foot paws were exposed, and sporting a set of claws that rivaled those of the tiger. His thick bushy tail swayed calmly from side to side giving Kiba plenty of time to confirm he was a raccoon once more by the black rings around his tail. If that wasn't a dead giveaway the 'mask' like patch of fur around his ice blue eyes definitely was. His stature was definitely smaller than the other three anthros in the room. Though he was obviously not the strongest, Kiba had a hard time doubting that he was certainly the quickest and most likely the most agile of the group. Muscles could be seen beneath his gray fur, and while not the biggest the human had ever seen, they were certainly toned and well maintained. A silent testament to their owner's training no doubt. \"He is still a human being, he deserves to be treated like one instead of like a piece of art.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright already, I won't stare so much anymore,\" The tiger huffed as she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The raccoon then moved to the center of the room where Kiba stood. He was but a head taller than Kiba, something that the human had found to be a rarity in this world, \"I watched your fight a few moments ago and I must say.... well done. Though they are not full fledged ninja, Leo's nephew and niece are not to be taken lightly as they are very formidable with their tag team tactic as you've experienced. I didn't expect you to be conscious at the end of it, let alone resist them... I'm truly impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba raised an eyebrow at the raccoon unsure of how to respond to his summation, \"Thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lioness chuckled, \"Don't take that lightly, Seth hardly gives compliments to anyone. In fact, from what we've seen he just tolerates most of us... so the fact that he's smiling at you and giving you praise is a rare sight for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba gave a small and tired smile but remained tense, unsure of what to expect. After all, the battle weary human had been kidnapped, attacked and now he was being observed. \"I don't mean to be rude or sound blunt. But what is it that you want from me? Why did you bring me here? And why did you have the two foxes attack me?\" Kiba demanded, his voice raising a little more than he realized with his final question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf nodded, \"All very good questions that you deserve to have the answers to. And we will answer those questions soon enough. But at the moment, all you need to know is that we will not harm you and you must remain here for the time being. Savannah and Seth will escort you to your room, you can rest there, from what I've been told and as far as I can see you've had a busy night and some rest will do you good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba scowled, \"An escort? To show me where to go or to keep me from running away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf gave another gentle smile, \"Both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Samatha grinned displaying a full set of razor sharp fangs to the human, \"You just tried to run away on us once. Why would we risk you doing it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth moved to Kiba's side while the Lioness moved to the door. The raccoon placed his palm on Kiba's shoulder, gently guiding him towards the door Savannah was walking through. The lioness paused as she waited for her comrade and the human they were to escort.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At length he decided do as he was told for the time being. After he'd left the wolf then turned to the tiger, \"Sam, I'd hate to impose but could you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tiger nodded, \"Say no more, I'll handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Leo looked at her dubiously, \"Be gentle Sam, he's still adjusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tiger shrugged as she walked out of the room, \"Whether I'm gentle or not is entirely up to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba found himself standing in a Chinese style room. It was very basic with only a bedroll, seat pad and candle. However, what it lacked in luxury it made up for with space. There was enough room to put three king sized beds and a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We'll be right outside if you need anything,\" Savannah said as she smiled warmly at the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba frowned as he spun around to face his escort, \"Wait, you mean your going to stand outside the door to guard me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Naturally,\" Seth replied, \"It's a known fact that you are... uncomfortable and unsatisfied with the information you've received about our abducting you and you are no doubt curious and anxious. I wouldn't put it past you to attempt an escape while we're asleep or begin an investigation and find yourself in an undesirable situation with one of the shinobi residing here that may mistake you for an intruder. That being said we well remain here through the night to ensure you're safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A deadpan expression crossed Kiba's face as he stared blankly back at the raccoon, \"Gee thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Savannah smiled sympathetically towards her 'captive', \"Don't think of us as prison guards, think of us like body guards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh-huh, right...\" Kiba muttered as he went into the room and slid the bamboo framed door shut behind him. The shadow's of his 'guardians' shown on the paper-like material that made up the door's center. Kiba flopped down on the bedroll, recounting everything that had happened throughout the day. His expression softened from irate to on of sorrow, <i>\"I wonder... If I'll ever go home again...\"</i> With that final thought echoing through his mind, the tired human rolled onto his side before drifting to sleep. The candle in the room burned out shortly after, leaving Kiba in darkness with the exception of light that streamed in through the door panel. As the tired human dozed, time rolled on until for no reason in particular he stretched and sat up on the bedroll wondering what time it was. He then shifted his gaze to his bedroom door to find that the lights in the hallway were no longer on. <i>\"Did they finally leave?\"</i> Kiba wondered as he cautiously approached the door. placing his hands on the wooden frame softly, he gently slid the door a third of the way open, the hallway was empty. No sign of guards or shinobi. Deciding that he wouldn't catch a better break than this, Kiba slipped out of his room and closed his door before tip toeing down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He came to the end of the hall which turned into a ninety degree corner. Peeking around the corner he found what he'd been looking for, the final door at the end of the hallway that stood between him and the outside of the compound. He glanced over his shoulder before proceeding around the corner and bumping into something large and relatively soft. The human cursed himself under his breath before tilting his head skyward to find `a pair of glowing orange eyes with slitted pupils, somewhere below them a faint outline of grinning fangs could be made out. Kiba's stomach dropped as he realized who he'd ran into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, well, What do we have here? An unscheduled tour after hours?\" Sam asked with a hint of mirth in her voice. Kiba didn't respond, still frozen against Sam's furry stomach where he'd first ran into her. \"I'm afraid I'm going to have to escort you back to your room,\" The cat continued, prompting the human to take two steps back from her. The tiger then rolled her eyes before drawing in a dramatic breath, \"This is the part where I say 'it's in your best interest not to resist me' and that 'this is for your own good' and 'It'd be easier on both of us if you'd just come quietly' and blah blah blah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Doesn't sound like that's what you really want me to do...\" Kiba observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam grinned again, \"My, what a perceptive little human you are!\" a muffled clap followed her gleeful outburst indicating that she'd clasped her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba's eyes had finally adjusted to the dark, and he could now see the anthro in her entirety, \"So what is it that you want me to do?\" Kiba inquired, his voice laced with skepticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tiger crossed her arms, \"Well we both know you want to escape and that it's my job to prevent that. And while I certainly don't want you to slip away I definitely don't want the boring alternative either. Sooooo, I propose we play a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The human's faced changed from skeptical to blank, \"A... game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeees~\" Sam replied with even more excitement in her voice, \"If I win, I'll return you to your room... conscious or incapacitated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba raised an eyebrow, \"And if I win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam frowned and peered up at the ceiling while humming in thought, \"I'll show you around the compound and give you a brief history lesson on what's happened with the humans and anthros here... and then I'll return you to you're room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba crossed his arms, \"That sounds like a cheap cop-out of a prize,\" The human argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam gave Kiba a toothless smile, \"Hmmhmm, well if you feel that way, I could always stuff you in a sack and hang you on the wall til' morning,\" She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba sighed and shook his head, \"There's no version of this where I get what I want is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"None whatsoever,\" Sam chirped as she continued to smile down on Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine,\" Kiba muttered, \"I'll play your game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excellent!\" The cat exclaimed, \"The game we'll be playing is cat and mouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course it is....\" Kiba muttered as he rolled his eyes and threw a hand up into the air before allowing it to fall lazily at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh cheer up already, I could have picked something like arm wrestling...\" The tiger warned as she held up her paw for emphasis, which was more than twice the size of Kiba's hand. \"In fact... I still can if you'd prefer it?\" Sam offered as she held out her paw in an inviting gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba protectively grasped his right arm with his left hand before turning the threatened appendage away from the anthro, \"No, cat and mouse is fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Smart kid...\" The tiger chuckled. A surge of frustration welled up in the human's chest, but he let it go knowing full well that it'd be pointless to get into another argument with her at this point. \"I'm going to count to fifty. After that I'll come in find you, if I can catch you before the sun comes up, I win. If the sun rises before I get you, you win. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just one, how long until sunrise?\" Kiba questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"About an hour and a half,\" Sam replied. \"Oh, and before I forget.

I told you I'd count to fifty, now I'm on twenty.\" At hearing that, the human scrambled back up the hall he came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>                    Kiba ran down the hallway, making tons of noise. The human whips around corners and hallways. Sam mentioned '<i>I'll carry you back, conscious or incapacitated.</i> this gets Kiba to run like crazy. He slides a door open, gets in, and closes it. It looks like any other room that was in this place. Kiba hides behind the door, if Sam came in, he'd make a mad dash past her. <i>Let's hope that she doesn't expect it... she probably thinks I will fight her...</i> Kiba thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Ok, Kiba. I'm at fifty!\" Sam yells. There was an almost charming giddiness in her voice. Almost no sound comes from this Tiger anthro. Her paws probably pad the ground, essentially dampening her footsteps. Minutes go by, and it feels like hours. Eventually... it became an hour. Kiba is extremely tired, and has pretty much gone into his own world. Asking questions like: What am I doing here? Why can't I leave? Then eventually coming up with his own answers, like 'maybe they want to help me', or 'maybe they want to keep me, as I'm so different'. He hated thinking if he was just going to stay there forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    Suddenly, the door opens. Sam walks in, looking around. Kiba immediately dashes behind her, and runs again. Sam turns around, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"There you are!\" She meows. She starts chasing Kiba, and is as silent as ever. Kiba runs around many corners, and so does Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"What if I...\" Kiba thinks aloud, under his breath. He darts around another corner, out of Sam's sight. She attempts to run around to Kiba, but he suddenly switches direction. Sam is caught off guard for a moment, but she immediately fixes this. Kiba now has some more time. Running by a small desk in a hall, he grabs what looks to be a small, padded training stick and throws it back at Sam. She catches it, with a -<i>thwap</i>-. Kiba looks back and isn't really surprised. He keeps running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Good try! Ha! Now you gave me something to throw! On top of that, you're not that fast!\" She says, she was really close. Kiba honestly felt like he <i>was</i> a mouse. Turning a corner, he tries to catch his breath. He knows he'll be caught. <i>I'm too tired to run... even though I lose, I mean, what even would she do?<br>\r\nIt's just a game, not like she'll hurt me or anything.</i> With that in his head, he awaits for her to turn the corner. But she doesn't. Kiba looks left and right as he leans against the wall. He realizes he ran down a dead end. \"You're trapped, mouse.\" Sam says while around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Y'know, I am not a mouse.\" Kiba responds. He can hear Sam, she is out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Y'know, you run really fast.\" Sam replies sarcastically. \"I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Oh really?\" Kiba responds, he starts to get ready to run, he may be on one side of the hallway, but there's always another way. The opposite side of the hallway. \"No you haven't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Yes I have. You're cornered.\" Sam says triumphantly. She is clearly impressed with herself <i>and</i> you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Never put a mouse in a corner.\" Kiba responds. He darts around the corner and whips past Sam, who glances between the alleyway and Kiba, hair whipping around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Hey!\" Sam protests. She starts dashing towards the human. Kiba laughs, he's actually having a bit of fun. \"That's not fair!\" Sam whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    Kiba loses Sam, but he is not convinced he lost her. On the other hand, Sam has no idea where Kiba is. Sam continues running, looking around walls and trying to listen to his footsteps. She hears him, and tries to run in his direction. Kiba looks towards an exit, he has a perfect view of the horizon, the game is almost over. He sighs with relief, and starts to find a place to hide for the rest of the time. Maybe the same place he hid the first time? He runs around a corner, but he looks back to see is Sam is chasing him. But little did he know, that at the opposite end of the hall, was Sam. She still had the stick in her hand. She runs at Kiba, throwing the stick. Kiba, who was obliviously running in Sam's direction, stumbles as the stick lands perfectly under his foot. He tries to catch himself. Sam takes this opportunity to try to catch him. She forgets that in that specific hallway, that there was a desk. She accidentally bumps the desk with all the training sticks, and slips on one too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Crap!\" Sam exclaims. Kiba looks up, for sure he has stopped himself, but he's crouched. He tries to stand up, but Sam falls on him. He puts his hands out to stop her from falling, but his hands accidentally cram down her throat. The last thing Kiba sees is Sam's giant mouth engulf his head. Sam's eyes open wide, in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    Kiba yells, but his voice is muffled. Sam is choking on human, the last thing she expected while in this 'cat and mouse' game. Sam puts her hands out, and gets up. She puts her hands on Kiba's hips as fast as she can. He kicks his legs to try to get out, but he's pulled out of her mouth, and dropped on the floor. He sits there in disgust, surprise, and fear. Sam gasps for breath, she looks just as surprised as Kiba. They make eye contact. Kiba starts crawling backwards, trying to get some space between the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Kiba...\" Sam says slowly, putting her paws out in a caring gesture. \"I don't-- I don't know how that happened... but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"What the hell was that?!\" Kiba responds, \"You just-- you almost ate m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"I tripped!\" Sam cuts in. \"I'm sorry!\" She's obviously shaken as well. Kiba looks up at Sam, and he picks himself off the ground. Now he's standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"What- what did you trip on?\" Kiba questions. He tries to wipe off the saliva that covers him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"A-a... training stick.\" She responds shyly. She messed up. \"The same thing you tripped on...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Y-you, well, what would the others think?\" Kiba starts to say. Sam looks to Kiba quickly, now she's listening. \"You practically almost ate me... what do you think Leo would say... Savannah?\" Sam's facial expression and body positioning is now completely different than it was before. It used to be tall and confident, but now she is a little nervous, like a little kid who just did something bad. Her ears flatten against her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Uh- how about we just don't talk about this.\" Sam says after a bit. \"Please don't tell them my mistake... or the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"What makes you say that I won't?\" Kiba pushes on. He sees that he may just get some information because of her almost eating him. \"You swallowed me down to my hips. I feel- violated.\" He puts up an act and looks away slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"I'm -- sorry. Hey, hey!\" She says desperately, Kiba looks back at her. \"I can, tell you. I'll tell you why you're here... and where we are. And what we know but just- don't. Say. Anything!\" She emphasizes 'anything'. Kiba smiles in his head. He's got her in the palm of his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Deal.\" Kiba says, putting down his act. She immediately frowns and realizes that he just played her. \"Now, can you tell be where I can get this-\" Kiba looks at Sam. \"saliva-- off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    \"Sure.\" She uses her paw to wipe off her mouth. \"This way...\" She grits through her teeth. Kiba follows Sam as he looks outside, the sun is up. He grins, now ignoring that he was pretty much eaten. </span></div></div>",

Zee strong and shilent type eh?\" She asked with a smirk, \"Vell, to quote zee old cliche', vee have vays ov making you talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"I already hate where this is going,\"</i> You thought to yourself as she took a few steps back and assumed a fighting stance that you'd never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let's begin your training, Ve'll start vith hand to hand combat. Show me vhy our shcouts shelected you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"I gotta fight her? Aw you've gotta be kidding me!</i> You screamed within the confines of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Becoming impatient you trainer decided that action was required on her part. \"Very vell, you leave me no choice, I vill make zee virst move.\" With that she charged at you with the speed of a track star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You let out a sigh as you get into a boxer's stance, <i>\"This won't end well...\"</i> As she reels her fist back for a punch you duck your head low to avoid the blow, but to your surprise you feel a jolt in you stomach. You look down to find her fist digging into your abdomen. <i>\"She faked a punch so she could counter my reaction?!\"</i> You let yourself drop to the ground but only to rebound up, throwing yourself into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Caught by surprise, she staggers backwards before recovering and standing upright. \"Vell done, an evective counter as von might exshpect vrom a shinobe. Vut this vight has only just begun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She dashed at you yet again but this time she simply attacked rather than feinting. She brought her leg up for a kick, you were fortunate enough to see it coming and get out of the way. But she didn't let you go, she followed up with an uppercut which you used both hands to stop by catching her fist in your palms as it came up. She countered with a second punch from her free fist which you were unable to stop. It connected with your jaw, causing your head to violently snap to the left. You staggered backwards as she came at you for another punch, by then you were back to center and ready for it. Rather than dodge or stop it your grabbed her by the wrist and elbow and using her own momentum you pulled her into your outstretched leg causing her to stumble and fall behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfazed she bounced back up and resumed her stance, \"Vee are getting zah vorkout now,\" She chuckled as she came at you yet again with a flurry of punches. You backpeddaled and dodged as many as you could. Occasionally she would get a near miss or a glancing blow but it wasn't until she backed you into a wall that she got a good hit in. The armor had saved you twice before, but that last punch forced the back of your head to slam into the wall disorienting you and reawakening your enraged headache. Taking advantage of you momentary lapse, your German 'trainer' grabbed you by the arm before judo flipping into the ground behind her. You lay their dazed before you realized that she would probably attack again, and you were right. She was crouching over you with her bent knees on ether side of your rib cages. Raised just above your face was her fist as she prepared to strike you with another damaging blow. You were quicker though, as you tilted your head to the side and listened to her fist slam into the wood floor you tightened your abdomen and coiled your legs. You somehow got your feet underneath her stomach and literally kicked her off of you. As you stood up you found a pair of daggers streaking towards you. Throwing yourself to the right you managed to avoid them, though one of them did clip your shoulder it harmlessly glanced off your armor. You stared back at the woman in disbelief, \"Vhat?\" She asked innocently \"Do you exshpect zee enemy to vight fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This lady's crazy...but she has a point\" You muttered to yourself as she through another pair of daggers at you, you rolled to the side as you found a pair of daggers embedded in the wooden floor where you were before. Your head was starting to pound again, but at this point, that was the least of your worries. A sharp pain in your shoulder grabbed your attention. You glanced over at it to find a ninja star. It'd pierced the armor, but it hadn't gone deep enough to cause any real damage. You look back at you 'trainer' who was now grinning wildly with several stars wedged between her fingers. \"Uh-oh...\" You muttered. As she drew an arm back to throw you jumped to you feet before dashing across the room toward the punching bags. You heard a metallic clinging noise before several stars peppered the ground around your feet. She drew back her other arm as you made it to the bags. You lifted up one of the bags in front of you as she flung the deadly metal shards at you. You felt the bag vibrate slightly as the stars sunk into it. You then charged her using the bag as a shield, <i>\"Probably has more hidden crap that I haven't seen yet,\"</i> you reasoned. As the thought crossed your mind, a sword's point pierced through the bag just under your right armpit. \"Whoa!\" You exclaimed as you released the bag, causing the woman to nearly drop her katana under the weight of the bag. You took this as your opportunity and tackled her to the ground causing her to drop blade and bag. After pinning her you got to your feet and plucked the star from your shoulder pad before assuming a throwing stance, \"I win...\" You quietly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That is a matter ov opinion,\" She replied. You wondered what she was thinking when you heard a click and found a gun in her left hand, trained on you. It was probably the smallest and weakest pistol you'd ever seen, but it could probably do enough damage to put you down. \"I vould say that vis vould be vhat you call a draw. However! You know zat there is no such thing as zee draw in vreal combat! Vut, I vill admit zat you did vhell.\" She then stood up and shook your hand, \"Same time tomorrow?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"This woman isn't crazy, she insane! She's a certifiable psychopath!\"</i> You thought as she shook hands with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before you can leave though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This made hard to see where the hair began and the fur ended. It was entirely possible that its hair was actually just long strands of fur. It's eyes were green with slitted pupils. However, you were only able to see one eyes as the other was covered by strands of fur. The next thing you noticed was the dark purple body glove the cat was wearing. It covered everything but its feet, hands, neck and tail. The final aspect that stood out to you was that <i>it</i> was a she, made obvious by her body shape. The cat glanced down at the man, \"The scent ends here,\" She stated, her voice was quiet with an even tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The man sighed and scratched his head, \"You couldn't just stay in your room could ya?

I've already missed five of my seven daily naps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You weren't sure how to respond to his rant, but you honestly were thinking about your current surroundings more than this guy's personal problems. That cat was easily a foot taller than you, and it was a safe bet that she'd easily overpower you in a fight. And speaking of fights, you were standing next to a psychotic German killing machine (In your opinion at least). You could probably out run her, but not her knives. She'd throw them faster than you'd reach the door; the door which is guarded by an anthro cat and the strange nutcase. You turned to take a step back when the glare of sunlight slipped under your visor and hit your eyes, causing your headache to flare up again. It was then you realized your only way out of this nightmare scenario you've found yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Vhat is going on here?\" You're trainer demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah I guess I should probably tell ya,\" The man shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tell me vhat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You remember that kid that we're keeping here?

I've tracked his scent here which means he's probably in this room,\" She then looked pointedly at you. Her visible eye seeming to pierce through you. In turn, Hilda was also prompted to turn to you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A clap echoed throughout the room, \"Right, everyone's all caught up,\" The man said almost gleefully. He then crossed his arms and leaned against the doorpost, \"So now that that's out of the way, why don't you just come along quietly and calmly hm? You wouldn't want Cleo-\" He paused to jab a thumb at the anthro cat standing next to him, \"-to get upset would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cat, who was apparently named Cleo sighed before approaching you, \"I won't harm you,\" She promised. She wore a gentle smile and began moving towards. Her steps were slow and deliberate, she held her arms outward with her palms turned toward you to show she was unarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You remained tense and on guard, though it was hard to do so with a headache shooting through your head at random intervals. But even in your less than-stellar-state, you were able to sense that something wasn't right... <i>\"They really do seem nice. I don't sense any- Where's the German psychopath?\"</i> It then dawned on you that at some point, they gave a cue to set a trap, and you were standing in the middle of it. <i>\"If they think I'm onto them they'll pounce on me right away... If I wait too long, it won't matter what I do because I'll have been caught anyway...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught between a rock and hard place, eh? So what do you do?

And given that 'Cleo' was approaching you from the front, it was a safe bet that they would try a pincer attack. And you figured while they did that, the strange man you'd met earlier would probably guard the door in case they missed you. You knew at this point that the window was your best bet, but there were two problems. You weren't sure what was on the other side of the window. And even if it wasn't a two hundred foot drop, which it very well could have been. You still had to escape the pincer attack first, and you're odds of that were slim at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hear the floor boards creak behind you an the floor vibrate beneath your feet.

It was narrow, which didn't leave a lot of room for error. You were either going to make it through on you're first try or have a very awkward conversation with the group you just left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Praying that you got you're timing right you jumped as you tucked your limbs in like you were doing a cannon ball into a pool. You shattered the window as before crashing down a fair distance below it onto the dirt, grass and leaves below. You coughed and sputtered is you recovered from the fall knowing it would only be a matter of seconds before they were on top of you again. You stood in place, instinctively clutching your side. Though clad in armor, you knew that you'd hurt something as your ribcage throbbed, making you painfully aware that you were definitely better off before you're fall. You surveyed your surrounding area and found that you were in a forest. There was no telling how far it went on, where the city was in relation to you or what the place you'd just escaped was. Deciding it was best to start moving again you broke into a light jog heading deeper into the forest. You didn't look back or slow down, you just kept running. As you kept your pace, seconds turned into minutes, and minutes turned into hours. The pain in your side became increasingly intense as you continued to run while your headache ebbed on inn the back of your head reminding you that though not as strong as it was before, it was still present. Finally, after what you assumed to be an hour and a half of running you came to a small river and slowed to a stop. You realized that you now had a choice to make. You could follow the river, or cross it. You turned to look at the woods you'd trekked through, you knew you had a head start since they'd have to come down from where you'd jumped the long way before picking up your trail and following it. But you'd been moving slower than they would be which meant your head start wouldn't last long. In addition to that, every second you spent standing still was a second they spent moving. You needed to get moving again, and despite the pain and exhaustion, you did just that. But which way did you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So?

You nearly fall over as the current pushes against your legs but your able to maintain your balance. As you continue to cross the river you find yourself waist deep, you've noticed the pull in the current has also doubled in force. You assume that this is because your at the deepest point of the riverbed and since there's more water here there's more force as well. Still though, you press on. Crossing the river and fighting the current reminds you of when you used to play whirlpool with your friends in your swimming pool when you were younger. It always was a struggle to get it going, and even harder to make it stop without falling. After a few more moments of wading, you find yourself in the shallows on the other side of the river. Your movement becomes increasingly easier as you're able to move more freely now that the water level has dropped to your knees. After a few more seconds of sloshing through the water you find yourself on the muddy riverbank.

You check your surroundings to make sure that you're alone, and as far as you can tell; you are. It's then that you notice the air is rather brisk, and it seems that the water had managed to penetrate your body suit. \"Guess it was just water resistant instead of waterproof,\" You mused. A cool breeze harshly reminded you of the difference, as the damp spots on your suit went from a mild chill to an icy cold sting. You also noticed that your breathing was now labored and you were having a hard time concentrating. <i>\"You'd better find some shelter, I'm not going to make much more progress than you already have,\"</i> a voice in the back of your mind stated. You wanted to keep going, but a jolt of pain from your right ribcage made you think twice. You decided that walking until you found a place to stay the night was the best thing you could do. Tired, injured, cold and wet you continued to trudge on. You looked up at the sky through the treetops, watching as it slowly darkened. You knew that it would only be a couple of hours until night fell, and that was when the shinobe were at there best.</span></div></div>",

You haven't rested since you woke up that morning and you've been moving nonstop since you escaped the place you woke up in. You decided that you were better off just resting in the open rather than continuing on to find decent shelter, which may or may not exist. Even if it did exist, the odds of finding it with only the moonlight to guide you in an unfamiliar environment were pretty much nil. You eventually come across an unusually large tree. Not seeing any better options in the area, you slowly get into a sitting position with your back against the tree and prop yourself up in as comfortable of a position that you can manage. You settle down and get comfortable, initially you have a hard time getting relaxed with the crickets and frogs chirping and croaking. You do you're best to ignore them and begin to drift off into a dreamless sleep. After who knows how long, you suddenly find yourself awake, laying down sideways on the forest floor. Moonlight and dark surroundings indicate that it's late in the night, so you couldn't have been asleep too long. You examine yourself and realize that you're heart is racing, you're hands are trembling and under you're armor you're sweating. <i>\"Why did I wake up?\"</i> You wondered as you transition from a laying to a sitting position. <i>\"Maybe it was a nightmare?\"</i> you speculate. You look around yourself and find that you're still just as alone as you were when you arrived. You spend a few more minutes quietly waiting and listening before deciding that nervousness and paranoia are the blame for you're sudden awakening. Deciding that it's safe to go back to sleep, you lay back and close your eyes once more, letting the silence of the night calm you're mind. Just as you're eyes were closing they shot open once again, <i>\"Why aren't the crickets chirping?</i> you asked yourself as you sat up and looked around yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The more you thought about it the more you realized that nothing was making any noise. A very troubling revelation to you, as it was normally only this quiet in a forest when a predator was lurking around. You slowly stood and put your back against the tree you'd been sleeping under. You looked down at yourself, hoping that the armor you wore had some type of hidden weapon. Fortunately for you, it appeared that for once, your life decided to toss you some good news. Strapped to the outside of each boot you wore, you found daggers. Not that you were a proficient knife fighter, but it was nice to know that you had something you could use to protect yourself if you had to. You stood and waited, minute after minute ticked by but nothing moved or made a sound. Eventually you got fed up with the waiting, \"I know you're there! So why don't you just come out so we can get this over with!\" You shouted into the darkness. The moonlight dully lit the armor you wore as it shined down on you in broken rays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few more moments of silence you heard the clatter of chains. As a few more seconds passed, you could hear footsteps accompanying them. \"It's very rare that somebody notices me before I make my move,\" A masculine voice called out, \"It's a sign that you are very aware of surroundings, I applaud you for that.\" Out of the darkness came an anthro, one you hadn't met before. The first feature that stood out to you were the large pointed ears that nearly stood straight up on his head. He wore a thin leather coat that stopped at his knees and a pair of black pants to match it. Thick leather boots covered his feet and grey fingerless gloves covered his hands. He had a coat of messy brown fur and a mess of scruffy black hair on his head at the base of his ears. Brown eyes sat atop his thin muzzle which housed his fangs. He wasn't much bigger than you, but he was slightly larger, a detail that didn't go unnoticed by either of you it seemed judging by the smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who are you?\" You demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, see that's an interesting question isn't it?\" The jackal replied, \"Because while it is legitimate, it's also one that I could ask you.

You appear to be all alone. Then there's the fact that you're injured... I can tell by the way you're standing. I've never seen an injured shinobe get left behind... all of this means one of two things. You're either a spy for the people I work for who's cover has been blown...\" The jackal then narrowed his eyes and dropped all hints of playfulness from his voice, \"Or you're the human that everyone's been fussing about. And conveniently, the one I was sent to capture.\" You growled outwardly this time and took a step back, \"So, we can do this the sensible way... or the difficult way. Take that anyway you like\" The jackal continued, grinning as he finished his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo will you run or fight?</span></div></div>",

Still though, just for the sake of protocol I'm going to have you put these on.\" The jackal reached into his pocket and pulled out a pair of handcuffs. \"They're specially made just for humans like you, now come 'ere and let's get on with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nodded and started walking towards the jackal with a halfhearted trudge. The jackal waited patiently, his furry tail swishing around behind him. When you got within five feet of him he started to reach out with the handcuffs. You extended you're arms, as if to slip them into the cuffs. Once you were standing just in front of him you jerked your arms over your head before bringing them down and slapping the cuffs out of the jackal's hands and onto the ground. You then hauled back and punched him square in the jaw. He stumbled backwards in shock, but you weren't done yet. You followed up with another punch with you're left fist and fired another one from your right. You would've hit him again if he hadn't tripped and fallen. The jackal touched a hand to his lower lip and looked at it in shock as he found blood on his fingertips. He then looked at you with disdain, prompting you to shrug, \"Did you really think it'd be that easy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The jackal chuckled, \"Did you?\" He asked as his tail swept against you're legs and knocked you down. You tried to get up as fast as you could but the jackal was quicker. He grabbed you by the edges of the chest plate before hoisting you to your feet and tossing you across the ground. You rolled until your side slammed into a tree, thankfully it wasn't the injured side. Again, you tried to get up as you rolled onto your stomach and got you're hands and knees under you. Before you could get to your feet you felt a crushing pressure on you're back that forced you onto your stomach. \"This could have been avoided you know,\" The jackal snarled as he grabbed you by the collar of the back plate and lifted you onto your feet. He went to punch you, but somewhere in the blur of motion, you managed to stop that punch with both of your arms. However, the jackal simply uses his freehand to backhand you across the face and send you staggering backwards. The armor along your jaw took the brunt of the blow, but the pain that came after the initial blow was still there. You managed to get your feet back under you and you're balance stabilized before you went too far backwards. But you'd lost sight of the jackal. Before you knew it you felt a spine shattering pain in your back which threw your body forward. You didn't even get a chance to hit the ground before you felt another strike hit your right side. You were sent crashing into a tree that happened to be nearby. You tried to orient yourself and catch your breath, but find yourself unable to do either as vice like force clamps down around your throat and your back was forced against the tree you'd just been knocked into. Your vision clears enough to see the jackal glaring at you with a hand clearly clamped around you're throat. You're already empty lungs were screaming for oxygen, your left ribcage felt as though there were a hole ripped in it and your neck felt as though it was being sawed off. The jackal wasn't finished with you yet though, he applied even more pressure to your throat and lifted you so that your feet were no longer touching the ground. \"But you had to go and make me angry, to be honest... I'm supposed to take you alive. But I'm starting to have second thoughts about that!\" He shouted. You began desperately bending your knees, trying to bring one of you're hidden daggers within arm's reach before you lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Come on! Come one!</i> You mentally shouted as your fingers writhed and flexed to reach the hilt of at least one of the blades. To the jackal, it just seemed like spastic jolts, but to you... those jolts meant the difference between life and death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Struggle all you like!\" The jackal shouted, \"But nothing's going to change! You- will die here! Cold and alone! I- will deliver you're body and collect my bounty, and NOBODY- will know what happened here tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You continued to strain and reach for you're blades until finally, you're effort was rewarded, <i>\"Got it!\"</i> You screamed within the confines of you mind as you slashed at the jackal's arm. He howled in pain before falling backwards and holding his arm. You choked and gasped as you backed away from the anthro. \"Too close...\" You wheezed to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The jackal looked down at his arm as he slowly removed his now bloodied hand. A long and clean cut ran through his jacket sleeve. He then looked at you with an expression that screamed 'rage'. He stood up and began walking towards you. You got to your feet and attempted another slash with your blade. But having already seen that trick once before, the jackal caught your right arm in mid swing. He then applied pressure to your arm until you could no longer grasp your dagger. It fell from you're hand making a muffled thud as it hit the ground. He then slung you by the arm and tossed you into a nearby log. You drew your second dagger in your left hand just as he reached you. You slashed at him but he stopped short of the daggers edge before grabbing your left wrist and smashing it against the log causing you to drop your other dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Snarling at you with his blood stained teeth from your first attack he extended the claws on his free hand, \"Now then, this is the end for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Random memories from your life flashed through your mind. The memories were like fragments of shattered glass falling all around you. Each glimpsing into a moment of your past. Happiness, sorrow, pain, regret, love and hate blurred together in a montage of your most memorable moments, all leading up to where you were now. Time seemed to slow as the jackal released your shoulder and shifted his grip to pin you down by your throat. <i>\"So this is it huh? I gave my best, and in the end it was only good enough to buy myself an extra minute or two... how pitiful...</i> Somewhere in the back of your mind you hear a faint voice, <i>\"If you gave your best then there's nothing to regret... right?\"</i> You smile to yourself as a small chuckle escapes you, \"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The jackal then thrusts his other hand toward you're chest. You know the armor won't stand up to an attack like that. So you close you're eyes and wait to be put to death. But the sharp pain never came. You open your eyes to find the jackal's claws, poised and ready to strike. But they are unable to do so as a thick, black and rubbery rope is laced around his wrist like a lasso. You look to the source of the rope to find an actual shinobe standing with the rope firmly grasped in its (Again, hard for you to make the gender out) hands, effectively preventing the jackal from killing you. The jackal briefly turns to cut the rope from his wrist. But as he does this he's knocked to the ground by a blur of motion. You slump over on your side now that you're free from the jackal's grasp. You look toward the direction that the jackal had been thrown in and find Cleo; the cat from earlier, standing between you and the jackal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really? Killing innocent humans?\" She demanded, \"I thought you were better than that Ray...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cleo, in my way as always,\" The jackal growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you even know why you were sent for this human?\" Cleo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I may have been a little curious before he hit me, but I don't really care anymore. I'm only interested in vengeance and retribution against that,\" Ray spat as he jabbed a finger at you accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What has he done to deserve your rage?\" Cleo demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray scoffed, \"He sliced a hole in my arm and knocked my fangs out of alignment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No doubt right after you tried to rip a hole in him and <i>beat</i> his bones out of alignment,\" Cleo countered. Ray fumed silently at her retort, \"You can always dish it, but you're the first to call for beheadings when someone retaliates against you, you haven't changed at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And you, always getting in my way and acting all self righteous! How you and Terra are related will always be beyond me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watched as the two anthros went back and forth. You tried to keep yourself awake, but you were exhausted and heavily injured. You faded in and out of consciousness, only hanging by a thread in the conscious realm. Time seems to start running together when you find Ray standing over you maliciously. But as he reaches out for you he's kicked to the side as Cleo attacks him. The two fight and move out of you're range of vision. You can hear the fighting, but you lack the energy to track and observe it. You start to fade from consciousness but manage to open your eyes once more. You find yourself being helped along by a shinobe and the man who was with you when you first woke up. Each had draped one of your arms over their shoulders and were currently dragging you through the river. As they crossed the river you hear a series of splashes. Looking to you're right, you find Ray dashing through the river and coming right for you. Cleo cuts him off however, and dashes between you're small group and the menacing predator. Forcing him to engage her in combat, she buys your group the time it needs to get out of the river and into the woods again. This is as much as you're able to see before you start to black out again. You're vision brightens and starts to clear again as you find yourself being dragged through hallways with hardwood floors and wood paneling. Again though, you are unable to keep you're eyes open for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You see images of Ray attacking you while you run through the forest alone and in the dark. You run for as long as you can but find a large waterfall blacks you from going any further as Ray approaches you from behind. You try to run but find your ankles have literally been chained to the ground by shackles. You pull, twist and yank yourself in every conceivable direction as you desperately struggle to get loose. He grinned maniacally as he extended his claws and walked toward you at an unsettlingly slow pace. It was then that you shot straight up in bed and found your breathing to be heavy and your body riddled with bruises and scrapes. You groan and lay back in your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I hate mornings too, but even I don't think getting up is <i>that</i> bad.\" You're eyes shot open as you glared across the room at the man who seemed to keep reappearing in your life whether you wanted him to or not. \"I get the vibe that we've been here before, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sigh and place a hand over you're eyes as if keeping you're eyelids covered would allow you to go back to sleep, \"I feel like I've been hit by a train and thrown into a river....\" You groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mondays, am I right?\" The man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You removed you're from your eyes and just glowered at the man, \"Could you please just, like, shut up... for five minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The man sighed, \"You know that was pretty rude. I saved you from a psychopath last night ya know. You should at least show me a little gratitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No,\" You reply, \"Cleo saved me from a psychopath, <i>you helped</i> drag me back to safety because you were told to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The man scratched his head, \"Well... that's another version of the story... But to be honest, Cleo's fighting is decent but she lacks form and discipline. When we had first dragged you out of there I had to go back and help her. She was fighting gallantly, but I knew she had bitten off more than she could chew in taking that guy on. I ordered the shinobe that you'd first seen to keep moving no matter what happened to me. And I went back for Cleo. She was so glad to see me come back to help her that she took her eyes off of that jackal and he knocked down. He would've dealt the finishing blow if I hadn't gone back to stop him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really? Is that how you remember it?\" A cool feminine voice asked from just outside the doorway. Cleo then walked in with her hand on her hip and a raised eyebrow as she stared down at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, hey Cleo! You should've knocked or somethin'! I would've told my story a bit differently!\" The man laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Which part? The one where you saved my life? Or the part where I was glad to see you?\" Cleo questioned as she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ouch,\" The man replied, \"You know I have feelings too. That really hurt. I can't believe that you would wound me so deeply over a couple of minor inconsistencies. But, that's okay, I forgive you.\" He then yawned, \"All of this reconciliation is taking a lot out of me. I'm gonna go sleep it off for an hour or three... later!\" And with that he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cleo stopped talking but her expression remained neutral, she was neither surprised nor was she bothered by the sudden accusation, \"And I noticed that you also sidestepped my comment about knowing him.\" A long silence passed between the two of you as you simply just stared at one another. \"If you don't tell me what's going on, I'll leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cleo scoffed at you're threat, \"You say that like you can make good on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And you act like it hasn't already happened once before,\" You countered. Cleo winced at your sharp comeback knowing full well that it was true, \"I have no reason to stay here and I won't until I know what it is you people want from me.\" Cleo huffed and turned away from you, \"You can't watch me twenty four seven. Sooner or later someone will fall asleep on the job, make a mistake, or leave a door open and I'll disappear. I'm guessing you don't want that, given how quickly you scrambled a team after me and how hard you fought to protect me.

Which also leads me to wonder why there's a group of trained shinobe living in the woods, and why they're made up of both species?\" You looked into the hallway before continuing, \"I mean, forming and training a community of ninjas isn't something you decide to do just because you're bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We did it to end the prejudice,\" Cleo stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A noble but vague response,\" You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The humans and anthros here didn't just become friends overnight,\" The cat admitted, \"It took years for some of them to stop judging and hating one another.

Theoretically, if you could get humans and anthros to get along on a small scale, you could also do it on a large scale. However, there are certain anthro officials and human groups that would hinder our efforts. And as if that weren't problematic enough, the humans that live here refuse to trust anthros outside of this compound. But we couldn't ask them to return to a prejudice world either. So we trained as shinobe, we take what we need from those who have it in abundance as quietly and quickly as we can. It's been our way of life from a few years now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" You replied. \"It sounds like you're caught between a rock and a hard place.

Me?\" You asked, \"What good am I to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You harbor no animosity or prejudice. You don't hate anthros and you're a human. Humans can accept you and you have no reservations about talking with an anthro,\" Cleo explained. Our plan is a bit drastic, but using the shinobe we have, we plan to kidnap the anthros who hold authority in the surrounding cities. After that, the rest will be up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And what do you expect me to do?\" You asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"After we bring them here we expect you to do what you're doing right now; talk to an anthro. Show them that humans aren't their enemy. But prove to them that they are not the vermin that some believe them to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shook you're head, \"You're asking me to represent my entire race.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I'm asking you to change the future of both of our races,\" Cleo countered. \"If things are aloud to continue, a war will eventually break out. A war that will result in the genocide of one, if not both species. Human children grow up being taught that anthros are powerful and vicious monsters who stole the world from humankind. Anthros grow up being taught that they were cursed and enslaved by humanity until they fought back. This cycle will continue unless you break it. Right now, you are the only human in existence that is untainted by the dark past that humans and anthros have woven. I need you to do this... please...\"</span></div></div>",

He sat a top of a eight foot tall armored, mechanical humanoid which lay face up and lifeless on the ground. The armor on its chest, upper arms and face had opened to reveal the innards of the metallic warrior to reveal that it needed a wearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll be here any minute!\" Terra warned as she helped Kiba drag a large metal beam towards the door. With some difficulty, the two managed to affix the beam across the door to act as an oversized deadbolt lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working as fast as I can!\" Neil called as he ran to the side of the machine's head and closed a panel before moving around to its side to plug an oversized black extension cord into its arm. He then ran to a computer that the extension cord was attached to and began furiously typing and punching in keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Terra watched with anticipation until they heard a loud thud at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're out of time,\" Kiba announced, his tone was grave and his expression stoic. Terra nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Neil asked, \"I'm still not ready yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll buy as much time for you as we can,\" Terra replied, \"But, I doubt it'll be anything significant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of what happens here, we did our job,\" Kiba stated, \"The hideout was evacuated with three of the four units. This is about finding ourselves an opening to get out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Kiba finished his sentence, two German shepherd anthros came busting through the door. Kiba was the first to react, throwing a hammer as hard as he could at the first officer. The head of the hammer thudded against the canines chest. He gave an audible help and whine before clutching his chest and growling at Kiba. Terra followed up with a wrist mounted slingshot, firing a showere of rocks and ceramic chips from it. While it did slow the officers it did little to stop them. Terra the switched tactics and picked up a metal rod laying nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Leaping into the air she brought the pole down on the officer closest to her. He easily blocked the overhead attack with one arm and reached out to grab Terra with the other. Unable to dodge in the air, Terra founder herself suspended by the hood of her hoodie. This was a mistake on the part of the officer however as his prey still held onto her makeshift staff. Taking the staff, Terra smashed it against the side of the shepherd's face. He howled in agony as he dropped the human and clamped his hands over his face. Taking the opening, Terra struck him again under his chin and twirled the rod around herself as though it were a propeller that she controlled with the accuracy of ballerina. She struck the Shepherd again and again, each time in a different place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Terra occupied the officer in front of her, Kira kept the other one busy with his own methods. Though he wasn't as agile as Terra, he was still far more talented than the average human. He disappeared into the shadows of the building, prompting the officer to follow him. As the officer adjusted to the dark and found his target, Kira shined a flashlight directly into his eyes. The canine whimpered and covered his eyes allowing Kiba to rush in and whack him in the snout with the steel flashlight casing. As the Canine clutched his nose Kiba ran behind him and limbed a file cabinet, using it as a stepping stone to throw himself onto his attackers back. Mustering all the strength he could, Kiba put the the officer into a chokehold. It took all of his strength to hold his grip. The attack was effective, but short lived as he was ripped from the officer's back and tossed to the cold stone ground. Shaking the dizziness from his head, he found that Terra now stood next to him, brandishing her rod defensively against not one, but two officers. Tired and slightly battered, the two humans realized that they had done all they could. The three anthros closed in on them, but suddenly stopped when a whirring noise was her followed by a high pitched whine, almost like a jet engine. Eventually the noise died down to a faint hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?\" Neil's voice echoed as if through a loudspeaker. A large silhouette rose above Kira and Terra, heavy footsteps were heard as the figure moved past them to reveal a large mechanical humanoid with a yellow visor over where it's eyes would be and a metal faceplate covering its mouth. It wore a helmet that was swept back in a tear drop design while the rest of its armor was rounded and sleek looking to match. It was painted a matte grey and stood at a level height with the officers. On its back it wor a sleek, metallic backpack which had several vent slots running along its sides and top. On the back of the pack the Number '01' was printed in white and above the numbering were the words 'Silent Echo'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So?\" Neil asked as he pounded one metallic fist into the palm of his other hand in front of his chest, \"Who wants some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blow knocked the canine clean off his feet and landed him flat on his back. \"Next?\" Neil chimed as he faced the remaining two officers.  Both of the drew their sidearms in response and fired a few warning shots which harmlessly glanced off of the armor. Neil moved forward quicker than either of then could react smashing into the first officer with a shoulder ram.

Neil turned to face the dazed officer and using the thrusters he launched himself into the air and literally body slammed the weakened anthro before standing up and heading for the back door.  \"I'm done here, but the the next faze of the war is just beginning...\"</span></div></div>",

Keep the interactive somewhat clean. Oral vore is allowed, like Metra said, but not all ze time, got it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one here will descriminate against you for your sexuality , whatever it may be. But the main character is always straight. Ok? <br>\r\n'Do other people/anthros have to be straight?\" No, their relations are up to the writer. But make it somewhat discreet, or, like, whatever. Just write it good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this storyline, the main character will say and do things. But the way they look and how they say things are up to the perception of the READER. The environment and characters around him/her will not change. This means, the character shall not be given a physical description or background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe standard  is 5 ft 8 in tall. And, well, just assuming they are smart enough to co-create an airplane, just assume the main character is somewhat more intelligent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and you get to pick your gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, here's the opening scene's description.<br>\r\nYou meet your friend, (make up a name, this guy is not important to the story, but will act as a memory/reminder of your home), and you two talk about how great the success of this new aircraft will be. Given, you and he, are long time friends, (insert name here) lets you ride in the aircraft first. The environment in this first scene is up to the reader's choice, whoever is first, but the next chapter will be that the main character has been teleported into the new world. The park, city square, just has to be in a town. After that, its reader's choice of whatever there on out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main character will not have a mentioned name, but they may gain a nickname. A NICKNAME. Not a real name. Like,  Jake, is the short of Jacob, but that's a cut name, which is NOT a nickname. 'The Runner' or something like a single letter works. If it works with the gender, that makes it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake sure when you're adding a chapter, proofread it, and make sure there aren't too many biased decisions. Also, try to use choices that relate to actions the main character may have to choose.<br>\r\nlike, Run through the door*  or Keep running down the hall*<br>\r\nDon't make other people do things in the choices, let the other characters in the story act, in the WRITING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! And don't think about the person's age, lets just always assume they're -always old enough-.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery scene, setting, anthros, and choices are first come first serve. But give the next writer some really decent choices and try not to bend the dang story into a gritty reality. Like, 'You're running through the alleyway and the anthros are behind you, there is a ladder just in reach to your left and to your right are some really big cans that look inconspicuously great to hide in. What will you choose? You may get caught either way.\" Then a choice is picked*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you can write good and make many a paragraph, THEN can you make some slightly bigger choices and story details.</span></div></div>",

A very relative feeling, as you and your friend both lived and worked in this area for a long time. You two have a mutual friendship and respect for each other's opinion on this new aircraft you two have co-created. You feel the air whip around your body as you close your eyes. The sun pierces through every crack in the field of miscellaneous flowers. You open your eyes and avoid direct contact with the sun as you soak it up. You glance over to the small building that was the control station. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan is to test the aircraft. You, your friend, and a retired pilot are all in to test this new aircraft. You and your friend get forty-eight percent each, while the pilot who risks their life will get one percent of stock profits, whilst the last one percent will go to donations and taxes. Aircraft business is a very profiting business, therefore the large gap between stocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are the smarter of the two, you and him. Ever since high-school you both realized that you'd be doing a lot of the equations, while he'd be putting together the architecture of the plane.

Almost as if it was an illusion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     No. You can still feel the flames of the fire, the feeling of smoke in your lungs, and the shaking of everyone near you. The sounds of the sirens are outside, the door door being kicked in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It was too late. You couldn't hold on. You simply started to...slip away. Slip away into the dark abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hey, ______, do you think we could come over to your place? We haven't been over in ages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah! We have Friday off this week, and no one has to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      A second voice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sure, let me get their permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     A third...wait, isn't that...your voice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I don't see them saying no, as long as we don't trash the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Another one? Their voice sounds very familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"We won't do that. Have some faith ________.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Yet another person. This one is familiar but...not quite right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, they said it was ok to use the house for our little get together. As long as we don't burn down the house or empty the fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Relax, everything will be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The voices stop. Who were they? All the voices were familiar, but they sounded echo-like, and hard to make out what they were really talking about. Do you know them? Are they important?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes. You will do nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As if all the voices weren't enough, now there's another one. But this one feels...frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"This is the human I've been searching for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes, this specimen will give me the keys to complete-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"The voice abruptly cuts off.

Their voice, whoever it is, is in trouble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"______! _______ help! Th-they're going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     What's wrong? What's going on?

Why can't-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"They're trapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You weakly open your eyes. That's when you feel yourself plummeting. The wind whips your arms and legs. Ahead however, is something you haven't seen before. A massive silver-colored creature floats down with you. It's shape...indescribable due to its body morphing constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"All of them are going to be trapped. Can you save them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Wait! Those voices...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Tell me, who are you?\" the creature asks, \"What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your name? That's simple. Your name is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <b>This person is desired for greatness. Whos survival will determine the fate of their siblings and  friends. Tell me reader, which unlikely person will be tasked with his family and friend's fates, and perhaps the fates of many others they have not even met yet? Be warned, the world this person is about to enter may not be the most forgiving, and due to action or inaction, the lives of the five may be forever lost.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <b>Terrance McCario</b> - Terrance \"Terry\" McCario, 6'2\" age 19, the youngest within his friends and family. Terry lives with his older brother, Vincent McCario , his adoptive sister, Clair McCario , and hangs out with his two best friends, Jess and Antonio Tremont . Terry, while the youngest within his siblings and friends, has just graduated from his high school, a whole two years later than everyone else in his class range. Due to him being older than everyone in his peer range, a lot of ridicule was thrown at him all through his life, starting from second grade. While this ridicule has left an affect on his trust in others, he is the most intelligent,  practical, level-headed, and loyal. He is also very kind toward others, helping anyone who has given up in their life with a smile and heartwarming personality.<br>\r\n     The few issues that Terry has, aside from his trouble to trust many others is his weight, resentment, and guilt. Terry is 30 pounds over what is 'acceptable.' While Terry can not run fast, he can run for a long time. While simple ridicule and taunts Terry has learned to ignore, the effect from when he was in school has built a fierce rage deep within him. When Terry was 14, he was beaten up by a thug who was trying to rob Clair. When Terry was stabbed, he flew into a rage befitting a berserker, and killed the thug by ripping the knife from his stomach and repeatedly stabbing the thug. Terry was then kept a close eye on for a year, in which nothing serious happened while he came to the realization that he killed someone. Terry will do anything to protect the ones he cherishes. Anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <b>Vincent McCario</b> - Vincent \"Vince\" McCario, 5'5\" age 21, the middle child between Terrance and Clair. Vince is the most average person in the group, but in school he was one of the best track members on his high school team, as well as the only person who took Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, ans Korean AP courses and passed with some of the highest scores in his age range. His relationship with Terry and Clair is a mixed one. Terry was the student that can do anything he could set his mind to, Clair was the student that could get good grades and is currently in the process of enrolling in the military, Vincent was the one who was in the circumstance as a translator for the government, an awkward position to talk about with his siblings. Due to this, he has not talked with either of them for a while and is beginning to distance himself from them.<br>\r\n     While Vincent is a rather plain man, his biggest faults lie with his indecision. When faced with the decision of cereal or oatmeal, it can take up to 10 minutes for him to decide on what he wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <b>Clair McCario</b> Clair \"Cara\" McCario, 5'11\" age 23, the oldest of the group. Cara enjoys protecting people and guns. She was currently attempting to get into the military and become a protector of the people. Her inspiration to do this is because of the traumatic incident with the thug and Terry. She blamed herself for nearly getting Terry killed and swore that she would never let that happen to him, or anyone while she was around. In school, she is decent, getting nice grades, but when she was scouted for the military she believed this was her brake. She could finally join the military and protect those she cared about.<br>\r\n     Unfortunately Clair is single-minded. While not necessarily bad, she tends to ignore or miss little items in her pursuit of her goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <b>Jessica Tremont</b> Jessica \"Jess\" Tremont, 5'6\" age 20. Jess is what many would call a bimbo, a person with an intellect comparable to dish-soap, while her figure looks like it should be in a magizine for...'reasons.' Despite what many believe, she is a hard worker, with a rational mind. In the group, she has the most practical advice. She first met Terry in high school, and feeling sorry for him, started dating him. While they eventually broke up, due to their feelings of wanting to be very good friends with each other, they stayed together all through high school.<br>\r\n     Of all the claims thrown at her, she can not deny that her academic record is not the best. She can only be called a sub-average student, unless it comes to anything construction based. She is also very cold at times with dry humor at the worst of times. Regardless, she loves her brother, and has a massive crush on Vincent McCario, one she is not sure how to express.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <b>Antonio Tremont</b> Antonio \"Tony\" Tremont, 5'7\" age 20. Tony is what many call the \"Social Expert.\" He can talk, and talk, and talk. He is the only one within the group that has not finished high school, but is working as a chef. While not a bad student before he dropped out, Tony has little motivation to do anything outside talking and cooking.</span></div></div>",
