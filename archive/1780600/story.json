            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a fine day in Ponyville, birds were chirping, the weather Pegasi were kicking clouds, and our faithful unicorn Twilight Sparkle was currently reading a spellbook titled Gain and Lose: Weight based spells for unicorns. recently Twilight had noticed a bit of extra fat on her stomach after Spike had told her about it, and then proceeded to giggle and make jokes as someone his age would. Wanting to keep herself in fit shape for a number of reasons, she consulted to a spell book she found the next day to help rid herself of the minor problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, density increase, growth spell, weight transfer...ah here we go instant weight loss.\" the purplish gray pony murmured as she read the details of the printed text. \"This spell when done correctly can rid the standard unicorn of up to 50 pounds of weight be it fat or muscle, it is very important that concentration is kept constant during the casting or spell could backfire. ...Backfire?\" Twilight wondered, putting her left hoof to her chin wondering what that could mean. Seeing that taking the time to come up with what that could mean would be pointless, she shrugged her shoulders and began to charge up the spell. As her horn glowed Twilight could begin to slowly feel the pounds receding away into nothingness. Suddenly, as she had just lost 6 pounds the door to the library, her esteemed abode, swung open abruptly. \"Hey Twilight you'll never believe what just happened!\" Shouting this was the mare's number one assistant Spike, who was earlier out and about in Ponyville and had returned to his friend to give her some surprising news. \"Gaah!\" Twilight yelped as she was shocked by the abrupt interruption. The magic that had been built up in her horn was let loose, blasting her with the energy inside it and sending her into the bookcase, sending a number of books piling on top of her. \"Twilight! Are you okay?\" Spike worried if the pony was okay, ran up to the pile of books to help her up. \"Ugghh..\" Twilight moaned as she laid under the mound of literature. As Spike reached out with his hand to grab her, he was suddenly knocked back by a glob of...fat? \"Wahaa!\" Spike screamed as he was pushed to the ground by this...thing, looking up he saw all the books were off of the mare and that also....the bit of fat she had, now had gained some friends...a lot of friends. \"Tw-Twilight?\" Spike said bewildered by her new state of being. \"Ughh Spike I told you before to KNOCK before you enter, you know what can happen when a spell back...fires?\" Twilight said as she trailed off now noticing a large mound of purple fur at the bottom of her sight. \"Wha-what the?\" she said aghast at the new, much larger layer of flab she now held on her body, frantically putting her hooves to her body she could feel a second chin and her barrel laid out from her body by a good 12 inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph hahaha AHAHAHAHAHA!!\" Spike laughed as he took pleasure at the sight of Twilight now weighing somewhere around a good 230lbs, she was very clearly obese, and to Spike...hilarious.  \"Spike! This is serious, now I've got even more fat then before!\" Twilight yelled as she waved her hooves in dismay, making her new rolls wobble and jiggle about. Holding in a laugh Spike responded, \"Hmmph D-don't worry Twilight you can just get rid of that stuff by doing the spell again.\" \"Oh my gosh, you're right, ok now page 413 ahhh...\" Twilight then noticed a small notice warning at the bottom of the page she had not seen before. <b> Warning: If a spell is done wrong, they cannot be redone by any other spells in this book, they must be handled by either normal physical work to the body, potions listed in page 568, or a team of powerful unicorns. </b> \"Wow, that's an oddly inconvenient warning label...\" Spike said lamenting on the detail.  \"Physical work?! Oh that'll take forever! I'll be the laughing stock of Ponyville before I'm back to my thin self!\" Twilight panicked as she imagined herself being taunted by her friends and peers.  \"Look at Twilight! She's such a blob!\" one pony said, \"Eww so unrefined, I'm sorry Twilight, but I cannot be seen with such a...fatty, goodbye.\" fantasy Rarity said to the now 800lb blob known as Twilight Sparkle. \"You've scared my animals Twilight, You ruined my techniques, You take up too much space for my parties, You get in the way of my applebuckin' '\" the rest of Twilight's friends said to her in disgust and shame. As Twilight spazzed and babbled in her state of panic, Spike interrupted it to reconcile her. \"Aw, come on Twilight, you know they'd never treat you like that.\" he said putting his claw to her belly, trying to comfort her. Taking some deep breathes, Twilight resumed her methodical thinking...until Spike belched up a letter from Princess Celestia. \"A letter?\" Spike questioned. Clearing up his throat, Spike began to read the parchment to the purple pony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ahem, Dear my dearest and most faithful student Twilight Sparkle, I am glad to announce that I will be coming to Ponyville in 3 months to check up on your progress in the study of Friendship, please be in your best shape when that time comes. Princess Celestia.\" \"Oh nonononono!\" Twilight babbled as she panicked yet again, realizing that the 200+ pound pony she was now was not <i> best shape material</i> \"Spike, we need to fix this immediately!\" \"Uhh how?\" the dragon asked, bewildered by the demand. \"Hmm uhh well I don't now yet, but let's get something to eat first, I'm starving.\"  \"Starving? But Twilight, you just ate an hour ago.\"  Spike said, putting his hands to his hips. \"I know..but I suddenly feel really empty now.\" In retort Spike whispered to himself \"Don't know why, you're gut's big enough to hold a pony in it...\" \"What was that Spike?\" Twilight said rasing her brow in suspicious manner, just barely hearing the baby dragon murmur to himself. \"Ohho nothing, now come on, there's plenty of food to get at the market.\" Twilight's eyes opened up like saucers upon hearing this. \"What?! I'm not going there!\" Twilight said crossing shaking her hooves about. \"Uhh but Twilight, that's where we buy food...\" \"Ehh I know that..but....<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I don't want to be seen like this yet.</font>\" Twilight whispered, putting her  hooves to chins in fear. \"Oh come on Twilight its...not too bad.\" Spike said eying the mare's mounds of fat on her body,poking with a claw, watching it sink inward into the flesh. \"I'm sorry Spike ,just go and get some food for me, and make sure it's a lot I'm really hungry!\" Twilight pleaded,  smiling daintily. \"Okay fine, just try not to eat the library while I'm gone, Haha!\" Spike said as he ran out to the market. \"Ughh Spike!\" Twilight yelled as the dragon chuckled to himself at his remark. \"Oh well... guess all I can do now is wait...\" she said as she pushed her hooves into her girth, noting that it at the least felt good to be fat if nothing else. \"*Sigh* this is going to be a long day.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Outside Spike was still chuckling to himself about the little joke he had made to his friend's new girth. \"Hehe, ah Spike you still got it.\" Then Spike realized he hadn't brought any bits with him and made a quick trip back to the library to fetch a large bag of bits the two kept usually for emergencies, well in Twilight's current state and odd hunger this was an emergency to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what would Twilight like...\" He said eying the various stands and carts of food surrounding him.  \"Hmm she'll probably eat anything I give her... I wonder why she's so hungry anyway, maybe that spell had something to do with it...\" Said as he made his way to a carrot stand. \"Hi Carrot Top, how are the carrots today?\" Spike greeted to the orange maned pony, gripping onto the edge of the cart. \"Oh hi Spike, carrots are doing fine, in fact they've been growing very well these pasts few days. What'cha doing here today?\" the mare said wiping some dust off the cart with a rag. \"Oh...just getting food for Twilight.\" \"Care to buy some carrots?\" Carrot Top said smiling cheerfully. \"Sure...\" Spike squinted his eyes to think of how much he should buy. \"Hmm gimme 20 carrots please.  \"20 carrots?! That's quite a lot, what do you two need all these carrots for?\" Carrot said handing the dragon a bundle of carrots. \"Emm its....complicated, thanks for the carrots Carrot Top!\" Spike said handing the correct amount of bits to the pony. \"Alright see ya later Spike!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Spike had bought 10 daffodil sandwiches and 30 turnips, with about 200 bits left out of the 500 he started with. Thinking to himself that he had gotten more than enough to satisfy Twilight and even feed himself, that was until he smelled an amazing aroma coming from Sugarcube Corner. \"Mmmh what's that smell?\" Spike said licking his lips, as the smell began to carry him through the air into the bakery. He then bumped into the body of the hyper pony Pinkie Pie, \"Ahh! oh hey Pinkie.\" Spike said rubbing his head after hitting her. Being the cheery, happy pony she was Pinkie Pie, she giggled at the humorous event and greeted her friend. \"*giggle* Hi Spike! Oh what'cha dong with all those goodies?\" She said peering behind him at the bags he was holding. \"Are you having a party, cause I love parties! I mean you got dancing and games and music and food. Who couldn't like that?!\" Pinkie Pie said once again talking up a storm from almost nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, actually this stuff is for Twilight.\" Hearing this Pinkie became slightly confused, \"Twilight? what does she need all this stuff for? Is she saving up for winter?\" Pinkie said despite them being in the middle of summer.  \"Well no, she's...hungry.\" Spike said, weary of revealing Twilight's current status. \"Hungry? But didn't you two just eat an hour ago?\" Surprised by this, Spike replied, \"How did you?...ergh never mind, she's just really hungry.\" \"Okie dokie lokie!\" Pinkie whimsically replied back, then she remembered something. \"Oh what did you come in here for anyway?\" \"Oh uhh...I smelled something delicious in here...\" Spike said, sniffing the air with his snout. \"Ohhhhh well are ya gonna buy something Spike?\" Pinkie said bouncing giddily. \"Ummm sure...\" Spike then peered into the glass counter, taking a look at the various decorated and all delicious pastries. \"Hmmm...\" shifting his sight over each item, with Pinkie Pie doing the same, he then came across something that dazzled him. \"Oooohhhh what about <i>that</i>?!\" Spike clamored, drooling at the sight of what he found.  Pinkie put her face up to it and smiled brightly. \"Oooohhhh triple chocolate fudge caaake.\" Pinkie said mesmerized by the wondrous design and texture of the cake she remembered help bake a few days ago.  \"H-how much is?!\" Spike screamed, desperate to have this delicacy made of the best chocolate ever, and the fudge ever, and the best dough ever. \"That cake is...\" Pinkie put her hoof to her chin to try and remember the price they put on it. \"...Uhh oh! 100 bits!\" \"100 bits?! b-b-but that's almost all of the money I've got left from our stash! \"Aww sorry Spike but this here cake is one of our best, gotta charge high for my favorite!\" \"But, isn't <i>everything </i> your favorite?\" Spike said, confused by the pony's statement. \"Well yeah, but this is my super duper bestest best favorite!\" Pinkie cheered, bouncing around Spike. Thinking for a bit, Spike knew he had to keep some money left in case of an actual emergency, and not just because of Twilight being paranoid, but then that cake.... It looked so good, and smelled even better, it's taste had to be absolutely incredible for it to cost 100 bits.  After racking his brain for a few more seconds he had decided to buy the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh....alright I'll buy it, please just take the money before I decide to change my mind.\" Spike winced as he handed over the money, hoping Twilight would be too enthralled by the food to realize their emergency budget had been reduced to a fifth of it's original amount. \"Oh boy! I hope Twilight loves this cake as much as I do. Ohhh oh oh! I got an idea, let me come with you Spike! I can deliver the cake to her personally!\" the pink mare said clopping her hooves together in excitement. Spike cringed upon hearing this, \"Uhhh I don't know she's uhh busy studying\" \"Ohh come on, it'll just be a little visit, I won't be long.\" Spike was now getting worried, he knew Twilight was quite...spazzy about her weight currently, and she didn't seem likely to let anypony know just yet what happened to her. Uhh umm well...alright.\" Spike just couldn't come up with a good excuse, besides, better Pinkie to be the first to see Twi, then anypony else. \"Woohoo! Alright! let's go!\" Pinkie said, balancing the cake box on her head, running out of the bakery along with Spike.  After calming her down, well as best as you could calm down Pinkie Pie, the two had stopped running. Along the way Pinkie asked something that was still bugging her. \"Hey, Spike?\" \"Yeah?\" he asked back to the mare. \" Do you really think Twilight will need all that food, I mean she's been hungry before, but not enough to eat 20 carrots, 30 turnips, 10 daffodil sandwiches and a whole cake.\" Pinkie wondered, tilting her head. Spike, thinking that it was no use being so secretive, considering she'd find out soon enough, decided to be a little more truthful. \"Well...something happened to her...\" Spike said, but then he was interrupted by Pinkie Pie. \"*gasp*! Oh no, is she sick, did she break something? Did she touch Poison Joke again!?\" \"No!...no, she...ehhh, you'll see when we get there.\" Spike said,twiddling his claws together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two had gotten to the door of the library they heard a gigantic belch come from inside. \"BBBBBUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hearing this shocked even Pinkie into silence. \"What was <i>that</i>?!\" Spike, wincing as he put his hand to the doorknob, closed his eyes and opened the door. \"Well Twilight I'm back, and....uhhh are you alright?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting in the middle of the main room of Ponyville's library was a now massive 400lb pony, taking up more than five ponies worth of space. \"Ughh... urrp\" Twilight groggily belched, looking somewhat out of it oddly. \"Yeah Spike I'm fine.\" <br>\r\n\"What happened, you didn't eat any books did ya?\" Spike said referencing his little poke at the mare's sudden increase in hunger just before he left, though now as he said it he wouldn't be surprised if she actually had eaten some of the books, given her current size.<br>\r\n\"No, I just suddenly felt this...tickling sensation in my body and then my body just started to grow.\" Twilight said nearly groaning in the process, pushing her hooves into her neck and chest fat. As she did this, Pinkie, getting out of her shocked trance, walked from behind Spike, up to Twilight's blubbery gut and pushed her hoof into it, hearing a small \"boomp\" sound come from the fat and the resounding jiggle her action caused Pinkie giggled and soon divulged back into her normal self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie?!\" Twilight screamed, only just now noticing her guest. \"Spike, didn't I tell you I <b>didn't</b> want to be seen like this?!\" Twilight waved her hooves in anger as Pinkie continued to poke and prod the mare's belly, greatly enjoying the sounds her hooves made when they smacked against the fatty tissue. Spike merely smiled meekly as he switched his view from the giggling mare up to his friend's angry and blushing face, no doubt caused by Pinkie.<br>\r\n\"Well...I tried to but, she forced it on me!\" Spike pointed his claw towards Pinkie Pie, biting his lower lip, hoping Twilight would understand. Twilight glared at her assistant, becoming frustrated by him attempting to put the blame for this folly on somepony else, she was about to respond until a certain pink pony gave her opinion.<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be so hard on the dragon Twilight, You should be happy to be so big and bouncy, now you got you're own trampoline, you! I mean how awesome is that? Though I guess <i>you</i> can't use it, but still so much fun for all your friends!\" Pinkie said as she was now suddenly bouncing on Miss Sparkle's large belly, flipping and spinning with each bounce. Twilight's eyes dilated at this point, wondering just how even Pinkie could think this was....good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but Pinkie, you don't understand, I can't be seen like this! I'll be the laughingstock of Ponyville, and I can't exactly study the magic of friendship if I can barely move!\" Twilight was once again, going into her panic mode, believing when the bond between her friends could be broken.<br>\r\n\"Oh, quit being so silly, It doesn't matter to me how big you are and it won't matter to the others, and if they does matter they'll have to deal with Pinkamena Diane Pie!\" Pinkie said patting her right forehoof to her chest, giggling in the process.<br>\r\n\"Your name is Pinkamena?\" Twilight asked, being seamlessly knocked out of panic by knowing Pinkie's full name. <br>\r\n\"Well, duh I told ya so many times before, don't you remember?\" Pinkie said, looking at her friend in her cheerful, goofy manner.<br>\r\n\"No...I don't.\" Twilight said, completely sure she had never been told of Pinkie's actual name, in fact she had always assumed Pinkie WAS her name.<br>\r\n\"Eh whatever I'll think about all this later, just gimme what ya bought Spike.\" the mare commanded wiggling her hooves towards her assistant, wanting to finally satisfy her insatiable hunger that rung her insides like a bell.<br>\r\n\"Oh of course.\" Spike happily replied, knowing his friend's hunger had stopped her neurotic babbling.\"Here's 20 carrots, 30 turnips, 10 daffodil sandwiches.\" Spike climbed up the many folds of the pony, throwing them into her gaping maw. Twilight with an almost gluttonous behavior, quickly and merrily devoured the palatable vegetables, munching in pleasure as about 6 or 7 ponies' worth of lunches went down her throat.<br>\r\n\"Mmmh Spike that was delicious...wait...*sniff sniff*\" Twilight stopped, smelling an intoxicating and alluring aroma, that had somehow alluded her attention until now.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" Pinkie cheered as she remembered what brought her in the first place. Bringing her hoof on the top of the box at the base of the doorway to the home, she made it flip into the air, making it land squarely on her back, bouncing up to Twilight's head, with not a single wobble of the box that laid atop her back, she brought it up to Twilight's face and opened it up. <br>\r\n\"Oooohh...It looks delicious....\" Twilight moaned as her a waterfall of saliva cascaded from her mouth. The sight of the masterful detail that had been put into this cake alone made her want to eat it, but the smell intensified this feeling tenfold! \"What kind of cake is it?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh it's my super duper bestest best favorite Twilight!\" Pinkie clamored as she bounced atop Twilight's chins, which luckily due to the mass of fat that laid in them did little harm to Twilight. \"It's a triple chocolate fudge cake, with pink icing, my favorite! Oh I can't wait to share--\" As she said this Pinkie had closed her eyes in excitement, by the time she had reopened them after saying \"share\" she saw that Twilight was gobbling up the entire cake and before she could even respond Twilight had engulfed it in all its glory, cake smudges all over her cheeks. \"--it...\" Pinkie said dismayed at not being able to taste such a delicacy, true she had full intention to sell it in the first place, but since it was a personal delivery to her good friend she thought the least the two could do was share a few pieces together. <br>\r\n\"Aw Twilight! I wanted that cake too!\" Spike groaned, wiping a few crumbs and icing off the pony's left cheek he stuck his claw in his mouth and savored what little bits of the devoured cake he could taste. Twilight in response belched.<br>\r\n\"BURP!\" Ah that was absolutely lovely Pinkie you and the Cakes did a great job baking it! Though....uhh sorry about not sharing some with you two, I just couldn't help myself?\" Twilight smiled meekly, embarrassed by her ravenous behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's alright Twilight!\" Pinkie said, hugging the mare. \"A cake that good is bound to make some ponies go craaaazy for it, why I remember when I first had it oh boy you shoulda seen me, even Gummy was surprised by how I acted at the first bite and you know how calm he is, which I guess makes sense cause alligators need to be calm to stay low in those murky waters all day, but anyway I was loco.\" Chuckling at the thought of imagining Pinkie being so ecstatic about something even her almost zen-like calm pet had shown a reaction to it, Twilight licked her lips as she asked her a question.<br>\r\n\"About that cake...how much did it cost for Spike, Pinkie?\" Upon hearing this Spike immediately ran up to the pink mare and clamped his claws around her snout. \"Oh it cost him a pretty bit, it wammhh mmhmm!\" <br>\r\n\"Ohho don't worry about that Twilight, what matters is that your not hungry anymore r-right?\" Spike sweated as he lied badly at that, to the 400lb+ pony.  \"Glaring rather disappointingly at her assistant, Twilight crossed her flabby forelegs, awaiting the truth. \"Spike...\" Seeing that she was obviously not going to take anymore lies from him, Spike bit his lip and took his hand off Pinkie's snout, as much as he didn't want to.<br>\r\n\"It was 100 bits!\" Pinkie pumped her hoof into the air, happy to make such a great sale of such a great cake.<br>\r\n\"100 bits?! Spike, I asked you to get me some food not drain or entire emergency budget!\" Twilight fumed as Spike cowered behind Pinkie as they stood atop her gaping navel ( I don't care if ponies don't actually have those, I feel like it's not bad if I give them one) \"Urrggh, okay...how much do we have left?\" Reaching into the bag of bits Spike used to hold their emergency's stash. Holding out the bits in his hand, Twilight counted up the amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only 100 bits?! Spike you used a fourth of our budget?!\"<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't have if you hadn't been so hungry all of a sudden, you should've planned ahead!\" As the two began to bicker Pinkie, sensing that this could end ugly, and obviously hated to see her friends argue quickly racked her brain for some amazing Pinkie style idea to save the day! At least in her mind it would save the day, but helping her friends was good enough. Pulling an air horn from nowhere, Pinkie blasted the device right at the two bickering friends. *WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* Twilight and Spike immediately stopped arguing to clasp their ears shut, their eardrums ringing in horrid pain at the thunderous pang of that dreaded device. <br>\r\n\"AHHHH PINKIE STOOOOP!\" Twilight screamed desperately as Pinkie oddly did not stop blowing the air horn despite the fact her idea of quieting them had worked. Blinking a few times as she realized what was going on, seemingly unaffected by the blasting noise, tossing the can behind to disappear into oblivion. She giggled a bit, sorry for the slight torture she made her friends endure. <br>\r\n\"Hehe sorry, ok so you guys were all like \"We don't have any money for emergencies and stuff like that!\" Well I got a super Pinkie Pie idea to help you two!\" She said bouncing atop her two back hooves.<br>\r\n\"R-really? What do you have in mind Pinkie Pie?\" Twilight asked, rather intrigued as to what her kooky friend had in mind. \"I'd be glad to tell you Twilight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We'll set up a thing for colts and fillies to use this squishy body of yours as a trampoline!\" the pink pony then proceeded to bounce on the purple, furry, flab of her friend. \"What?!\" Twilight and Spike both questioned. \"Oh yeah it'll be great, we'll charge 2 bits per 5 minutes and you'll have your emergency money back in no time!\" \"Pinkie! I am not going to charge kids to jump on me!\" Pinkie Pie tilted her head amused confusion. \"Well you can't do it for free! Otherwise I'll never get a turn!\" Twilight's face scrunched up at Pinkie Pie not getting her statement. \"No, I mean I will not be using myself as an entertainment device by ponies!\" \"But how else are we gonna restore our budget Twilight? It seems like a good enough plan to me.\" Spike asked. Twilight bit her lip desperately trying to think of anything less embarrassing then the overzealous plan from Pinkie. \"I...don't know, but there's gotta be something that can be done without involving me being made public.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on Twilight we both know you can't stay in here forever, it'll be better for you to just get it over with a.s.a.p.\" Spike responded to the unicorn, wanting her to get over her somewhat overreacting fear of being ostracized. Sighing, Twilight finally admitted that she needed to get out, even if it meant being laughed at. \"Okay, let's do it, but do you think I'm even big enough to actually function as a...trampoline Pinkie?\" Twilight cringed upon referring to herself in such a bizarre manner.  At that moment however, as if the universe itself wanted to screw with the obese unicorn, Twilight yet again felt another sensation. Stronger this time, her body glowed with a faint reddish hue of magic as it increased in weight and size. \"Oh what the hay?!\" Twilight shouted as an audible *boomp* sound came from the expanse of new flab that surged forward, suddenly, sending Pinkie and Spike to the floor near the door. <br>\r\n\"Aagghh!\" the two of them gasped as they fell to the floor, rubbing their heads as they got up.Looking at their friend, the two saw just how much this sudden expanse truly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPropped by the fat of the now cart sized belly, Twilight's forelegs hung just slightly off from the floor. Her flank and backside were now pushing into one of the many shelves of the library, and considering the \"center\" of her body was 6 feet from the walls this meant they were rather large, each cheek enough to house a budding family of parasprites inside. Her face now utterly laden with fat, draped with 10 chins, with an 11th clearly on the way. The pony's vast form now laid at an incredible 1,300lbs, well over 10 average ponies in weight. Slowly opening her eyes, knowing that she had expanded yet again, Twilight's eyes shrunk as she saw her form. \"Oh nononononono! Uggh this is just great, I can...hardly... walk!\" Twilight grunted as she worked her hooves to the wooden floor. <br>\r\n\"Woooah...\" Spike gasped in awe at seeing a pony at such a size, he didn't even know ponies were capable of being this...large. \"Ergh hey you two a little help here, if we're going through with this plan, I think it's necessary if I'm <i>outside</i>.\" \"Alright! Come on Spike help me push!\" Pinkie cheered as she skipped towards the unicorn's towering posterior. \"Uhh right...\" Spike said unsure if Twilight would even budge at her current size. Awkwardly putting his scaled hands on the fat flesh of his friend, which despite it being harder to tell from his perspective where on her body it was, he was still sinking his hands into her butt. Pinkie Pie, showing off a large amount of determination and possible obliviousness to the arduousness of the task at hand, shoved her hooves into Twilight's left cheek with Spike on the right and pushed forward. Amazingly, despite weighing over half a ton she was moving towards the door, slowly...albeit but still enough to not be completely difficult for the pony and dragon, mostly due to Pinkie's energy and her being an Earth pony.  After about 45 seconds of pushing Twilight was only 6 inches away from the door...which wasn't much distance considering her size but now at least all they needed to do was open the door. \"Phew! sheesh that was a little harder than I thought it would be.\" Pinkie said lying on the floor, somewhat out of breath, but still keeping cheerful demeanor. Spike however, still being a baby dragon and nowhere near the physical strength of an earth pony was wheezing, having put all his effort into pushing Twilight. \"Speak...for.......yourself!\" Spike wheezed out to Pinkie, then asked a question to Twilight. \"Hey...huff hufff...Twilight you don't suppose you could move and get out of her yourself could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight put a fat hoof to her first chin. \"Well...wouldn't hurt to try.\" Twilight then wiggled her hooves towards the door handle...and was actually able to push open the door. \"Aha! Yes! I did it!\" Twilight exclaimed, exuberant that she had succeeded in the at first assumed impossible task, opening her front door. Putting her hooves to the floor she waddled her huge frame into the doorway...only to get stuck as her massive midsection became wedged in the library's doorway. \"Uhhmmm guys...ehehe a little help?\" Twilight asked meekly, now needing further assistance in getting unstuck from her own home. \"Sure Twilight,... just give us a little time to rest, I'm pooped!\" Pinkie responded as she laid back down on the floor, closing her eyes for the time being. \"Never thought I'd hear that from you...\" Twilight murmured to herself as she sat and stared at the outdoors, which for right now luckily she could see no other pony was nearby. It would be devastating for somepony to see the local librarian stuck in her own abode, especially in such a manner, and even more so being so....gigantic. She thanked the royal sisters for this moment of good luck on her behalf. After waiting for 3 minutes, hearing the heavy breathing of her friends gradually decreasing in volume, Twilight could then feel a hard push behind her, but then as quickly as it started, dispersed. \"Uhhh Twilight...I don't think the rest of you is gonna agree with us...you think you could try and use your magic on the doorway?\" the voice belonged to Spike who couldn't be seen from behind the mound of fat blocking her view into her home. Twiligh then sparked up at realizing this. \"Oh right...Let's see.\" Twilight then concentrated, forming her magic around the frame of the door, expanding it's form to allow her girth to slip through. With an audible squeaking noise, Twilight, with a few red marks on her sides made it outside. \"Ahhh...much better.\" Twilight sighed as she attempted to rub her sore belly and flanks. Suddenly, Twilight was caught off guard by a pink blur. \"Wha...Pinkie! Where are you going?!\" Looking at her turn the corner Twilight sighed, guessing she'd have to wait and see later....until Pinkie came up from behind, poking her on the shoulder to answer her question. \"Well duh, I need to get supplies for our idea Twilight...sheesh.\" \"Bwaaaah! Pi-Pinkie! Don't do that!\" Pinkie just stared at her, \"Don't do what?\" Twilight then gawked at the pink mare  \"Don't....ugh nevermind just go and get everything ready, I'd rather not want to <i>wait</i> on my embarrassment. \"Okie dokie lokie! Come on Spike!\" Pinkie cheerfully exclaimed as she threw the baby dragon up onto her back. Sighing Twilight once again began to play the waiting game. \"*sigh* Guess I'll just take a nap, not much else I can anyway...\" Twilight then closed her eyes and let the calm, serene enviroment she was in lull her into a rest. Minutes past, and as Twilight awoke with a snore she heard a loud gasp come from...somepony. \"*GASP!* Oh...my Twilight...is that you?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Opening her eyes, Twilight saw down past her cascading rolls of flab the coat of a white unicorn, Rarity. \"Rarity?! What are you doing here?!\" the purple pony said perplexed and embarrassed. <br>\r\n\"Uhh well...Pinkie...\" \"I went looking for supplies, and then Spike said maybe Rarity would have the stuff we'd need to make a stand and stuff, so we got ourselves to Rarity's, and then she asked why I needed to make a stand, so I told her you're gonna be a trampoline, and Rarity didn't believe me so I brought her here!\" Pinkie interrupted with a large shiny smile. \"Umm yes, correct Pinkie, now Twilight darling, just why are you so uhh out of shape?\" Rarity said wincing as daintily poked Twilight's haunch, making sure this was real. Twilight bit her lower lip in shame, seeing that this was going to happen eventually, best to get if over with already. \"*Sigh* I noticed some extra fat on my stomach and tried using a spell to to get rid of it, but it messed up along the way and it backfired on me to do....this.\" Twilight lowered head in despair, her collection chins bunching up in a heap of layer after layer of soft flesh. \"Well that's awful dear! Now...Pinkie, why exactly do you want to use our friend as a trampoline?\" Rarity cocked her head, wanting to know just what the sporadic pink pony was planning. \"Ooh I got an idea to help Twilight get over how big she is by letting her see how fun it could be to so shaky and jiggly and...\" \"Bouncy?\" Rarity added.\"Yeah! so anyway I thought that if we had Twilight hep out around town by having all the kids play on her belly for money like this!\" Pinkie then grabbed Rarity and trounced onto Twilight's fat laden gut. \"Wait Pinkie!\" Rarity screamed as she was hoisted up into the hooves of her friend.  \"Hehehehaha, see this super double fun with another pony on you!\" Pinkie then did a double bounce, sending Rarity about 10 feet in the air. \"Waaaaah!\"\"Pinkie quit it! You could hurt Rarity doing that!\" Twilight ordered flailing her rather nearly useless appendages now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping in mid-bounce, Pinkie grabbed Rarity to stop her from bouncing, Rarity glared with disapproval on being thrust into that, Pinkie merely smiled sheepishly, emitting a squeak sound in the process. \"Wait a minute... where's Spike?\" Twilight asked. \"Oh he's out in the market, setting things up for our plan with the stuff Rarity gave us!\"  <br>\r\n\"And what was that?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh well it was just some large elastic material which I can see now is meant cover your umm expanded form, some planks of wood for a stand, and a hat and cane because Pinkie wanted to act like a circus leader.\" Rarity answered, questioningly speaking the last bit of info.<br>\r\n\"I've always wanted to do one of those scenes where the ringleader tells ponies to gather around for some AMAZING spectacle!\" Pinkie added in. Twilight rolled her eyes at her friend's logic. <br>\r\n\"Well whatever, so...are we gonna get me over to my inevitable embarrassment now?\" Twilight asked. <br>\r\n\"Oh don't be so self deprecating Twilight, I'm sure everypony will love using you as an entertainment device.\" Rarity said, wincing as she tried not to insult her friend in such a delicate state of emotion.<br>\r\n\"Not helping Rarity.\" Twilight gritted through her teeth. <br>\r\n\"Wait, darling... can't you just teleport yourself there?\" <br>\r\n\"Well...no, I don't think that'd be a good idea, I don't know who might be where I'll end up, I may end up squishing some pony, and seeing a half ton pony come up from out of nowhere might be problematic for me...\" <br>\r\n\"*sigh* So I guess we're going to have to push you then.\" Rarity sighed as she realized her day was to be filled with strenuous physical labor.  \"Alright time for another go.\" Pinkie said with a slightly lesser amount of enthusiasm then she normally had, considering what she felt the first time she did this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the aid of another pony, Pinkie found moving her flabby friend somewhat easier. This pushing continued on for 4 minutes, making considerable progress, based on how much they had moved  last time.  \"Heeah Uurrgghh! Huff huff pant, Twilight I'm sorry but, I don't think I can do this any longer...at least not without a break.\" \"Oh that's okay Rarity, we're here!\" Pinkie responded, as they found out there had already made their way into the town square. \"What is that?!\" \"Is that a pony?!\" \"Is that the librarian?!\" A number of ponies shouted and screamed upon noticing the blob of purple fur, which was odd, as Twilight had gotten into the middle of town square and had gotten no reaction until it was pointed out by Pinkie that they had gotten there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Twilight muttered closing her eyes, awaiting the worst. \"Everything set up Spike?\" Pinkie asked to the baby dragon, seeing a rather well made stand with a sign saying \"Pony Trampoline 2 bits fillies and colts 5 bits for adults, 5 min. each.\" \"Yep! Got everything up and ready to go, now you're sure this work Pinkie?\" \"I pinkie promise Spike, no pony can resist my speeches!\" the perky pink pony promised, making a crossing motion over her heart and touching her eye. \"Twirling the hat onto her head and taking the cane, Pinkie stood on her hind legs and shouted. \"Come one come all! See the amazing First EVER Pony Trampoline! Given to us by our very own amazing librarian, Twilight Sparkle!\" Many gasps and \"oh mys\" were made, ponies were flummoxed at how a pony could attain such girth. \"So, who's first?!\" Pinkie cheered, waving her cane at the crowd of ponies. The ponies looked weary, unsure if this okay to do. \"I'll try it.\" said a small blue unicorn filly. \"ALRIGHT!\" Pinkie cheered, tossing the filly up into the air sending her down towards Twilight blubbery rolls. \"Woah!\" the filly screamed, but then was tossed back up as she landed on the expanse of fat, bouncing upon it, spinning and twirling with delight. \"Hey I wanna get on!\" \"Me Too!\" \"Let me play on Miss Sparkle's belly!\" and soon the crowd was throwing bits into a chest Pinkie had gotten, slowly filling up with the gold coins. \"I don't believe it....\" Twilight muttered. \"They actually....enjoy this.\" Twilight then couldn't help but laugh from the immense sensation of so many ponies jumping on her, it was rather tickling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Pinkie! you're a genius, we'll have our emergency budget back again in no time!\"  Spike was ecstatic at the success that was going on. \"Aw thanks Spikey, now if you'll excuse me I've got some bouncing to do!\"  Pinkie then jumped a good 15 feet in the air and joined over 7 ponies in the fun. \"Can you believe this is going so well Rarity...Rarity?\" Spike looked around for the unicorn, only to find that she had in fact joined in with playing on his companion's blubber as well. \"H-hey wait for me!\" and soon Spike too climbed atop Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours went by, with the number of ponies switching in and out, taking turns jumping on the \"pony trampoline\", Pinkie, Spike, and Rarity went down to check to the bits collected. \"498...499...500! Haha We did it!\" Spike pumped his fist downward. \"How much did we make Spike?!\" Twilight said past all her flapping chins and jiggling flab. We currently have 600 bits for emergencies!\" \"600?! that's fantastic! Well then everypony time to get off.\" Twilight said, now wanting to stop being used as a plaything, even if it did make her a good amount of money in only a few hours. Trotting down to the ground, the remaining crowd of ponies reluctantly left, going back to their homes. \"Well...I must say, Twilight it was rather fun bouncing around on your...fat.\" Rarity said, slightly embarrassed to say something rather ridiculous sounding. \"Hehe your welcome Rarity, I'm just glad I got my funds back oh!\" Suddenly Twilight felt a strong surge through her body. \"Oh no....\" Twilight moaned. \"Hmm? What's wrong dear? What's wrong with her?\" Rarity turned her head to the other two who were backing away in fright. \"R-rarity you better move back.\" Spike shuddered. \"What? Why?\" Rarity turned back towards Twilight, seeing her cheeks were starting to bloat up. Rarity winced as she knew something bad was about to happen. \"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>BBBUUURRRPPPP!!!!!!!!</b></font> Twilight let out a truly monstrous belch, blowing Rarity's mane back into a straightened single spike of hair. Then even worse for Rarity, Twilight's flabby body surged forward, blasting into the unicorn and sending flying through the air into Pinkie and Spike 20 feet away. Wah!\" the three of them screamed as they tumbled across the ground. Twilight continued getting fatter, her cascading flab and shelves of fat growing to fill up a decent portion of Town Square. Considering they had set up nearby the Town Hall, it was getting to the point where Twilight's rear end was reaching to the second floor of the establishment. The mare's hock's and legs were getting so enveloped in fat that they were sinking in the flab that came from them. Her belly was getting so big and full of blubber that she reached out towards Rarity. After about 20 seconds of growing Twilight had gone from a \"petite\" 1,300lbs to a staggering 6,700 or so lbs! Now big enough to swallow up 10 manticores in her rolls the pony was truly gigantic in terms of weight. \"Wh-what in the hay?!...Twilight...How'd did you...Augh?!\" Rarity blathered about, confused as to what just happened. \"Ugh that...was one of the side effects of my spell backfiring.\" Twilight said groggily. \"Well...how do we fix this, if you keep growing like this...oh I don't want to think of such a disaster!\" \"I think there were some solutions back at the library but, I'll have to go back to get the book.\" Spike responded. \"Urgh no time Spike!\" \"Oh I need some food NOW! I feel so..empty.\" Twilight groaned. \"Ain't that ironic, *sigh* alright I guess we should get the rest of the gang, we're gonna need help if we want to feed this blob.\" Spike said. \"I heard that!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing a few of the various animals that lived about the place scurrying about to their dens and nests, the pony and dragon walked up the pathway and knocked on Fluttershy's door. \"Fluttershy, are you there, I'm sorry to bother you at this time, but I think we need your help....Fluttershy?\" Rarity called out to her friend, hearing for a response. Looking over to Spike with a confused look, he merely gave her a shrug, then with a small creak the door opened slightly. <br>\r\n\"Oh it's you two, please come in quickly!\" Fluttershy muttered, pulling them inside. Looking around, the two companions saw what looked like a fort made of her furniture that occupied the back part of Fluttershy's living room. <br>\r\n\"Uhh Fluttershy, what's all this for?\" Spike questioned, as he saw Angel hop past, putting a potted plant on top of a box in the fort. <br>\r\n\"Ohh it's just... I was watering some plants here with Angel, when out of nowhere this horrible roar of monster came though my house and shook everything about, it was awful, so loud and frightening. So I've been making this fort as protection if it comes here...I really hope it doesn't though\" the pegasus shuddered slightly upon remembering the roar. <br>\r\n\"Oh Fluttershy, darling that's what we came to you about, but to clarify for you, that wasn't a monster you heard.\" <br>\r\n\"Not a monster? B-but it was so loud and deep, what else but a monster could make that kind of sound?\" <br>\r\n\"I think it'd be better if you saw for yourself Fluttershy.\" Spike said as he motioned to her to follow him outside. <br>\r\n\"We-well alright. Can you put all this stuff back in they're proper places Angel?\" the bunny turned his head up at the makeshift fort, taking in at how much they had put into it. Turning back he gave the pony a look of irritation at making him do all the hard work, putting his paws on his hips. \"Aw please, I promise I'll make that special salad you like tomorrow.\" Angel patted his chin in thought,closing his eyes he nodded in compliance. Fluttershy smiled as followed the two outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, Pinkie had made her way to Sweet Apple Acres. Bouncing along the fields she saw Applejack getting ready to head in for the day and bounced over to her. \"Applejack!...Applejack!\" the pony cheerfully exclaimed as she hopped closer to the mare. <br>\r\n\"Huh? Well hey there Pinkie Pie, what brings ya around here at this hour?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh Rarity told me to come get you, cause we need food for Twilight, and Twilight needs it because she really hungry, and she's hungry cause she's gotten all blobby and big and super-duper fat!\" Pinkie responded in a quick speech.<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh.....what?\" Applejack merely stood there, unable to comprehend what she had just been told, the last bit of info too bizarre to make any sense of it in her head. \"Just come with me..oh and ya got any snacks?\" <br>\r\n\"Just some apple fritters over there I made for dessert after dinner...hey!\" Applejack shouted as Pinkie came from behind her and ran off with the treats. <br>\r\n\"Come on Applejack, we gotta get back to Twilight before she starves, oh wait, but first Rainbow Dash!\" Pinkie yelled, giggling as Applejack chased her. <br>\r\nAfter Pinkie and Applejack had made their way to RD's house, or at least below the structure of clouds, Pinkie apologized to Applejack for taking the treats and explained that they'd be necessary in a bit. <br>\r\n\"How ya gonna get a hold of RD Pinkie?\" Applejack puzzled to the Earth pony, not sure of how they'd get up to the vaporous abode.  <br>\r\n\"Are you forgetting who you're talking to Applejack? I'm Pinkie Pie, just watch me.\" Pinkie then ran off, presumably to gather things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuaahh\" the pegasus yawned as she walked over to her bedroom. A whole day of doing nothing but relaxing, while nice she had to admit today had been boring, with her shift of cloud clearing being moved to Friday, Rainbow Dash had all tomorrow and the next day to train and exercise for her long-running goal to join the Wonderbolts. Rainbow Dash went over to a nearby mirror to fix her mane, as she'd obtained a bed head sleeping around all day. Then suddenly she heard a voice, one that was too close for it to make sense, but at the same time did make sense. \"Hi Rainbow Dash!\" Pinkie Pie said, standing on the floor of the room. <br>\r\n\"Pinkie Pie?! What are you doing at my place at this hour, and how are you standing in my house?\" <br>\r\n\"Hehehe Oh Rainbow Dash, I'm not standing in your house.\" Pinkie responded, completely ignoring the first part of her friend's question. \"Huh?\" puzzled, Rainbow Dash poked her head out through the floor of her bed room, looking down she saw Pinkie was in fact standing on incredibly high stilts, looking further down she saw Applejack, who nonchalantly waved to her. <br>\r\n\"Okaay...Now why are you here, I got practicing to do tomorrow, so I need my sleep.\" <br>\r\n\"We're here to take you Dashie, something's happened to Twilight and we need to gather food for her.\" Hearing mention of possible misfortune upon one of her friend's, Rainbow Dash's ear perked up, though she was perplexed by the food part.<br>\r\n\"Wait what's wrong with Twilight? Why does she need food?\"<br>\r\nPinkie, despite being on stilts, moved about the clouds as if she really was on them. \"There's no time for explanations, we need to hurry or..or Twilight will...\" At this point Rainbow Dash was getting worried.<br>\r\n\"Will what? get sent to a dungeon, die....EXPLODE?!\" Rainbow Dash violently shook the pink pony in worry. <br>\r\n\"Actually I don't know...she's just hungry, so get some food out of your kitchen and we'll bring it to her.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait...she's just hungry? Are you kidding, you're making me worry over her being <i>hungry</i>?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, Rainbow Dash, I know it's weird, but just come on, it'll make sense when you see her.\" Rainbow Dash rolled her eyes, even though she couldn't hold any of this as being important, the fact that Pinkie seemed worried at all just didn't sit with her. \"Oh, all right...\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, see ya in a bit Dashie!\" and with that Pinkie's body disappeared underneath the clouds.<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and Rainbow Dash flew down with a saddle bag full of some old treats and bits food she had been keeping in her kitchen. \"Alright...now let's go and get this to Twilight.\" Rainbow Dash said in a somewhat triumphant manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh....uurrrrpp so empttttyyyy.\" Twilight moaned rubbing her gargantuan \"empty\" stomach. As she did this, her eyes widened as she heard the voices of a certain three coming near her. <br>\r\n\"Well...here she is Fluttershy...your \"monster\" is....Twilight.\" Spike said as he move out of the way for Fluttershy to see the purple blob in front of  her. It was unbelievable, the fact that that horrible sound had come from Twilight...it just didn't make sense, and why was she so...so...large?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" T-Twilight...is that really you?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh Fluttershy bbuuuurrrrrppp! Ye-yeah uhh it's...me, all of me.\" the purple mare blushed violently, horridly embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Fluttershy squeaked and shrunk down shaking, once again sacred by the belch of her friend, although this one nowhere near as loud as the previous. <br>\r\n\"Oh, I-I'm sorry Twilight, it's just that your burp reminded of your last one, see I heard it and thought there was a monster.\"<br>\r\n\"A-a monster?\" Twilight's ears drooped as she realized one of her close friends had thought of her eructation was the roar of a monster, and thus herself as one. <br>\r\n\"Oh don't be so down Twilight dear, Fluttershy here is fine now, especially since she knows it's just you and not a \"real\" monster, right Fluttershy?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, no need to be sad Twilight, everypony burps, even me.\" Fluttershy then swallowed in a great amount of air and let out the largest burp she could muster at the moment. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">urp.</font>\" <br>\r\n\"Kch..kch hehe...\" Spike and Rarity snorted and giggled at the mare's tiny and rather cute belch. Seeing it Twilight regained her composure. <br>\r\n\"Haha you're right Fluttershy, so what did you guys bring?\" Twilight asked eager to finally fill her ever growing hunger. <br>\r\n\"Oh well I brought some vegetables and fruits from my garden, I hope it's enough for you Twilight.\" Spike and I went around my house and we made you a number of lovely sandwiches, oh just one of these is enough to keep me going for an entire day, I'm sure you'll love it darling.\"<br>\r\n\"Ohh it all looks great, thank you so much, a pony couldn't ask for better friends.\"<br>\r\nJust as they began to walk over to the mountainous blob of pony flab, A surprised shout came from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Twilight, is that....you?! Pftt Bwahahahah!\" Rainbow Dash had lost it upon seeing Twilight, just a day before had been a svelte and thin mare, and now....just incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow!\" Applejack sternly yelled in response to her friend's rude and boisterous laughing. As her laughter died down, she began to regain her composure and apologize.<br>\r\n\"Ah..ha I'm sorry but, sheesh when Pinkie told me you were hungry, I didn't think you'd be be like this. \"What happened to ya anyway Twilight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of her friends had found out about her gigantic new size. \"Sigh okay, I noticed that I've put on a little weight recently and decided to try a weight loss spell, but I messed up and it caused me to uncontrollably gain weight and...now I'm this gluttonous blob. I just hope you don't think of me any differently...\" Twilight hung her head as she awaited their response.<br>\r\n\"Well of course we don't sugurcube.\" <br>\r\n\"Yo-you don't?\" Twilight began to smile as she realized this.<br>\r\n\"Why of course not darling, fat as you admittedly are, you're still the same old Twilight Sparkle we know and love.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...and besides...you're waaay too much fun to bounce on.\" Pinkie said as she pounced onto Twilight's blubber, being thrown back from it's jiggling, back to where she was previously standing.<br>\r\n\"And hey, with you like this I could have a safe, cushioning landing pad for my stunts!\" Rainbow Dash thrusted her hoof into a roll on Twilight's barrel.<br>\r\n\"Even if you eclipse us all, you'll still be our Twilight.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah! See Twilight I told you you were just overreacting.\" Spike said rather proud of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight found herself so grateful to have such great friends as these. \"Aw guys...come here.\" She said as she stretched her hooves out towards them, as best as she could anyway. Making their way up there, the 5 ponies and 1 dragon huddled together with the massive purple mare to hug her, despite the changes that had occurred, she was still in their eyes the same pony. <br>\r\n\"Guuuurrrrgghhgllleeee\" <br>\r\n\"Eeep! What was that?!\" Fluttershy squeaked in shock. <br>\r\n\"Ahahaha...oh yeah I forgot I was still hungry...did you guys bring anything?<br>\r\n\"Umm well I got some hay and jugs of apple cider I saved.\" \"And Ah've  got a piece of a Zap Apple pie, I was gonna save it for a special occasion but...after seeing you like this I think you need it.\" Applejack stated as Rainbow Dash flew up with it all to Twilight' mound of chins, holding them above her head. <br>\r\n\"Ah good...just drop in here.\" Uncorking the jugs and dropping the hay, Rainbow Dash dropped the food down to the mare's maw, taking a second to nibble from the incredible taste of the Zap Apple pie, she let it drop, almost regretting it.<br>\r\n\"Mmmh I haven't had a good pile of hay in a while and those snacks from the Apple Farm were great, thanks Rainbow Dash, Applejack.\" Twilight licked her lips as she savored the taste of sweet appley cider.<br>\r\n\"No problem\"<br>\r\n\"Ain't nothing.\"<br>\r\n\"I've got some vegetables and fruits from my garden if that's fine with you.\" <br>\r\n\"Sure Fluttershy, bring 'em on up.\"<br>\r\nFlying up to Twilight, she daintily brought the Twilight's mouth, feeding like one would a colt or filly almost.<br>\r\n\"Was it good?\"<br>\r\n\"Mmmh yeah definitely! Well that about does it for now.\"<br>\r\n\"Well that's good, now if you don't I got some sleeping to catch up on.\" RainbowDash began to fly away when suddenly a sound stopped her.<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh..girls....I feel something coming up again.\"<br>\r\n\"Again?...What do you mean again?\" Rainbow questioned as Twilight's body began to rumble to such an extent that even at this time of night, several ponies of came out of their homes to investigate. <br>\r\n\"Is there an earthquake?!\"<br>\r\n\"Is that...Twilight?!\"<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\" As the townsfolk galloped about, most began to realize the source of it all...coming from their very own librarian, Twilight Sparkle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm guys...what do we do?\" Rainbow Dash said to her companions, unsure of just what exactly was about to occur.<br>\r\n\"I think its best that we RUN!\" Rarity shrieked as the inevitable began.....or at least it would have, but for some reason all the rumbling just...stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Twilight murmured as the sensation ended abruptly. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was a dud?\" Spike answered.<br>\r\n\"Well...anyway...I guess now would be good time to finally undo this spell, Spike you should go and retrieve the book, I believe it had something in it that said how to undo this kind of mishap. And hurry! We don't know if that \"dud\" or whatever will start up again!\"<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" the dragon ran off as the nearly 7,000lb pony sat there, a crowd of ponies surrounding her, perplexed by the words \"mishap\" and \"again\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean mishap?\" a brown stallion said.<br>\r\n\"Are just gonna keep getting bigger? What do we do if you outgrow Ponyville?\" a light green mare with a whitegreen mane asked, having bounced on Twilight earlier with her marefriend.<br>\r\nThe crow was bickering and volleying question at the studious, blubbery mare, unsure of what would happen if this continued, wanting to know if she could something about this, or at least had some answers.<br>\r\n\"Please everypony, settle down! Alright...so earlier today in the morning I accidentally botched a spell on myself and it made into this...blob..and every so often I expand in weight, now the book I was casting from is at the library which Spike is retrieving right now! None of you have anything to worry about. I explicitly remember that it had the cure in there!\"<br>\r\n\"So you know how to fix this?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...no not exactly I don't remember what the cures were...but I'm sure whatever they are they can't be hard to do.\" Twilight said, reassuring everypony, and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...book, book, where did we put it?\" <br>\r\n\"Hoo?\" <br>\r\n\"Arr?\"<br>\r\n\"AH Owlowiscious, Peewee, you think you can help me find....Gain and Lose: ....Weight based spells for Unicorns?\" <br>\r\nThe two birds gave a salute, and flew about the shelves of the library. As Spike began to tear into the shelves, pulling books out and throwing them onto the floor, Owloiscious came up with a book in his claws, Peewee flying above him. \"Hoo.\" \"Arr\"<br>\r\n\"Ah thanks you two...where was it?\" Pointing their wings towards a shelf, Spike walked over and saw \"G\" on it.<br>\r\n\"Oh...the G section...yeah probably should've remembered Twilight likes to keep everything alphabetical...anyway thanks!\" the dragon waved to the two pets as he ran back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight! I got it!\" Spike shouted as he ran to the crowd.<br>\r\n\"Ah good throw it to me Spike!\"<br>\r\nSpike then Threw it somewhere near her head, which was hard to do given his short stature made it somewhat hard to tell where her \"head\" was in all that flab. <br>\r\nCatching it in her aura, Twilight flipped through the doorstopper of 800 pages and found on pg 413 the spell she had messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah okay everypony I have found the spell!\" She said bringing in cheers from the crowd of ponies. \"Alright...let's see ah!...to undo mistakes caused by this spell, one may use a team of unicorns.\"<br>\r\n\"Well that seems easy enough.\" Applejack stated. \"Alright, everypony, all y'all unicorns gather up now, if you can cast magic, you can help Twilight.\" <br>\r\nAll the unicorns in the crowd gathered up, big and small, young and old, all of them came to undone the problem that was ailing Twilight. \"Alright everypony, on the count of three I want all of you to focus your magic on me, and focus on the thought of me going back to normal!...1....2.....3!\"<br>\r\nAt three, over 70 able unicorns focused their thoughts on the blobbish mare in front of them. Twilight giggled a big as the immense amount of magical energy was causing quite a sensation on her. Unfortunately...something happened. </span></div></div>",

Completely shutting down the cast of the spell, Twilight groaned at her own undoing. \"Uggggghhh! I can't believe this!\" <br>\r\n\"Urrrrrhhhh...is everypony okay?\" Rarity said as she held her head in her hooves after crashing into a stallion.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\"<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n\"For the most part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was a waste.\" Rainbow Dash grunted in retort of the event.<br>\r\n\"Ah well come on RD, we can just try again, y'all unicorns up for another try?!\"<br>\r\n\"YEAH!\" all of them said in unison, the little hiccup that had stopped them before wasn't going to make them quit anytime soon. Unfortunately for all of them, they did not get that second chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooah....uh everypony? I feel something big coming...and I don't think it's a dud!\" Twilight said worried, as the rumbling in her body escalated to a level beyond what any of them had experienced. As several ponies stood on in worry and fear of just WHAT was about to happen, Twilight let out the mother of all burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</font> \" Upon releasing her gaseous eruption, Twilight exploded outward with flab, immediately bowling over many of the members of Ponyville, and unlike the last few times she had gained in weight, this one wasn't stopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on?! W-why isn't she stopping?!\" Fluttershy said in a high state of panic, to scared to fly out of range of Twilight's growing body.<br>\r\n\"I guess...maybe since we're were all using our magic on her, since all of our spellcasts were interrupted by her belch, it must've had an exponential effect on her growth!\" Rarity said as she and the others were running as fast as they could away from the cascading folds of Twilight.<br>\r\n\"But's shes nearly outgrown all of Ponyville, and she's not stopping...what do we do?!\" Pinkie said frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...I grabbed the book when she burped the first time. Let's if there's something else we can do!\" Applejack took the book out from under her hat and tossed it to Rarity. Flipping it page 413 as she remembered Twilight mentioning, \"Aha! Okay, it says here that there are potions on page 568. 568...568 Ah! Okay...one of them is something called the Kupoteza Uzito?\" <br>\r\n\"What the hay is a Koopoetayza Oohzeetoe?\" Rainbow Dash shouted as the blubber behind them, while still flowing was beginning to lose its speed, however it was still continuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh...oh no! Its ingredients are native ONLY to the land of Zebrilia.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...Zebrilia....that sounds like Zebra...come on gals, we got a Zebra to visit...Oh Ah' hope she's got this potion otherwise Ponyville or Tartarus..., everything is done for!\" Applejack said in a frenzy as she and the others ran straight into Everfree Forest, with the purple blob not far behind, ever moving, with it getting close to encompassing all of Sweet Apple Acres now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been an odd day for Zecora, over the day she had spent meditating and brewing tea for herself, a loud and eruptive roar had spooked her every now and then throughout the day, with the largest one yet having so much as even rattled the contents on her shelves. Just as she was getting ready to end the day and go off to slumber, her door had been barged into by 5 ponies and a dragon. \"Zecora...quick we need your help!\" Seeing the 5 in such distraught made Zecora worried, at this time of night, it could nothing but something disastrous if they had come to her so late and in a rather abrupt manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your coming here is rather late, so whatever you face must be quite great.\"<br>\r\n\"Great nothing, we got ourselves a TREMENDOUS problem on our hooves!\" Rainbow Dash flew up to Zecora held up in the air. <br>\r\n\"Do you have this potion here Zecora?\" Rarity said as she shoved the page up to Zecora's face.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...unfortunately I do not.\" <br>\r\n\"*GASP*!\" the 5 ponies and dragon gasped in horror as it seemed their final source of hope was gone.<br>\r\n\"However, the ingredients for it I have bought.\"<br>\r\n\"PHEW!\" they all collectively said.<br>\r\n\"So how long will it take to prepare?\" Fluttershy asked.<br>\r\n\"This potion will only take minutes to prepare, but might I ask why you have come to my lair?\"<br>\r\nRainbow Dash not wanting to waste anymore time on this, picked up Zecora and flew her high above the dense trees of the Everfree Forest, what she saw shocked and amazed her...a monstrous purple mass was making its way towards the forest, and it showed no signs of stopping.<br>\r\n\"THAT is why we're here.\" Rainbow Dash said in an impatient tone.<br>\r\n\"Look Zecora, that there blob is our friend Twilight, and we gotta get that Kupowhatza Uzitothingy to her pronto, or she'll cover all of us in her fat!\" Applejack said in a desperate tone.<br>\r\n\"Hmm....quickly gather my supplies, with your help our pony friend will be put down to size.\" Immediately, the gang got to work helping Zecora pour, mix, and shake all the necessary ingredients together in the proper way.<br>\r\n\"We better hurry guys, Twilight's already halfway here!\" Rainbow Dash said as she made herself lookout. Stirring and brewing in her pot, Zecora took a sizable amount into a moderately sized bottle.<br>\r\n\"Here is the potion that which you seek, now go and take it to Twilight to drink.\" Despite her calm demeanor and manner of speaking the gang could hear a hint of worry and fear in her voice that was unheard of from them before.<br>\r\n\"Alright! Now let's go get this to Twilight! Pinkie said as she gripped the bottle in her mouth.<br>\r\n\"YEAH!\" they all shouted, minus Pinkie who mumbled with the bottle in her jaws. Opening the door they found themselves eclipsed by the mountain of blubber that was Twilight Sparkle. <br>\r\n\"Oh dear Celestia!\" Rarity screamed as the mass grew closer and closer. <br>\r\n\"Rainbow you're the fastest, quick get back to Ponyville and find Twilight's head! GO!\" Applejack snatched the bottle from Pinkie's mouth and threw it to the pegasus.<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" Rainbow Dash flew off at towards the center of the pony blubber, while the rest of the gang including Zecora ran from her hut as the blob of fat surged over her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on Twilight...in all this fat of yours, YOU gotta be here somewhere.\" Rainbow Dash flew about, trying to desperately spot the unicorn's head in all these folds of fat.<br>\r\n\"Twilight! HEY TWILIGHT!....YOU THERE!?\" Rainbow Dash quickened her flying as she knew each passing second meant more danger for not only her friends but all the citizens of Ponyville, wherever they were in Twilight's blubber. Just as she was about to fly off to another part of the growing mass, she heard a scream coming a good 30 feet from her.<br>\r\n\"R-Rainbow!\" <br>\r\n\"Twilight!\" flying over she could see Twilight face nearly covered by the immense amount of neck and back fat, so much so her horn was rendered useless at this point due to being covered by so much fat. \"Oh mare am I glad to see you!\" Twilight said as she winced in pain, most likely from her body going over trees, rocks, and several other things in the neighboring areas around Ponyville.<br>\r\n\"Same here...now quick drink this, I don't know how much time the others have!\" Rainbow Dash said in a panic as she practically shoved the entire bottle in Twilight's mouth.<br>\r\n\"*GULP....GULP...GULP....gulp..gulp.....BUUUUURRRRRRPPPP!!!\" Twilight downed the contents of the potion, letting out one final belch. In moments her body, which probably at this point weighed in the hundreds of millions began to recede back to Twilight's body.<br>\r\n\"Is it over?\" Twilight asked as she felt something happening in her.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah I think we're good.\" Rainbow Dash wiped her brow, worried that she'd never find Twilight's head or worse..the potion had no effect somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group ran through the thickets and bushes of the forest, they found themselves stuck between a blob and a hard place...more specifically Twilight's belly and the wall of a cliff. With no time to move out of the way, it seemed that they would be consumed by the ever growing mass of flab. The ponies, zebra, and dragon winced as they thought this was the end, but then as the wall of flab came inches to their faces, it began to shrink backwards.<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash DID IT! HOORAY!\" Pinkie waggled her 4 hooves in the air with glee as the danger subsided.<br>\r\n\"Alright...lets get back to our friend and the rest of Ponyville!\" Applejack ordered as the gang ran out of the forest and towards Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only was their friend a huge, over three-ton blob, but below the large amount of flab that made up Twilight's rear end, a huge penis was sticking out! It looked to be about twelve feet long and two feet wide, and it was hard and throbbing. It was a lighter shade of purple than the rest of Twilight's body and it seemed to wiggle along with her as she tried to move herself somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... it's a... ooohhhh...\" Fluttershy said right before fainting, her bags of food spilling on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in Equestria happened to Twilight?\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, some spell she was trying out made her into this big blob.\" Spike explained. \"I don't know what's up with the penis though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why don't we ask her then?\" Rarity said, picking up the food Fluttershy dropped and putting it into one of her bags. \"Besides, all of this food is getting heavy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rarity, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Spike went over to Twilight's face,  Rainbow Dash just stood where she was, unable to tear her gaze away from Twilight's penis. Her eyes widened, she began to drool, and her wings stood straight up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others made it to Twilight's face, who looked tired and exhausted. \"Oh, its no use. The spell didn't work...\" Twilight said. \"And I'm still hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, are you okay?\" Spike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look okay!?\" Twilight said. \"Not only am I a constantly growing blob of pony lard, but I'm still hungry and this spell I tried to make myself stronger didn't work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you tried to use a spell to make yourself stronger?\" Applejack asked. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting impatient waiting for you guys to bring me food, so I thought if I made myself super-strong I would be able to move by myself.\" Twilight said. \"But my stomach rumbled and I got distracted, so the spell didn't work. Now I just feel weird in a funny place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you don't know about it...\" Rarity said, unsure of how to break the ice about Twilight's new appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It? It what? What are you talking about?\" Twilight said, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a penis!\" Pinkie Pie blurted out in her usual manner. Everypony else gave an annoyed look to Pinkie for being so tactless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" Twilight said. \"You've gotta be kidding me! That can't be true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there's about twelve feet of pony meat that disagrees.\" Spike said, also getting annoyed looks from everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is terrible!\" Twilight said. \"Not only do I become a giant living trampoline, but I'm not even a mare anymore! Oh, what will Princess Celestia say!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, it's, um, not so bad?\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? This is great!\" Pinkie pie said. \"She gets to be a trampoline for everyone in Ponyville! I mean sure she can't fit into the Library anymore, she won't be able to get food without help, she can't dance, she can't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie! This really isn't making me feel any-OOOOOHHH!\" Twilight said, feeling something very, very strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\" Spike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I don't know, but I like it...\" Twilight said, a goofy smile on her face. \"Can, can you guys go see what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony then went over to Twilight's backside, leaving behind the many bags of food. While Twilight began to eat the large amount of food dropped in front of her, everypony else saw what was giving Twilight her pleasure...</span></div></div>",

She had all four of her legs wrapped around it, while she humped it and even began to lick it!  Fluttershy briefly woke up, saw what Rainbow Dash was doing, and then just fainted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash, just what the heck are you doing?\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohh, I couldn't help myself.\" Rainbow Dash said. \"It was so big, so beautiful, I just had to touch it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know the feeling.\" Pinkie Pie said. \"Once there was this giant wedding cake, and I knew it would be the most delicious thing ever, I knew I shouldn't have, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity put her hoof over Pinkie Pie's mouth and said \"Well can you let go? I'm not sure you should be doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Let her do it!\" Twilight called out from the other side. \"It feels too good! I must feel it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright. I guess if she says so...\" Rarity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rainbow Dash continued to jerk Twilight off with renewed vigor, while everypony else watched with a mixture of disgust and fascination. In addition to what she was doing before, Rainbow Dash rubbed her entire body up and down Twilight's huge shaft. Twilight moaned loudly as her penis continued to be played with, and so did Rainbow Dash. Soon, Twilight began to feel something very strange, though she had an idea on what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh my.\" Twilight  said. \"I think, I'm gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SPLOOOOOOGE!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight began to cum at a ridiculous rate! Gallons upon gallons of it shot out of her penis and began to pool on the ground. Rainbow Dash went up to the head of her dick and held her mouth open to eat as much of Twilight's cum as she could. Eventually it stopped, Twilight's penis had gone flaccid, and Rainbow Dash fell to the ground licking up any remaining cum she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... was... amazing...\" Twilight said, completely out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I agree.\" Rainbow Dash said, rubbing her own belly full of cum. \"It was so- UUUUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rainbow Dash's belly began to grow bigger! It surged out until it covered her hind legs, which themselves began to fatten up as well. Soon Rainbow Dash weighed about 400 pounds, having a huge belly, large jiggly ass, thick legs, and at least three chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah! What happened to me!?\" Rainbow Dash said, poking her new fat with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's going on?\" Twilight asked, still unable to see anything going on behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash is getting fat too!\" Spike said. \"She's as big as you were when you first tried that spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? She is!?\" Twilight said. \"How could that be, unless... oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\" Rarity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything that was done to me was done by magic.\" Twilight said. \"If Rainbow Dash is getting fat now, maybe my cum contains the same magic that made me like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean I'll get a penis too, because that would be awesome!\" Rainbow Dash said, continuing to play with her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. Oh, if only I had my books I could try to find some counter spells for all of this...\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no hurry. Take your time.\" Rainbow Dash said. \"Besides, don't tell me you didn't like what I did with your penis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, I guess some good things came out of this...\" Twilight said, blushing about the fun they had earlier. \"But still, I would like to undo all of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Twilight was about to ask her friends to fetch her books, something else had happened...</span></div></div>",

They all looked in its direction (except Twilight, for obvious reasons), and saw Fluttershy drinking from the huge pool of cum on the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FLUTTERSHY!?\" They all said, surprised at what their normally meek friend was doing. She looked up from the pool, and her face turned a bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, well, I...\" Fluttershy said, embarrassed beyond belief. \"Oh, I couldn't help myself. I've always been curious about what semen tastes like, and when I woke up there was a lot of it, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like you're not as innocent as we thought.\" Rainbow Dash said playfully, making Fluttershy blush once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy, I think its only fair to warn you that drinking too much of that will make you like Twilight and Rainbow Dash here.\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, speaking of, when am I gonna get that penis?\" Rainbow Dash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, this stuff has never happened before!\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy didn't heed Applejack's warning and continued to drink Twilight's cum, loving the taste. She used her front legs to gather as much of it as possible so she could guzzle it down. As she did, they all saw her body slowly getting fatter with each gulp. When she was finally satisfied, she laid on the ground with a full belly and a body that looked slightly plump, but not that fat. She only looked like she had gained 20 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's weird. I thought she would be bigger.\" Rarity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. What do you- hey, where's Spike?\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he ran off sick when Rainbow Dash was jerking Twilight off.\" Pinkie Pie said. \"Apparently he thinks this is gross or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I can't imagine why...\" Applejack said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was delicious.\" Fluttershy said. \"I wonder if- UUUURRRRPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Rainbow Dash and Twilight before, Fluttershy's body began to get fatter from that burp. Her belly began to stretch until it covered her hind legs, which also began to thicken up along with her front legs, face, and ass. Bigger and bigger she got, until she weighed 450 pounds, and was slightly bigger than Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh my.\" Fluttershy said. \"This is strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you look good!\" Rainbow Dash said, poking Fluttershy's big, round gut. \"I bet once I grow a- whoah boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash belt something strange below her belly. She lifted it up, and was delighted to see something growing from under it. Sure enough, she was growing a penis just like Twilight! It grew bigger and longer, until it was about a foot long and two inches wide. Rainbow Dash marveled at how large her new penis was, and then gave a mischevious look to everypony else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash, what are you thinking?\" Rarity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it frosting? Because that's what I'm thinking!\" Pinkie Pie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just though of something fun we could all do.\" Rainbow Dash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\" Twilight said, confused about what was going on behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash turned to Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie, and then said \"I want you three to...</span></div></div>",

Action!\" Twilight said, excited by the thought of three of her friends jerking her off. This was proven by her large penis becoming hard again. Pinkie Pie jumped up to its head, with Applejack soon following, and after some coaxing, Rarity joined them too. They all then began to rub their bodies and hooves up and down Twilight's shaft, making her moan in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw what they were doing, Rainbow Dash smiled, and then turned to Fluttershy. \"Well, while they're having their fun, why don't we have ours?\" She said, gently stroking Fluttershy's fat buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know...\" Fluttershy said, feeling nervous. \"I mean I haven't grown my penis yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as if in response, Fluttershy felt something grow out from under her belly. She looked, and sure enough, there was her new dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there you go.\" Rainbow Dash said. \"Now where were we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash got herself behind Fluttershy and positioned her cock right at her crack. She began to thrust into her, which made Fluttershy gasp in surprise. Fluttershy had never felt anything like this, it scared her, and yet it felt amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh Rainbow Dash, please continue...\" Fluttershy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tell me twice!\" Rainbow Dash said, continuing to fuck Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two pegasi had their fun, Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie continued to give Twilight's huge cock a good rubdown. Twilight began to yell in pleasure as the three jerked her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this is actually kind of fun.\" Rarity said, sitting right behind Applejack as they rubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Applejack said, sitting right behind Pinkie Pie. \"I wonder if we can give her more pleasure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea!\" Pinkie Pie said, rubbing the cock's head. Suddenly, she began to insert one of her hooves right into the hole of Twilight's dick! This made Twilight scream in pleasure, this felt incredible! Soon she began to feel it again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready girls, here it cums!\" Twilight said, briefly giggling at her pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SPLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGE!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's dick began to spray its cum once again! Her body jiggled so much with pleasure that the three were thrown off her spraying dick and into her torrent of cum, which knocked them all to the ground. They sat there and continued to be covered in Twilight's squirting cum, until eventually it finally stopped, her dick going flaccid again. There had to be twice as much cum on the ground as there was before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was... interesting.\" Rarity said, still trying to come to term with the fact that she had just made one of her own friends cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie then put one cum-covered hoof in her mouth and licked it down. She pulled it out and said \"Mmmm, salty! You gotta try this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But If we do, we'll-\" Applejack said right before Pinkie Pie shoved some of the cum into her mouth. After swallowing, Applejack said \"Give me some more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack then joined Pinkie Pie in eating the cum on the ground, with Rarity watching them. Rarity just sighed and said \"Well, if you can't beat them...\" and then went to devouring the cum along with them, finding it to be delicious. They all began to slowly grow fatter as they ate more cum...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Rainbow Dash, she continued to screw Fluttershy in the ass, making the both of them moan in pleasure. \"Oh, Rainbow Dash, this feels- UUUURP!\" Fluttershy said right before letting out a massive belch. When she did that, she actually began to grow fatter! Rainbow Dash was surprised by this, though not enough to make her slow down. Once Fluttershy stopped growing, she now weighed 800 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright, more cushion for the-UUUURP!\" Rainbow Dash said right before burping herself. She too began to grow fatter, soon reaching the same weight as Fluttershy. They continued to fuck each other, and they continued to burp growing bigger and bigger, until they were about to climax...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I'm gonna...\" Fluttershy said, feeling an orgasm and a burp coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" Rainbow Dash said, feeling the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SPLOOOOOOOOOOOOGE!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pegasi burped and orgasmed at the same time, covering the area in their juices and growing to the same size as Twilight!  Their big bodies all squashed into each other, with only their heads emerging from this small mountain of fat. They all breathed heavily after their sexual misadventures today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Twilight.\" Rainbow Dash said, exhausted. \"We're just... as big... as you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" Twilight said, getting some ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how can we have any more fun if we're all this big?\" Fluttershy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been thinking, and I just remembered a spell that should help us.\" Twilight said, her horn glowing. She covered them all in a purple aura, and then she began to stand up on her own fat, blubber filled legs! \"There! Now we should be able to move no matter how fat we get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy then stood up on their own, and smiled. \"Awesome!\" Rainbow Dash said. \"Now, what happened to the others?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she said that though...</span></div></div>",

Standing there, their mouths agape, their dicks rising, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy could only stare on at the jiggling mass of purple furred flab that was their friend Twilight. Finishing her 20 second long belch, Twilight let out a sigh of relief. \"Phew! Wow, I must say, I didn't think that last one would ever stop....\" Standing there in the moonlight, the mare felt a tingling sensation erupt inside in her body, but as suddenly as it came it stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?

I just do one of you at a time, or maybe one of you takes my mouth, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's one thing I've always wanted to try...\" Fluttershy said, blushing as her cock got hard. \"It's called the Conga Line...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. What is it?\" Twilight said, intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, its where we all line up in front of each other, and then we do the one in front of us, in the style of a conga line.\" Fluttershy explained, getting excited by doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun.\" Rainbow Dash said. \"Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds of discussion (they were already aroused, so they didn't think too hard about it), The decided that Twilight should be in the back of it while Fluttershy should be in the front. Rainbow Dash positioned herself in front of Twilight's dick, while Fluttershy did the same for Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's conga!\" Twilight said, excited. She then began to thrust her cock into Rainbow Dash's ass, who then began to do so for Fluttershy. The three giant pony blobs' bodies wriggled and jiggled as they continued to thrust, bringing them all to unbelievable heights of pleasure. Fluttershy was glad she suggested this, it was even more fun than she could ever have dreamed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie continued to slurp up Twilight's cum, their bodies continuing to grow as they did. Soon they began to notice their supply running low, so they looked up to see if Twilight could make some more. When they did, they saw what the three were doing, and were very surprised!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They never quit, do they?\" Applejack said. \"One minute they're- UUUURRRRRPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's body then began to grow right before them! Before her body weighed about 200 pound from all of the cum she drank, but now she was an 800 pound mass of pony lard! She looked down at herself, and began to smile as she played with her new fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can anyone finish a sentence tonight without-UUUURP!\" Rarity said, belching as her own body grew to the same size as Applejack's! Applejack noticed this, and began to cuddle Rarity and play with her new fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess that just leaves me! BUUUUURRRRRRRPPPP!\" Pinkie Pie said, burping intentionally to join her friends in being big. She did so, and grew to Rarity and Applejack's sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Pinkie, want to have some more fun?\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really have to ask?\" Pinkie Pie said, cuddling up with Applejack and Rarity. They were about to have a pony threesome of their own, when suddenly Applejack burped again, growing even bigger! She now weighed 1,300 pounds, just  as much as Twilight weighed this afternoon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoowee, I guess the gas ain't done yet!\" Applejack said. She then felt something else, and sure enough there was her new dick. She began to stroke it, arousing Rarity and Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When are we gonna get- UUUUUURP!\" Pinkie Pie said, burping and growing, both in fatness as well as a new penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean, nobody can finish a sentUUUUUUUUURRRRRPP!\" Rarity said, the same thing happening to her. They continued to burp and belch, until they were just as big in fat and genitalia as the three ponies doing the conga line!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now what?\" Rarity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now? Now we joint their conga line!\" Applejack said, aroused beyond belief. They three went over to Fluttershy and made their offer to join up, which Fluttershy happily agreed to. Applejack then got in front of Fluttershy and felt the pegasus's dick go into her, which Fluttershy screamed in pleasure about. Applejack then grabbed Rarity and began to screw her, which Rarity really enjoyed. Not to be left out, Pinkie Pie got in front of Rarity and let herself be screwed by the fashion-minded unicorn. The six continued their conga line of sex, until the inevitable was coming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna cum!\" Twilight called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME TOO!\" All of her friends yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*SPLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGE!!!!!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all began to cum at once! Their bodies, the ground, the town directly in front of Pinkie Pie, it all got covered in magical pony cum as they yelled out in pleasure! After about two straight minutes of cumming, the six ponied all laid down on each other, tired out from this amazing night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... was...awesome...\" Rainbow Dash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was everything I ever dreamed it to be...\" Fluttershy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I mean, you guys took a great dance for parties and made it even more fun!\" Pinkie Pie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know much about sex, but I don't think it can get any better than that!\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was like being in heaven...\" Rarity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know girls, I think our friendship has grown to a new level.\" Twilight said. \"Its become something better... love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all sighed as the cuddled up with each other. Suddenly, something else happened unexpectedly...</span></div></div>",

The cum shot out of Twilight's cock like water out of a geyser, surging up the channel of the princess' cock and causing it to swell from 10 feet around to almost 30. The influx of cum had also had an effect on Celestia's weight, as new folds of lard developed and old ones deepened as a result of the high-fat content of the creamy liquid. This deepening of the folds had caused the other ponies to take notice, as the pressure of the fat rolls pressing down on their firm cocks became greater and greater by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!! I'm gonna..cum!\" , Rainbow Dash grunted as she felt her cock getting squeezed by Celestia's expanding ass.<br>\r\n\"As am I!

The surge of cum came rushing through the streets of Ponyville, sweeping any loose objects along with it as it flowed at a torrid pace. The cum finally puddled into a large, shallow pool that flooded the valley Ponyville was situated in, from the Ghastly Gorge all the way to the edge of the Everfree Forest. In their tunnel-vision-like lust, the girls had failed to notice that one of their massive peers had yet to cum...</span></div></div>",

The bulge in Celestia's meta pole quite simply exploded from the organ's head. Flying off into the air at 45 degree angle, shooting past clouds, and even made an odd rainbow as the sun shined through the stream of off-white juice. Celestia could only moan as her massive balls emptied out into all of Ponyville and a good portion of the land around it. The flood of cum that was throughout the town was turned into a raging river 4 feet high, luckily due to it's higher density compared to water it was far easier to stay afloat in, as many ponies found out among those who didn't pick the best cover. Going well into Everfree Forest, and making a new river inside Ghastly Gorge, Celestia's cum was a force to be reckoned with as her stream continued on for what seemed like forever. Finally, after well over 5 minutes of torret cumming, Celestia's cock dried up and she could finally relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huuuuah....I haven't... felt this good..... in eons...\" Celestia said wincing as the last bit of jizz trickled out her shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPonies all around, trotted over to their blubbery blob of a princess, in absolute awe and amazement of being lucky enough to not only have pleasured their ancient ruler, but to also see her let out her amazing power in the form of an orgasm. \"WOW! Celestia that was super incredible!\" Pinkie squealed as she stood on her hind legs, despite her massive girth saying otherwise. <br>\r\n\"Even I didn't think our princess could do that.\" <br>\r\n\"She was so sexy blowing her load like that.\"<br>\r\n\"I wonder what this stuff will taste like on a muffin?\"<br>\r\nMany of the members of Ponyville conversed amongst themselves as the Mane six, worried a little and obviously curious on the princess's thoughts on all this. \"Princess?...You alright?\" Applejack asked as she poured cum that had gotten lodged in her hat out from it. \"Yes, Princess, I mean from the looks of it, that tired you out quite a bit.\" Rarity spoke as she made a quick slurp of the cum on her dick, hoping nopony had noticed her unlady-like action, it was just so damn delicious. Taking a breath, the alicorn smiled gracefully, her many chins dripping with cum, giving her an odd look of something between graceful and slobbish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, don't worry my...\"little\" ponies\" Celestia giggled as she realized how silly that now sounded given her and every other pony's girth. \"I'm fine, more then fine actually. Because of this, I've decided that I will share this with my sister, Twilight...can you go get Spike for me and send a letter to my dear sister explaining what has happened and that I have an idea to share with her. I'd go and tell her myself..but...well I think we can all agree that would be too much of a shock for my staff at the castle to handle, plus...I'm still rather winded after that...load of mine.\" Celestia chuckled as she began to imagine the limitless reactions her sister could have upon seeing her like this, nothing to mention about the vast pool of cum and the fact she had a massive cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Princess!\" Twilight \"ran\" off which wasn't much of a run considering her weight and having to wade through a sticky mess of Alicorn seed. \"See ya Twilight!\" Rainbow Dash waved as she fluttered about above her rotund friends. Getting a little horny she flew over to Princess Celstia's many chins and began to hump them, the sheer tabooness of it turned her on like nothing else. \"Rainbow! Please, she is tired, now stop...Fluttershy not you too!\" Rarity screamed as the two pegasi pleasured their cocks in Celestia's flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrodding though the flood of cum, every now and then taking a gulp of it, Twilight finally made her way to her home. \"Oh dear...\" Twilight saw that apparently the tree had been hit by the blast slightly, cum was dripping from its branches and Twilight could see within the windows that her bookshelves were soaked...so many books to fix, but that was not important as the pony realized that this meant Spike could be hurt. \"Spike!\" Spike?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerched atop the highest of shelves, alongside Owlowiscious and Peewee, the young dragon was rather shocked and disturbed. \"Oh thank Celestia all of you are alright.\" Twilight sighed in relief, her chins jiggling as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike gave her an annoyed look. \"You just had to botch that weight loss spell.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Spike, its not that bad, we'll get used to it, and beisdes, Celestia didn't know...\" Twilight began to respond but was interrupted by her assistant. \"Wait Celestia...what does she have to do with this?\" Spike said in curiosity as he carefully dropped down from shelve into the pool, wincing in disgust as he fell into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed as she told Spike what had happened. \"Celestia....did this?!\" <br>\r\n\"Yes Spike...oh and she told me to write her a letter to her sister.\" <br>\r\n\"A letter, won't it just go to Celestia when we send it?\"<br>\r\nTwilight rolled her eyes at his reasoning.  \"We're not gonna send it ourselves, just write the letter for me, and we'll give it to Celestia to teleport to Luna.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh...wait why does she want to tell Luna about this, I mean besides it being a huge problem.\" Spike said dryly, looking over to the side in an annoyed fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...she wants to share this experience with her, so Luna will probably end up like Princess Celestia soon, most likely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike's eyes widened as he tried to imagine that. \"Give me one reason why I should write that letter for you, with all this happening to us?\"<br>\r\nTwilight smiled slyly, knowing EXACTLY what to say to win over Spike. \"Oh my, Spike you should've seen Rarity back there, I must say I think she could love just about anypony... or anydragon, what with all of us being so full of lust right now.\"<br>\r\nSpike grunted and gritted his teeth, knowing what Twilight was doing, but...this chance he simply couldn't pass it up, and hey maybe Twilight was right, maybe they could actually get used to all this craziness, if only with Rarity by his side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erggh fine, you win, but you better be right about Rarity.\" Spike then began to write up the letter as Twilight ordered. Alright! Lets get this to the Princess! Twilight AWAY!\" Spike then jumped atop the flabby mare, kicking her in the sides.<br>\r\n\"Please don't treat me like a kiddy ride at the carnival Spike.\" Twilight nagged as they waded through the juices, waving off to their pets as they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are Princess!\" Twilight cheerfully exclaimed, holding the letter up with her magic, bringing it up to Celestia's gargantuan blubbery face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah thank you Twilight.\" the mare said as she let out a rather loud and out of character belch, gluttonous hermaphrodite or not, it was still weird seeing the Princess...burp like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForming her magic around the scroll, Celestia teleported the scroll all the way to Canterlot, to her sister's chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Pinkie said as she was humping Celestia's belly hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wait for her, simple as that.\" Celestia said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No sooner than she finished saying that did clouds fill the sky and thunder rain down behind. Everypony jolted, trying as best they could with their flabby bodies to hurry and gallop back into the safety of their homes. As per usual, a gothic chariot pulled by two gargoyle-esque pegasi glided across the sky, Luna riding atop it standing in a gallant pose with a very unimpressed look on her face. As the chariot came close to Celestia, Luna jumped off as the Pegasi flew straight up into the cloudy sky and Luna floated right in front of her sister's fat face. The clouds soon parted, as did Luna's lips as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SISTER, WHAT IS THY MEANING IN THIS QUEEREST OF SUMMONS?\" Luna sounded rather unimpressed, as shown with her lack of restraining use of the Royal Canterlot Voice, accompanied by strikes of lighting as she finished. Celestia winced a bit as the force of her sister's voice blew at her mane and caused the fat of her face and chins to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is very much as you see here, dear sist-UURRRRRRPPP!!\" Celestia said in a calm, composed voice before belching with such force, she sent Luna tumbling in the air through a loop-de-loop. Luna recovered with an unamused scowl on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOWEST WHAT I SEE WITH MINE OWN EYES AND WHAT I SEE IS PLAIN AND SIMPLE HEDONISM DEAR SISTER!\" Luna proclaimed once more. The Mane Six had planned ahead and watched while they all wore earphones. \"DESPITE WHAT YOU PROCLAIM AS PEACE WHAT I SEE IS SIMPLY A BAND OF NYMPHS WHO REVEL IN CLAIMING THAT MOST FORBIDDEN OF FRUIT! YOU WHO WOULD-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTIA-*Cough* I mean, Celestia sighed to herself heavily. Of course, openness in regards to romance, sex and orientation had not necessarily been a large issue in Ponyville for as far as she could recall, but there had been much progress on how it was taken in regards to how it was presented. True, she made sure no little ponies were present (so as not to be scarred for life seeing their parents hump her bountiful fat rolls), but she needed to help make sure Luna saw that there had been strides made, especially so within the last couple of hours, towards free love in Equestria. As Luna continued to rant, blowing away at the scenery with the Royal Voice and, of course, chew the scenery to such an extent as to rival Nick Colty, Celestia focused her magic through her horn on the ponies...other lower horns. They began to moan and groan as they couldn't control their unexplained euphoria, feeling something pull and rub against their swollen and bulging cocks. It only took seconds for them all to simultaneously cum, Celestai making sure their loads were spewed in constant streams towards Luna's wide, open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FURTHERMOR-Mmmph!!\" Luna was interrupted, to Celestia's favor, by the thick, hot, salty loads traveling down Luna's throat, their force as they traveled giving Luna little choice but to instinctively swallow. Her dark blue body began to visibly fatten and bulge as thick fat was packed on and her eyes rolled back in an expression of bliss as her face blushed a light blue. Celestia smiled as Luna began to welcome this change and how it felt, feeling her body grow, relishing the hot pegasus cum and enjoying, once she rounded the 800lb milestone, the feeling of growing a huge, throbbing member between her hind legs. Luna only moaned. As the cumming stopped, still in a sort of dreamy state, Luna swooped down of her own will and began to fly through the cum flooding Ponyville's streets, swallowing thick amounts of it in her mouth and growing more and more, her bulbous body surging outwards with new fat as her cock throbbed with it's continued growth. Celestia smiled, but took pause as she considered something. After all this time of holding onto the now much antiquated ways of 1000 years ago, Luna obviously had copious amounts of belligerent sexual tension piled up inside her. And now, somehow, in some way, it all had to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she thought that, Luna, now a very sizable 5,671lbs, had bent Rarity over and proceeded to ram into her with her royal shaft while urging anypony nearby to stick as many of their own swollen cocks as they could fit inside of all of her holes. A clamoring crown of ponies swarmed all over her, eager for a release as they all humped and fucked whatever of Luna's they could. Luna moaned and cried out, lightning striking in the sky as she cried out and felt orgasm after orgasm impact her as her body swelled out from taking in so much pony cum. As she grew big enough to accommodate more suitors, they took whatever chance they could in ramming inside of her while those who had to settle for fucking her rolls of fat moaned as they felt Luna's further adipose body press against them, making them spray their loads inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">BUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP!!!!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's deafening roar of a belch (which was oddly, in some way, adapted to the Royal Voice) caused ponies in front of her to lose balance and tumble over as she let loose. Celestia licked her lips as she felt her own shaft rise with arousal as she watched the wild spectacle before her. She was so wrapped up in her own pleasure, as she drifted off to imagine studly colts plowing into her while being fed infinite amounts of cake as her royal bulbous body spread outwards and began to cover the whole world with her flab, she failed to see...</span></div></div>",

All the fattening magic the seed contained was bloating her body at an exponential pace now. Rolls of sweet, juicy adipose were added to her body at a rapid rate as her lovers cummed inside her, releasing a cascade of hot, salty jizz into every hole, crease and fold in her body, making her midnight blue coat slick and covered in a film of semen.Her damp mane drooped and dripped with gallons upon gallons of cum. 7,000...10,000....15,000....20,000... 27,539 lbs!!! Her weight shot off the charts as she caught up to her solar sister in weight and began to eclipse her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...RAINBOW DASH!! WILT THOU COME HITHER AND FILL MINE GULLET WITH THINE THICK, WARM SEED??\" , Luna boomed using her thunderous voice, which had become even louder as she had gotten fatter.<br>\r\n\"I'll be right there my Princess!!\", Rainbow Dash replied obediently as a Wonderbolt reporting for duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rainbow Dash flew over to her princess as fast as her swollen, house-sized body would allow. Flying had been her forte, and even now she showed prowess compared to her plump pegasi peers, but her wings had become laden with flab much like the rest of her body and she broke out in a sweat that trickled down her face and out of her many chins and rolls. Her mouth was opened wide as she thought of how...delicious her fuck with nearly 30,000 lbs of hot, sweaty and cum drenched flab of Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a considerable battle with gravity, Rainbow Dash had flown over Luna's bulging chest and belly and was now above the multitude of chins and the bulbous cheeks of Luna's face. Luna saw Rainbow Dash rise above her prodigious girth and thought of how subtle yet delicious the cyan pegasus'  creamy ambrosia was going to taste as warm globs of it shot down her gluttonous throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HURRY RAINBOW DA....MMMMPHHhhh...\" The midnight blue princess bellowed before she was silenced by Rainbow Dash flying forward and ramming her thick, light blue, fat and veiny cock into her mouth and down the choke point that was the entrance to her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Would any of you?\" Celestia looked down to her futa subjects who were not only nodding but either stroking they're own massive shafts or pleasuring another. Some doing both \"Third I would like us to have a shared sleeping arrangement. Were upon either of us have morning wood the other would be ready to alleviate. And lastly I'll be calling you my BIG baby sister. And obviously still Lu-lu\" Celestia said as she flew atop Luna's massive spire sized cock \"Do you agree?\" Celestia asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded excitedly \"Good. Now then my big baby sister. How would you like me to take it? You're in charge.\" Celestia licked Luna's flare and a big rush of precum went in Celestia's face. Celestia greedily licked up the precum and Luna was shaking with pleasure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-In the b- the- BUTT!\" Luna cried out in pleasure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled as her body swelled. Her already skyscraper sized body growing as she spread her thick giggly legs around Luna's massive cock slowly covering more and more of the flare moaning in pleasure \"You got it, Lu-lu.\" Celestia began shacking her body. And jerking off Luna's massive cock. Despite the size difference Celestia's last drink of Luna's cum was giving Celestia great grip on Luna's cock as she felt it slide further and further into her ass. Luna laid on her back thrusting upwards<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait!\" Celestia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna groaned \"What is it?\" Luna asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's turn over. You'll be able to thrust harder from there.\" Celestia said Luna obliged turning over now she stood over Celestia as Celestia plump frame rested on the cum covered street and Luna resumed thrusting her cock now much harder then before Luna thrust on and on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-oh! Lu-lu!\" Celestia said and Luna briefly looked at Celestia wondering if she was talking or crying out in pleasure \"I-I'm... I love you so much!\" Celestia cried out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's eyes shot open as her cock hardened Celestia cried out blissfully \"I-I love you so much! I... I am your oaf of burden!!!\" Celestia cried out orgasmically<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna writhed as her cock hardened more so Celestia was having trouble mustering words \"Luna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Luna asked gritting her teeth from the pressure of her cock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Celestia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Luna asked still thrusting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was a jerk... back before you... had your episode. I was a horse's ass. I was. I was under a lot of pressure you know?\" Celestia said sadly still Luna thrusted her massive shaft while looking soulfully into Celestia's eyes \"I shouldn't have been so strict on you. I had no right and I was wrong.\" Luna's cock hardened and Celestia shuddered with a dopey smile \"It was my fault you felt so bad about sex and relaxing. But I WAS WRONG!!!\" Celestia cried out as she orgasmed. \"AND I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna cried out in pleasure and Luna's cock swelled beyond belief it was MASSIVE as powerful veins ran up and down it's strong shaft. Luna thrusted so hard her whole fat body shook and Celestia cried out in pleasure as her orgasm intensified \"I AM YOUR OAF OF BURDEN, LU-LU!!!\" Celestia proclaimed  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna shuddered intensely as she smiled \"Thank you for accepting me, Tia.\" Luna smiled and so did Celestia before Celestia saw Luna's cock bulge. But it wasn't getting harder. The bulging started at the base of her shaft and continued up Luna's shaft as the bulge continued it maintained it's size at the base in the gargantuan blue cock going in Celestia before she realized Luna was cumming! And Celestia wondered <i>That's a lot of jizz. If all that goes into me I could get pretty big. And pleasure Lu-Lu even more.</i> Celestia thought as she looked at her jacking off masses <i>But then again... If I pull away and let the jizz spill all over that would mean more for everypony which means everypony would get fatter. Hmm...</i> Celestia thought before deciding to...</span></div></div>",

Celestia looked down seeing the budge in Luna's cock didn't go down but oddly Celestia felt the seaman run through her butt. It felt pleasant but it wasn't the gushing tidal wave she was expecting. She smiled mildly growing slowly before Luna spoke up \"Ti-Tia. I feel kinda of funny in my balls.\" Luna said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Celestia asked trying to look around Luna's massive cock and as Celestia's body slowly grew new fat and a bigger frame she was able to see more and more around Luna's cock soon seeing Luna's thigh folds which were swaying oddly, but soon realizing she wasn't looking at Luna's thighs \"Luna, your balls!\" Celestia exclaimed pointing to Luna's testicles which Luna had a hard time looking at. So she simply put her legs closer to her engorged testicles noticing it to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are they... PULSING!?\" Luna said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!

After that happened Celestia's growth sped up as more and more fat grew around her body.

Finally, pounds of fat packed onto his muscular body, giving him the look of a heavy lifting, heavy eating stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy just whimpered, clutching her head as her memories shifted and body fattened.

I want to LOSE all this fat, not get even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Twilight, the spell is making you get fatter as we speak! There's no point in trying to fight it, we'll just have to roll with it until the spell wears off or you can find a counterspell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had to concede that this did seem like the most logical course of action. The only problem was that since this was an accidental spell, it would take her much longer than normal to find a way to counter it. She was pretty much at the spell's mercy at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she wasn't REALLY hungry right now, but she knew she would be soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll do it,\" Twilight admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Pinkie replied. \"Now you'll be bouncier than ever!

Pinkie was filling her up faster and faster, and Twilight's belly was growing at a visible rate, mounds of fat rolling higher and higher. Unfortunately, she had become too big for her library, but she had managed to teleport herself to an empty field a few miles outside of town. Here she gained, faster and faster, and the more weight she put on, the hungrier she got. She was really starting to enjoy her now 800 pounds of wonderful, soft flesh. Barely mobile, she now got around with mainly her magic, and she usually only moved at all in order to get closer to the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the day of the eating contest arrived. Twilight teleported herself to the entrance of the contest, taking in the competition. There were hundreds of ponies, few of whom she recognized.

Looking out from her library window, the emerging spring made for quite a sight. Birds were nesting in the library's branches, foals were out playing after school, Rarity was approaching with a basket on her back. Twilight glanced back to the road once that last one registered, finding it was indeed her fashionable friend wandering towards her residence, dressed up more than usual. Twilight closed the book she had been reading, and got up just in time to greet her friend at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Twilight Sparkle.\" Rarity greeted her, enunciating her words with that pleasant, not-quite-foreign not-quite-familiar voice of hers. Twilight smiled at her, stepping aside as an unspoken invitation into the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Rarity. Is there anything I can help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. I'm actually looking for company on a little outing I'm having. Would you be free to have lunch out by the park today?\" Rarity asked her, batting her eyelashes. Twilight would have taken the cue if it wasn't for the fact that Rarity couldn't talk without batting her eyelashes... and the fact that Twilight couldn't read social cues if they were printed on billboards. The basket on Rarity's back did in fact look like a picnic basket, and a rather large one at that. Twilight had her answer almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds wonderful! What's the occasion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, first day of spring and all that. I was going to invite Fluttershy, but the poor dear's up to her feathers in newborn animals. It'd be just you and I, if that's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded. \"What should I wear?\" She was referencing Rarity's flowery sundress, all light pinks with a matching wide-brimmed hat. In a world where nudity was normal, going to the effort of putting on a dress seemed a little much for just a picnic. Then again, this was Rarity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just airing out my closet. Feel free to put on any old thing.\" Rarity waved the question away. Twilight did register that nudity was omitted as an option however, so she gave a quick nod and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back.\" It was nearing lunchtime, and it was obvious Rarity was already to go straight to the park. Twilight headed up the stairs, into her bedroom, and towards her dresser. She had a nice light blue saddle that would do nicely. She magicked it up and around her, slipped the buckle into the... into the... Twilight exhaled, feeling the straps of the saddle slide away from each other. Confused, she glanced in the mirror. She looked same as always... but, trying to force the straps into their usual combination, Twilight found her waist being cut in two. Realizing she was keeping Rarity waiting, Twilight let the straps out a little... then a little more... and finally got the saddle in place. She briefly considered finding a hat, but that was really Rarity's thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go.\" She said as she reached the stairs again, finding Rarity waiting patiently. Her friend smiled at her, and they were quickly off for the park. Twilight breathed deep in the spring air, but that only brought attention to the still-snug saddle around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity?\" Twilight caught her friend's attention. \"This might be a silly question, but, since you know so much about fashion and clothes... can saddles shrink? In the wash?\" Her ears flattened against the side of her head, but Rarity gave her a calm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean, dear. Don't worry, nearly everyone finds their wardrobes snug after the winter holidays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? But you look as good as ever!\" Twilight stated it as a fact, But Rarity fluttered her eyelashes even more than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Twilight, you'll give a girl the wrong impression with lines like that. And thank you dear, I do try to watch myself. I really should have warned you after you moved in; Ponyville is an earth pony town, and if you eat like an earth pony, well, I just don't know where they put it all. I wager you've never eaten like you have hear, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gave that some thought, spacing out as they walked. There was sugarcube corner... and sweet apple acres... and of course Twilight had to order in instead of getting school cafeteria food here, and had discovered a few favorite fast-food places... then there were all the parties and celebrations and feasts....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I haven't been watching what I've eaten.\" Twilight said. Now that she was paying attention, it was pretty obvious that her tummy was rounder than it used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the risk of giving the wrong impression.\" Rarity told her. \"You look marvelous, dear. It would be a shame for you to ruin your figure, because you have <i>quite</i> the figure. Just take care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's cheeks were burning, but she smiled, her ears perking up. \"Thanks Rarity. Maybe I just need some new outfits then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that would be so much fun. Perhaps we can discuss something over lunch?\" Rarity offered. Twilight nodded, liking the sound of that. She had a figure? Who knew!</span></div></div>",

I have the loveliest blue pearl earrings that would go excellent with a nice summer dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but maybe I'll hold off...\" Twilight sat and talked with Rarity, looking occasionally at the remains of their lunch. The picnic had gone rather swimmingly, but Twilight should have expected Rarity to pack light. The unicorn ate like a mouse, and the salad she had offered Twilight was a far cry from the country food and pastries Twilight had indulged in so recently. Still, she wasn't going to be rude and cut their conversation short because of her appetite. She tried to tell herself she should be eating more like Rarity anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's entirely up to you of course. But do come by, we could have such fun.\" Rarity ended with, need I say it, a quick flutter of her eyelashes. Twilight nodded, taking the signal that they were finishing up here anyway. Sure enough, Rarity stood up, and Twilight quickly followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has been marvelous dear, I'll be sure to invite you again.\" Rarity said, packing up everything quickly with the aid of her magic. Twilight smiled at her, rather glad she had come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for inviting me. And thanks for the advice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even worry about it dear. And remember, come by whenever you can.\" With that, she and Rarity began to walk their separate ways. Twilight originally intended to head straight back home, get back to her studying, but her belly complained at her. A salad was a palette cleanser, not a meal, and it was now well past her lunch time. Twilight frowned. When had she last even eaten a salad before today? She knew she wasn't going to be able to focus on her studies with this in the way, so decided to pick something light up on the way. Luckily, there was a sandwich shop Twilight favored on the way. The pony running it reminded her a lot of pony joe, from the doughnut shop, a kind of big fellow whose face just invited you to sit and wile away the hours with him. Of course, it also did pick-up and ordering out. She entered the shop, finding herself lucky as there was no line for this time of day<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodday Twilight.\" The stallion at the counter greeted her by name, a personal touch she liked. \"The usual I presume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes plea- I, I mean...\" Twilight was too late, he had already turned away to prepare the meal. She had answered the question automatically, realizing that quite the routine had developed between them here. Suddenly, the fact that she was known by name, had a regular meal, and knew that meal was too big for a \"light lunch\" all came to Twilight. Her ears flattened in shame. Too awkward to ask the stallion to stop after she had gone and answered like that, Twilight swore to herself she'd eat a little and give the rest to Spike. The sandwich in question was a big sub stuffed with every type of flower and diced vegetable under the sun, with enough salad dressing to drown a chicken in. Of course, Twilight thought to herself, she had eaten this pretty regularly and not put on more then ten pounds in a few months, so perhaps she was overreacting. Perhaps. The large order of hay fries were a little much however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying for her sandwich, Twilight left the sandwich shop in a hurry, still feeling rather ashamed. The more she looked at it, the worse her eating habits actually were. Yet... she had gotten through several months living here and was barely any worse for wear. Probably a combination of a good metabolism and all the energy magic took, now that she thought to herself. And it wasn't like she wanted to diet, in fact the idea seemed rather unappealing overall. But that left her entirely unsure what to do from here on out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, her stomach reminded her, she needed to eat, one way or another. She made it home, finding the library empty. Spike was probably off chasing down unreturned books or something; Twilight gave him a fair bit of autonomy these days so long as he finished his chores. Slave labor wasn't easy to come by after all. So she sat herself back down in front of her book, unwrapped the brown bag her sandwich was in, and got back to studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next half hour, Twilight once again slipped into a bad routine. She munched as she studied, her mind not even on the food she was putting in her mouth. Little had she realized how very much her stomach took over once her brain was occupied elsewhere. She completely forgot her promise to herself, and downed every bite of the sandwich and the fries as well. The fullness that came afterwards also went unnoticed, except for a general feeling of content Twilight had found more common recently. Most of her afternoon came and went, and by dinner time she had forgotten most of her concerns. For once Spike actually cooked, rather than ordering out, so Twilight went to bed feeling okay about herself overall. It wasn't until the next day that she even remembered Rarity's offer for some new clothes, and why she needed new clothes to begin with. Twilight decided she...</span></div></div>",

I'll be gentle.\" The hooker said in a sultry voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shuddered \"So let's go to my place huh?\" The hooker asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh... no thanks. I have a place we can go to.\" Twilight said nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you want baby. I'm all yours.\" The hooker said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they returned to the carriage Twilight nervously sat next to her hooker. The hooker putting a wing just a bit over Twilight's back and she shook. On the ride to the castle Twilight occasionally glanced at her hooker. As she chewed gum and blew bubbles every now and again. The hooker saw Twilight staring and gave her a flirty wink and Twilight shook more so<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning to the castle Twilight was lead to a room of the royal castle to be alone with her hooker \"So uh... how should we do this?\" Twilight asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However you want it.\" The hooker said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Twilight turned away blushing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... this is your first time.

Only to be shocked as her vagina shot outwards right into Twilight's mouth. To Twilight shock and surprise the hooker's vagina became a big throbbing cock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Oh that's right!\" The hooker said her voice becoming deeper as a ripe pair of testicles grew under her engorged shaft<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight made a murmur. Surprised and enjoying giving a blow job to a mare to Twilight's own surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet your wondering why I have such a big cock. Or a cock at all. Well to answer your questions I- hold on a minute.\" The hooker groaned as her cock doubled in size filling more of Twilight's mouth with cock.

You're first time is with ME!

So you PROMISE not to do anything evil during sex?\" Twilight asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I'm on the clock I'll do anything you say. But I won't hard boil an egg in my vagina. That was hard enough once.\" Chrysalis said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you- Never mind!\" Twilight trotted back to the bed and Chrysalis smiled flying over landing next to Twilight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you changed your mind.\" Chrysalis smiled snickering under her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah. Let's do this.\" Twilight said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" Chrysalis grunted and her testicles, grew swelling to the size of apples and her shaft growing to five feet long by a foot and a half as it throbbed she gave Twilight a sultry look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how am I supposed to have sex with that?

After all.\" Chrysalis put her arms around Twilight \"You're my pretty little Princess.\" Twilight pulled away glaring at Chrysalis before grabbing her shaft and began licking it\"And feel free to drink as much of my cum as you want. It can't get a pony pregnant... but you'll sure look pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stroked Chrysalis's shaft and noticed something \"Hey, Chrysalis is your stomach bigger?\" Twilight asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Chrysalis looked at her belly \"Oh yeah. When I eat enough love I get fat. So you better be careful cause I can smell love. And while we're talking.\" Chrysalis made her balls grow even bigger to the size of watermelons \"Oof. That's more like it. Nothing like a big pair hanging between your legs.\" Chrysalis said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah-yeah.\" Twilight said blushing as she sucked Chrysalis's cock</span></div></div>",

Twilight needed somepony to talk to and Rarity really seemed like the best candidate for this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lunch madam,\" a waiter said as he walked by and placed a baked bean burger in front of her. Twilight gulped and salivated somewhat at the sight. She had ordered it on a whim, she never ate the kind of fattening, greasy, salty, saturated, delicious food. However, after the most recent book she read, she was considering making it a part of her regular diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry I'm late, Twilight,\" Rarity said as she sat across the table from her. \"Let's just say Sweetie was trying to be helpful and leave it at that.\" Rarity blinked at the bean burger in front of Twilight and noticed Twilight's hungry gaze. She wasn't making any move to eat it, though. \"Err, dear? Are you going to eat that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity looked confused. \"You ordered that without knowing whether or not you were going to eat it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked up. \"Well, look at it. There's got to a couple hundred calories or so in this thing. I might gain a few pounds after I eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity giggled at her friend. \"Well, I'm not one to judge how fabulous a pony looks... or maybe how 'flabulous.' I don't care that much about looks despite what one might think. However, you must have known what an unhealthy meal you picked when you ordered it. Again; Are you going to eat that? Why aren't you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight bit her lip and levitated a book out of her saddle pack. \"Don't tell anypony about this, alright? This is Spike's diary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scandalous!\" Rarity said with a grin. \"I didn't think you the type to sneak a peak at other's secrets. What did you find out? Ahem, not that I'm a gossip or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do it on purpose, Rarity. Spike's gone to take care of some business in Canterlot and I had to do some cleaning. While I was cleaning Spike's bed, this fell out to... to a page that was hard <i>not</i> to look at.\" Twilight blushed and allowed Rarity to take the book. The white unicorn opened it and glanced at the first few pages. \"About a third of the way through,\" Twilight. Rarity flipped ahead and her eyes widened. She then giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, how adorable. His crush on me is almost a front. He'd much rather have you over me. How sweet, he's too shy to say anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more,\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity skimmed over the next few pages and her cheeks puffed out as she tried to hold in a laugh. \"Oh my... Oh my goodness. Is this real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's blush deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, he's written fantasies.\" She turned a page. \"Oh my, he's drawn pictures!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's face turned red. \"Sshhh! Not so loud! You want all of Ponyville to hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dear, but this is certainly a discovery. Our own little Spikey Wikey, a chubby chaser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blanked somewhat. \"There's a name for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity sighed. \"You poor sheltered thing. I guess I should be happy you don't know about naughtier things. This is quite tame compared to other... body related fantasies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's blush faded. \"But this is okay? You're okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Twilight, are you planning to indulge in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight grinned bashfully. \"Well, I... I've always liked Spike. Maybe as a brother, but according to 'Lovely Heart's Guide to Colts' Spike fits the requirements for the perfect coltfriend. I just never really considered it until I found this. And I've always tried to be thin so I can at least be presentable to ponies. But if I could eat what I want and still have somepony like Spike, well then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then eat up,\" Rarity said as she waved a waiter over. \"Excuse me, we need more burgers please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight burped and rubbed her distended belly. \"Did I really just do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity magically stacked the ten or so plates that once held food. \"I'm certainly impressed. You might be able to hold your own against Pinkie in an eating contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" Twilight moaned with a silly grin. It had felt so good to indulge like that. Her thought wondered to some of Spike's writings and she imagined laying in bed while Spike spoon fed her dinner and all the had to do was chew. This seemed like a great idea all of a sudden. \"That was great, but I couldn't eat another bite. I'm going to need help If I want to get as big as I can before Spike gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity clapped her hooves. \"Surprise him, will you? Excellent.

She was so adorkably innocent. She rubbed it a little more and stifled another petite belch. Her smile looked pleasured as she closed her eyes in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...This feels so good. Maybe I should've stopped worrying about what I eat a long time ago. I could -*YAWN*- get used to this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's eyelids were drooping slightly. It seemed as though that substantially unhealthy meal had made her lethargic. Rarity took this as her queue to help Twilight sleep the food off. This was good. She knew very well that going directly to sleep after overeating sped up weight gain. However, Twilight was falling asleep in her chair while they were still at the cafe. She was probably too tired to teleport or move at all. So, before anypony began to question them, Rarity left the bits on the table and concentrated really hard. Rarity did know how to use teleportation spells, but she didn't use them very often. Let alone use them to teleport two ponies at the same time. It took her much more effort then Twilight ever needed to put into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got it just right. And, just like that, they were both in...</span></div></div>",

So, Rarity opted to let her rest and digest on the couch in the boutique's backroom. Rarity felt a little strange because she was just standing there, staring at Twilight as she laid there unconsciously on her back. But, she thought that Twilight was so adorable while she was stuffed like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Good heavens! She is so CUTE! I can kind of see why Spike would like a mare that loves to eat. Ooooh I just want to cop a feel....But, that would be so wrong! As a lady, I should show restraint, especially for such odd behavior.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, Rarity decided to work on some projects while Twilight was out. After a couple of hours, Twilight woke up with a yawn. As she lifted her head up on the couch, she noticed that her tummy was a little rounder than normal. All of those burgers sure did some damage! Well, for Twilight, it was actually good progress. She was pleased with the quick gain as she giggled to herself. She was playing with the slight chub and loving the feeling of being softer. Rarity stepped into the room and nearly squealed in delight at the adorable display. But, before she could even say something, a rather audible growling noise disrupted both of them. It was then that Twilight was aware of Rarity\u2019s presence. Her ears drooped as she blushed profusely. Rarity knew exactly what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Twilight with a face of playful mockery. \u201cMy, Twilight Sparkle. Are you that hungry again? I would\u2019ve expected you to be done for the day. But, apparently I underestimated your appetite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt very embarrassed, but thrilled at the same time. The burger binge that she had earlier stretched her stomach out and stimulated a little quirk that she always had, but kept under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI usually suppress my appetite so that I don\u2019t become obese. Considering that I was never as active as other ponies. I\u2019ve had a problem with overeating ever since I was a little filly. Obviously, my parents helped me stay fit. But, now that that doesn\u2019t matter to me anymore, I can eat as much as my body has always wanted me to. *GROOOWL* And I know just how to treat it right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight\u2019s expression changed from embarrassed to mischievous. And Rarity was slightly alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what exactly does that entail?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rarity\u2019s mouth gaped as she stared at Twilight in disbelief. Rarity had her eat quite a bit during lunch. But, she didn\u2019t think that Twilight would go so much further for dinner. The pizzas from the local pizzeria were quite large. Three of them alone would be as much as all of the burgers from earlier. Rarity was especially shocked by the specific amount of food. She always knew Twilight as a very calculated mare. But, was that really exactly what she could handle right now? If so, than Twilight\u2019s appetite really was secretly always just as monstrous as Pinkie Pie\u2019s, and nopony ever knew. That must also mean that she is experienced as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just smirked at Rarity. \u201cWell. Are we going or what?\u201d Twilight was already out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity shook her head and sputtered. \u201cU-um, T-Twilight...\u201d Rarity followed her outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity asked in a hushed tone, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you have stayed relatively restricted in your eating habits? How could you possibly know that you can eat all that in one sitting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed again and tried to look away. She made sure to whisper in Rarity\u2019s ear. \u201cW-well. Uh, I have cheated a few times....And...when I did, I would go all out. Whenever I got caught by my parents or Celestia, I was punished or forced to burn off the calories....When I first came to Ponyville, it was the first time I didn\u2019t have somepony to keep me in check. I was confident that I could stay in control on my own. A-and, I was.......f-for the most part.....A couple nights in....I binged while Spike was asleep on half of the order that we are about to make....\" She started breathing quickly as she hesitated to add, \u201cP-p-pizza is my favorite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity just didn\u2019t have anything to say. Twilight Sparkle was filled with surprises today. They both walked for a few minutes until they were in front of the cashier within the pizzeria. He was a lanky, young stallion with brown eyes, a tan coat, and blonde mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Twilight with a smile. The last time she came, which was a while ago, she made a pretty large order for herself. She realized her mistake in saying that it was all for her when it was too late and pleaded that he tell nopony about her visit. She made his boss very happy that night. Most ponies around town couldn\u2019t afford the amount that she bought or just didn\u2019t require so much pizza. She had the same irregular look of gleeful anxiety on her face. He knew what was up. Twilight Sparkle was now well known within the town. However, everypony thought that she wasn\u2019t big on ordering out and eating in general. Even the cashier\u2019s boss didn\u2019t know that she made the order. He put two and two together and figured that Twilight was secretly madly in love with pizza. He understood that she probably restricted herself from it to keep her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well. What can I get for ya, Twilight Sparkle?\u201d, he said in a knowing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was panicking internally. \u201cOh no....\u201d *He remembers me. I didn\u2019t even think about what I said to the cashier last time...* She made sure that nopony else other than Rarity was in the restaurant with her. She sighed heavily then said dully, \u201cHello....um...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCustomer Service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs.....that really your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. Proud of it too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Customer Service, you seem to remember what happened last time I came here. I...I appreciate you not saying anything about it to anypony. Since then, as far as I know, nopony had found out. So, I can only assume that you kept your promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lips have been sealed, Twilight Sparkle. So, you plannin\u2019 on havin\u2019 another binge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recoiled at the question with her eyes the size of pinpricks. Her face was scrunched up and cheeks rosy. She looked like she had been caught stealing from somepony\u2019s house. Rarity was snickering, trying her hardest to hold in her violent laughter and keep her composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier laughed humbly. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, Twilight. We all have our quirks. I\u2019m actually glad to know that you aren\u2019t as plain as most ponies would assume. Now, about your order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was about to say something about his remark on ponies seeing her as plain, but she figured that he meant well. He was right. Everyone has a strange quality or two. Some more than others. And, she and Spike had qualities that went hoof in hoof. It made her realize just how good this decision might turn out. But, enough about that. She had a feast to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight regained her composure and smirked at the cashier. \u201cI\u2019ll have ten cheese pizzas and two 2 liter bottles of soda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing right up! It\u2019ll take a bit though.\u201d Customer Service turned to go into the back to tell the cooks about the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve got some business to take care of that may also take a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity asked, \u201cWhat ever do you mean, Twilight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just pointed to the restroom, then ran in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....Oh.....\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, after Twilight's 'business', she and Rarity decided to teleport back to Carousel Boutique with the pizza feast for her to have some privacy with her shameless gluttony. Once again, she didn't want anypony catching her making an absolute pig of herself at the library. It was more likely to happen now since the day was in the late afternoon. Rarity offered to continue helping her on her quest to become fat for her faithful assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Twilight know, Rarity was a little excited about this venture for her own reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity made sure that nopony could see into her kitchen as Twilight set the pizza boxes on the table. Twilight got a stool and plopped down on it. She was salivating profusely and couldn't wait another second. She felt as if she hadn't eaten in days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer magic flipped open the first box and wrapped around a single slice. It's beautiful, steamy presence was just too much for the little librarian to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to mama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the first bite and moaned in ecstasy. She proceeded to ravenously devour it with zero restraint. The grease splattered all over her cheeks and muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"~Aaaaaahh....Oh my gosh....I love you, pizza....~\" She then remembered that Rarity was right there with her, blushed and frowned. She wanted to just hide away in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity giggled. She floated a handkerchief over to Twilight's face and wiped the grease off. \"Oh, come now, darling. I won't judge you for this. You're safe to indulge as you wish while I'm here. However, you may make a mess in my kitchen if you're going to eat like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Here is my chance...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity blushed, herself. A pizza slice wrapped in blue magic floated towards Twilight. Twilight looked obliviously puzzled by this sudden change of pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....What are you doing?.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-you simply must-er....show SOME restraint....for Spike of course! You want him to enjoy feeding you, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. That is part of the fantasies that he wrote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want him to stay attracted to you as his feedee, there are a few things that you must practice to fancy his taste and really give him the best experience.....A-and....I could be your...your-erm...training feeder?....I-If I may...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....That does make sense. You are really willing to do that for Spike and I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, of course! I will support you two as much as I possibly can!\" Rarity was beginning to get giddy. Her plan was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are a great friend, Rarity. I'm sure that you know a lot more about this 'fetish' stuff than I do. Ooooh, it's like a new subject to study! And, I get to eat what I want because of it! I'm guessing that we should start by letting you feed me? I want to get a feel for being fed by somepony else. Then, I can figure out how to be a better uh....What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feedee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" *GROOWL* Twilight chuckled nervously. The pizza slice that still hovered in Rarity's magic was brought back to her attention. She licked her lips longingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can we start now?\", Twilight whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity smiled lewdly. She had her gluttonous friend right where she wanted her. Spike was going to get his fantasies fulfilled. And, Rarity would reap the temporary benefits. She could indulge in her own interests - while, at the same time - giving all that she could to her best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good to be generous.</span></div></div>",

That's a pretty lazy procedure....But, it does sound nice....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A feeder likes to have relaxed control over his or her lazy glutton. Now, ~be a good little piggy and eat your pizza.~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza slice floated into Twilight's salivated maw. She took a big bite out of it and chewed sloppily before swallowing forcefully. She tried to tear the rest apart like before, but ended up chomping on nothing. Rarity had pulled the slice back after the first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight groaned. \"Rarityyy.\" She whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"~Oh, no no no, my darling piggy.~ You must control your hunger for just a bit. Don't you fret, mamma will fill you up until you can't move soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's now rosy cheeks were threatening to put her whole face on fire. Rarity's behavior had thrown her off guard. She felt quite embarrassed about her current situation, now. However, she figured that this was just part of her lesson in being an obedient feedee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. If you are good and pace yourself, I will stuff you up like you've never been before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat remained of the half eaten slice floated back into Twilight's face. She reluctantly took a more modest bite, chewed it properly, and swallowed. The slice moved in again as she repeated. Soon enough, the slice was gone. \"MMmmmm.\" Rarity continued to feed her like this for four more slices. Leaving only two left for the first pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh...mmmmm...\" Twilight rubbed her soft middle contently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had to admit, it wasn't getting into her at a pace that she was used to, but she was able to further savor the taste. Her body became less tense as she relaxed with the wonderful sensation in her mouth and belly. This was the laziest she had ever felt while eating. She was putting almost no effort while Rarity filled her. However, Twilight was getting nowhere near full. In fact, she was feeling hungrier than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You a very good eater, dear.\" Rarity wrapped the last two slices in her magic and put one on top of the other like a sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is your reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity had the pizza approach Twilight a little faster. The double slice sandwich was gently crammed into her. Twilight moaned as she chewed up enough of it to fill her cheeks. The remaining half of the slice sandwich pulled away to give Twilight time to swallow the first. Twilight swallowed, and rubbed her tummy in delight. She licked her lips as the other half floated over. Rarity allowed her to greedily devour it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMMMMPH! *GUUULP* *sigh*.....*BURP* Rarity....have you done this before?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-why....of course not, darling!...What ever would give you that idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wondering. That was absolutely brilliant! You really know how to spoil me. I don\u2019t think that I could ever not do that with pizza, now! Now, give me more!!...I-I mean....You may continue...\u201d She blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, dear...\u201d *That was close.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity continued with the second by stuffing Twilight with two slices at a time. The feeding was going faster and slightly looser as both Rarity and Twilight began to get further into it. Twilight even took pleasure in allowing Rarity to pat and rub her slowly hardening middle when they were done with the second pie. Unladylike belches and more playful behavior released as the third pie got demolished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BRAAAAAAPT* Twilight giggled adorably. \"WOO! I am such a pig! But, I love it! I am pretty thirsty, Rare. Why don't I show you how to chug a two litter bottle of soda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid bottle hissed as the cap came off. The purple, adorably nerdy mare chugged and chugged, rapidly draining the bottle of it's contents. Twilight was looking bloated and drunk on gluttony at this point. She seemed more loopy and brash. And, Rarity was starting to get anxious and sweaty because of it. She bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*This is, as Rainbow would say, getting pretty hot. Oh, Spike, you are so lucky.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loudest and longest belch that Rarity had ever heard in her life had punctuated Twilight's victory over the high-calorie soft drink. She could've sworn that the fine china on the shelves of her kitchen had rattled slightly during her friend's thunder. Rarity just stared in awe as Twilight hiccuped and giggled in a drunken stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Twilight noticed the staring, her face turned beet red. \"S-soooo.....R-Rarity-*HIC*-how am I doing as a feedee? *uuurrrrp*\" She rubbed her spherical middle and waited nervously for Rarity's answer. *Oh no. Did I do something wrong?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's face was neutral and sweaty. Another handkerchief floated over in her magic and started wiping the sweat away as she continued to stare expressionlessly. She was using all of the masterful composure that she had trained over all of her years of practicing proper etiquette that she could muster. It was nearly physically straining not to let loose and grope and stuff Twilight furiously. She would probably do even more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling.....might I say....that you are truly the fastest learner in all of Equestria? No wonder Celestia chose you as her student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-*HIC*-you're just saying that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity began to approach this beautiful mare. \"No, really. Spike is going to have everything that he wanted out of you and more, dear. Now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity hopped onto the table and sat in front of her voracious student. The fourth pizza box magically opened. The entire pie floated out. Twilight's eyes became glossy and dilated. Her jaw slacked, and drool dripped profusely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha...What are you doing, Rarity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slices were broken up. One of them went into Rarity hoof. With her free hoof, she gently massaged Twilight's tight paunch. The librarian's cheeks puffed out into a low burp. She closed her eyes and moaned in pleasure as Rarity continued to help her digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna make you blow up like a parade float. A very heavy, adorable, and over inflated one at that. And, you will enjoy it so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity pushes her whole hoof into Twilight's snout. The pizza slice filling up her cheeks. She chewed it up passionately, swallowing it whole and hard. Rarity could actually feel the belly expand from the acceptance of the morsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked at Rarity with a lewd smile. \"Then I hope Spike can handle all of me by then. Otherwise, your responsible for making me too big for him to take. Not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. Twilight, please. When you were moved here, you probably would've had to be carried by TEN pegasus soldiers if you weren't disciplined beforehoof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n One by one the slices fell. Twilight's stomach getting closer and closer to the table she was sitting in front of. Fourth pie; fifth pie; sixth pie. At this point Twilight was so stuffed and bloated that she was close to becoming completely round. She opted to lay on her back as Rarity laid on top of her. The second soda bottle was empty and, before they knew it, Twilight had devoured ten pizza pies by herself. She in an immediate food coma after that. A round, hardened, purple ball filled with cheese, tomato sauce, crust, soda and grease slept soundly on the fashionista's kitchen floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily, I learned this spell while she was asleep, after lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cast a digestion spell that would allow Twilight to process all of that food over night. She wasn't confident in her ability to move her friend out of the kitchen, safely. So, she moved a sofa into it and laid Twilight on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dreams, my dorky porker. You'll probably be a little bigger by tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Right now she was reading an interesting book over magical theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">In the fifth year of Princess Celestia reign, Starswirl the Bearded proposed that while Unicorns were born with a certain amount of magic, this amount could increase. Starswirl believed that since magic came from the pony's lifeforce, to increase the amount of magic a Unicorn had to somehow increase their own lifeforce. While there have been differing opinions on the true definition of a lifeforce, Starswirl associated with the condition of a pony's body. If a Unicorn was sickly, then they would have less magical potential, while if a Unicorn was healthy, then they would have greater magical potential. Now, while being healthy increases magical potential, it does not significantly increases the amount of magic. To do this a pony will have to do one of two options. One way is to increase one's physical fitness is one way to increase one's lifeforce and the amount of magic a pony has. The second way is to increase one's girth. The second option was theorized by Starswirl to not only be the easiest option, but the most effective of the two options. Since fat is essentially stored energy, it is theoretical that a Unicorn's would become more powerful or be able to sustain a spell for a longer period of time. However, nopony has ever tested Starswirl's theory, and thus remains a mystery today.</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight tapped a hoof on her chin. <i>Why has nopony tried this yet? After all, Starswirl was right about everything he researched.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat for a few more minutes, then pulled out a blank research journal, labeling it 'Testing Starswirl's Magic Increase Theory, Second Way.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight hated physical exercise, and it was theorized that it was the least beneficial. Plus, she could pack on a few pounds in a short amount of time and get results quickly. Nodding, she got up and grabbed her saddlebags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike! I'm going to Sugarcube Corner and the Market Square!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for a reply, Twilight left to begin her experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Two Months Later&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sat on a very comfortable cushion in Rarity's house, having been invited to come over and have tea. The past two months had been successful in Twilight's mind, though down right horrifying to her friends and mentor. Twilight had gone from a thin, sleek mare to a soft mass of flesh. Her underbelly hung down close her knees but not quite, she had acquired a second chin, her legs looked like she was wearing thick Winter gear and her sides bulged out to look like she was wearing saddlebags. Rarity was sitting across from her in her classic sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So darling, I was wondering when I might have a chance to measure you again? You have outgrown my last measurements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight pulled out her schedule, ignoring Rarity's stab at her recent acquisition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm free for tomorrow. I can't do a measurement right this moment though, got studying to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's stomach let out a low growl. Twilight didn't even blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's quite alright dear. I after all do need to buy a new tape measure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll be here tomorrow afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight waddled out of the shop, leaving a mildly fuming Rarity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Twilight reached the library, she was a sweating, huffing mess. She never really left the library these days, not since discovering that Sugarcube Corner delivered, along with several other fast food restaurants in Ponyville. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need to start teleporting to places. It would give me more feedback on any increases in my magic anyways.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight made her way into the kitchen. She had installed several refrigerators and the cabinets were never empty. Pulling eight pizzas from the refrigerators along with a large double chocolate cake and several bottles of apple soda. She was <i>very</i> hungry. Rarity had made a point not to feed Twilight any food, so she was without access to her snacks and one of her six square meals a day for more than a hour. She quickly heated the pizzas with her magic and set them down on the dinner table, lowering her wide rump onto a familiar cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ripped out a large chunk out of a helpless pizza and bit into the cheesy goodness. Her starving belly let out a growl for more, to which Twilight obliged. She dug into three of the pizzas before taking a guzzle of apple soda. Twilight settled into a routine of eating a large slice of pizza before taking a gulp of the soda. By the time she was done, her stomach was slightly protruding. Her attention was soon set on the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a knife from the drawer, she cut a large slice of cake, levitating the chunk of chocolate heaven towards her. She tore through the cake after the first slow, savoring bite. Soon, the cake was gone, leaving no traces other than the smears on Twilight's face. She topped off the cake by draining an entire soda in one go, a feat she was rather proud of. Her belly was now noticeably poking out after her meal. Twilight sat still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bbbbbuuuuuurrrrrrppp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in relief, she heaved herself out of the comfortable cushion, grabbing several extra-large chip bags, some boxes of cupcakes and more soda before making her way to the study room. She snagged a book on Zebra Alchemy she had ordered recently and positioned herself on the second most used cushion in the library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the recent meal, Twilight still snacked. Twilight wasn't even conscious of her eating when she was studying. Her stuffed stomach continued to balloon outwards, though at a slower pace then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her experiment, Spike would have to drag her away from her books. Now, all it took was a lack of snacks or that it was the next meal time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her magic failed to bring the next batch of chips or cupcakes into her mouth, she discovered she was out of food. She got up and moved back to the kitchen. Spike was already there, cooking haycon, eggs, pancakes, and waffles. It was breakfast night. She was about to sit down when Spike turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check the journal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, she opened the journal to find that before she ate, she had to test her magic to see if there were any changes to her level of magic. Her stomach let out a defeated rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight waddled down into the basement to where a block of marble stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore beginning any experiment, one must have a control. Her control was trying to create a realistic golem that though it was a pony. Her first attempt left her exhausted. Her creation was pony in shape, but still looked like a marble statue, and continued to call her 'master' and called itself 'servant,' despite her trying to get the golem to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe channeled magic into her horn, her mind forming the spell. She aimed at the statue...    </span></div></div>",

Pinkie giggled and enveloped her stuffed friend in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     \"Heehee *snort* Oh Twilight you have just the sweetest softest tum-tums,\" the pink pony cooed as she rubbed Twi's belly causing the unicorn to blush. \"It's so warm and snugly and bouncy wouncy just like a woony moon jump if moon jump's were purple and super duper magical like you which everypony knows they aren't of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Partially tuning out the party pony's tidal wave of words, Twilight stretched a bit and carefully leaned back as Pinkie tenderly stroked her large purple stomach. From the first moment she and the hyperactive sweet loving pony had started being \"more than friends\" barely two months ago, she'd never imagined they hit it off this good, or that she'd come to enjoy Pinkie's company this much. Being able to get away from the rigidly hectic orderly life she normally lived, even if it was only a few times a week or month, had practically been like a breath of fresh air for the studious mare. They played, snuggled, goofed off and indulged themselves in various sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Said indulgence, of course, is what had resulted in the current situation the two fillyfriends were in now. Ever since she was foal Twilight had always had a major sweet tooth, yet her studies, magical lessons and the occasional spine tingling adventure had always prevented her from partaking in satisfying her cravings for sugary delights. But now in the company of Ponyville's premier baker and party pony she could finally let her guard down and indulge herself with glee. If she ended up big as a barn because of her binges so be it, being pampered and dotted over by Pinkie was all worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You wanna try my special triple fudge sprinkled blueberry cupcakes?\" Pinkie asked sweetly and eagerly. Twilight snapped out of her stupor and to her surprise and slight pleasure, found herself suddenly hungry in spite of all the pastries she'd consumed early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I...  I guess I can try some, \" Twilight wiped her mouth when she caught herself drooling at the mention of fudge. \"I've always got room for those cupcakes of you-BRAAAAAAPPPPPPPPTTTTTTTT!!\" the unicorn was cut off as she let out a huge belch. Pinkie laughed and snorted loudly as her stuffed marefriend blushed deeply in embarrassment. \"Oh my I'm so sorry Pinkie, it's just that I'm so full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Pinkie just smiled and giggled in amusement, \"Oh Twilight you don't have to apologize silly, especially since you make just the bestest belchy welchies\" she chirped as she bounced over to a table in the room and came back with a large tray of freshly baked cupcakes and other treats. Mouth watering in anticipation Twilight instantly levitated a cupcake off the tray and greedily wolfed it down, followed soon by another and then a big piece of banana cream cake. Pinkie soon joined in the gluttony as she scarfed down a few jelly beans and cherry turnovers, watching gleefully as Twi's belly grow bigger and rounder with each sugary good she devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Pretty soon after thirty minutes of non stop eating....    </span></div></div>",

The scholar unicorn couldn't recall the last time she'd eaten so much, not even on her first visit to Ponyville when she'd stuffed herself silly with Applejack's apple pies. Now she and Pinkie were lying in the pink pony's loft, bloated like dairy cows that'd eaten an entire century's worth of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Mmmmm those were the greatest bestest donuts we've ever had.\" the pink mare chirped as she rubbed her massively engorged stomach.

Pinkie's beaming face blushed a mild shade of scarlet as she hefted herself onto her hind legs and struck a confident pose. \"Now that's what I call a real knock 'em flat belchy welchy...\" the two hundred plus pound mare declared before settling back down on her rump with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Yeah well you are bigger than me Pinkie, though not by much,\" Twilight teased as she waddled over to her plumped up fillyfriend. The two jumbo sized ponies shared a quick smooch and rubbed noses as Twilight reclined against Pinkie's bloated stuffed tummy, the pink pony turned over and playfully rubbed and poked at her companion's stuffed belly, \"Ahhhhhh being big and soft feels soooo amazing, \" she said with a happy sigh and murr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Pinkie couldn't help but break out in a loud chortle \"Hehe well due, I told you being chubby wubbly marefriends would be super duper fun, \" she stated in her delightfully cheery voice. \"We can eat as many sweets as we like and then cuddle and snuggle into each other's big softy comfy tum-tums and have burping contests and after chubby pony marefriend bedtime eat even more goodies and then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Alright Pinkie I get the idea, \" Twilight interrupted with a laugh. Pinkie merely beamed her trademark carefree smile at her. The two ponies nuzzled and rubbed each others guts for a few seconds before Pinkie suddenly spoke up. \"Hey Twilight I just got a really really super duper idea,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n      \"Oh, what is it Pinkie?\" the portly unicorn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Well, it's two months since we started being marefriends and all our friends are soooo happy for us and since it's gonna be our Two Monthiversary on Saturday I wanted to throw us all a big <i>Twilight and Pinkie Two Monthiversary It's Fun Being A Chubby Pony</i> party!!\"  Pinkie explained all in one breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"That's a great idea Pinkie, the girls will love it,\" Twilight answered happily.

The sun gently rose above the clouds as a certain lavender unicorn pony rose from her bed. Bringing a hoof up to rub some of the sleep from her eyes, she smiled gently, glancing to her side to see the snoozing pegasus she'd been spending so much time with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dash...\" She called softly, gently nudging the pony, rustling her mane with her snout. \"Rainbow Dash, come on, it's time to get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pegasus simply rolled over with a groan and pulled the blankets closer to herself. The unicorn's face fell as she blew a lock of her purple hair out of her eyes. \"Oh, I see.\" She smirked playfully. \"Well, I happen to know a spot on you that is just perfect for... TICKLING!\" She shouted, laughing as she reached over and began to dance her hooves across the spot between Dash's wings, making her eyes shoot open as she started to giggle uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, alright! I'm *hehe* up!\" Rainbow Dash snorted as she sat up in bed and smiled at Twilight. Leaning in to rub her cheek against the unicorn's, Rainbow stretched. \"Ugh, what's so important you're waking me up on my day off? It's clear skies today, so you know us weather ponies don't have to do anything but burst some clouds, and I can do that in my free time.\" She said, her tone almost making it sound as though she were bragging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We were going to have a picnic today, remember? And if we want everything ready and made by lunch time, we'll have to work most of the morning.\" She teased, making Rainbow laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But neither of us can cook, Twi!\" She teased, grinning broadly as she hopped out of bed, stretching her back and wings. \"Can't we just have Spike make us something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight put a hoof to her chin in thought and sighed. \"Well... Alright. But we can at least make breakfast. And maybe you can swing by Sweet Apple Acres and get us a few pies, and fritters... Ooh, and maybe some candied apples!\" Her eyes shone at the thought and her stomach growled as she looked to Rainbow Dash expectantly, making the pegasus snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sheesh, Twilight, I think my eating habits are rubbing off on ya'!. Come on, let's go get some eggs and toast.\" She said, nodding to the stairway, her trim form and rainbow mane strolling away with pride. Twilight couldn't help but bite her lower lip as she watched her go, making a move to follow her before pausing, catching her reflection in the mirror. Maybe Dash was right. She definitely had been eating a lot more... Walking to the mirror, she tilted her head as she looked herself over, from head to hooves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From the front, she could see her face had thickened a bit, her neck now puffing outward and making a second chin. Reaching a hoof up to touch it, she sighed. \"I guess it's not too bad, right?\" She asked her reflection, whose chin bounced and wobbled in response, making her grumble. She blinked, looking down her softer front to notice something... Her belly seemed to be hanging a good deal lower. Turning to the side, she watched it bounce as she turned. It was certainly a lot bigger than it had been before! Hanging heavily between her thicker back legs, it bounced a bit whenever she moved. Pressing a hoof against it, she blushed as she realized how soft it was... \"I guess that's why Dash said I made such a nice pillow...\" She mused, her eyes turning back to her thicker flank. Taking an experimental step, she watched it jiggle a bit as she did. Had it been doing that with every hoof-fall? \"Somepony might need to start watching what they eat...\" She mumbled, the flabbier, 100 pound pony continuing to examine herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Twi, get down here! Breakfast is ready!\" Rainbow Dash called from the kitchen, making the purple unicorn snap out of her ogglings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Be right down!\" She called as she descended the stairs, some worrying thoughts forming in her head as she did. Did Dash think she was fat? Had her friends noticed? And most importantly... What if Rainbow Dash didn't find her attractive after this?! Her eyes widened and her ears flattened at the thought. A landslide of negative thinking followed that thought as she headed for the kitchen, gulping as she sighted the rainbow tail of her marefriend. Sitting at the table across from her, Twilight looked at her food nervously. It looked like half a loaf of bread and a dozen eggs were scrambled just for this meal! And Dash was eating just as much! 'Ugh, why does she get such a good metabolism?' Twilight thought to herself with a huff before taking a cautious bite, smiling as she started eating quickly now, almost out of habit... Sometimes she and Dash would even have competitions on who could eat the most the fastest. Those were always fun. She blushed at the thought before looking up at the pegasus who was scarfing down some toast. \"Hey... Dash?\" She began cautiously, a bit unsure as to how to approach this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow Dash looked up from her food and tilted her head, a bit of egg speckling her snout as she looked at Twilight Sparkle quizzically. \"Yeah, Twi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you think I've um...\" The unicorn began, tracing a circle on the table with her hoof, gulping as she asked, \"Do you think I've been getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow Dash blinked, bursting out laughing before saying...</span></div></div>",

The first day of it had been a frenzy of food, the ponies eating enough to feed a family for a week in one night. Of course, the two already had quite the capacity, so, they didn't get too awful of a tummy-ache, but, the night ended with them snuggling up in bed, their guts gurgling as they digested the feast inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This became their daily routine, though. Get up, eat, go to bed. Rainbow Dash decided to finally use all of her saved up vacation time and take the whole month off, and Twilight still managed to her job, writing the occasional letter to the Princess, who was a bit confused by all the food stains on it. Still, the two ponies had never been happier than they were now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At the moment, Twilight was sitting downstairs, reading as she snacked on some pie that Applejack had so kindly brought by. She hummed lightly as she turned the page with her magic, licking her lips as she took another bite of the delightful baked treat. Where once a chubby mare had been, a truly fat filly now sat. Twilight was out and out flabby, having gained 100 pounds in the past three weeks, putting her just over 200. Burping loudly, she smiled. Her large belly rested on the floor from her seated position, it was clearly her biggest part. It wobbled and shook with every waddle she made, pressing against her much thicker legs, visible easily from all angles now, even bulging past her sides a ways! Her face was thick and round, with two chipmunk cheeks that made her squint a bit, and her neck was thick and adorned with extra chins that pressed against her fatter, softer front. Glancing at the clock on the wall, she smiled. \"Rainbow, it's time for lunch!\" She called to her marefriend who called back. \"Yeah, yeah, be right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some heavy hoof-falls followed as the cyan pegasus made her way downstairs, and when she came into view Twilight Sparkle couldn't help but bite her lip and grin. Rainbow Dash was out and out huge. Her once toned, trim form was now even fatter and flabbier than Twilight's! The former fastest flyer in all of Equestria now looked more like the fastest eater. The now 235 pound pegasus smiled at Twilight as she huffed a bit, clearly tired from the short waddle downstairs, making the unicorn giggle. Her triple-chinned face jiggled as she caught her breath, her thick neck forming rolls at just about every joint. Beneath her, her jiggling belly hung low to the ground, occasionally scraping against it when she walked... Soon, she'd have to drag it along. Twilight liked the thought of that. Licking her lips, she nodded. \"Let's go into the kitchen, shall we?\" She asked, making Rainbow nod and turn to reveal her crowning achievement, her flank. Easily the width of two ponies now, almost three, Rainbow Dash had the fattest flank in all of Ponyville. It wobbled and bounced as she walked, swaying back and forth behind her, rolling down into her fat, thick hindlegs. Twilight grinned at the sight and waddled happily behind her. She was loving the new Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight grunted as she plopped down at the table, leaning across to rub noses with Dash who giggled as they did. \"Yeesh, Twilight, you've been really lovey dovey since we got so fat, you know that?\" She teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded happily and kissed her marefriend, saying, \"Of course... I dunno, Dash, something about you being all big and soft is just so... Amazing.\" She said with a happy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash laughed, rolling her eyes, \"Sheesh, Twilight, you're enjoying this even more than I am, and I'm the one who wanted you big in the first place.\" She teased with a chuckle. \"Now, come on, let's eat!\"</span></div></div>",

Twilight pushed the door open and headed inside, Rainbow following after her, feeling her fat flank and bloated belly brush the door frame and bump against the stairs as they went. Blushing brightly, she headed inside. Seeing Mrs. Cake at the counter, Twilight grinned. \"Heya Mrs. Cake, is Pinkie Pie around?\" She asked, looking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The stunned mare took a second to regain her composure before nodding. \"Um, yes, she's in the kitchen!

You two got all flabby! That's so cool! I've always wondered what it would be like to be all chubbly-wubbly, but, never really did it. Is it like swimming in marshmallows?

Applejack had a rather sizeable gut, Rarity's flank was flabby and wobbled as she walked in, and Fluttershy definitely wasn't that soft the last time they'd seen her! Blushing, Twilight said, \"Wow, um... Hi girls... I don't mean to be rude, but... how did you all get so... Well, fat?\" She did her best to approach the subject tenderly, not sure how the others felt about their gains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Rarity began, putting a hoof to her chest, \"I can't speak for Applejack or Fluttershy...

Apparently, thin is no longer in!\" She said, grinning. \"So, when I heard about everyone plumping up, I simply had to join in, And I think I carry it fabulously, don't you all? And now, I've decided to convert my Boutique into one of the first plus-size stores in Equestria! I'm getting custom orders from all over!

The Princess was enormous! Easily 500 pounds of white pony now stood before them, her jowled face grinning as she walked inside, somehow still graceful despite the fact she was dragging a belly the size of Twilight along the ground beneath her. Her flank was so wide that two ponies could stand nose to tail behind her and still be hidden from view.

Sure, she was the envy of every nobles' wants, desires, and love (especially given her current corpulent size and girth). However, she had lived long enough to not be fooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, some members of the rich upper class were quite duplicitous, only caring about advancing their hooves on more power to their ambitious agendas, not once caring about her feelings of romance, which only hardened her heart just a smidge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, it was thanks to Twilight that her heart had softened, both figuratively and quite literally. Thus, here she was at this moment, scouring through various letters sent to her by numerous suitors, most of which were stacked in a rather substantial pile, as if discarded out of immediate rejection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* This is getting me absolutely nowhere. So much for an easy transition into dating.\" She sighed, furrowing her brow, whilst she subconsciously rubbed the frontmost section of her voluminous white belly, since she was currently in a sitting position within her private quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But then again, I have been out of touch for some time now.\" She audibly contemplated, to which her thoughts would be abruptly intruded upon as a feminine voice rang out, \"--And hear we thought thou would be more contemporary than us, dear sister.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Celestia easily recognized her guest, as she slowly turned her plump head around, only to gaze upon her younger sister, Princess Luna. A smile calmly encroached upon the obese Alicorn's cherubic face, as if relieved to see her nocturnal sibling once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd much like their celestial counterparts, so too were their physical shapes. Whilst Celestia had become an all-out elephantine Princess, Luna retained a surprisingly thinner physique than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, <i>mostly</i> thinner physique, as Luna was currently sporting a bit more svelte curves this time around, as the two Alicorn sisters proceeded to embrace one another for a brief moment, Celestia's gargantuan belly practically smothering Luna's smaller form, whilst Celestia promptly quipped, \"*chuckle* Oh you have no idea, Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...What is this all about, dear sister of thine?\" Luna questioned, to which slowly lowered her head as if with shame, huffing out a deep sigh, then looked back at the dark blue Alicorn and explained, \"...The truth is, Luna, I...I, um...I-I want to have a marefriend again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...Marefriend? Like your student and her friend?\" Luna asked, to which the rotund Celestia confimed with a hefty nod, where she then continued, \"...Look, I know what you're probably going to say. We shouldn't be having romantic affairs due to our duties as rulers of Equestria and all that. I remember my duty all too well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...why now, sister? Clearly, there are plenty of suitors to choose from.\" Luna retorted, motioning her right forehoof towards the large stack of discarded letters before them to which her much fatter sister swiftly answered, \"--That's because all those letters are from suitors who seem more interested in raising their social status, rather than wanting to give me love and affection like a true romance should.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing such an answer from her more corpulent sibling, Luna obtained a better grasp and comprehension of the situation Celestia had found herself in, as Celestia subconsciously lowered her head with an almost depressed motion to it. In response, Luna calmly placed a forehoof upon Celestia's rounder flabby shoulders in reassurance and understanding to which she then said, \"...Thy now see why thou has not chosen a suitor so hastily.  Thou seek true romance, correct?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Celestia gave a few hefty nods, then (as quickly as her fat could physically allow) wrapped her plump forehooves around her thinner sister out of sheer comfort, with a few small tears streaming down her rounder face, damping her fur a little, where she soon replied, \"*sniffle* *sniffle* Yes... Yes... I want a real romance again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing such a sorrowful tone coming from her fatter sister's tongue, Luna couldn't help but feel empathetic towards Celestia's romance-related plight, which caused her just to tighten her hug amongst her older sibling's burgeoning gut, as if her forehooves could fully sink into the folds of adipose at any given moment. After all that had happened as of late between them, Luna felt like she owed it to Celestia to see her gentle smile once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather surprising idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an almost sheepish smile creeped up on her snout, Luna soon began to speak towards her larger sibling and said, \"...Thy think we know a way to relieve thou of such regrets.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ...And what do you have in mind, Luna?\" Celestia answered, now bearing an almost somber tone in her soothing voice, while the two siblings ended their familial embrace, to which the blue Alicorn promptly retorted, \"Thou shall see soon, sister. But for now, please get some rest. It seems thou most undoubtedly needs it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, as they said their goodnights to one another, Celestia heated herself up and waddled over to her sun-shaped bed, lumbering onto it as she used her Alicorn magic to levitate a bedsheet corner to cover her enormous self up for the night, while Luna calmly exited her sister's personal quarters, quietly closing the massive doors behind her with a muffled *Click-Clack!* in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The synapses in her subconscious paddled to and fro on what sort of plan she could concoct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she approached the massive double doors to her left, the same sheepish grin appeared once more, where she then decided to enter the room that laid behind the enormous doors, which revealed quite an expansive bedroom. And yet, as she made her way through the neatly strewn piles of tomes, books, and encyclopedias that formed all around her,Luna came upon a familiar sight to her for some time:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA somewhat chubby Unicorn mare, who bore pale yellow fur, a mane and tail in red and two-tone purple streaks. She wore a rather snug yet stretchy dark purple turtleneck sweater, as her violet eyes lingered upon a massive tome propped up by several stacks of encyclopedias, while said eyes hid behind a pair of rigid eyeglasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one name came to Luna's mind as to the identity of the plump studious mare when she finally spoke her name:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moon Dancer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing her name, along with recognizing the voice, Moon Dancer jolted from her sitting position out of reactionary shock, causing the opened tomes she levitate with her magic to quickly get flung across the room in separate directions, which caused her somewhat plump physique to briefly ripple and jiggle with such abrupt locomotion, as she quickly turned herself around to greet the nocturnal Alicorn princess and stammered, \"Oh! Uh, P-Princess Luna! I-I didn't expect you t-to visit me so early.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tis quite alright, Moon Dancer. Our apologies for disrupting your studies.\" Luna apologized, to which Moon Dancer quickly retorted, \"No no! It's not a problem, Princess! I, uh...I-I was just about to finish up my studies for the day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Moon Dancer used her Unicorn magic to promptly close the enormous tome she was reading from out of some hesitant servant-like gesture towards her superior, with a somewhat embarrassed expression upon her slightly chubby face. Ever since she had returned from her banishment, as well as being reverted from her form as Nightmare Moon, Luna noted how Celestia had Twilight Sparkle as her favored student, Luna felt somewhat jealous of this aspiration of a mentor-pupil relkationship between Celestia and her proteg\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, out of some sort of minute sibling jealousy, Luna sought out a student of her own to teach and mentor, which ultimately led her to the acutely intelligent yet introvert Moon Dancer. Ever since then, Moon Dancer has been living within the Royal Palace as Luna's personal student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, due to the obvious overabundance of food and harvests currently in Equestria, Moon Dancer wasn't truly immune to the snowball effect that has every mare in Equestria unwittingly packing on the pounds, though it was surprisingly kept in check via extensive studying of various tomes within the Canterlot Royal Library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, shortly after the two mares greeted one another with a friendly hug, Moon Dancer quickly noted a slightly somber look in her mentor's pristine shimmering eyes, which made the redhead mare all the more concerned, where she then looked back at her beloved mentor and curiously asked, \"...Is...Is there something wrong, Princess? You seem...distressed, about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing how astute her pupil was to even the most minute of details, Luna figured she might as well confess what's troubling her, to which she exhaled a deep sigh and explained, \"...Are you familiar with my elder sister, Moon Dancer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You mean Princess Celestia? Of course, Princess Luna! Everypony knows who she is!\" Moon Dancer swiftly yet bluntly retorted, to which her brilliant mind soon connected the proverbial dots, where she soon spoke with a more subtle tone and cautiously asked, \"...Why are you asking me this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ...Thy will not sugar-coat this predicament, dear Moon Dancer, but...Thy dear sister...she seems to have troubling matters concerning affairs of the heart.\" Luna inevitably confessed, to which gave a surprised expression on Moon Dancer's equine face and snout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I-I wasn't aware of such a thing, Princess. Would it be okay to elaborate on this further?\" Moon Dancer carefully asked, now aware of how problematic the situation was. In response, Luna once more exhaled a deep somber breath, her head leaning just slightly downwards and retorted, \"...It seems like the best course of action as of now, my dear student.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Luna sat down alongside her chubbier student, who listened very keenly on what her nocturnal mentor had to confess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd confess did the Princess of the Night do...</span></div></div>",

Suffice to say, even though she wouldn't outright admit it in broad daylight, she legitimately missed the conversations she had with Celestia's late lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as her mentor told her this story, Moon Dancer couldn't help but feel...<i>sympathetic</i> towards both her mentor and Celestia as a whole. Sure, the two Alicorn sisters were definitively immortal, and had lived rather long lives, but...when one thinks deeply into such an extended lifespan, it becomes a rather lonesome life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriends and loved ones slowly aging into passing away whilst only Celestia and Luna retained their youth, watching as their entire world changes over time as the years, decades, even centuries pass by them. In response to developing such sympathy, Moon Dancer slowly place a forehoof upon Luna's own forehoof, showing her mentor how she empathized with her plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Moon Dancer felt unable to help relieve her mentor of such depression, slowly opening her mouth to speak but unable to gather the right words to concoct into a sentence, just as Luna unexpectedly nudged her head lightly into Moon Dancer's rounder shoulder out of comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Are you...feeling alright, Princess Luna?\" Moon Dancer hesitantly asked, to which Luna quickly recollected herself after such a brief moment of letting her guard down, where she then calmly retorted, \"...W-We are fine now, Moon Dancer. Forgive us for Our moment of weakness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* It's alright, Princess. I, uh...Just wanted to thank you for telling me this.\" She calmly stated, reassuring her mentor for opening up about what troubled her. In response, Luna nodded in a subtle manner, thanking her student for listening to her tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ...To be honest, Princess, I...I-I honestly never thought that Princess Celestia was really into Mares...you know? I-I don't mean any offense, but...I thought she was more into Stallions.\" Moon Dancer continued, which caused Luna to let out an amused chuckle before she explained, \"At first...she was, Moon Dancer. However, We soon learned she was more interested in Mares during Our second to third century as Equestria's monarchs. *sigh* If only <i>She</i> were still among the living to see Equestria as it is today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...She sounds like an interesting pony to be around.\" Moon Dancer retorted, putting a slightly chubby forehoof around Luna's slightly plump but still robust back area, just above the Alicorn's enormous feathery wings. From there, as a small but brief upward curve of her lips occurred, Luna looked back at her chubbier student and replied, \"...Indeed she was. We hold few ponies in Our hearts that We consider dear to Us. <i>She</i> was one of those We held dear, Moon Dancer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Moon Dancer could easily see how important this mare was to both her mentor and Princess Celestia, just as another question arose within Moon Dancer's incredible intellect, where she calm herself down a little and asked, \"...I take it that Princess Celestia wants to fall in love again, correct?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes. Thou are correct, thy dear student.\" Luna flatly answered, confirming the obvious to her eidetic student, as Moon Dancer then asked, \"And I'm guessing you have a plan of sorts to help Princess Celestia find another lover, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, a small but too noticeable smile slowly appeared on Luna's equine snout upon hearing the question, to which she stated, \"...Indeed, thy student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as if unexpected, Moon Dancer soon spoke toward her mentor with an affirmative tone and said, \"...If you're willing to help your sister find love once more...then count me in.\" Suffice to say, it undoubtedly surprised the nocturnal Alicorn, as her eyes widened some to express her reaction, as if felt almost uncharacteristic of Moon Dancer to assist somepony in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with such a surprising confirmation, Luna felt reassured of her student's voluntary assistance, as Moon Dancer seemed itching to assist her mentor by any means necessary, as she swiftly questioned, \"So... Who do you have in mind for Celestia, Princess?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, with an almost uncanny twinkle in her moonlit eyes, Luna...</span></div></div>",

Originally turned on by each other's bodies, they began to increasingly find their own frames sexy, riding the high that came from having a partner that loved every inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Twi, lookit what I can do.\" Dash caught Twilight's attention one day as they were in the library. She backed up towards Twilight, which drew Twilight's eye given those massive bouncing flanks, her cutie mark stretched three times its original size. Then she simply let her front hooves off the ground, pivoting on her massive belly. This brought her flanks - and her sex - right up to head level with Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they say size is supposed to make this har-Twi! Down here!?\" Dash was interrupted as Twilight stuck her muzzle right between those gigantic cheeks, her head completely absorbed by warm, inviting fat. Dash's cheeks reddened as she began to pant from Twilight's efforts. She was actually completely unable to get away if she wanted to - her front hooves might have been strong enough to get her back up, if it wasn't for Twilight having sat back and kneading Dash's flanks with her own forelegs. She began to rub Dash's cutie mark, and all thoughts of resisting left Rainbow's mind.

Ever since she was a little filly, Twilight has always had what her parents called a \u2018healthy appetite\u2019, she was always seen munching on a number of snacks while she studied and it had only continued to grow as she got older during her studies under Princess Celestia. It was therefore no big surprise that time, Twilight changed into the 180 pound pony she is now. A thick layer of fat wrapped round her legs and back while her large stomach hung down and shook as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the search, Spike shifted a set of books across the bookcase he was looking through and spotted what he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found them!\u201d Spike yelled lifting the box of cupcakes up above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job Spike.\u201d Twilight smiled and used her magic to take the cupcakes from her young assistant and quickly took a bite out of one of them, \u201cYum!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point Spike burped up a scroll from Princess Celestia,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh a letter from the Princess.\u201d Twilight said as she finished the cupcake and started on another one, \u201cwhat does it say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike quickly unrolled the letter and, clearing his throat, began to read,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dearest, most faithful student Twilight,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I am glad to see you having quite an interest in continuing your studies, it has come to my attention that you have become, to kindly put it, quite overweight.

Up and at\u2019em Granny, we got guest\u201d AJ called over to an elderly pony, who slowly made her way to the table with the rest of the Apple family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Applejack continued to list family members and food based items their named after, Twilight stared at the various baked goods, never have seen so many sweets and pastries in place before, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, they look so good and delicious and\u2026 hhmmm.\u201d the unicorn scholar quickly became lost in thought. For a moment, Spike and the Apple family watched puzzled as Twilight sat there, eyes glazed and drooling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr, is she always like this?\u201d Applejack asked Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwi? Twilight? Snap out of it!\u201d Spike said, giving the fat pony the sharp nudge in her flabby side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh! Sorry. Everything looks great. It looks the food situation is taken care of.\u201d Twilight said, trying to cover her embarrassment at zoning out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we best be going.\u201d Spike spoke up, \u201cWe got a lot of others tasks to check up on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to stay for brunch?\u201d Applejack\u2019s sister, Applebloom asked, looking pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Twilight hungrily eyed the large amount of food that Applejack and her family had presented  and smiled, \u201cI\u2019m sure I could stay and have a apple fritter or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, Twilight was already digging into her forth apple based baked good.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had never seen a pony ever eat as much as Twilight did. For the past several hours, the purple gray unicorn had so far managed to eat her way though enough baked goods to have feed three pony of Big Macintosh\u2019s size for two week and, apart from one moment where it liked she was going to be sick, Twilight was still going strong and the effects of her eating were clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight\u2019s belly had swelled out by several feet further then it did before, covering her lap as she sat at the table. Twilight\u2019s rear end took up enough space for two seats and well on it way to overflowing on to a third. Three new chins framed her face, as she stuffed another cupcake into her fat cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese have to be the tastiest apples, I ever tasked.\u201d Twilight said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s why Sweet Apple Acres apples are the best in Equestria.\u201d Applejack said, a proud grin on her face, Twilight\u2019s complement having snapped her out of her surprised stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be nice having so many family members around.\u201d Twilight said, wanting to get to know Applejack better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, they don\u2019t live here, they\u2019re just here for the family get together. The only ponys living here are just me, mah sister and brother and Granny. The others have their own farms to take care of.\u201d the farm pony<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo ya\u2019re new here, right?\u201d Applejack said, \u201cWhere did you all come from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe came from Canterlot.\u201d Twilight answered as she took a partially large bite out of a slice of apple pie. I was studying there as a student to Princess Celestia and Spike helped as my assistant.\u201d At this, Applejack\u2019s eyes widened in amazement,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know the Princess?\u201d the orange pony said with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded and wolfed down the rest of the pie slice, \u201cSure do. She was the one who sent me here. She wanted me to make some friends\u2026 and she also said to get some exercise.\u201d she added hesitantly, \u201cApparently, she thought I need to do more then just sit around and\u2026 eat\u2026snacks\u2026all\u2026day\u2026\u201d the words faltered from Twilight\u2019s mouth as soon as she realised what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia had sent Twilight to Ponyville to do more then study and eat snacks and yet here she was, sitting there, stuffing her face with enough food to feed a family of ponys. Twilight looked over at Applejack embarrassed, wondering what the farm pony thought of her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must think I\u2019m a complete pig. I just stuffed my face. The purple gray unicorn thought as she looked at Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Applejack,\u201d Twilight looked down ashamed, the action making her newly gained chins all the more apparent, \u201cYou and your family have been so kind and welcoming and all I\u2019ve here I am, stuffing myself with food while going on going on about how I\u2019m suppose to be not doing that. Oh what you must think of me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack however, instead of giving the insulting or rude remakes she had expected, gave Twilight a friendly smile,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t ya fret none about nothing.\u201d Applejack said, \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing the Apple family respect apart from hard work and honesty is a pony who enjoys their food. Now, Ah\u2019ll be honest with ya when ah say ya do need to do more then just sit an\u2019 eat, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with being on the big side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Twilight asked, looking a bit happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang tooting.\u201d Applejack nodded, \u201cAh may need to make a bit more, next time ah invite ya round for lunch, but ah got no problem with ya weight, friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor awhile Twilight just sat there, looking unsure about something, but then broke into a bright smiled and wrapped her front hoofs round the orange earth pony, squishing her in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Applejack.\u201d the purple gray pony said, \u201cI\u2019m glad to have meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSawks Twilight,\u201d Applejack replied, \u201cAh ain\u2019t nothing special, but ah\u2019m as pleased as punch to be ya friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, Applejack.\u201d Twilight pulled another pie closer and, using her magic, split the pie in half, sharing it with Applejack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwilight!\u201d Spike spoke up, \u201cWe have to go! We got other things to check up on and we\u2019ve been here for hours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww Spike.\u201d Twilight moaned. She had enjoyed her time with Applejack and would rather stay, but knew Spike was right. It was starting to get late and they need to make sure that all preparation were done before the Princess arrived for the Summer Sun Celebration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get going.\u201d Twilight said, slowly pulling herself out of her seat, \u201cSorry Applejack, looks like I got to get going. Maybe we can meet up later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Twilight and the baby dragon went on  their way, her now larger belly and flank turning the unicorn\u2019s walk into a full blown waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the food for the celebration is taken care of,\u201d Spike said, checking off the list, \u201cunless you just ate it all.\u201d he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed slightly in embarrassment, feeling guilty for her binge, but still gave the little dragon a stare that warned him to stop with the jokes.<br>\r\n\u201cIn any case, we\u2019re know running late with checking up on the preparations, we still need to make sure the weather, decorations and music is all done before tonight.\u201d Spike continued, \u201cWe best shake a leg and no distractions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpike, I\u2019m the oldest out of the two of and you\u2019re still a baby dragon.\u201d Twilight replied with a chuckle, \u201cIf anyone out of the two of us is going to be distracted it would most likely be y- hey, is that a bakery?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You already ate not that long ago and we\u2019re behind schedule as it is.\u201d Spike said as Twilight opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Spike, we\u2019re just only going in for a few minutes.\u201d Twilight replied back and entered the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Twilight\u2019s eyes widened. Cakes and baked goods lined every wall and table in the room, making the purple unicorn\u2019s mouth water, \u201cOh my.\u201d she said, \u201cEverything looks so\u2026 delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, they sure are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight jumped, not an easy task for a pony weighing close to 290lbs to do, when she noticed the pink pony suddenly standing next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha- where did you- who?\u201d Twilight stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, welcome to Sugar cube Corner. I\u2019m Pinkie pie, I work here, helping Mr and Mrs Cake make all the goodies you see here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hello, I\u2019m Twilight Sparkle and this is Spike.\u201d Twilight said, a bit nervous at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Twilight, welcome to Ponyville. I know you\u2019re new here cus I\u2019ve never seen you before and I know every pony here and I mean EVERY Pony. So if you\u2019re new then that means you don\u2019t know any ponys here yet and if you don\u2019t know any ponys then that means you could do with some friends to help you. So, I could be your friend and help get to know everyone round here.\u201d Pinkie Pie said hardly pausing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blinked slightly at the pink pony\u2018s energetic response, but quickly recovered and replied, \u201cThanks, Pinkie Pie, that is nice of you to offer.\u201d Twilight looked round at all of the cakes, \u201cIt must be great working here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie nodded energetically, \u201cYep, sure  it. So what I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2026\u201d Twilight began to say when she suddenly felt a bubbling sensation welling up in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUURRRRPPPPP!\u201d the purple unicorn let out a huge belch that shook the room and causing her own ample frame to jiggle. As the belch died down, Twilight blushed in deep embarrassment, worried what Pinkie Pie thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second pause, Pinkie Pie bust out laughing, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeheehee that was a really good one, Twilight. I\u2019ve tried many types of fizzy drinks but I never ever managed to make a belch as big or loud as that. You\u2019re really good at belching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm thanks,\u201d Twilight replied with a nervous chuckle, \u201canyway, I\u2019m here to help make sure everything is ready for the Summer Sun Celebration when I saw this place and thought I\u2018d have a look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Well nice of you to come visit even though there must be so many other places you need to be.\u201d the pink pony said with a bright smile, \u201cWhile you\u2019re here would you like to try some our treats? We make some great cupcakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Twilight was about to say no to the offer when her stomach intervened, growling despite the large meal she had not so long ago. Giving an small chuckle, the purple pony replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Sure Pinkie, I would love to try some.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Twilight, you already had a large brunch when we were over at Applejack\u2019s.\u201d Spike tried to protest, but Twilight quickly hushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but it\u2019s just a little snack\u201d she said as Pinkie Pie quickly went brought out a tray filled with a number cakes and sweets for the two ponys to share. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, they look so\u2026 tasty.\u201d Twilight said her, mouth watering,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey sure are,\u201d Pinkie Pie smiled, \u201cgo ahead and try one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight took one of the cupcakes and ate it, nearly devouring the treat in one bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, I was right.\u201d Twilight said, \u201cThese cupcakes are  great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on and have another, there\u2018s plenty to go around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I think I will\u201d Twilight said, taking another cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks again for the cupcakes, Pinkie Pie, I had a great time.\u201d Twilight said. Her latest binge, while small compared to her last one, was still enough to add a few more inches of fat to the purple pony\u2019s already large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd thank you for the complement on the cupcakes.\u201d Pinkie Pie replied with the biggest smile Twilight had ever seen on a pony. Before either of the two ponies could say anything else, Spike cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright that\u2019s enough.\u201d the baby dragon said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been here for an hour now and there\u2019s still a number of tasks we need to complete before the celebration. Besides, aren\u2019t you suppose to be cutting back on the snacks?\u201d as he said this last part, Spike gave Twilight a meaningful stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gave an embarrassed smile as she recalled Princess Celestia\u2019s orders and spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight Spike.\u201d she said and looked back over to Pinkie, \u201cI got to go, see you later.\u201d with that, Twilight turned to leave, but ended up stuck in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm a little help?\u201d Twilight said, her face flushed with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing!\u201d Pinkie Pie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike sighed as he and Pinkie Pie walked over to the large rear blocking the doorway  and began to push. After awhile and a lot of pushing, Twilight eventually came free with a pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d Twilight said to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome Twilight,\u201d Pinkie said, smiling brightly \u201cthanks for your visit, see you soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and Spike soon headed off on their way, Twilight\u2019s large weight slowing her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Twilight, \u201d Spike said, a hint of annoyance in his voice, \u201cWe\u2019re way behind schedule now. We have to hurry if we\u2019re going to be ready in time. So no more stopping for snacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, Spike, I\u2019m sorry, but I just couldn\u2019t help myself. They all looked so good and tasty.\u201d Twilight said, blushing deeply, \u201cI promise I won\u2019t let myself get carried away till we\u2019re done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roll of his eyes, Spike returned his attention back to the checklist, \u201cOkay, next up is weather, A Pegasus pony named Rainbow Dash is in charge of clearing the sky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up in the sky, Twilight couldn\u2019t see any sign of the Pegasus, but a few clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she doesn\u2019t seem to be doing a good job on it.\u201d the purple pony said, irritated, but before she could say anything else, Twilight heard a sudden whooshing sound approaching along with a yell of ,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight suddenly felt something colliding into her pudgy side and bouncing off, into a large mud puddle. Turning to look, Twilight and Spike saw that a blue Pegasus getting up from the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that could have went a lot worse.\u201d the blue pony muttered to herself as she got to her hooves<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr hello, I take it you\u2019re Rainbow Dash, right?\u201d Twilight asked, slightly embarrassed about what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the mud off of herself, the blue Pegasus nodded, \u201cThe one and only.\u201d she said, taking off into the air and hovered in front of Twilight, \u201cwhy? Have you heard of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard you were suppose to be keeping the sky clear.\u201d the purple unicorn replied,  \u201cMy name is Twilight Sparkle and the Princess sent me to check on the weather for the Summer Sun Celebration.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. It\u2019ll be a snap. I\u2019ll do it in a jiffy, just as soon as I\u2019m done practicing.\u201d Rainbow Dash said as she flew up onto a nearby cloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPracticing? Practicing for what?\u201d Twilight asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Wonderbolts.\u201d Rainbow Dash replied, pointing to a nearby poster of the airail team in question, \u201cThey\u2019re gonna perform at the celebration tomorrow, and I\u2019m gonna show them my stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Wonderbolts?\u201d the tubby unicorn said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe most talented flyers in all of Equestria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft. Please.\u201d Twilight scoffed, \u201cThey\u2019d never accept a Pegasus who can\u2019t even keep the sky clear for one measly day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I could clear the sky in ten seconds flat.\u201d Rainbow Dash retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProve it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rainbow maned Pegasus shot a glare at Twilight before quickly speeding off, zooming from cloud to cloud, kicking each one into nothing as she passed them, the purple pony watched in a surprise as Rainbow Dash succeeds in clearing the sky within ten seconds as she claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoop-de-loop around and wham! That\u2019s ten seconds flat.\u201d Rainbow said as she landed in front of Twilight, \u201cSee? I\u2018d never leave Ponyville hanging.\u201d she then chuckled as she saw the surprised expression on Twilight\u2019s face, \u201cHaha, you should see the look on your face, bet you wish you could move even half as fast as that with those tubby legs pf yours, ha you\u2019re a great laugh, Twilight Sparkle, I can\u2019t wait to hang out with you some more. Later.\u201d and with that, Rainbow Dash speed off to wherever she planned to practice her flying next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, She was awesome!\u201d Spike said, clearly impressed with Rainbow Dash\u2019s flying skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight, on the other hoof, gave a exasperated sigh and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the next thing on the list. Spike?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Following his pointed finger, Twilight saw a white unicorn at the other end of the room, sorting through a series of ribbons.  Twilight watched as Spike began rambling about how he looked and if his spines were straight. Clearly the baby dragon was developing a crush on the white unicorn. Figuring that she was the pony in charge of decorating, Twilight walked over and began to introduce herself,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m-\u201d before Twilight could finish, the white unicorn cut her off,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne moment please,\u201d the unicorn said, not looking round, \u201cI\u2019m in the zone as it were.\u201c After a minute, she nodded in satisfaction at the latest bow she had tied round the pillar she was standing by, \u201cAh yes, sparkles always does the trick, does it not?

Now then, what can I do for you?\u201d The unicorn apparently named Rarity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m here to see how the decorations for the celebrations are\u2026\u201d Twilight faltered as she suddenly felt a bubbling sensation building up in her belly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, not again! She thought as she tried to held it in, but all that food she had gobbled down at Applejack\u2019s and then Pinkie\u2019s places coupled with Rainbow Dash\u2019s crash into the tubby unicorn\u2019s belly shaking it about causing a build up of gas which then about resulting in the purple unicorn letting a belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy word!\u201d Rarity gasped, her face scrunching in disgust, \u201cReally dear, that is not the way for proper lady to act. And your appearance\u2026\u201d at this she levitated a mirror out of her saddle bag and holding it up for Twilight to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked in the mirror, at the fat purple unicorn looking back. Her mane was a mess from the gusts of wind caused by Rainbow Dash\u2019s clearing of the sky and the crumbs and frosting of all the baked goods she ate all day covered the fat cheeks that framed her face along with the three chins. Twilight\u2019s ears folded back in embarrassment as she realised what a mass she looked. Before she could apologise for her burp, Rarity began leading her out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wait! Where are we going?\u201d the purple unicorn said as Rarity continued to gentle push her along the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t worry darling, I\u2019m just taking you over to my boutique. We\u2019re going to tidy up your appearance just a bit.\u201d the white unicorn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two ponies and baby dragon were at Rarity\u2019s boutique and the white unicorn had Twilight\u2019s mane styled, face cleaned and had her put on one of the dresses Rarity had in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 No, no, too blue.\u201d Rarity decided after awhile,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s.. kinda tight as well.\u201d Twilight added, the dress having been designed for a pony a third of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm yes, I must apologise, I don\u2019t much work for the plus size side of the fashion business.\u201d Rarity said as she helped Twilight out of the outfit. Rarity then hurried over to her work room, levitating a number outfits and dresses with her, \u201cWait here a moment would you dear? I\u2019ll be back just as soon as make a few adjustments to make these dresses more suited for a mare of your\u2026physic.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rarity left, Twilight looked down at her hooves, her face flushed with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she amazing?\u201d Spike said, finally snapping out of his love struck trance now that the white unicorn had left the room, \u201cit\u2019s great of her adjusting those outfits to be more suited for your \u201cphysic\u201d whatever that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was just putting it in a nice way of saying she was resizing them to fit a pony as fat as me.\u201d Twilight explained to the baby dragon, feeling even more depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed and looked at herself in the mirror. Fat cheeks and a couple of chins that wobbled as she talked, her belly bulging out, pressing against her front and hind legs which were also wrapped in a thick layer of fat. Twilight began to pace round the room causing her belly to sway like a pudgy pendulum while large flanks wobbled and jiggled with each step she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I even still here? I have left and gotten on with the rest of the preparations so I can get to the library.\u201d Twilight wondered aloud when Rarity returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d the white unicorn said with some satisfaction of a well done job, \u201cthese dresses should fit you a lot better now.\u201d she then began to look through the dresses to pick one out, \u201cNow let\u2019s see\u2026 hmm, perhaps something in black? It\u2019s quite slimming and of course it\u2019s such a wonderful colour, simple yet bold at the same time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity continued on like this as she had Twilight try on different outfits, looking for the one she thought would be right for the purple unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, Twilight, you were telling me where you were from?\u201d Rarity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m from Canterlot.\u201d Twilight answered. At this Rarity stopped in her tracks and looked at Twilight, wide eyed in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCanterlot? Oh, I am so envious. I have always dreamed of living there, the glamour, the sophistication. I can\u2019t wait to hear all about it. We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I.\u201d Rarity said, smiling brightly as she stood close to the purple unicorn as if they were already old friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmerald? What was I thinking?\u201d Rarity suddenly said, taking a good look at the gem stones in the outfit Twilight was wearing, \u201cLet me get you some rubies.\u201d she then headed off to fetch the gems in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate the generosity, Rarity, but I-I really should get going.\u201d Twilight told Rarity as she quickly wiggled herself out of the dress she was wearing and then hurried for the door, dragging Spike along side her, \u201cQuick! let\u2019s go before she decides to dye my coat a different colour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gasped for air as she tried to catch her breath, exhausted from her run from Rarity\u2019s boutique to the meadow which, according to Spike, is where they would find the pony in charge of the musical entertainment for the celebration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre *huff* we *puff* almost done?\u201d Twilight wheezed, looking up at the sky to see it was starting to get late. All she wanted to do was to finally get to the library and rest, for once, Twilight decided studying can wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Twi, all that is left is music.\u201d Spike replied, \u201cnow according to one of the ponies I asked back in town told me the pony in charge are practising out here in this meadow.\u201d Sure enough, the two soon heard the sound of a choir birds signing. Investing the sound, Twilight and Spike found the choir of birds, being directed a yellow pegasus with a pink mane.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight hesitated a moment as she thought about what to do. On the one hoof she was tired of all of the going around town doing these task, especially since she didn\u2019t really wanted to come to Ponyville in the first place, but on the other hoof, she had been asked by Princess Celestial to do this task and she never shied away from a given duty. So with a sigh, Twilight began to approach the yellow Pegasus and prepared to introduce herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached, Twilight listened to the singing birds being directed by the pink mane pony, finding it to be amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello.\u201d At Twilight\u2019s words, the yellow Pegasus jumped in fright and the bird choir flew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t mean to scare off your birds.\u201d Twilight explained, \u201cI came to check up on the music for the celebration. It sounded very beautiful\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Landing on the ground, the Pegasus stood in front of Twilight and, avoiding the purple unicorn\u2019s gaze, shuffled her hooves bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Twilight Sparkle.\u201d the tubby unicorn introduced herself, but the Pegasus didn\u2019t answer and just continued to shuffle her hooves, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm\u2026I\u2019m Fluttershy.\u201d  the yellow pony mumbled, not making direct eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what was that?\u201d Twilight asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Fluttershy.\u201d the Pegasus replied in a barely audible whisper,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t quite catch that.\u201d Twilight said, at this Fluttershy didn\u2019t replied and simply gave what sounded a scared whimper. After a few more moments of silence, Twilight decided to gave up and continue with more important things, such as getting some lunch,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell goodbye, I guess.\u201d Twilight said and trotted off back to where Spike was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was easy.\u201d Twilight said to Spike as she approached the baby dragon when suddenly she heard a gasp of excitement. The yellow Pegasus, having seen Spike, had rushed over, looking at Spike with keen interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA real baby Dragon?\u201d the pink maned pony said, this time speaking at audible level, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a baby dragon before.  He\u2019s so cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s about time somepony recognised that.\u201d Spike said, smiling in a smug way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, he can talks. I didn\u2019t know Dragons could talk, that\u2019s so wonderful, I just don\u2019t know what to say!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, in that case we\u2019d better get going.\u201d Twilight spoke up, trying to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d  the butter yellow Pegasus called, moving to follow the unicorn and dragon, \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Spike\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chello Spike, I\u2019m Fluttershy.\u201d The yellow pony said, \u201cwow a talking dragon, and what do dragons talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell, what do you want to know?\u201d Spike asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely everything.\u201d Fluttershy said with keen excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, first of all, I started off as this cutest little egg with spots\u2026\u201d Spike began to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight groan in despair as she realised that was going to be a long time before she could get to the liberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so after that, Princess Celestia suggested we try and use some soap to loosen it. And that\u2019s how we finally managed to get to get Twilight free from the bucket and since she learned an important lesson on watching where and what you sit down on.\u201d Spike finished his story with a snigger as Fluttershy listened to the baby dragon\u2019s tales of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight on the other hoof, was starting to wish she hadn\u2019t approached the Pegasus. Since seeing Spike, Fluttershy wanted to know everything Spike had seen and done, including all the embarrassing stuff that has happened to Twilight such as the time she got her flank stuck in a bucket or even the time during one of her pastry binges, she had ended up swallowing  a letter from Celestia thinking it was a Swiss roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two ponies and baby dragon reach the tree house that was the library that Twilight and Spike  were to live in during their time in Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh will you look at that, we\u2019re here already.\u201d Twilight said, trying to change the subject before Spike tells another embarrassing story, \u201cWell it\u2019s been great talking with you, Fluttershy, but this is where I\u2019m staying while in Ponyville and Spike really needs his sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t-\u201d Spike said before Twilight quickly silenced him by making him full off his sitting spot on her back, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, wook at dat, he\u2019s so sweepy he can\u2019t even keep his widdle abeyance!\u201d the purple unicorn said talking in baby talk to Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww poor thing\u201d Fluttershy said, picking Spike up, \u201cyou simply must get into bed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, we\u2019ll get right on that, well g\u2019night\u201d Twilight said, quickly taking Spike and heading into the library and closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRude much?\u201d Spike said, as Twilight lowered him to the ground and began looking for the light switch,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Spike, but I have a lot of studying and I certainly wasn\u2019t going to let you tell her another one of those embarrassing stories. Now, where\u2019s the lights?\u201d As if on que the lights suddenly came on, revealing the room to be filled with lots of ponies and a filmier pink pony jumping out in front of the tubby scholar.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSurprise!\u201d Pinkie Pie yelled, \u201cWelcome to Ponyville\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGAH! Pinkie, what are you doing here?\u201d Twilight said after quickly recovering from the fright she got, \u201cCome to that what are all these ponies doing here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell obviously it\u2019s a party, see?\u201d Pinkie Pie said as matter of factly, \u201cSee after you left Sugercube Corner I thought to myself, since you\u2019re new here that means you don\u2019t know many ponies here yet, which I though was \u201coh dear that\u2019s just so terrible.\u201d so then I thought why not just throw you a party and invite everypony. Now now you have lots of friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gave an exasperated sigh as she realised this meant her plans to study were over as she doubt she could focus with such a party going on, but on the other hoof, it wasn\u2019t like the time she spent with Pinkie at Sugercube Corner wasn\u2019t fun and she could see that Pinie had set out quite a number of snacks for the party.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first pony outside of court officials she had really interacted with, and it was easy to see she doted on the pony, becoming almost a second mother to her. And with Twilight's hard schedule studying, Celestia took any opportunity to provide the pony with a little enjoyment. At first this simply meant a sweet here or there, and making sure she had plenty for dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure one more scoop won't hurt anypony, hmm?\" Celestia asked, smiling to the little filly who looked up at her with such eager eyes. Nopony had smiled at her so eagerly and sincerely before. If all it took was a little extra sweets, nopony was worse off. The chef serving their dessert smiled and nodded, sure that the little girl was just big for her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I have seconds?\" A slightly older Twilight asked of Celestia, earning a ready nod from the princess. Twilight was burying herself in her books more often these days, but at the table they had time to talk. So the longer she stayed at the table, the better. The waiters around the table traded a glance, knowing better than to say anything about the way the young pony's midsection creased as she leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, come, it's Nightmare Night, you used to love this time of year!\" Celestia did her best to keep her regal composure, but she was worried at how distracted Twilight was these days. A big pudgy pony, her flanks spreading out beneath her like a pillow, didn't even look up from her books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a foal's holiday Princess, and I need to study!\" Twilight replied, her extra chin wobbling as she spoke. Celestia wasn't going to let this be however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the candy? I took the liberty of gathering some for you.\" Celestia levitated a huge pile of sweets up from behind her. She would have her time with Twilight, no matter what it took. Sure enough, Twilight looked up, lips already wet with saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later, Celestia watched her pudgy prodigy waddle away from an invitation to a birthday party. Twilight's size hadn't even entered Celestia's mind as a problem, despite the way that Twilight's belly hung low between her legs, slapping against huge wobbling thighs as she walked, or the way she looked to be carrying saddlebags everywhere she went given her huge sides, or even the way either flank was wider than a regular pony, great big pillows o fat. No, Celestia had no problem with Twilight's size, and it wasn't like ponies typically suffered from weight-related diseases. But Twilight was so closed off that even Celestia couldn't get her to spend time together. The first pony in centuries she had connected with was a total misanthrope. Fortunately, Celestia had a plan. She needed somepony at the summer sun Celebration, which just happened to be at...</span></div></div>",

Ponyville in particular was a hot spot for sweetmakers and bakers, and Celestia had glad that it had ended up bing the summer sun celebration's location, because Twilight would surely fit in. There was of course the matter of her sister's fated return, but the goddess-pony was already pretty sure she knew how that was going to play out. Happy coincidences were nice however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when a letter came from Twilight about her studies, Celestia pounced on the opportunity.</span></div></div>",

The carriage landed in Ponyville, the team of eight pegasus ponies carrying her panting hard. Twilight got off the carriage, which creaked audibly as her massive weight shifted about. Ignoring his employer's struggle to make a simple step down without toppling over, Spike hopped off and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, and I thought it was just Twilight...\" he muttered under his breath. There didn't seem to be a single pony here under 200 pounds, and many probably beat that by a good margin. Even the pegasus ponies had pendulous bellies swaying beneath them as they flew. Pegasus magic was a funny thing, as obviously their wing size shouldn't be able to support even the thinnest pony of their size. So like their legs, how much their wings could lift was really a matter of strength more than one of aerodynamics, and a strong enough pegasus would be able to move even when their feet couldn't touch the ground. Twilight, on the other hoof, just tended to make movement unnecessary thanks to her powerful magic. Spike hoped that she'd get at least a little exercise walking around town today. And maybe if she made some friends she'd have something to do other than eat and yell at him when the fridge *somehow* was empty again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try, Twilight?\" Spike pleaded, gesturing to a random pony walking down the road. She had to be as big as Twilight, but with bigger pouchier cheeks and more weight in her belly, which was only inches away from brushing the ground. Twilight's ears flattened against her head, betraying the fact that all self-important bluster aside, she didn't want to make friends because she didn't know how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, h-hello there.\" she tried, greeting the pink pony in front of them. Suddenly the pony gasped, and leaped up higher than anypony her size had any right jumping. In an instead she was waddling off, belly slapping hard against all four of her legs as it swayed against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooookay.\" Twilight said. \"Let's just get this over with. What's our first stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike sighed. That had gone well. Pulling out his list, he read off Sweet Apple Acres to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go.\" Twilight replied, getting her bearings. Spike walked beside her - you'd think with all that weight she'd be able to handle a little more and let him ride on her, but nooooooo<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a lot of huffing and puffing, Twilight made it to Sweet Apple Acres, spying-</span></div></div>",

All the apples in the trees had been bucked by that mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange pony's left hoof was crossed in front of her left hoof. Her head was in the air, and she smirked delightfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed and sagged her head down onto her chins. \"Let's get this over with..\" she sighed, as she waddled over to the orange mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinny pony looked over. Great. Another obese pony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would just have to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she had dealt with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight finally reached the other mare.

Ah'm Applejack, and we here at the farm sure do like makin' new friends.\" Applejack was shaking the fat hoof of the pony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's fat was jiggling all around, her plot shaking up and down. Her stomach had waves going through them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actuallyyy... Iyyyyyy...\" Twilight tried to speak but the wiggling made her voice sound strange. Applejack finally stopped shaking hooves.

She screamed and was swallowed by the crowd, being carried to the table by 20 ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me introduce y'all, to the Apple Family.\" Applejack grinned.

Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apples, Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp...\" She took a moment to breathe.. \"Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom and Granny Smith.\" Twilight's mouth was watering up to the brim. She never saw as much food as the Apple Family members set out. Then she looked over to Granny Smith. She was skinny. You could see her ribs. \"Up'n'attem, Granny Smith, we got guests!\" Applejack called to the sleeping mare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny Smith's eyes flicked open. She snorted. \"Wha..? Soup's on? I'm up, here I come, ahm comin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked very slowly towards the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Applejack turned to Twilight. \"Why, i'd say yer already part o' the fam'ly!\" She grinned at Twilight and stuffed an Apple Fritter into the purple unicorn's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flavor savored in Twilight's throat. \"Mmmm!\" She licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there by any chance I could have more?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom hopped in front of Twilight. \"O' course!\" she squeaked and jumped away to get her plate. Meanwhile, the Apple Family let out a chorus of 'Huzzah!'s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, once she lifted her flabby neck, Twilight saw that the sky was still full of clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Spike? Who's the pegasus in charge of clearing the sky?\" Twilight had asked slightly irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... It says a pegasus named Rainbow Dash was the one put in charge.\" Spike looked up trying to see if Rainbow Dash was at least heading in this direction, but not a single pegasus was within sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's stra-\" All of a sudden, Spike was cut off from his sentence by the searing pain of a fat, 220lb. pegasus crashing down on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woops! Sorry about that!\" The pegasus had a very distinct rainbow colored mane, so it was easy for Twilight to guess that this was the weather mare who was slacking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Rainbow Dash right?\" Twilight had asked, now even more annoyed as she had just squished her only assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only!\" Rainbow Dash made it pretty clear she had a big ego. \"So I'm guessing you're new around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm from canterlot, I'm here in order to check in on how preparations for the Summer Sun Festival are going for Princess Celestia.\" Twilight had said with yet another reason to be annoyed, though Rainbow Dash still failed to notice her irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! I've been hearing that the Wonderbolts are gonna be performing at the festival! One day, I'm gonna be a part of their team!\" Rainbow spoke with a lot of confidence in her voice, though Twilight could only chuckle under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a little... Fat to be in an extreme stunt flight team?\" Twilight didn't hold back in the slightest because of her previously built up annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Rainbow Dash off guard, but it certainly didn't damage her confidence. \"Sure I'm overweight, but I'm still the best flyer in Ponyville!\" She then carried herself up on top of one the clouds and laid down to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike gasped for air as he was now freed from Rainbow Dash's crushing weight. However, Twilight was still distracted by just how smug the pegasus was. \"Don't you mean LAZIEST flyer in Ponyville? Because you've certainly been slaking on clearing away the clouds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, that. Whatever, I'll prove it to you then! I'll have all these clouds cleared away in ten seconds flat!\" Rainbow Dash was boasting even harder now, which just succeeded to make Twilight even more irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, there's no way a pony your size could do that.\" Twilight began boasting her own confidence, though she'd very quickly eat her own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash did as promised and cleared the area above of clouds in exactly ten seconds leaving Twilight with her jaw dropped. \"I *huff* told ya *puff* I was the fastest!\" Although it was certainly impressive, Twilight knew Rainbow Dash wouldn't be able to take anything more. \"Alright, now that I'm done with that, I've got more important things to do.\" Rainbow Dash flew away with a smug look of victory on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's taken care of.\" Twilight was angrier than ever and Spike was reluctant to speak because of this. \"Spike, what's next on the list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um...\"</span></div></div>",

Deciding to check how decorating was going was the best choice, since it was so close, meaning Twilight wouldn't have to walk much. The building's interior was eloquently decorated with a multitude of deep violet ribbons which were all placed in the perfect places. There were different decorations as well, but the ribbons are what definitely stood out the most. At least to Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the middle of the town hall was a white unicorn with a distinctly fashionable mane admiring her work. She appeared to be about 240 lbs. Still not even close to Twilight's 260 lb. size, but definitely closer, and definitely all that Spike was even paying attention to. \"Hold on, why are you so focused on her?\" Twilight was completely confused by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? Just look at her.\" Spike had the tone of someone who had fallen in love at first sight, and this was indeed the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I see.\" Twilight chuckled under her breath and walked over to the the white unicorn, who she could probably guess who she was. \"You're Rarity, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes! Is there anything I can help you wi- *GASP*\" The overweight unicorn was shocked at the pony she had just laid her eyes on. \"Darling, I must know, what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, my name is Twilight Sparkle\" Twilight failed to see why Rarity seemed so excited towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Twilight would it be okay if I escort you to boutique?\" Rarity was simply beaming with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about the decorations?\" Twilight wanted to make sure things were going as planned, and the pony in charge of decorations leaving in the middle of the job certainly didn't fit that description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The finishing touches can wait!\" Rarity's excitement gave her the energy to run out of the building towards her boutique, despite her size, leaving Twilight with no choice but to follow her, with Spike following right behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Twilight arrived, Rarity had pulled out a long rack of clothing. \"I've finally found somepony who might be the right size for these outfits I made! Please darling, stand over there if you would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity began giving Twilight outfits to try on, one after another. \"So, if I may ask, I don't believe I've seen you here in Ponyville before Twilight, are you new here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was sent here from Canterlot to check how preparations for the Summer Sun Festival were going.\" Twilight immediately noticed that Rarity was beaming with excitement once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Canterlot?! I am so envious! The glamour, the sophistication! I've always dreamed of living there! Finally showing the world the true beauty of rubenesque ponies such as myself with my designs!\" Rarity continued to have Twilight try on outfits, though Twilight wasn't exactly sure how long it had lasted, though it was still daytime so she still had time to finish checking all the preparations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike? How much more is there left to do?\" Twilight was hoping they were almost done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike looked at the list and saw that there was only one last thing they hadn't checked yet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hoo-wee!\" came an enthusiastic call, making Twilight look up. She had walked literally dozens of steps, and was quite out of breath. She looked up to see an extremely round orange earth pony standing next to an apple tree laden with fruit. This earth pony looked to be all belly, her wide-as-a-barn-door sides forming a smooth curve with her wobbly belly. Her bag legs were much thicker than her front, a clear mix of muscles and fat, and her freckled cheeks were the size of the apples on the tree. As Twiligth watched, the pony stood beside the tree, and with a heave slapped her belly straight into the trunk with such force that apples rained down into carefully placed barrels. Twiligth approached with caution, slightly awed by the display of girth put to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, hello there, my name is Twilight Sparkle and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why howdy there Twilight, good to meet you!\" the earth pony trotted up to Twilight, showing to be much more mobile than Twilight would've expected of a pony her size. She grabbed Twilight's hoof in a overly hearty shake. The resulting quake of pony flesh was absolutely obscene. It seemed to go up Twilight's body before going down, and her chins alll began to sway at their own rhythm. Her cheeks nearly blinded her as they bobbed up and down. But then the quake went down to the rest of her. Her front jiggled against her neck, her foreleg fat against her sides, her belly against &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; and her rump quaked against her back legs. She actually fell over - all of two inches or so before her belly hit the ground. She took a seat and tuned back in to the pony blabbering at her. Her name was Applejack apparently, and something about being friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, actually, I'm just here to check on the food.\" Twilight explained. Applejack's eyes lit up, and she trotted to a triangle suspended on a pole, giving it a great ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soup's on everypony!\" Applejack hollered. \"Let me introduce you to the family.\" she turned to Twilight. What proceeded next was the largest procession of bellies Twilight had ever seen. The Apple family apparently prided themselves on being the best \"applebumpers\" in Equestria, able to knock down all the apples in a tree with a single swing of their gut. Twilight had never seen any such thing at Canterlot... maybe there was something to this Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Big Macintosh, Granny Smith, and Applebloom.\" Applejack finally finished, pointing to a little yellow filly who was clearly already well on her way to being a prime applebumper. Still, a number of these farm ponies had come straight from the field, and, well, smelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can see the food situation is in order...\" Twilight said, looking around at the admittedly delectable treats many of the ponies carried. \"I really should get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to stay for lunch?\" The little filly asked. Twilight hesitated, but her belly reminded her that she hadn't eaten since she had left Canterlot, and that had been nearly an hour ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe for just a little...\" Twilight replied, gathering a hurrah from the gathered family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, mph, Twilight, y'sure know how to eat!\" Applejack said with her mouth full, crumbs spilling from herr mouth. Lunch had lasted for about two hours now, and while most of the family had gone back to work, she and Twilight were still stuffing their gullets like there was no tomorrow. Twilight had never met anypony who could keep pace with her before. Applejack sure was a messy eater though, nothing like the refined company Twilight had been forced to endure in Canterlot. So she had decided to likewise let loose a little, and crumbs now littered the top of her belly. The two obese ponies sat back from their table, and as Applejack clutched her belly she let out a huge belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh. Y'sure are a barrel of fun, Twi.\" Applejack slapped a friendly hoof on Twilight's back, triggering a crumb-filled burp to erupt from the unicorn. Applejack just gave her a friendly grin. Twilight blushed a little, but had to admit, not only had the lunch been delicious, but this pony's attitude was as unusual as it was enticing.</span></div></div>",

She also happened to gain a couple more pounds as her belly was close to dragging on the ground. Spike was walking ahead of her as Twilight was panting with all the walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPP!!!!!!!!!\" Twilight belched. \"I ate so much pie, though I could go for some more.\" Spike just rolled his eyes at Twilight's appetite. \"Okay, the next thing on the list. Somepony named Rainbow Dash is supposed to clear the clouds.\" Spike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked up into the sky and saw that a lot of clouds were still in the sky. \"Well she didn't do a very good jo.....\" as Twilight said that, she then got hit by a big flying pony. She then got covered with mud while the big blue Pegasus pony flew up beside her. The mare had a rainbow colored mane, strong and thick legs as big as tree trunks and flabby belly that was close to the ground. Her cheeks were as puffy as Twilight's. <br>\r\n\"Hehe! Sorry about that.\" She said to Twilight. Twilight just gave her a stare while looking at her rainbow-colored mane. \"I take it that your Rainbow Dash.\" Twilight said as she shook all the mud off herself. <br>\r\n\"The one and only.\" Rainbow Dash said. \"I don't think I seen you in Ponyville before.\" <br>\r\n\"It's because I'm from Canterlot. My name is Twilight Sparkle and I'm here to make check of the preparations for the festival.\" Rainbow became excited. \"Cool! The Wonderbolts are gonna preform. I gonna be in that group one day.\" Twilight began to laugh a bit. \"Aren't you a little of the fat side to be in the Wonderbolts?\" Twilight said. \"Hey, I may be a little over weight, but I'm the best flyer around.\" Rainbow said smugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash then flew up to a cloud and laid on top of it, eating a piece of cake sh had saved up there. \"Don't you think the Wonderbolts want somepony who isn't lazy. I mean look at all the clouds in the sky you were suppose to clear.\" Twilight said to Rainbow as she stuffed her face. \"Mmy! M mmn mphm mne mpy mn mnn mecmmds mmnp.\" Rainbow said with her mouth filled with cake. Twilight and Spike couldn't understand them. \"What?\" Twilight said. Rainbow Dash then swallowed. \"I said I can clear the sky in ten seconds flat.\" Rainbow said to Twilight. \"Prove it.\" Twilight said, confident of implausibility of such an act by a portly mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow then did her thing and dashed past several clouds, clearing the sky in her path. Even for her size, she moved pretty quick. In ten seconds, the sky was clear. Rainbow then came down to the ground a little breathless. \"*pant* There! *pant* Ten Seconds Flat!\" Rainbow said with pride. Twilight and Spike froze with amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Just like everyone else who sees me fly.\" Rainbow Dash said. \"You should she the look on your face.\" Rainbow starts flying again. \"You are a riot, Twilight Sparkle! Can't wait to hang out some more.\" As Rainbow Dash said that, she then flew away.\" \"Wow!\" Spike said. \"She's amazing!\" Twilight was puzzled. <br>\r\n\"How can a mare as big as her fly so well?\" Twilight said. \"If she's anything like you, she'll just end up getting even bigger.\" Spike said smartly. \"What was that, Spike?\" Twilight said. \"Noth.....nothing!\" Spike said so Twilight wouldn't be mad. \"Anyways, let's check on more of the prepping. I'm start to get hungry again.\" Twilight said as her stomach slightly growled. \"BUT WE JUST ATE LESS THAN AN HOUR.\" Spike said. \" Its not my fault working makes me hungry.\" Twilight said with a smile.</span></div></div>",

I am in the zone as it were.\" she said without looking at Twilight. \"Yes, sparkles always does the trick. Rarity you are a talent. Now how can I help...GASP! My star daring what happened to you?\" Twilight was still a mess from when Rainbow Dash crashed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story. I'm just gonna check on the decorations, then I'll be out of you hair.\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of my hair? What about your hair?!\", with that Rarity began to push Twilight out of Town Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you doing? Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity took Twilight to her boutique. \"Feel free to have some of the chocolates I keep in the bowls around the shop they are for everyone. I couldn't imagine going five minutes without a few. Now lets get you cleaned up and looking pretty.\" She then began putting large dresses on Twilight who ate three to five chocolates between outfits. \"Too green. Too yellow. Too poofy. Not poofy enough. Too frilly. Too shiny.

To show that big mares are beautiful! That chunky stallions are hunky! That fat is fabulous and fashionable! I can't wait to hear all about it. We are going to be the best of friends you and I.\" Twilight winced at once again hearing that \"f- word\". Rarity then took a closer look at the dress. \"Emeralds?! What was I thinking? Let me get you some rubies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking to make sure Rarity was out of the room Twilight said. \"Quick, before she decides to dye my coat a new color!\"</span></div></div>",

Sequins that had been stuck in her mane and armpits flittered out behind her, as Spike followed along, with a dreamy look in his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Wasn't she wonderful?\" he said, staring into the sky. Twilight merely rolled her eyes as she huffed and puffed up a hill.<br>\r\n\"Fo... focus, Spike...\" she heaved. Her coat was glistening in the afternoon sun. \"What's... next?\"<br>\r\nSpike pulled out Twilight's list. \"Uh... music. It's the last one.\"<br>\r\nTwilight sighed with relief. \"Good... maybe after this, I can... finally get something to eat... I'm starving!\" as the sound of tweeting birds filled the air, Twilight pictured a nice, big cake at the top of the hill. Salivating, her delusion gave her the final burst of energy she needed to push her flab up to the top of the hill. The chocolates from Rarity's boutique had added a good pound, and she collapsed as she arrived at the summit. She was panting heavily, her fat tongue hanging out of her mouth. Spike looked down the hill, it was only a few yards high. This exercise would be good for her. But for now, their attention was turned to a round yellow pegasus and her chorus of similarly large birds.<br>\r\nThe yellow pegasus was truly shaped like a ball. She wasn't particularly flabby; instead she had a thick, firm stomach that evenly curved around her large flank. Her cheeks were equally round, and rosy from the stress on her clearly rarely-used wing muscles. She was only flying to reach the blue jay at the top of the tree.<br>\r\n\"Oh my... um, stop, please everyone,\" she said. She approached the blue jay. \"Um, excuse me sir, no offense... but your rhythm is just a... teeny, tiny bit off... would you mind, um, just... singing along?\" she smiled, her wide grin showing the dimples in her chubby cheeks.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the blue jay <i>had</i> taken offense. It turned its head away from the pegasus and refused to make a peep. \"Oh, I'm sorry... let's see... would you sing if I gave you a yummy nummy snack?\" she produced a large sack of bread crumbs and held a good portion of them out with her hoof. The blue jay eagerly consumed most of the crumbs, gave a most melodic belch, and hopped back in line.<br>\r\nThe pegasus retreated to the ground with relief, exhaling loudly, and was about to begin the verse again when Twilight, who had only just recovered her breath, exclaimed a hearty \"Hello!\"<br>\r\nThe mere power of her voice was enough to frighten away all of the birds in the tree, and even startle the pegasus, who fell over, shaking the trees around them. Twilight - who was oblivious to the ruckus she had caused - continued speaking in the same loud tone, her body quivering and jiggling with each word. \"My name is Twilight Sparkle, and I am here on royal Canterlot business to check up on the music. It sounded beautiful!\" it was only when the pegasus failed to reply that Twilight noticed the commotion. \"Oh my, I'm sorry... I didn't mean to frighten your birds...\" The pegasus was still struggling to get off the ground, and was failing miserably. Luckily, Twilight's magic was especially strong, due to her using it more often than her muscles. She levitated the heavy pony off the ground and back onto her feet, though even with her magic it was a struggle. The pegasus was truly thick. When all was set right again, the pegasus hid her face in her mane, evidently flustered. Afraid she hadn't heard the first time, Twilight repeated, \"I'm Twilight Sparkle,\" and when still no reply was given, she said \"what's your name?\"<br>\r\nThe pegasus muttered something as she picked up her bag of snacks, but Twilight couldn't make it out. \"I'm sorry, what was that?\" she asked. She was eyeing the bag.<br>\r\nThe only word she could make out in the pegasus's response this time was \"um\". \"Didn't quite catch that,\" said the unicorn, taking a whiff. There was definitely something in there other than breadcrumbs. Sure enough, the pegasus whimpered, and impulsively stuck a hoof in the bag, producing a tea cake, which she ingested furiously. Twilight, who was far too hungry to remember her manners, licked her lips as she asked, \"Those look delicious! Would you mind if I had one?\" She took a few steps forward, eyes gleaming. The pegasus took another cake and shyly tossed Twilight the whole bag. It was only after her third cake that the unicorn realized how rude she'd been. Eager to leave the awkward situation (and get a more substantial meal), she hastily stammered with her mouth full, \"Wull, it looksh like yer furdsh ur burck,\" and placed the food sack in her saddlebag. She swallowed and finished with \"I guess everything's in order. Keep up the good work, and thank you for the cakes,\" she turned away and started to leave, but not before the pegasus spotted Spike, who had been thinking of ways to get the food bag away from Twilight. Suddenly, the pegasus exploded with life.<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, a baby dragon!\" she squealed. Somehow, her flimsy wings picked her off the ground and hurtled her at top speed towards Spike. Her immense weight knocked Twilight right out of the way, like a bowling ball and a really jiggly pin. As Twilight levitated herself back up, the pegasus - who had just revealed herself as Fluttershy - was googling over Spike. She had brought out another snack bag and was practically stuffing him with bread crumbs. \"You're sooooo cute! But so thin,\" she noted, and gave him more bread crumbs, insisting that he needed to eat more.<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I don't want any,\" he said, but it only induced more prodding from Fluttershy.<br>\r\n\"Oh, he talks too! I didn't know dragons could talk! That's just so incredibly wonderful, I just don't know what to say!\" She hopped up and down, shaking the ground.<br>\r\nTwilight used her magic to pull Spike away. \"Well in that case, we better be going. Thanks again!\" but Fluttershy would not be stopped.<br>\r\n\"Wait, what's his name?\" she asked, pouring more bread crumbs into his mouth as they walked along. Spike was extremely uncomfortable, and wished that Twilight would let him sit on her back. <br>\r\n\"Agm Spahke,\" he said, as he practically gargled down bread crumbs. Luckily, due to the weight of all the ponies, no place was too far away from another in Ponyville, and they were very close to the library, where he and Twilight would be staying.<br>\r\n\"Wow, a talking dragon! - have some more bread crumbs - what do dragons talk about?\" she asked. Twilight quickly turned around with a huff as the reached the front of the library. <br>\r\n\"I am so sorry, how did we get here so fast? This library is where I'm staying while in Ponyville, and my poor baby dragon and I need some sleep, not to mention a good snack,\" Twilight wondered aloud. She wondered how many goodies Celestia had sent to be stocked in the library. She thought she smelled sweets wafting out of an open window. <br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor thing! Have a few more bread crumbs -\" but Spike had had enough.<br>\r\n\"Would you quit it? I'm not hungry or tired! And stop with the bread crumbs, I don't want to end up fat like you!!!\" he exploded. Twilight held her breath. Fluttershy was completely silent.<br>\r\nThen her lower lip began to quiver.<br>\r\nThen she collapsed into a heap of fat and tears. \"I KNOW!\" she said. \"I'VE COMPLETELY LET MYSELF GO! ALL I DO IS EAT ALL DAY AND EAT AND EAT AND... AND I FEEL SO TERRIBLE!!!! JUST LOOK AT ME!\" she rolled on her back, exposing her immense belly. There was no doubt how large she was, by Twilight's estimate, she probably ingested a good twenty pounds a day. Good thing I don't do that, she thought to herself. She patted herself on the stomach, but didn't say anything out loud. Staring at the weeping pegasus, Twilight decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An evil laugh could be heard as a dark figure formed from the mist on stage. Slowly a figure became a apperant. Albeitly though, a rather full figure. At at least twice the weight of Twilight, Nightmare moon was a bit... Bigger than the pictures from the legend. T<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhick thights, a giant blubbery belly, chubby cheeks, an extra thick chin and perhaps the most noticable of all. Her huge flanks, proudly displaying her crescent moon. Strangely enough though, rather than a cheesy speech you would be expecting from such a villain, all that came out of her chubby face were screams of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... What has happened to me?!\" The confused lunar villain said as she observed her body, no this wasn't her body! It was a mere parody! A bad dream! A Nightmare! Yes, just a nightmare, she would wake up and see her good figure again, not this fat food obsessed creature!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the nightmarish fiend was panicking, the crowd's initial fears slowly turned into confusion, it was quite safe to say that none had seen this one coming. \"Say... since you were the one planning all of this... Mind telling me if this is a joke, because if so, you're doing quite the bad job at it.\" Rainbow asked Twilight as she wasn't sure what to do, was she supposed to be laughing or trying to calm the poor mare down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, darling. While I must admit I am not an expert when it comes to pranking myself, I'm afraid I missed the punchline...\" Rarity said as the six mares kept staring at the still panicking nightmare moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't think this was meant to be a joke... And neither do I think Nightmare is playing this out...\" Twilight said, still a little confused of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait a second there, who is this nightmare guy you're talking about.\" Rainbow cut in as she finally snapped out of her freaked out state. Was this the feared Nightmare moon her mother had always told her about?  She didn't seem all that scary right now, nearly crying and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sugah cube, who is this nightmare you're talking about?\" Applejack joined in as they ignored the screams of terror from nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A being that once tried to bathe Equestria in eternal darkness, banished by the elements of harmony a thousand years ago. But... This doesn't make sense! Why does she look like that? The pictures made her appear much more... thinner so to say.\" Twilight said, nearly gagging at the word. It was almost as bad as the word \"dieting\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that would explain the reason why the poor dear is-Going crazier than an fruitbat on harvest day.\" Applejack cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... darling, whilst not the comparison I would've chosen, I must agree.\" Rarity said, feeling genuinely sorry for the poor alicorn. She couldn't imagine how it would feel to suddenly lose the figure you worked so hard on. Being it avoiding sweets or making sure you would get them on a regular basis. Nopony deserved to go through that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare was still in total shock, each step she took forced her to waddle seeing as the round barrel that was her tummy forced her thick thights to move side ways to it to avoid a rather uncomfortable bump. And why could she not stop jiggling?! Her flanks would even move when she was standing still! She couldn't take it anymore... Why was this happening to her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears slowly made their way to Nightmare's reptillian like eyes, why was she tortured like this? Was it because of what she had done to her family all these years ago? But they had deserved it right?... Celestia was the bad sister! Not she! Nightmare slowly started sobbing as her fat body layed down. This was all Celestia's fault... And why wouldn't she stop thinking about chocolate! Was this was fat ponies thought the entire time? When the next time would be that she would get something to eat?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith teary eyes she looked at her crest piece. Once shining bright and proud, now it was partially covered with her fat. Why would somepony ever do this to her?... She had only meant for everypony to enjoy her beautiful night sky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ah don't know about you girls but I can't stand to watch this any longer. Evil or not, this pony needs our help right now and darn it if we won't help somepony in turmoil.\" Applejack said, her heart just couldn't stand to see somepony cry like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe we could c-cheer her u-up?\" Fluttershy muttered before immediately being cut off by Pinkie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea, Fluttershy! Oh and I have just the bestest idea! Let's give her some of her favorite dessert, chocolate cake!\" Pinkie said, bouncing up and down excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on Equestria do you know that that is her favorite dessert, darling?\" Rarity asked in confusion, admittedly, chocolate cake was high on her list of desserts, she knew all too well being a designer and all, everypony's taste was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a hunch!\" Pinkie said with a smile as she bounced up and down. Her whole body jiggling from the bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Twilight, Darling, what do you think we should do? You do seem to know most of this... Nightmare moon.\" Rarity said, looking at her weighty newly found friend in front of her.</span></div></div>",

I would give her anything she would need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah got to say to say, there are few ponies who can keep up with an apple family meal, she's is a true friend and that the honest truth.\" Apple jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy as next. \"When I was not feeling so good about how I looked Twilight cheered my up. It was so kind. A kindness I intend to return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last it was Pinkie Pie's turn. \"I could tell from the minute I saw her that Twilight is a pony who can bring out the best in us. I pony we could share goodies with, go on adventures, and share a laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They really feel this way about me? I've been making friends with them without realizing it?\" Twilight thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only more ponies could have felt like that about the night.\" Nightmare Moon's coat was turning to a dark blue while her mane was becoming a lighter shade of blue but still sparkled like stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who you were and Princess Celestia shown me so many wonderful things about the night; stargazing, studying nocturnal creatures; roasting s'mores by a fire...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'mores?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marshmallows chocolate and gram crackers put together.\" Twilight started to drool. \"Where was I? Oh, the thing is I think she knew you would be coming back and she wanted to show you that ponies do care about the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But will she still want me back now that I look like this?\" The mare in the moon placed a hoof her large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I want you back sister.\" It was Celestia, the sun rising behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister?\" The five mares from Ponyville asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had thought that you all would find the Elements of Harmony to turn Princess Luna back to her original self but simply being her friend and giving her cake did the trick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was still just as fat as she was before she was shorter and her eyes became like ordinary pony eyes. \"Sister, you are not offended by my body? How could I have gotten like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, I didn't mind Twilight gain weight. As how; every year there is a celebration called Nightmare Night and started a tradition that the children would offer some of there candy to you. No pony knew I enchanted the offerings so the would go to you, you do love sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides I have been keeping a secret that is well past time to show.\" With a glow in her horn Celestia began to fatten. Her flank became the size of beanbag chairs, her legs were the size of street lamps, she grew a quadruple chin , and her bell was only a quarter of an inch above the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have know with your love of cake and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was confused. \"If you were fat all this time then why hide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed. \"The nobles back then thought it was 'unseemly' for a princess to be fat so I hid it for centuries. Luna you do not have to stay fat if you do not want to but I will hide who I am anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna bumped her flank against Celestia's. \"I think I may stay this way for a while to show my support for my 'big' sister but size wise you may not be that for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will see now how about we celebrate with a feast!\"</span></div></div>",

Love has an oddly precarious way of showing itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe begin this erotically romantic tale moments after the beginning of Twilight's official coronation as a newly christened Alicorn, as she stood before the crowd of Ponies alongside her mentor, Princess Celestia, and Princess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unlike her noble mentor and the Princess of the Night, Twilight had a more...let's say \"robust\" physique. And when we mean by robust, we mean \"Rotund\". What Twilight lacked in height as an Alicorn, she undoubtedly accommodated this conundrum with her weight. Sure, she was always know to be a rather \"curvier\" Pony than most mares in Equestria, but when her friends' destinies were swapped (along with consuming the calorie-rich delicacies of the Apple Family for an extended period of time), anypony would certainly notice that Twilight had undoubtedly \"ballooned\" in size, as they say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she had ascended into an Alicorn, her increased weight stuck out like a sore hoof. However, Twilight had become accustomed to the stares she would get at her bulk, but now she knew that she would somewhat scrutinized by her girth now that she was an official Princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as she made her honestly humble speech, one mare stared keenly and profusely upon Twilight's burgeoning girth jutting out within the confines of her dress; The famed Fashionista of Ponyville known as \"Rarity\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the average onlooker and resident of Ponyville, Rarity was merely gawking at the intricate designs of Princess Twilight's gown. But in reality, Rarity was focused only on the copious amounts of flab Twilight carried upon her now Alicorn physique. Like a doctor monitoring a patient's progress, Rarity easily noticed how fat her mauve friend was getting prior to her ascension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she got to know Twilight better, the stark white Unicorn mare began to develop...\"certain feelings\", shall we say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeelings of affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeelings of romance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeelings...of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Rarity soon realized that she was in love with her best friend, just before Twilight's ascension into a full-fledged Alicorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind, just as Twilight reached Celestia before her and many ponies, Rarity now knew that she had to come clean and confess her feelings for the rotund Alicorn Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, she wouldn't get over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Twilight's humble speech, the festivities soon began in full swing. Pinkie was excited as always, Fluttershy was spending time with Discord, Applejack and Rainbow Dash continued their friendly rivalry as usual. And Rarity herself was keeping herself temporarily preoccupied as to avoid looking conspicuous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as she finished off her glass of red wine, she soon began searching for the rotund Twilight Sparkle, where she soon found her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the sun rose over Ponyville, a purple unicorn stirred from her heavy slumber. Another day was set out for her to conquer, and she was ready for anything! She giggled as the light poured in through her window, tickling her nose and all of her body, encouraging just enough movement to get out of bed and start her daily adventures. Twilight stretched out her hooves, leaned to her side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand toppled out of bed and down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in Celesti-owwww...\" Twilight rubbed her flank. It had received the full blast of the fall, and now was pulsing in pain. Sorely, she retreated back up to her room. She slowly turned around in front of her mirror, hoping that her accident hadn't left a bruise, but what she saw was a bit of a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn had never been skinny - a strict schedule of reading books and writing letters leaves very little time for exercise, but now she was noticing that she was... well, fat. She stared at her reflection in wonder and fascination, observing every detail about her body. Her cheeks were soft and doughy, and hung a good inch off of her face on either side. They wobbled in unison with her three chins when she talked, quivering with waves like water. A thick forehoof sunk into twenty inches' worth of squishy, pillowy blubber. Her stomach hung fairly low, only about six inches off the ground, and it jiggled with each of her movements. But the prize had to be taken by her flank. With a cutie mark stretched out to twice its normal size, a good full four feet of rump totaled across her back. It was perfectly round, and swayed evenly and smoothly, contrasting to the bouncy ripples of the rest of her body. Overall, she resembled a 5ft x 6ft bowl of cuddly gelatin, weighing about 150 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was astounded. How had she gotten so big? Or, even more baffling: why hadn't she noticed it before!? Surely such a large weight was noticeable. <i>Logically speaking,</i> thought the unicorn, <i>I might have just been gaining for an extremely long time, and the change didn't occur to me till I actually thought about it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked back into the mirror. The sun fell on her rolls of fat, illuminating them with a golden glow. A warm feeling of contentedness flooded over her, and her eyes twinkled with delight. She smiled, and did a little twirl. She had never felt quite so good about her body. Suddenly, she was very excited. Another adventure to look into, to explore and experiment with. And best of all, she didn't have to convince any of her friends to be her lab rat! Surely gaining weight for the sake of learning was no great sin; when she was through, she could just work it off - if she even wanted to get rid of it. She could study how quickly she could gain, how big a pony could get, different ways to get bigger. A whole new frontier, and one that didn't even require her to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GUUUUUURGLEEEEE.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... maybe some breakfast is in order first,\" said Twilight, putting a hoof to her gut. Being a unicorn, she could conjure up food at any time (so long as she had a resource). Eager to get started, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You ready for this, squirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was preparing to show off the latest stunt that she had created - using special techniques that she had recently learned from her time at the Wonderbolts Academy. And Scootaloo was given the honor of being the first pony to witness what she, herself, could consider to be the next amazing feat of awesomeness that nopony other than Rainbow Dash could ever achieve. Scootaloo was more than ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash and Scootaloo have pretty much become unofficial sisters since that fateful camping trip. It really wasn't too long ago. But they were slowly, but surely, bonding more and more - each time they had the chance to hang out. It wasn't too often, but Rainbow Dash could tell that Scootaloo was starting to see her as more than just an icon for her to obsess over............At least that's what she assumed. Dash isn't exactly the perceptive type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I'm ready, Rainbow Dash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I call this one 'The Blaring Bolt'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rainbow Dash vanished in a prismatic blur that left behind a strong burst of wind. Scootaloo felt the strong force for merely a second before a booming thunder emitted from the sky. Somewhat shaken, but used to things like this when spectating her hero up close, Scootaloo looked up and saw that Rainbow Dash was creating a series of storm clouds by brushing multiple clouds together at high speeds. They were starting to form a diagonal line that pointed vertically. When the line was done, Rainbow Dash began looping in a downward spiral around the thick line of clouds, leaving a rainbow trail, until she reached the bottom. Rainbow stopped for a moment to position herself at the bottom end of the line. It looked like a needle composed of a thunder storm, wrapped with a thin, rainbow ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Rainbow Dash had only learned the techniques used to create this stunt a few days ago. And she had only practiced a few times since. But, she was so eager to show off these techniques that she had specifically created a stunt for the sake of proving to Ponyville that she was going to be the next Spitfire. Sure, Spitfire warned Rainbow Dash and her fellow trainees that these techniques could be dangerous if not perfected. But this wasn't going to stop Rainbow Dash from using them prematurely. Besides, being reckless is what got Rainbow Dash this far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow then dashed right into the tip of the needle at an incredible speed. As she struck and went through it, lightning began to erupt all around the needle. And it was radiating with brilliant, rainbow colors - just like Dash's cutie mark. The stunt was also creating a continuous, blaring sound of thunder.  Soon she had cleared the entire form, making it look one long streak of flashing, prismatic lightning and clouds shooting into the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*That has to be the greatest, most awesome and epic thing I had ever seen in my life.* She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo hadn't noticed, but there was a crowd of ponies from Ponville - including all of Rainbow Dash's friends - gathered around the area; staring in awe at the spectacle. And they thought the Sonic Rainboom was an impressive sight. After the last few seconds of thunder, there was silence. And after a few seconds of silence, Sootaloo was screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOOOOOOOHOOOOOO!!! GOOOO RAINBOW DASH!!!! YOU ARE THE BEST PONY EVER!!! THAT WAS SOOO AMAZING!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute........THAT WAS RAINBOW DASH!!???!!???!!!\" Twilight Sparkle screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd started cheering wildly for Rainbow Dash. Everypony had apparently showed up when they noticed the strange anomaly in the sky, but didn't see what created it. However, there was now a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she?\" asked somepony. Then, there was silence again. Even Scootaloo had stopped cheering. Rainbow should've been visibly eating up the attention and praise by now. But the mare was nowhere to be seen. Then, somepony noticed - \"Oh Celestia! She's lying over there!! On the grass!\"<br>\r\nRainbow's friends were now very shocked and alarmed. Scootaloo, Spike, and the other 5 of the Mane 6 sprinted over to her immobile, charred body. The crowd watched as Rainbow's friends freaked out, picked up Rainbow Dash, and rushed to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a few weeks since the incident with 'The Blaring Bolt'. Rainbow Dash was shocked and burned. But, thankfully, she didn't mess up the stunt too badly. And she ended up recovering from most of her injuries. She looked ALMOST as good as new. There were no signs of the burns that she had received. This time, however, she had shocked her wings enough to make them go completely numb. Thank Celestia that it would go away eventually. It might take a month though. Rainbow would have to stay on the ground for quite a while. And, although this doesn't sound like it would be too much of a problem for any ordinary pegasus, Rainbow Dash is no ordinary pegasus. She is going to go nuts and probably drive everypony else crazy if she stays out of the sky for too long. She wouldn't be able to stay at her cloud house. So, she had Fluttershy take care of Tank at her cottage, and opted to stay at Sugarcube Corner with Pinkie Pie - who is probably the only one out of her friends that could put up with a disgruntled, cranky, restless, and depressed Rainbow Dash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the Cutie Mark Crusaders Club House, at Sweet Apple Acres, Scootaloo was contemplating on what she was going to do for Rainbow Dash. She felt that, as an unofficial sister and number one fan, she should find a way to help Rainbow Dash cope with her ailment. Sure, she believed that Pinkie Pie could keep anypony happy. But, she knew Rainbow Dash could only take so much Pinkie Pie. Scootaloo thought that this was a good time to bond with Rainbow Dash more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I could give her flowers. Nah, that's too prissy.....I could write her a song. No, wait.......I'm horrible at that.....I could......*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, Scootaloo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo was startled for a second. She was so distracted by her thoughts that she didn't even notice that Sweetie Belle had entered the club house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...H-hey, Sweetie Belle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you here, alone? And what were you doing?\" Sweetie Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I usually come to the club house when I need a good place to think. And I've been thinking about what I could do for Rainbow Dash to help her feel better about her wings. She's going to be staying at Sugar Cube Corner, starting tomorrow. And, I know that she is probably pretty bummed right now....What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just came to pick up my cape. My sister kept bugging me about how I've been running around with it all this time, and haven't once brought it back to her to get cleaned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't even do much with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! That's what I said! But she won't stop bothering me about it! And I just know that she's going to keep it from me, so that it stays as clean as possible until I really need it. I mean, I guess that's really thoughtful of her. Even if it is kind of annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo sighed. \"I wish I could be as thoughtful.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Sweetie Belle started thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm.....Y'know......Whenever Rarity gets really depressed, she starts eating a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo blinked with a bewildered expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. She gorges on her gourmet chocolates and secret stash of ice cream. She thinks I don't know, but I've seen her do it before.\" Sweetie Belle then realized what she just did and began to panic. \"O-oh! Uuuuuuhhhm. PLEASEDON'TTELLANYPONY!! I-I mean.....Rarity will kill me if she finds out that I know and told somepony!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo was taken aback, but got interested. She started forming questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she get really hungry when she gets depressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know. I just know that she starts to feel better when she does it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are chocolates and ice cream the only foods that cure depression?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They work for Rarity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo started to inch uncomfortably close to Sweetie Belle as she asked her these questions. Sweetie Belle knew that she was just getting excited about a potential way to help somepony. But, when it came to Rainbow Dash, Scootaloo scared her sometimes. And this was just getting weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do all older fillies eat a lot to get happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to know?\" Sweetie Belle then quickly swerved past Scootaloo and grabbed her cape. She trotted towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Scootaloo. But I've gotta go! Rarity is waiting to clean this thing!\" She galloped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo thought about what she had just learned. If Rainbow Dash ate a lot of food, she might be able to stay happy. Scootaloo would do anything to get her approval. And if pampering her with food would do it, then she would give it a shot. However, she had to figure out how to get enough food for Dash. She was sure that it would take quite a lot considering how broken her spirit might be, and how long it would take for her to be able to fly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I probably don't deserve your help, considering how stupid I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie gave Rainbow Dash an incredulous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU KIDDING? That was the most super awesomest pegasus stunt I've ever seen!! How were you supposed to know that it was incredibly dangerous and could've hurt you REALLY REALLY badly and even potentially taken you away from us forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow's face just screwed up in response to that question. She tried hard, but she couldn't keep herself from tearing up and, eventually, sobbing uncontrollably. Pinkie realized that she ran her mouth without thinking, again, and consoled Dashie with a nice, Pinkie hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so so sorry, Dash! I was just being a dumb Pinkie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but,*sob* I d-did know how d-dangero-o-ous it w-was!! Sp-Spitfire told us not to try the techniques until we practiced them enough! *sob* *sob* I-I not only disobeyed her. *sniff* But, I made you all worry! And probably scared you all half to death! A-and now I'm going to be behind on my training!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash then proceeded to, flat out, bawl like a little foal. Pinkie Pie comically cradled Rainbow Dash in her front legs and carried her over to the guest bed. They were both in Pinkie's room, at the moment. And Pinkie Pie prepared to house Rainbow Dash until she could use her wings again. The guest bed was pretty big for one pony. It was big enough to fit, at least, two adult ponies. It was incredibly comfortable, with a ruby red, cotton quilt, and two big, ivory pillows, filled with perfectly kempt pegasus feathers. The frame was rich mahogany, with fancy engravings of Pinkie Pie's cutie mark. And this bed was usually hidden in the wall. When any of her friends slept over, or any ponies needed to crash after getting a bit too wild at one of her big parties, Pinkie Pie would deploy this baby and put it to good use. Nopony knows how or when she managed to install it, or where she got it from, but nopony would ever question it because of its sheer magnificence being reserved for them. Pinkie Pie could sleep in it, herself, but she insists on sleeping in her own bed, just in case anypony else needed somewhere to sleep, in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie gently laid Rainbow Dash on the mattress. When Rainbow's back touched the bed, she almost immediately quieted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Pinkie Pie........\" Rainbow said, still somewhat flustered. She had never actually slept over at any of her friends' houses. And she was actually quite reluctant to stay at Sugar Cube Corner. She always tried to avoid sleeping in other ponies' homes for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yyyeeeeeesss?\" Pinkie had a smug grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-this bed.........is...........AWESOME!!! And I thought nothing could ever beat a well made cloud-o-pedic!! This is something I would only expect Rarity to have! Where did you get this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my sources. You never stay over, so you've never met 'My Guest Friend'. You're actually the first pony to ever ask me about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........'Guest Friend'?.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessirooni! 'My Guest Friend' is my ever reliable, super fancy pants, true guest bed among guest beds that is only reserved for my very special guests among very special guests.........Which is pretty much any guest I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash just didn't know what to say. But, she wasn't going to complain. She always knew that Pinkie Pie's entire life was devoted to making everypony happy. But, she sometimes underestimated just how devoted Pinkie actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the Legion of The Cutie Mark Crusaders.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle turned towards Scootaloo in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya got what?\" Inquired Apple Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apple Bloom! Everypony loves your family's cooking, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmm, Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know that Rainbow Dash is always the most excited for cider season and is Applejack's best friend! I bet that if I can get your sister to make me a lot of apple goodies, and maybe even get a bunch of cider from her, I can make Rainbow Dash feel good as new!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't know Scoots. Ah'm not sure if mah sister's gonna wanna take the time do that, just so that you can impress Rainbow Dash. Besides, ya can't just make our cider just like that. It's a long, delicate process that takes months. That's whah we have a 'Cider Season', and only make enough for most, if not all, of Ponyville. And, shouldn't you find a way to help Rainbow without usin' other ponies? Y'know, so that what you do for her is extra special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo put a sour expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that you wouldn't help somepony else help her friend if she needed you to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle was just trying to find somewhere to hide. She knew where this was going. And it was partially her fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! That's not what Ah mean! What Ah mean is that you could prove yourself to be a better sister if you did something yourself. Ah mean, mah sister would probably do something for Rainbow Dash. But, feeding her a ton of food? That don't sound like somethin' Applejack would do. She would want Rainbow to stay as fit as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo was getting annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're saying that I want to make Rainbow Dash fat?! You know what? I'm going to ask your sister to help me, myself! And nopony is going to get in my way!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo stomped her way out of the club house and galloped towards Apple Bloom's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gotten into Sootaloo?\" Apple Bloom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle sheepishly crept out of her hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh I don't know. I-I didn't tell her that Rarity eats a lot when she's depressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle scrunched her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom sighed deeply and face-hoofed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sweetie Belle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo made it to the front door of the Apple family house. She knocked politely.<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, the door opened. Applejack was done with any chores that she needed to do for that day and had answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whah howdy, Scootaloo! What can Ah do ya for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Applejack! I want to ask you if you could do me a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot, sugar cube.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make me 20 apple pies, 50 apple fritters, and 30 caramel apples?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's expression went from friendly to deeply bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"........W-what in Equestria do you need all that food for?......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to give it all to Rainbow Dash cuz she's depressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack then stared into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*G-g-give......all that.....f-food.........to Rainbow Dash?.......* Applejack blushed a bit as she thought to herself.<br>\r\n*And.......s-she's askin'........M-ME to HELP?.................Rainbow ain't gonna do much exercisin' for a while, if she can't fly......'Specially since she can be pretty lazy to begin with.........* Applejack started to imagine Sootaloo and herself, each taking warm, home made, Apple family goods to Rainbow Dash; as she scoffed them down and kept accepting more and more and-*NONONO! NUH-UH! Stop, right there, Applejack!* Her conscious was trying to fight back. *Get a hold of yerself, girl! You know better than to take advantage of somepony for self pleasure! Let alone one of your friends!..............Ah-Ah mean.......Ah did kinda lose control, already, when the family stuffed Twilight.....B-but that don't count! Mah family wanted her to try all our goods!.....Although, it didn't stop me from gettin' ahdeas....*<br>\r\nApplejack was biting her lip. Her face was turning slightly red. She started sweating bullets. Scootaloo was getting a bit concerned.<br>\r\n\"Um........Applejack?........Applejack? Are you okay?\" Applejack kept staring with a strained, but content look on her face. Her breath seemed a bit shallow. Scootaloo tried waving her hoof in front of Applejack's face. Applejack looked like she was getting ready to faint.<br>\r\nScootaloo yelled, \"APPLEJACK!!!\"<br>\r\n\"DW-WHA-WHA-Y-YES-AH'LL-DO-IT!!!\" Applejack blurted without thinking. She looked incredibly nervous and conflicted. But, Scootaloo seemed oblivious to that, at this point. She got the answer she was looking for.<br>\r\n\"You'll make the food? Alright! I told your sister that this was a good idea that you would agree with!\"<br>\r\nApplejack finally got out of her stupor. But, she wished she hadn't. She heard Scootaloo, loud and clear. Now that not only the excuse and temptation to submit to her dark desires, but also a promise to help a little filly's thoughtful - although very misguided - cause to help her best friend had been put in front of her muzzle, she couldn't resist.<br>\r\n\"Uhm.....heh, heh......yeah........Oh, pony feathers.\"<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh, nuthin'-nuthin'!\"<br>\r\nApplejack and Scootaloo awkwardly stared at one another within an awkward silence. Applejack felt very awkward. More awkward than she had ever felt before. She realized that Scootaloo, a little filly that she hardly knew, was going to take part in fulfilling her neglected desires. She loved seeing mares get stuffed and fat. And, she had always dreamed of having a fat marefriend to call her own. But, of course, Applejack hid this side of herself from everypony. Everypony, except Granny Smith. She knew that she could tell Granny Smith anything without being judged. And, Applejack couldn't understand her feelings when they first surfaced. When Applejack first talked to Granny Smith about her confusing affinity, all Granny Smith said was, \"Now, don't you fret, sugar plumb. Nopony has the same kinks as another. Alls ya gotta do is be sure to show 'em when the time is right. Whether or not ponies will accept you for who you are ain't gonna be known 'til it happens. And, when that time comes, always remember to stay true to yourself, hun. Your real friends and family will love ya, no matter what.\"<br>\r\nApplejack wished that she had the courage to tell her friends. But, she had pretty much labeled herself as a health nut, over the years. She is probably one of the fittest mares in Equestria. And, she always gave others the impression that honest, hard work and athleticism was what she was all about. She wasn't going to suddenly make it seem like that was all a lie, any time soon. Even if it all wasn't. Letting everypony know that she was really a filly fooling, chubby chaser, all this time, frightened her furiously.<br>\r\nApplejack had to say something to break the silence.<br>\r\nShe said with uneasy uncertainty, \"So.........Ah guess........since we're not doin' anything else important right now........We can start makin' RD's food.........right?\"<br>\r\nScootaloo perked up in anticipation.<br>\r\n\"Now, your talkin'! I did say that we should give her 20 apple pies, 50 apple fritters, and 30 caramel apples. But, do you think that's too much, or not enough?\"<br>\r\n\"Um-uh, Ah think that MIGHT be a bit much......\"<br>\r\n\"Oh.......Well, how much do you think we should make her? I know that this was all my BRILLIANT idea. But, if you're going to help, I guess I can give you some choice.\"<br>\r\nApplejack bit her lip again. \"Uh........maybe..........10 apple pies........and 10 fritters.....\" She gave Scootaloo a sheepish, pleading look as she blushed a bit. She couldn't believe that she still suggested enough food for 3 mares.<br>\r\nScootaloo put a hoof to her chin. \"Hmmmmmm..........I guess that would be good......I am planning on doing this until Rainbow Dash can fly again.....I probably shouldn't go all out on the first day!\"<br>\r\nApplejack gulped. *RD......eatin' like this until her wings get better? She's bound gain weight before then!* Applejack knew it was wrong. But, she started getting excited.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah. THAT'S whah we should make less! Heh, heh......\" According to the position of the sun, there should only be an hour left before noon. \"And......it would probably take too long to make all that.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh.....yeah......Well, then what are we waiting for? Let's bake!!!\" Scootaloo whizzed past Applejack; straight into the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.....Let's.....do it.....\" *Ah'm probably gonna regret this.....*</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rainbow Dash was not crying anymore. But, she was still moping about in Pinkie's room. More specifically, she was lazily lying on 'My Guest Friend', staring at the ceiling. The time was late in the afternoon, closing in on the evening. Pinkie Pie should be done with her shift for the day, by now.<br>\r\n\"sigh....\"- Rainbow rolled over, onto her stomach, and ruffled her feathers with her hooves -\"Nope. Can't feel a thing....Man, that's gonna be hard to get used to....I mean, it's bad enough that I can't use them. But, not being able to feel them either? It's almost like they're not even there. That's not just disturbing......Celestia, this is cruel.\"<br>\r\nPinkie's head - with a ridiculously big, rainbow colored top hat that had a piece of paper taped on the front, with the words 'RD is da best!' sloppily written on it - suddenly crept up at the foot of the bed. \"AAAAWW.. Is Dashie still sad?\" She proceeded to put on a pouting face as she did a random jig on the top of the foot of the bed, with her head seemingly frozen in place. When she finished with a graceful pose, she expected a reaction. Preferably, Dash's hardy laughter. But, what she got was a completely unfazed expression of disinterested melancholy. Pinkie Pie visibly deflated and went to Rainbow Dash's side.<br>\r\n\"It's that bad, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n\"Is there anything that I can do for you?\"<br>\r\nThere was suddenly a low, growling sound that came from Rainbow's direction. Rainbow blushed a bit. She felt very hungry, all of a sudden. Maybe drowning in sorrow builds a strong appetite?<br>\r\n\"Uuuhh....Ya...I'm kinda hungry......sort of....\"<br>\r\nPinkie's mood swung from sympathetic Pie to get-up-and-go Pie in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Dash! Pinkie Pie is here to help!\" She threw off the large hat - which kind of disappeared into nothing, out of eyes' view - and sped through her door. Until she reared back just as fast and said, \"Be right back!\", then sped off. Rainbow Dash normally would've went with her. But, she felt that 'My Guest Friend's' comforting embrace was all she had to keep her from falling apart completely. All she needed was some grub to go along with it.<br>\r\nWhen Pinkie Pie got downstairs, she headed for the kitchen until she got distracted by something. She had a strange, violent, bodily twitch, then looked past the pink, tinted window at the front of the store. It seemed as though Applejack, with a small cart full of apple pies, was walking towards Sugar Cube Corner. She was mere feet away when Pinkie noticed that Scootaloo was accompanying her, holding a basket of apple fritters. Pinkie Pie didn't know what her Pinkie Sense was telling her, this time. But, it had to be something good or exciting if it triggered because of Applejack and Scootaloo bringing Apple family goodies to Sugar Cube Corner. She trotted to the front door and opened it with gusto.<br>\r\n\"Heya, Applejack! Hiya, Scootaloo! Are we having an apple pastry party? Cuz, if we are, this is absolutely superific perfect timing!\"<br>\r\nWhen Applejack and Scootaloo got in front of Pinkie Pie, Applejack shifted her eyes every which way - trying not to make eye contact with Pinkie. She was sweating, again.<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh, hi Pinkie Pie. Fancy meetin' you here!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I live and work here, silly! Although, I am usually everywhere and anywhere these days.\"<br>\r\n\"I-Is that so? Heh, heh........heh.....\"<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, AJ?.......Something seems weird about you today......It's a familiar kind of weird that I'm supposed to watch out for....What was it?.......Are you riding something?....No. That's not it.......Biding something?....No-no. That's not it either....Chiding something?....Or maybe-\"<br>\r\n\"AH AIN'T HIDIN' NOTHIN'!!!\" Applejack blurted out loudly. She froze. Her eyes shrunk to the size of pin pricks.<br>\r\nPinkie Pie looked confused for a second, but just shrugged it off. \"Okie Dokie Lokie, then!\"<br>\r\nScootaloo took over the conversation. \"Don't mind her, Pinkie Pie. She's been acting funny all day. Anyway, this isn't for a party.\"<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAWWWW.\"<br>\r\n\"All of this food is my gift to Rainbow Dash!\" Scootaloo explained.<br>\r\n\"Wowee wow wow! That's so nice of you, Scoots! And, this really is perfect timing. Dashie seems pretty hungry right now.\"<br>\r\n\"How has she been, since she settled in?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's just terrible! I couldn't even get her to laugh at the old, 'Rainbow Jig' routine. And I was sure that would stop her from being such a mopey moperson! She's currently in my room.\"<br>\r\n\"So, I was right!\"<br>\r\n\"Right about what?\"<br>\r\n\"You said that she is really hungry right now, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"And, right now she is so depressed that even you can't make her happy! It has to mean that she needs this food to feel better!\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Y'know, Scoots. That does make sense. Okay! Let's give Rainbow Dash what she needs!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright! Let's start taking these fritters and pies to Pinkie's room, Applejack!\"<br>\r\nApplejack couldn't believe this. She was starting to wonder if this was all an elaborate joke or fetish dream. It was like the universe was allowing her to indulge in her fantasies without anypony questioning her. Whatever was going on, she wasn't about to back out of this opportunity. Even if she did feel bad about taking advantage of her friends' ignorance.<br>\r\n*Ah coulda' said no to Scootaloo. Ah wouldn't be here, about to get sick joy out of stuffin' mah friend's face. Ah guess it is what it is. This pony's had an itch for a long time. And she deserves ta' finally scratch it.*<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Applejack started carrying the basket, full of Apple fritters and as many pies as she could hold into Sugar Cube Corner. Pinkie Pie and Scootaloo carried the rest.<br>\r\nRainbow Dash, expecting Pinkie Pie to get her some cupcakes or something, was no less than surprised when Pinkie Pie, Applejack, and Scootaloo walked into Pinkie's room with 10 apple pies and a basket of apple fritters.<br>\r\n\"WHOA! Um........H-hey Applejack..........and Scootaloo.....\" Rainbow Dash was shocked and almost didn't know how to react to this sudden occurrence. But, strangely enough, she was actually somewhat happy that they brought all that food for her. At least, she assumed it was for her.  * Oh.....my gosh.....am I dreaming?........And why do I actually not mind this?......Is all of it even for me......I......kinda hope it is....For some reason.........I feel that this was just what I needed............What is with me, today?*<br>\r\n\"....What are you all doing here with......all that food?......\"<br>\r\nScootaloo put down her haul and scurried over to 'My Guest Friend'. \"Rainbow Dash!!!\" Scootaloo  hopped onto the bed and hugged Rainbow Dash. \"I knew that you would be staying here with Pinkie Pie for awhile. And that you might be depressed about not being able to use your wings. So, I thought that you would feel better if I got you some good food! It's all yours.\"<br>\r\nPinkie Pie - being her normal, gluttonous self - added, \"Well......I was hoping that I could have some too.....sigh........but I guess you really need this...\"<br>\r\nAfter hearing that, Rainbow Dash - trying hard not to show it - was touched by Scootaloo's thoughtfulness. This just made her more eager to accept the delicious feast. Even if she wasn't sure she could eat it all. She was now determined to try.<br>\r\nShe chuckled warmly. \"Thanks, Scoots. Y'know, I actually am pretty hungry. Hey, AJ!! I bet you a mug of free cider that I can eat all this in one go!!\"<br>\r\nApplejack kind of just squirmed, twitched one of her eyes, and kicked herself with one of her back legs. Any denial that this wasn't really happening was forgotten. And she was ready to have a great night.<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-Y-YOU'RE ON, RAINBOW DASH!!!\" She said in a crazed, excited fashion.<br>\r\nRainbow Dash jumped a bit. That was a little bit unnerving. She leaned in, next to Scootaloo's ear. \"What's with AJ?......That was kinda weird.\"<br>\r\n\"I really don't know. She's been acting strange, ever since I got her to make all this food for you.\"<br>\r\nRainbow Dash pondered for a very brief moment before Applejack trotted over to the bed with the basket of apple fritters. The smell of the morsels was incredibly intoxicating, and gained her full attention. Rainbow Dash has eaten Applejack's fritters before. And, she knew that they had the power to put a pony into a submissive hold of bliss. If not careful, anypony can get hooked. The same could be said about any of the Apple family's recipes. If she wasn't such an athlete, Rainbow Dash would probably be a lot less svelte. Between Applejack and Pinkie Pie making all of these amazing pastries, she has had her fair share of that bliss. She sometimes wishes that she could eat their goods every day. Then, some thoughts struck her.<br>\r\n*Oh my gosh. That smells amazing!........But.......this sure is a lot.........I know that I'm gonna end up getting carried away, if I'm not careful. I'm not going to be able to exercise as much, since I can't do my usual routines........I don't wanna become a butter ball........BUUUUT................If I did................I would totally get in shape again! Yeah! That's right! That most likely won't be happening. But if it did, I could totally be athletic again! I'm Rainbow Dash for crying out loud! Besides, my friends just walked in here, offering me a bunch of food that I didn't have to get for myself! And how can I not try to get some free cider from AJ?*</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Applejack put the basket next to Rainbow Dash, on the bed. She had to stir up the restraint of a Solar guard to not out right stuff a fritter into Rainbow Dash. Rainbow sat up, leaned her back against the frame of 'My Guest Friend', and picked up a fritter from the basket. She was a bit hesitant at first, but ended up taking a tender bite.<br>\r\n\"MMMMmmmm.....Oh, sheleshtia......theesh never tashted thish good before!\" The blissful submission hold of pure, confectionery greatness was never this strong. Rainbow Dash swallowed and quickly scarfed down the rest of the first morsel, licking all the crumbs from her hoof and muzzle when she was done. The metaphorical cuffs were off. Rainbow started eating the fritters like a mad mare.<br>\r\nApplejack started jittering and biting her lip. *WHOA NELLY!!!......M-m-m-maybe Ah shoulda' made more! Ah had no Ahdea that Rainbow was such a good eater! S-she kinda puts me and Pinkie to shame........And Celestia knows Ah've fantasized a lot about Pinkie's appetite before..........Horse apples, Ah'm sick....*<br>\r\nScootaloo was surprised at first. But, she got really happy and excited; bouncing up and down on the bed. \"WOOHOO!! Go Rainbow Dash!! You'll win that cider for sure!!\"<br>\r\nPinkie Pie was impressed. *WOWEE!!! And I thought I was the piggy of the bunch!! Come to think of it.....I don't think I've ever seen Rainbow eat this much ever!........Teeheehee! The echo of my thoughts sounds cool!* She distracted herself with the sounds of her thoughts.<br>\r\nPinkie Pie was right, though. She and her friends had always thought that Rainbow Dash wasn't exactly the biggest eater. It always seemed like she tried to watch her weight. Which made sense, since she always wanted to be the top athlete. But, there were times when it seemed more like she was having an internal conflict when large amounts of food were involved.<br>\r\nWithin a mere minute, Rainbow had demolished the basket of fritters. Her tummy had become a small, but noticeable lump. She looked like she was in ecstasy as she tenderly rubbed it with her fore hooves. She even made soft, almost inaudible moans of pleasure. This was very much unlike the normal Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n\"Oooooh.....uuurrp.....That was amazing....\"<br>\r\n\"YAY!! I knew that you would like this!!\" Scootaloo squealed with glee.<br>\r\nPinkie Pie was in her own, little world. Applejack almost couldn't stand idly any longer. She was, just barely, able to restrain herself before. But, now she was completely turned on by the scene before her. Rainbow Dash was indulging as a gluttonous mare. She may not realize that she is putting on an erotic show for Applejack, but she seems to be enjoying herself. Does Applejack dare offer to feed her?<br>\r\n\"AJ!! Bring me those pies! This feast is going down!!!\"<br>\r\nOr, maybe she doesn't even need to offer?<br>\r\n\"S-s-sure thing s-sugarcube! Ah.....c-can h-help you.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh?! AJ, you are the best!\"<br>\r\nScootaloo felt a twinge of competitive possessiveness over Rainbow Dash. \"Hey! I can help too, Rainbow Dash!\"<br>\r\nApplejack proceeded to bring the pies over to the bed. She pulled out her trusty, baker's knife from the basket that had the fritters, and started cutting the first pie into multiple slices. She was going to cut up all of the pies before giving the slices to Rainbow Dash, but Dash had gotten very greedy and impatient.<br>\r\n\"AJ! Just give me those slices! You too, Scoots!\"<br>\r\n\"A-a-alright, alright!\"<br>\r\n\"YES, MA'AM!!\"<br>\r\nBoth Applejack and Scootaloo grabbed a slice of pie. As soon as they did, Rainbow Dash pulled Applejack's hooves towards her muzzle and sloppily gobbled up her slice. Rainbow even licked the left over debris off of Applejack's hooves. Applejack was giddy and very happy that Rainbow Dash had suddenly become a ravenous feedee. She didn't question it for a second.<br>\r\n\"MMmm. Thanks, Applejack. Your stuff tastes even better than usual!\"<br>\r\nShe blushed and looked to towards the floor. \"Hehehehehe. No problem, RD!.......T-thank you kindly!\"<br>\r\nScootaloo was a little bit annoyed. Rainbow Dash seemed to appreciate Applejack and her cooking more than the fact that this was Scootaloo's idea, in the first place. She was going to show them that she was the unofficial sister that Rainbow Dash deserves. She proceeded to stuff her entire slice into Rainbow Dash's face. The whole thing filled up her cheeks. Rainbow Dash wasn't mad and moaned in approval as she chewed up the big piece. She swallowed it whole. A sizable bulge went down her neck and visibly stretched out her belly slightly more.<br>\r\n\"BURP.....AAAAH......\" She purred slightly as she rubbed her belly some more.<br>\r\n\"HA!! See, Applejack!! I'm way better at pleasing Rainbow Dash than you are!!\"<br>\r\nApplejack was slightly confused. She didn't notice that Scootaloo was competing with her. However.....<br>\r\n*HMMMMM......Ah reckon that Ah can take advantage of this.....* Applejack thought deviously. A dastardly grin struck her face.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?!?!\"<br>\r\nApplejack grabbed another pie slice and crammed it into Rainbow's maw. Dash gratefully accepted this and ate it in mere seconds. She opened her mouth again, expecting more. She was surprisingly approving of all this. Appejack stuffed another. Before Rainbow was done with that one, she readied another. This kept going until the first pie was completely gone, with nothing left but the tin. Which Rainbow Dash licked clean.<br>\r\nRainbow Dash moaned in bliss. \".....S-sweet......HIC.....Celestia......HIC....Don't stop there!!\"<br>\r\n\"Beat that, missy!!\" Applejack shot out.<br>\r\nScootaloo was a bit flustered. She wasn't going to let Applejack be more respected in the eyes of Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n\"FINE!!!\"<br>\r\nScootaloo hurried over to the rest of the pies and brought them to the bed. She picked up one whole pie and removed the tin.<br>\r\n\"Say, 'AAAAH'!!!\"<br>\r\n\"OHMYGOSH-OHMYGOSH-OHMYGOSH!!\" Rainbow opened her jaw as wide as she possibly could. Which was apparently wide enough, because that whole pie went straight into her gaping maw. When she closed her mouth, her cheeks were almost the size of party balloons. But, she didn't care. She just munched and moaned for several seconds.<br>\r\n\"GUULP....BRRAAAAAP!! SIGH.....I can get used to this.....\" She said with lidded eyes and a stupid grin on her face. Rainbow's belly was now close to the size of her own head. The loud outburst of gas finally stirred Pinkie Pie out of her thoughts.<br>\r\n\"O-oh! Hey, everypony! I didn't think we were still-GAAASP!!!......What are you two doing to Rainbow Dash!?!?!\"<br>\r\nApplejack quickly retracted her one hoof from Dash's mouth, as she had just fed her the third pie, and whipped her head towards Pinkie Pie's direction. Scootaloo, who was rubbing Rainbow's belly with both hooves and an expression of steely determination, stopped and stared at Pinkie.<br>\r\nRainbow Dash swallowed and just drunkenly said, \"Oh.....HIC...Hey-UUURP-Pinks! Ca-HIC-can you feed me too?\" She seemed totally out of it.<br>\r\n\"W-W-WELL-Y-Y'S-SEE-AH-AH-AH....THISAIN'TWHATITLOOKSLIKE!!!!\" ; Applejack was pouring sweat; her eyes the size of her freckles; they were darting about, wildly, as she clenched her teeth and shook like a windigo's cold breeze had struck her. She looked like she was about to cry.<br>\r\nScootaloo just stated matter-of-factly, \"Me and Applejack are helping Rainbow Dash finish her feast. And, I'm OBVIOUSLY doing a better job than Applejack.\"<br>\r\n\"OOOOOO-That sounds like fun!! Can I help too!?\"<br>\r\nApplejack's jaw dropped. But, the more she thought about it, the less surprised she was. This is Pinkie Pie. Of course she would think that this could be considered fun. Then, she realized that she had just dodged a speeding arrow.<br>\r\n*PHEW...Ah thought Ah was caught fer sure....Well.....Ah kinda was.....*<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, sugarcube. Yah can give an extra hoof in feedin' RD the rest o' the pies.\"<br>\r\n\"Okie Doki Lokie!\"<br>\r\nScootaloo didn't say anything. But, she didn't look happy about this. Now Pinkie Pie was going to try stealing Rainbow Dash's attention during her moment to shine? She continued rubbing Rainbow Dash's belly as she contemplated.<br>\r\nPinkie Pie gave Rainbow Dash the fourth pie. Then, immediately followed up with the fifth. Both her and Applejack continued the same pattern until all of the Apple family confectioneries disappeared into Rainbow Dash. Her stomach was so big, that Scootaloo could barely see past it as she stood at the side of the bed. It was as tight as a drum, and as round as a ball. Rainbow Dash sluggishly shifted until her head was sinking into one of the ivory pillows of 'My Guest Friend'. The mattress sank ever so slightly, comforting Rainbow Dash with its soft embrace.<br>\r\nHer hooves rubbed as much of her belly as they could. \"Ooooooooooh........I'm.........s-soooooo-BUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRP......stuff ed.....\" She huffed breathlessly. Her breathing was labored. Although, she had never felt so amazing while not showing off her flying skills before. Before long, Rainbow Dash had slipped into a blissful, food coma.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But Twilight could still identify the final few parts of the sequence as Rainbow flew dead straight and up in a wide arc, sloped down into a dizzying rainbow-colored figure eight, stung away and swirled through the two hoops, swirling them into a vortex before shooting up and down to split the tornado apart, sending a cloudy rain of shining, rainbow colored light down as she dove like a rock to the ground and slammed into the grass only a few feet from Twilight, who still jumped after how long she'd watched her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"35 seconds!\" Twilight read off of her stopwatch. \"Wow, Rainbow, that's got to be the best-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!!!\" Rainbow spat in frustration. \"Why can't my stupid wings fly any faster?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow, that was one of your best times yet!

Besides, I'm sure that pushing yourself like this will just run you over your limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know...\" Rainbow grumbled, looking back on her times at the Wonderbolts Academy. But then again, she still knew how tight-ended the judges could be at these auditions. \"...what if 'my best's' not good enough for them, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. You're still one of the best fliers in Equestria!\" Twilight enforced, placing a hoof on her friend's shoulder. \"If they see you and don't give a second glance, they wouldn't have any idea who they could've dealing with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...I just...I just wish I had some way to get a little <i>thing</i> above the others, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, why don't we take a break?\" Twilight recommended, stepping back the way to town. \"I'm sure all this flying's got you exhausted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right. Guess I'm getting kinda thirsty, anyway.\" Rainbow admitted as she followed Twilight, the two of heading back from the outskirts of Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, no Arctic Rush?\" Rainbow complained upon seeing that the vending machine was fresh out. \"Dangit, when are they gonna fix this dang thing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might have some at the corner store down there!\" Twilight noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked down the street towards the corner where a small crowd was gathering in the street. Not an unusual sight in town, but the two took notice of a stand in the midst of the growing herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Rainbow leapt up and with a flap of her wings flew down the street above the ponies in her way, giving her a nice view of a lime green pegasus with a green-and-white striped mane onstage in front of a banner picturing a green bottle with a white lightning bolt running through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S THE SUPEREST-DUPEREST MOST ENERGY-TASTIC BOTTLE OF PURE SUGAR-LADEN PONY POWER YOU'LL EVER BENCH-PRESS YOUR TASTEBUDS WITH!!!\" She shouted with an exuberance that would put Pinkie to shame, her pupils shrunk tight from sheer ecstasy. \"ONE PULP OF PERK PRIME'S PEAK POWER POTION IS WHAT MADE ME THE PRIME POWERHOUSE OF PERK I AM TODAY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...powerhouse?\" Rainbow folded her wings down and swooped to the front of the crowd, to the bemusement of a few ponies at front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEFORE I COULDN'T DREAM OF ALL THE THINGS I COULD DO BEING THE LAZY BUMMARINO I ONCE WAS, BUT NOW I CAN DO A THOUSAND AND MORE THAN ANYTHING I'D EVER DONE BEFORE ALL THANKS TO THE MIRACLE OF THE MOST ADRENALINE-FUELED SPORTS DRINK EVER MADE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrenaline?\" Rainbow repeated interestedly, an expression that caught Perk's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE GOT US A CURIOUS CATHY, HERE!\" In a flash she reached down and yanked Rainbow onto the stage with her. \"DO YOU, MISSY, EVER THINK ABOUT ALL THE STUFF YOU COULD BE DONE'IN WITH PERK PRIME'S PEAK POWER POTION JUMPSTARTING YOUR SYSTEM?!\" Rainbow flinched at the mare's volume in her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEN LET ENLIGTENMENT TAKE ITS COURSE!!!\" Perk Prime seemed to reach from nowhere and shoved one if the bottles into her mouth, letting her gulp it down as though she were feeding a baby. \"NOW, EVERYPONY, WATCH NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the HAY is your...\" But just as Rainbow was about to wallop the mare she suddenly jolted as she felt a sharp, sudden jab of energy strike her in the pit of her stomach, slowly coursing through her veins with her legs shuddering at the passing sensation. It felt as though pure energy was coursing through her muscles, a sensation that Rainbow was quickly starting to welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing a hold of her newfound rush, Rainbow smelled at the confidence-fueling feeling and leapt into the air and soared through several quick loops in the air, the audience murmuring approvingly at what they'd seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'D SEEN IT RIGHT NOW, RIGHT HERE, IN OUR EXACT PLANE OF EXISTENCE, LADIES AND GERMS! THIS PONY'S A NEW MARE READY TO SEE THE REST OF HER LIFE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, this is what I'd been needing!\" Rainbow gibbered quickly, shaking the mare's hoof. \"How can I get more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, MISS, AS SOMEPONY LUCID TO THE POWERS OF THE POWERHOUSE POTION I'LL GIVE YOU AN INSIDER DISCOUNT!!!\" The mare reached behind her and swung in a cart filled with dozens of the drink. \"FIFTY BITS FOR ALL THESE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Rainbow zipped away from the stage and took her saddlebag back from Twilight, who barely noticed it missing as Rainbow darted back. \"Fifty bits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO, MISS, SEE THE WORLD BEYOND THE CHAINS BINDING YOU FROM THE HEAVENS ABOVE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Rainbow dumped off fifty bits for the sales pony, she took her drinks and left the stage just as the audience grew into a loud, clattered murmur to sample some of the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EASY, FOLKS, THERE'S ENOUGH TO PILE AROUND!!!\" She whooped, blinking her light eye to align her contact lens. <i>But not enough for every sucker in town...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow? What was going on up there?\" Twilight asked as Rainbow returned with her bounty in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I struck gold, Twilight! I got just what I need for the audition!\" Rainbow pulled out a drink and unscrewed the cap, taking a long sip from the drink inside. \"This crazy pony was giving it away on stage and it made me feel <i>alive!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALive? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This awesome sport's drink! You gotta try it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Twilight gently pushed the drink away, unnerved by Rainbow's enthusiasm. \"No thanks, I'm not a fan of energy drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, suit yourself.\" Rainbow dipped the bottle back and downed the last of the drink, tossing the empty over her shoulder with a loud belch. <b><i>BRAAAAP!!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, 'scuse me! C'mon, let's go see if any of the others wanna hang out!\" Rainbow said as she walked past Twilight, taking another of the drinks from the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Rainbow trotted by, Twilight caught a glimpse of something...different about Rainbow. She couldn't put her finger on it, but as she watched Rainbow move she picked up on a faint jiggle running through Rainbow's step. It was then that Twilight noticed that Rainbow's stomach looked somewhat rounder and hung down further than usual, puffing out a few inches further than the slim, tender waistline Rainbow'd had for years. Her legs also seemed a bit puffier, boasting an unfamiliar amount of paunch that bunched around her joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Rainbow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll be a <i>shoe-in</i> for...</span></div></div>",

At first it was but a nagging feeling in Twilight's mind as the entire town seemed to be filled with a very sluggish, lazy air as the local ponies slowly trotted about, un absent the former energy bustling through the streets. It was around now as she looked around that she noticed that most of Ponyville looked significantly heavier than average; some had only gained a slight amount of plump while others had become significantly fat or even outright obese, but didn't seem to pay much heed to their gain as they walked about with their bellies less than a few inches from the ground, their engorged bodies jiggling with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could this have something to do with Rainbow disappearing?\" Twilight thought aloud as she glanced around without looking straight ahead of her, leading her to bump into a soft, furry wall in the sidewalk. \"Oh, I'm so sorry, I wasn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Twilight's voice fell silent as she looked closer at the black-furred, rounded mass she'd slammed into. It was Thunderlane, who didn't seem to notice Twilight had run into him as he pointed his head up with a bottle of the sport's drink in his puffy cheeks. Twilight slowly backed away with her jaw slackened in shock as she took a distant look at his size, the athletic stallion he once was completely devoured beneath monstrous amounts of easily several hundreds of pounds worth of fat. He actually looked two feet taller than before, and his belly was so large that it completely swamped a large area of the dirt road around him, his round, bloated legs pressing down against its pressure as they struggled to keep his hooves grounded, with his hindlegs weighed down by the immense, grandiose size of his flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spat the bottle out once it was empty with a loud belch, but as he reached down to grab another near his side he noticed Twilight gawking at him and smiled. \"Hey, Miss Sparkle! 'Sup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THUNDERLANE?!!?\" Twilight sputtered, barely able to cohere a sentence to match her astonishment. \"Wh...What happened to you?!!? What's happening to the town!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's this new energy drink! It gives you this insane rush and tastes awesome!\" He held a bottle out for her. \"Want one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...I...no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, suit yourself.\" He grabbed another bottle and pointed each into his mouth, squirting their contents inside. Right before Twilight's eyes she saw his belly ooze further out along the ground as it began to expand as several dozen more pounds were pumped into his body, his cheeks filling out more of his maw as his legs continues to balloon on top of his monolithic stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's muscles fell limp as she stared at the growing stallion in a mix of horror and tantalized fascination, but shook her curiosity out of her mind as she ran around him and flapped her wings into takeoff, shakily flying up en route towards Rainbow's house in the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me this hasn't gotten to Rainbow, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow? Are you in their?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight knocked against Rainbow's front door, the cloud material letting out a soft squish with each rap. But she realized she'd never checked to see if it was locked as it opened against her knocking, the foyer dark behind the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow? I'm sorry, but I'm coming in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight hit the light switch as she invited herself in, banishing the darkness concealing the foyer. The room still looked in proper order, but her fears were worsened upon seeing a trash can in the corner of the room filled with the same green bottles Rainbow and Thunderlane had been drinking from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight? That you?\" She heard Rainbow ask from a door to the right. \"I'm in the living room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight trotted along the cloud floor and opened the half-open door to see Rainbow standing in the center, drinking another sports drink amongst dozens of empty bottles scattered along the floor...</span></div></div>",

Twilight was so shocked that she didn't even realize she was staring until Rainbow spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Twilight? Hello? Anypony in there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?

I'll prove to you that these drinks are only making me more athletic than before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was too distracted to answer Rainbow's question, however.

Her grand, ground-scraping belly was somehow still supported by her doughy legs, each one not that dissimilar to overfilled pastry bags. Her ass was easily as big beach balls, sagging heavily off the rest of her rotund body as it looked as if it was trying to engulf her tail. Her sides were nearly a foot of pure fat bloating out from her body, her wings laying on her back and likely useless by now. Her chest sagged slightly, being more of a shelf for her two chins. Her face was puffy, cheeks large even after she swallowed the last of another can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling herself together after seeing the shocking sight, Twilight ran up to Rainbow and ripped the new can the fat pegasus had grabbed right from her hoof and holding it away from her in her magic before she could take another swig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's your problem?!

If you would just listen to me for one moment I-WAHHHH?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery suddenly Twilight felt one of her hind legs go out from under her after accidentally stepping on a discarded can. With Rainbow leaning on her still Twilight quickly found herself falling backwards. Soon enough Twilight slammed onto the ground and before she could even register the pain of the impact a second one came as Rainbow's full weight landed on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cyan mass of flab jiggled for a few seconds after landing on top of the unicorn with a mighty *PLOP*. Rainbow had been just as surprised as Twilight and wasn't immediately aware of what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rai-Rainbow, please get off, I can barely breathe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing fully too Rainbow looked down. Twilight was almost entirely covered by the bigger mare, her neck down was buried under the soft yet heavy flesh. She was a little bruised and the pressure on her chest was making it hard to get air, but otherwise she was fine. Rainbow's first instinct was to get off her friend as quickly as she could, but before she did a thought popped into her head when she saw the still full can of energy drink they had been fighting over was sitting within hooves reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Rainbow, I really don't feel comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was starting to get worried as she watched her friends face shift between contemplation, uncertainty, slight anger, then at last an evil little grin. Rainbow reached out and grabbed the can and brought it up to her face, eyes with a mischievous gleam in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow? What are you thinking of doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's worry shifted to fear when Rainbow didn't answer her, instead giggling madly as she opened the can and lowered it so that it was hovering right over her captives head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Twi, I understand you're not sure about the awesomeness of these cans of pure goodness, but that's why you've got cool friends like me who are willing to help. Heck, I'm gonna even give up one of mine so you can see what you're missing out on, so open up wide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow tried to put the lip of the can to Twilight's lips, but Twilight swivelled her head to the side to avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, I am NOT drinking a single drop of that cursed stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing, Rainbow pulled the can back thinking over how to get Twilight to drink, while she did Twilight tried to charge a spell, but found that with her breathing being compromised she couldn't summon even a fraction of her normal magic. As Twilight's horn fizzled from a failed teleportation spell Rainbow figured that all she could do was brute-force the matter. With her free hoof Rainbow took a tight hold of Twilight's lower jaw and began to pull it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight did everything she could to try and wrench herself free, but Rainbow's grip was strong and kept her mouth open as the can tipped forward closer to her mouth. Sure enough without any means to escape the soda began to pour into her mouth. Rainbow kept spilling more into Twilight's mouth until it was full, at which point she firmly close it shut. Wanting to make sure she didn't have any other choice but to drink Rainbow set down the can use the now open hoof to close up Twilight's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry that I had to do it like this, but I promise you that you'll be thanking me once you fell that energy pumping through your body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight tried to keep the liquid in her mouth as long as possible. a brief thought passing about how it didn't taste particularly special, just like an overly sweet soda, but with her already limited air having been cut off the inevitable came and she swallowed her load. Seeing this Rainbow lets go of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GASP* \"RAINBOW, I am going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not another word left escaped her mouth as a feeling quickly began to spread from her stomach outward to the rest of her body. She suddenly felt ready to move the sun and moon, fake strength coursing through her veins. Rainbow grinned like a mad mare watching her friend's reaction. She grabbed the can again and put up to Twilight's lips again, this time not having to force it as Twilight started to drink of her own will. She didn't know why she let Rainbow pour the rest down her throat, she just did. Rainbow stopped only when the last drop was inside Twilight. Tossing the can the same as she had done many others Rainbow finally rose up off of Twilight. Sitting down next to her, Rainbow helped Twilight up into a sitting position as well. Twilight just sat there for the moment, looking stunned. Rainbow, however, was eager to see if the drink did its job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you feel? Still think the stuffs bad?\"</span></div></div>",

They'd be perfectly fine for the first few minutes, but as she'd sleep, the clouds would slowly drift closer towards the earth before she would sink through, waking from her sleep as she would seep through and her stomach would touch the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd experimented several times with different sizes and densities, but the result would either be the cloud sinking or her sinking <i>through</i> the cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What could be going on?</i> She thought to herself. <i>Could there be a problem with the cloud production?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided that a quick trip to cloudsdale could provide the answer. After all, it might be a fun experience returning to her old hometown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe readied herself by stretching her wings out and tightening her leg muscles. But just as she lowered herself for takeoff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Squish*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow's eyes widened in surprise as she felt her stomach touch the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe canceled her takeoff and stood up straight, pressing a hoof against her stomach. Sure enough, her belly seemed to hang down five inches further than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird...\" She said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on a log nearby to examine herself better. Feeling her belly, her stomach sure enough had a larger amount of weight put onto it. However, it wasn't just her stomach. All four of her legs were thicker, particularly her hind legs. Feeling at her face, her cheeks seemed to have a little more puff to them. She could also tell from sitting on the log that her plot had garnered some cush to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on? I usually get a lot of exercise...\" Rainbow grew fearful, hoping that her newly fund weight wouldn't hamper her flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a loud gurgling noise emanated from her stomach. The sound surprised her, as she felt no hunger from it, but her confusion turned to shock as her stomach started to grow. As the sky-blue mass started to gain volume, it reached out further till five inches were added to it.

But when she noticed Rainbow standing in her doorway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh my Celestia! What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rainbow explained this morning and what happened at Rarity's to Twilight. She stood in front of the fat pegasus, absorbing the information like a sponge. When Rainbow finished, she summoned a piece of parchment and began scribbling on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If what you are saying is true, then we will have to inform the princesses immediately! Spike is off with the crusaders doing something, and I can't get in touch with them until I find him,\" Twilight paused for a second, then continued, \"I will be back as fast as I can. You can stay here if you want; I assume that you don't want the populace to see you like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rainbow Dash nodded, and Twilight trotted out the door. The pegasus stood in the library, alone with nothing to do. She browsed the bookcases for any new releases of Daring Doo, but found only old ones. She sat on the couch and pondered about what she was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But her thoughts were interrupted when a gurgle sounded from inside of her plump gut. Fat soon started piling on to the once fit frame. Rainbow stood quickly, feeling the cellulite rest against the floorboards. Her limbs thickened, and her thighs touched. But the most prominent feature was her flank. It swelled outwards until each cheek could comfortably take up one couch cushion each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Another gurgle erupted form her stomach, but this time it was from hunger. Rainbow had ignored her hunger before, but now it seemed to be the only thing she could think about. So the obese athlete waddled into the kitchen, open the refrigerator, and spied a jug of apple cider. She picked it up, and turned towards the kitchen table. In the center was a fruit basket, holding freshly picked apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rainbow Dash carried the apple bowl and cider onto the couch, and she sat back. She was bored, and what better way to cure boredom then to cure your hunger. She picked up an apple in her hoof, and bit into it. The flavor seemed amplified, somehow. It was the best tasting apple she ever ate! The rest was downed in one gulp, along with the rest of the apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cider jug open easily, and the pegasus chugged the contents in ten seconds flat. The cool cider rested in her belly, and she rubbed the mass. She felt the apples and cider inside of her fat body. A sigh escaped her lips, and as it did, a gurgle did from her mammoth of a gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The fat spilled outwards, and pushed against her legs, which too were fattening. The blubber cover her back, and she felt her neck sink into her body. The fat lifted her limbs off of the wooden ground below her, and Rainbow started to feel scared. She kicked and kicked, but that only succeeded in causing jiggles to ripple across her flesh. The growth eventually stopped, but the pegasus was immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rainbow laid on the couch, feeling as much of her fat body as she could. It was soft and warm, but also restricting and unhealthy. After considering the pros and cons...</span></div></div>",

TWILIGHT!??!\" Rainbow knocked against the lavender substance in some hope that it would deliver an answer, but her only response was a few unusual sounds as the fat shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man...\" Rainbow noticed that a window on the balcony was open, but she couldn't reach it due to her indisposed flight. She instead opened for a metal ladder perched against the wall of a nearby building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWILIGHT, I'M COMING IN!!!\" Rainbow called out as she ascended the ladder. Each of the rungs bended slightly as she traversed upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on the balcony, Rainbow infiltrated the library and descended a flight of stairs leading into the main chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, I...WOAH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main chamber was normally 20 feet in height, but now there was only six feet of space below the ceiling that wan't occupied by the soft, mauve mass below it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's legs were now longer than Celestia was tall, but her forelegs were shorter and tree-trunk width. Her Hind legs were even longer and grotesquely huge, buried between the wall and her gargantuan rear end, which took up about two-fifths of the area behind her and elevated upwards by two feet. Anything else was dominated by her titanic belly, which greedily occupied any and all space in the library beneath and building strong pressure. After a minute of navigating the blob of incredibly soft, yet stable fat, Rainbow made out Twilight's mane. Finding her head buried in fat up to her nostrils and atop an army of about ten huge chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...R-Rainbow? Is that you?\" Despite the grogginess and sickness to it, her normal voice was a huge contrast to the monstrosity she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T...T-T...Twilight?\" Rainbow could barely form words as her fears that the fat in the library was her friend Twilight. \"W-What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know...\" Twilight uttered. \"It just s-started happening a-a few days ago, I...I just gain weight in..in intervals, and I get fatter each time... I-I tried to stop it, but each attempt to reverse it only made it worse, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you sent a letter to Princess Celestia about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've sent some, but she hasn't responded at all.

NOT AGAIN!!!\" Rainbow yelled as fat was added to her. Her belly would now press against the ground, rounded to a point where it just started to touch her legs, which fattened to a diameter of eight inches each calf. Her cheeks puffed outwards as her double chin just started to peek out. She also grew, adding about six inches to her, making her about five feet tall. With one or two more gains, she'd estimated to be at about Rarity's size this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Twilight, they ascended another three feet as her belly built up more and more pressure beneath them. Her rear end now pressed to the wall where it was three feet tall above her back. Her arms fattened and grew and her head sunk slightly into her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow...I...I'm so sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault, Twilight...but what are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a letter appeared in midair between them.

It proceeded to grow and soften, her belly inching forwards fatter and fatter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">One Hour Later...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flabbergasted guard came into the throne room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Your hignesses?\" He stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, soldier?\" Shining asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a pony here to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence's and Shining's faces fell as they heard that there forewarned guest had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring them in.\" Said Cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my liege.\" He said as he exited the room. The throne room doors opened all the way, and the two rulers gaped in shock at what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow was now ten feet tall and fifteen feet long, the last third of her length occupied by her enormous rump. Her three-foot wide forelegs gradually bunched into dinner plate-sized hooves that were seven feet apart, separated by a mass off fat from her belly that forced its way through by two feet. Her monolithic belly stuck out from between her legs, causing her sides to bulge out another five feet. At eighteen feet, her flank marked her widest point, barely beating her protrusive stomach by a foot (each hind leg's calf neared five feet in diameter). The poor mare could only move by gently inching her hooves forward while forcing them grounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...Hey, guys...\" Rainbow dash chuckled, embarrassed. Her head was wrapped in a thick collar of fat that was once her neck, her fat cheeks bonding with her 7-10 chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R...<i>RAINBOW?</i>\" Cadence uttered in shock. She was expecting a fat pony, but not <i>this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be saying that a lot louder if you saw Twilight, Cadence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence gasped, but said not another thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens now?\" Rainbow asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well,\" Shining said, joining in. \"We have a few scientists i another room who wish to analyze your magical index, and reverse-engineer the bug affecting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will that take? I get fatter every fifteen minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would actually like them to see you grow at least once, Rainbow. That way we can observe the situation better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining used his magic to summon a golden communication device up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pony is here, and be warned...she's ten feet tall. Try not to let that disturb you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Understood, sir.\"</i> Came a voice from the receiving end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, Shining discarded the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry about all this, Rainbow,\" Cadence said, no longer absent from the conversation. \"I understand how much you love flying, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry about it, Princess. Like you guys said, I'll get better in no ti...\"</span></div></div>",

Their pleas fell silent, but the shock of what had happened was still prominent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining, now the second-largest pony in the room (losing to his wife by only a few inches), had a stomach that stuck out eight feet from each side. His feet were at the point where they were transitioning from touching the ground to being lifted up by his belly, his front legs (four feet wide at the calf) forced about nine feet from each other. At a stupefying fifteen feet in height, his plot was large enough to fill an empty wall in a living room. His once-chiseled skull receded into his massive cheeks, resting atop over ten chins. The white mass was twenty feet from his head to the furthest point on his flank, his cutie mark now the size of a full grown stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence, slightly taller, looked almost exactly like her husband, aside from her pink coat over his pure white. Her flank was also her widest point, vaguely like Rainbow's, reaching a width of twenty-five feet. Even if they were Rainbow's height, they still would've been fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow stared at the shocked rulers in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...oh nonononono, guys, <i>I'm so sorry!</i> I...I didn't...\" Rainbow almost felt tears coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...We know, Rainbow...I just...\" Shining said, squeezing his stomach to get a better grip on reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm sure the scientists might have room for two more ponies of our size...\" Said Cadence, her tone somewhat unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, the throne room doors were thrown open.</span></div></div>",

Her gargantuan belly spread out eighteen feet from each side, lifting all of her hooves off the ground, rendering her completely immobile. Her flank had now reached 32-feet in width, losing to her stomach by four feet.

Anypony to slow to outrun their bulk would be caught in the ring, which would safely levitate them up and onto Cadence's back. Rainbow seemed to shrink in comparison as they ballooned outwards beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to grow for ten seconds straight. Their newfound growth gave them around a hundred feet of height and a hundred twenty in width. Even though they had stopped, the citizens were still restless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everypony, listen to me!\" Shining exclaimed. \"As said, remain calm! Anypony who is afraid to use the ladders is free to be levitated as before! I promise you all, you're all going to be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough still unnerved, most of the citizens absorbed their leaders' words and slowly began to approach them again, either entering a pink spot of the ring that remained in front of Cadence, or proceeding to the ladders on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Again, how long will this be?\" Rainbow repeated, but this time out of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Soon, hopefully...\" Shining answered, matching her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least an hour had passed with no change in effect. All of the citizens had successfully been evacuated onto Cadence's back, who was currently chatting with a bunch of locals sitting near her head (which was now several times their height). Shining decided to take a nap, hugging his own fat stomach as a makeshift mattress. Rainbow simply laid awake on his back, gently bobbing up and down with his gentle snores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So boring...\" she sighed with her chin rested on her forehooves. \"I can't wait for this to be over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an impressive view of the country from her altitude, but she was since bored with it after an hour of seeing it.

The ponies growing everywhere are out of control, they can't move and other ponies are having a hard time not getting crushed, \" explained the chief scientist, now sounding fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is some good news though. We've studied the effect the viruses our having on our rulers, and they aren't suffering from any ill effects. In fact, it's making their magic far stronger as time passes. It would seem their magic power is growing exponentially over time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh ... , \" said Rainbow, dumbfounded. \"Care to explain that in plain pony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is, their magic will quickly become extremely powerful, making them far more powerful than Princesses Celestia and Luna combined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a massive, horned, white head with a blue and cyan mane rose up. \"Status report, please, \" said Shining Armour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief scientist explained to Rainbow what had just been happening, while at the same time, Princess Cadence was reading a letter that had magically appeared in front of her huge head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey? Does your magic feel a lot stronger than it did an hour ago?\" asked Shining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining started explaining what the scientists had told him, while Cadence explained Princess Celestia's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got no choice but to start teleporting everypony, and others, on to my back, quickly. There'll be plenty of room for them as we grow much bigger. Being able to control our growth will mean we have time to evacuate all of Equestria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only a temporary solution, as once everypony is safe, the next step will be to levitate ourselves far above the ground, and use magic to teleport all of Equestria on to your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally I'd call a plan like this crazy, but we're running out of time, plus I do like the way you look ... \" said Shining, flashing a grin at Cadence. \"I also like the really snug feeling of being so big and fat. It's been so long since I've been able to rest like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence blushed. \"I know, honey. I love it too, \" she said, returning his grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, their bellies started rumbling. \"Oh no! We have to stop this, just for a little longer!\" yelled Cadence, her horn glowing. \"Shining, quickly, read this spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining took the scroll from Cadence and used the same spell. The rumbling subsided, but they both suddenly felt really tight. \"I don't think we're going to be able to hold these viruses back much longer, that felt like the start of a really big one!\" said Shining, a tone of fear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shining, read the other spell, the one Princess Celestia told me about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let's see ... Oh! This must be the one for removing the viruses, and we'd be the only ones powerful enough to do it now. We'd better hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, their horns glowed, and a brilliant light spread all over Equestria. Soon, everypony was back to normal, including Rainbow, but not Shining and Cadence. After that, Cadance and Shining immediately started teleporting as many ponies and other creatures across Equestria as they could on to Cadence's back, starting with the ones nearest the Crystal Empire. Cadence calmly explained what was going on as more and more creatures appeared. After 1 hour of mass teleportation and stopping the virus, Cadance and Shining's bodies felt like they were about to explode. The Mane 6 had decided to come over to see Shining, and discuss the matter in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twily!\" said Shining, ecstatic to see Twilight back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, \" said Twilight, an expression of awe on her face, \"where are we, and how did you get this big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're standing on your RRBBBFF, \" said Shining, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRBBBFF?\" said Twilight, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, really, BIG brother best friend forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that!\" said Twilight, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining calmly explained to the bearers of the Elements of Harmony what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both Shining and Cadance grimaced. \"Shining! The atmosphere spell, hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of their horns glowed, and then a massive rumbling reverberated through their oversized bellies, causing an earthquake that was felt all over Equestria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on tight, everypony!\" exclaimed Shining and Cadance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, their bellies surged outwards in all direction, causing them to blimp out, with pink and white flesh surging over the landscape of Equestria and the land surrounding the Crystal Empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels sooooo gooood!\" moaned Shining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I love it!\" moaned Cadence. \"Let's keep teleporting everypony, it should be much easier with our new size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all of the citizens of Equestria had been evacuated on to Cadence's back, with all that could be seen of Equestria from space being two massive blobs, one white, and one pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, we're the size of Equestria now!\" exclaimed Shining, gleefully. \"The next step is us levitating upwards, and teleporting Equestria on to my back, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, \" said Cadence. \"I need to check this virus hasn't spread any further.

I know! That spell that lets me use telepathy I just learned this morning should do the trick!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the chief scientist heard a familiar voice in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hello, can you hear me? It's me, Prince Shining. I'm using telepathy to talk to you now, as it's going to be difficult to talk to ponies normally with the size my head has grown to. You can talk to me just by thinking of your response. Any news on the virus inside us?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Prince Shining, the virus in your body, and that of your wife, appear to be busy gathering even more energy, although we don't predict more growth for a whole day yet, after that last tremendous growth. There also seems to be signs the virus is growing more intelligent. Maybe you could try using your magic to talk to them?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Interesting. I'll look into it after I've had some time to relax with my wife. I'll send you the spell you need to get in touch with me.</i> thought Shining, to the chief scientist. With that, Shining Armour conjured a scroll and quill at microscopic size to him, but he used magic to magnify his vision and pen the details of the spell anyway, and sent teleported it to the chief scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I was wondering, could you give me a belly rub?\" said Shining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to ask you the same thing,\" said Cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's both do it then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they started massaging each other's planetary bellies with their hooves, each hoof being five times the diameter of Ungula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh! This feels divine!\" moaned Cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I knew it felt good when I snuggled myself, but this feels sooooo gooooooood!\" moaned Shining. \"It feels like our nerves have grown extremely sensitive, I can even feel everypony on me moving around. You know, I think I could get used to this, as long as we don't expand too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed!\" said Cadence. \"Now let's stop talking and continue rubbing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they continued their massage for an hour, moaning contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That felt great, but tiring at the same time, \" said Shining. \"I'm going to take a rest now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, \" said Cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they both fell asleep, with titanic snoring that could be heard 1000 miles away from their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the chief scientist's team had picked up very interesting readings. The virus in their bloated rulers' bodies had been gaining intelligence until half an hour before they fell asleep. They also realised the viruses were taking in energy at a much higher rate than before, leading them to believe another massive expansion was in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'd better write up my findings and ask Shining to summon me to his head when he's awake.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12 hours later, Shining and Cadence finally awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How long have we been asleep for? It felt like a long nap,</i> thought Shining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Shining heard thoughts in his mind. <i>Sir! It's me, the chief scientist! I need to see you right away, can you please bring me to your head? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sure, don't worry about me not being able to see you, I have magic that will let me see you very clearly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the chief scientist was teleported half a mile in front of Shining's head. Shining looked down and spoke: \"Status report, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist briefed him on what he'd learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, please keep looking into the intelligence of the viruses now. I'd also like you to do a study into the sensitivity of the nerves of Princess Cadence and myself, please. I'm afraid I need some time alone to think, so I'll send you back now,\" said Shining, absentmindedly rubbing his hooves down his stupendous stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief scientist bowed, and was teleported back to his team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey? Were you talking to somepony?\" said Cadence, who still seemed groggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Shining, \"just trying to figure out what's going on with the viruses.\"<br>\r\nAfter Shining filled Cadence in on the details, they decided to try a belly rub again, but far more gentle this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, this feels good, and it's a lot more relaxing, \" moaned Shining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, \" moaned Cadence, \"it really takes a lot of stress off of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

[i]As you have suspected, we are viruses that have recently become self-aware thanks to the Elements of Harmony. We cannot live without a host, but at the same time, we like to give our host what they need to look after us, and to that end, we build up their energy by absorbing sunlight and magical energy, and convert it to fat for the host that is used to give us all energy. Next, we build up the host's muscles, and magical power, if they have it, to allow the hosts to move around freely. Until we were struck by the magic of the Elements, we had no idea of the inconvenience and danger we posed, and we deeply apologise for any inconvenience we may have caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, we are pleased that you both enjoy your new bodies and power, as we intended, and we are currently enhancing your brain to allow you to control what we do to your body, instead of all of these unexpected growth spurts that we didn't know was so inconvenient. Very shortly, you'll be able to work with us to allow both of you to grow to your hearts' content. We've already gathered enough energy from the surroundings to allow you to grow to at least 100 times your current size, and that's just the beginning![/i]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining and Cadence discussed the problems they faced with the viruses, and decided that they should be allowed to have some time to rest, but they also asked the viruses to keep absorbing the energy, as they couldn't get enough of the idea of getting bigger, at their own pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 week later, Shining and Cadence were still the same size, and all of Equestria had been moved on to Shining's titanic back, where Princess Cadence could easily see and speak to her subjects, while Shining could easily protect everypony there with his own special skills with defensive magic. They discussed what the viruses had told them, and in celebration of one week of being new rulers, they had planned something special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing their enhanced brains, they signalled for the viruses to cause as much explosive growth of their bodies as possible. A massive rumble was heard throughout their bodies, one that would normally cause an earthquake that would defy description, and lasted for a whole hour, until suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Hi. It gets kind of lonely out here, with just the two of us. We're both glad to see you'd like to join us. You'll be able to grow and keep growing forever, although we will always be ahead of you in size, but that doesn't really matter, does it?\" said Shining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, I don't have as many responsibilities as you do, and I think you've both earned it, \" Rainbow said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Rainbow, \" said Cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to put you at a spot below the halfway point between our heads, where you can grow without colliding with Ungula, or its sun and moon. Cadence will be careful to make sure Ungula remains safe, and will move it up if necessary. Then, both of us will use magic to transfer viruses from our body that are multiplying into your body, which you can then grow as you see fit. The rate at which you grow will go up as more viruses multiply within you. Once you get to the point where you touch us, it starts to feel REALLY good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we get started? \" asked Cadence eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! YES PLEASE!\" exclaimed Rainbow, barely able to contain her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another flash, Rainbow appeared in space, between the upper halves of Shining's and Cadence's enormous blobby bodies, but far below Ungula and its sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've used magic to enable you to breathe for now, Rainbow, \" said Cadence. \"Soon, the viruses will give you your own magic power to enable you to make a breathable atmosphere all around your body, among other things. Now, let us begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo enormous beams of light shot out from the royal rulers' horns and enveloped Rainbow in a rainbow-coloured glow. Rainbow moaned in delight as her body surged out in all directions as she grew, and grew, and grew. Within a mere 10 seconds, she was the size of Ungula, but the royal rulers were only just getting started. Within 50 more seconds, she was the size of Ungula's star, and her body started to press against Shining's and Cadence's bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW! THIS FEELS AWESOME!\" yelled/moaned Rainbow at the top of her voice. The light disappeared, but she noticed her body was still expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you have been brought up to a nice size and are in direct contact with our bodies, more viruses from our bodies will be able to move into yours, further increasing the rate at which you grow, \" said Shining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe viruses then explained to Rainbow how they can help her expand, much like they did with Shining.

Due to sensory overload, they both blacked out, with their horns set to fire the spell off continuously until stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 minute later, Rainbow felt flesh surging up against hers, and moaned at the now-familiar feeling of flesh surging against flesh. \"Shining?\" said Rainbow, wondering how long they would be busy. But Rainbow didn't hear a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shining? Hello, are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hello, Rainbow.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh! Who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We're the viruses that are inside you. We've become intelligent, but there's a problem. Shining and Cadence weren't prepared for what their spells would do and have lost consciousness, and their spells are still firing at each other.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viruses that can talk? Neat. But what are we to do about the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We've seen to it you won't black out over sensory overload, and have dulled your nerves so you don't lose consciousness due to expansion. However, there's not much we can do but wait for Shining and Cadence to recover and regain consciousness.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long does it take before the astronomically-sized rulers wake up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shining's eyes fluttered open only after a minute of continuous growing, shutting off the beam streaming from his horn as he got a grip on the world around him again. Cadance was still asleep, snoring loudly as her spell shot randomly in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cadance, wake up!\" A gentle nudge from Shining was all it took for her to sputter awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...What? Shining? Where's Rainbow?\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"I'M DOWN HERE!!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow was standing on the front of Shining's belly, who was now the size of a planet compared to her. He was big enough that his fur reached half of her height, with nothing for her to see of him except the mountain range of his doughy body. Shinign couldn't see her, but could still sense her presence from his godly perception. \"Can ya guys lend me a hand in getting bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be right with you, Rainbow! Let's just take care of a quick set of business first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining used a spell to shift Rainbow's existence onto his back, then that of him and Cadance so that they were at the widest pocket of space in the universe with absolutely no effort, allowing him and his wife to work. The two of them lit their horns and let the both of them touch, sending out a stream of magic that swirled around their bodies like a ribbon, allowing them to focus their concentration on the shapes of their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mental chant, their blobby forms began to change. The pancake-like folds covering their sides and pouring around their bellies began to recede until they were completely smoothed out, whereas the lumpy piles of butter forming their limbs began to round out like smooth blimps that tapered off the curvature of their forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir cheeks also began to shrink while their chins were sucked back into their necks, leaving them with a hearty fullness in their faces as they peeked over a smooth scarf-like hill that formed a nicely plump double chin on both of them. Once they were finished, the majority of their weights was gathered in their stomachs, while their legs were overstuffed into doughy globs akin to the biggest hamlegs in the world, but only fattened enough that they could still waggle them in the air. However, their flanks formed two heavy, bulging entities that faintly formed the highest point of their width, while their back hooves were but tiny little tips on the funnels of their gargantuan hindlegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think?\" Shining flexed his forelegs and used his magic to send weight into his biceps, swelling them several times their size, which made Cadance giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're a <i>very</i> sexy stallion.\" She flirted, also using the spell to shift some of her weight so her flanks jutted further out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining had a goofy smile on his face as his wife floated towards him with fluttering eyelashes, too engrossed by her shape that he was caught off guard as she wrapped her legs around his neck and kissed him on the lips. His eyes widened by surprised, but slowly lidded as he returned her embrace, allowing his lips to in turn explore hers in blissful passion. Cadance broke away so she could worm her head under Shining's chin and nuzzle his porky neck, while Shining sighed contentedly and let his chin scratch along her mane, the feeling of their bodies expanding against each other delivering a rush he'd never felt in their marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Uh, guys? Forgetting something?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two broke apart, laughing off the experience before Shining shifted Rainbow into the crevice between he and Cadance's bodies, the two of them zapping her with their spells. They could see a (relatively) small blue blob forming between them that began to push the two of them apart until neither could see the other, separated by Rainbow, who was three heads taller than the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me give you a hand!\" Cadance offered as she conjured the spell that she and Shining just performed, but with Rainbow. Her overwhelmingly large cheeks and chins sunk back into her belly as though she'd swallowed them. Her entire body smoothed out as Cadance and Shining's had as well, bringing back some of the athletic pony Rainbow appeared to be, even as round as she still was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...thanks!\" Rainbow smiled as she rubbed what little of her belly her forelegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Shining actually blushed as she looked up at Rainbow's face. Her cheeks were far chubbier than his or Cadance's, with her mane wrapping around their round shape and dangling atop her shoulders. He couldn't help but deny that thanks to the feeling of them growing on top of one another, he'd taken a real liking to Rainbow, and seeing her in her smoothed-out form, he thought she looked absolutely <i>gorgeous.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow herself was taken aback by Shining as she laid eyes on his maintained appearance, for the first time in her tomboyish lifestyle able to admit she was attracted to a male. The two sat still, unmoving while suspended in space as they seemed to mentally communicate with one another, although they could barely think much outside of how they admired one another. Slowly, Shining floated up to Rainbow's face so he could get a closer look, while Rainbow gently held onto him so he could stay still. The two kept a fascinated gaze into one another's eyes for a length of time unknown to either of them, but at a crawl's pace Shining was leaning in closer, without Rainbow to push him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when the two were nose to nose, Shining hesitated in a moment of thought before he let his lips press against Rainbow's. The two were only in physical contact for a few seconds before Rainbow reached under his forelegs and hugged him against her, with Shining returning as their testing kiss erupted into a passionate embrace, with Rainbow blushing in absolute glee as she made her first kiss, with absolutely no shame or heed for time as she locked lips with one of her favorite ponies in the past time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadance watched, but while some would expect her to bite Rainbow's head off and shoot Shining out of a cannon into the furthest boundaries of the galaxy, she actually smiled. She felt the love both of them shared for one another that equated to that of he and herself, which equated to their expanding sizes compared to their former selves.</span></div></div>",

A mystical cloud forms in front of her, as she attempts to create the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just then, Spike walks in and accidentally bumps into Twilight, causing her balance to become misconstrued and she fires off a blast of energy towards Rainbow Dash.

I was practicing a spell that required a ton of concentration!\" Spike held his claws up in defense, \"H-hey! I'm sorry!

Both of them were more excited then they had ever been in their whole lives when Twilight began charging up the spell. When the magic was released, the effect happened very fast. Their city sized fat shot out in all directions expanding, and squishing against each other in the process. They both managed to completely fill the entire plain that had stretched for miles, the only thing now standing between them and more weight was trees surrounding them from all directions, but this didn't stop them. Twilight cast the spell one more time after resting, causing every last tree to be utterly smashed by fat. Rainbow Dash and Twilight had reached 250 sextillion lbs. each, and had no chance of gaining anymore than this since Twilight used up every last drop of magic she was born with.

Sitting at the table, Rainbow Dash nodded, licking her lips greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Pinkie.\" Dash reached out for the cupcakes, but grunted as she found shifting over too difficult. The reason why, of course, was that even when she was sitting up on the bench Pinkie had gotten her, Dash's big blue belly spread her legs apart and anchored her to the floor. When she had hooked up with Pinkie a month ago, she had originally thought it'd just be her typical casual relationship, a real friendship with benefits kind of deal. But then they hit it off so well, and Pinkie was so much fun to be around... they had spent more and more time together, and in that they had started eating together. Even Dash couldn't keep up with Pinkie's nearly magical metabolism, and she had started spending more time with Pinkie and less time advertising. Couple that with Pinkie's apparent kink with feeding other ponies, and things had begun to spiral. Yet Dash, in her own way couldn't be happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get that, silly. We don't want you straining your little tum-tums!\" Pinkie cooed, though there was nothing little about Dash's \"tum-tums\". It was, however, stuffed to the brim, so Dash happily leaned back. Pinkie got up on two hooves, standing beside Dash's belly and resting one hoof on it as the other fed Dash. Dash wasn't oblivious of her weight so much as she couldn't seem to find time to care. Whenever she had been about to exercise, Pinkie Pie had suddenly popped up with something more fun (but lower energy) to do. And when Dash complained, Pinkie would just start kissing her and telling her how wonderful she was. It was excellent for Dash's ego. So she had put on a little weight, big deal? If it was this easy to put on, it had to come off just as easily, right? She was sure that, any day now, she'd get back into shape. In the meantime she was enjoying life, fully indulging her lazy side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie fed Dash cupcake after cupcake, slowly stroking Dash's belly as it inflated with more food. The pegasus was in complete bliss, and Pinkie couldn't be happier either. She watched Dash chew, extra chins wobbling, with lust in her eyes. After a couple dozen cupcakes, she decided enough was enough. Too full, and Dash wouldn't be able to have fun with her later tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done, Dashie.\" Pinkie told Dash, nuzzling her bloated fillyfriend. Dash sighed and patter her belly. Then she tried to get up. She couldn't exactly throw herself up by her back legs like most ponies would, so instead she leaned around her big belly and got a front hoof down on the bench, which groaned despite the reinforcement Pinkie had recently added to it. From there she pivoted around her belly slowly, her mass of fat rolling on the floor. Upright, Dash's belly still touched the floor, requiring her to drag it along. Or at least it would, if Pinkie didn't have plans otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Dashie, you can't go back home all full! You'll get a cramp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Dash asked, slightly out of it from her sugar-binge and full belly. Pinkie giggled and planted a kiss on Dash's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Dashie. I got an extra big bed for the both of us! It's as comfy as any cloud.\" Pinkie replied, guiding her stuffed lover to the giant mattress she had set out. She had laid the mattress directly on the floor, as getting up on the bed proper would probably tax Dash far too much. There'd be plenty of time for Dashie's 'exercise' later.</span></div></div>",

Those poor little legs had gotten such a workout recently, dragging around a big belly that now reached out into the air. Pinkie knew that this was probably wrong, but she couldn't help herself. Dash just kept getting cuter and cuter the more she ate, and they were spending more and more time together. Pinkie was terrified of being alone, but now she had found a way to never be alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash was so used to eating by now she could literally do it in her sleep, believing she was dreaming. Pinkie had discovered this when Dash had actually fallen asleep halfway through a meal, and now used it to great advantage. She had gotten the feast ready, and now gingerly lifted up a slice of pie to Dash's mouth. Dash sniffed the air and opened her mouth automatically, allowing Pinkie to feed her. Pinkie fed her an entire pie slowly, and then shook up a can of whip cream, and with careful direction, sprayed it directly into Dash's mouth. The sleeping pony lapped it up greedily, her tongue going everywhere to get what landed on her lips or nose. Pinkie bit her lip - she so wanted to lick it off for her Dashie right now, but some things would wake her up. So instead she contented her to watching Dash's belly bloat, and bloat, and bloat, until it was nearly as big as an entire pony! Pinkie Pie carefully rubbed Dash's belly, feeling all its wonderful blubber. She'd get to play with it some more tomorrow as Dash ate breakfast in bed. For now, she simply pushed it a little and watched it jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie kept feeding Dash. Soft things were the easiest, so she went with cakes and fritters. Then she decided to try something knew. Carefully leaving the end of a long tube in Dash's mouth, Pinkie got off the bed, taking the other end of the tube and sticking a funnel over it. Then she took the first of several prepared milkshakes and poured it down the tube. Sure enough, she soon heard a sucking sound from the other end of the tube as Dash began to drink. But Dash's belly barely went up with just one milkshake! Pinkie would have to try more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second and third milkshake inflated her belly a little more, but after the fifth Pinkie realized what was happening. The milkshakes were filling all the nooks and crannies in between the food Dash had eaten. It was making her stomach heavier without making it bigger. But then Pinkie hit the sweet point with the sixth milkshake. Dash's belly was absolutely packed. Dash continued to gulp down the milkshake, but her belly was beginning to take on a nearly-perfect spherical shape, pushed ever closer to the breaking point. At this rate, Dash was going to wind up fatter than ever! But perhaps Pinkie was overdoing it...</span></div></div>",

Despite these reservations, she kept going. A platter of three dozen snickerdoodles was emptied into Rainbow's eager, but unknowing maw. She chewed wildly and licked her chops afterwards. To wash it down, Pinkie gave her a half gallon of whole milk which Dash sucked down like mare's milk. The temptation to snuggle, play with, and fondle Dash's belly was becoming unbearable. It had doubled in size since Pinkie began her feeding session not an hour earlier. She decided to exhaust her food supply and then call it a night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of an hour, Dash unconsciously  gobbled down an entire catering party's worth of yummy desserts. She took a second to admire her work. What was once a distinguishable neck was now 10 or so chins, the spaces in between filled with pastry crumbs. Those chins transitioned seamlessly into the biggest tummy in Ponyville. \"Done and done\" whispered Pinkie as Rainbow munched the last bit of raisin scone. Dash stirred upon hearing this. \"<i>Of all the things to wake her up it's my whispering?!</i>\" Pinkie thought incredulously. Rainbow murmured something unintelligible and promptly fell back asleep. Then she rolled over onto her side, squishing Pinkie under her giant gut. Any other pony would be disgusted at the very thought of being trapped under a huge tummy while they try to sleep. Pinkie, however, relished the state. \"My chunky little Dashie...\" she cooed while softly nuzzling a roll of fat. Pinkie drifted into slumber, her filly friend serving as her over-sized comforter.</span></div></div>",

Her stomach was heavier than she remembered it last night, but she was use to that by now. Pinkie had explained once about shifting food and morning tiredness... honestly, Dash didn't really care that much. Pinkie would take care of her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning cupcake.\" Pinkie said, kissing Dash on the lips. Dash hadn't even opened her eyes yet, and she was getting pampered. She had definitely gotten used to this, but still, yeah, she could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for breakfast, Dashie?\" Pinkie asked. Dash finally opened her eyes, seeing Pinkie in an apron and chef's hat. She had some dough on her cheek. Dash moved forward to lick it off, but her gigantic belly got in the way. Pinkie giggled and leaned in, letting Dash lick her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving, I hope you made plenty!\" Dash told her. Pinkie couldn't have a wider smile hearing that. Dash grinned in return. This was such a sweet deal. She got it all, and it seemed like the more she relaxed and asked Pinkie for things, the happier Pinkie got. It had definitely gone to her head, and she could be quite demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it already?\" Dash asked, unsure why she was woken up before food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute Dashie~!\" Pinkie replied. She got up on the side of the bed and began to push against Dash's fat, blubbery stomach. Her food mostly digested (though her belly never got totally empty these days) Dash's tummy was soft and gave way. Unusual for ponies, and a sign of just how obese she was, Dash had rolls, her belly like a giant pile of dough wrapped up in a blue balloon. Thank goodness earth ponies were so strong (with some members known to pull houses...) that Pinkie easily rolled Dash onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go Dashie~\" Pinkie put a plate of eclairs to Dash's side, going to rub her belly as she usually did. Dash grunted as she moved one tubby foreleg. She had so much fat creasing around her shoulder and hanging from her foreleg that the idea of moving her hoof back and forth to her mouth was really unappealing. The athlete part of Dash died a little more when she made that decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Pinks... could you help me here?\" She asked. Pinkie peered up from behind the dome of blubber blocking most of Dash's blue. She saw her obese fillyfriend, head sunk into nearly a dozen chins, give an annoyed glance at the plate of eclairs. Pinkie's eyes lit up like christmas lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my little cupcake~\" Pinkie said. She grabbed the plate, and then clambered on top of Dash's belly. Dash grunted. Feeling Pinkie Pie's body splayed over her soft, sensitive flesh... Pinkie shoving eclairs into her mouth... Dash was in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, out of sight for Dash, Pinkie had brought up a feast's worth of foods. Breakfast foods, but a lot of sugary and fattening baked goods, Pinkie's recipes designed for maximum fattening. She brought enough over so that she didn't have to keep running back and forth, and lay over Dash, rubbing her body on Dash's belly as she fed her. Dash lay there, inflated legs hanging uselessly in the air, eyes closed and mouth open as Pinkie pampered her into ecstasy. Pinkie cooed to her as she fed the pegasus, talking about how beautiful she was, what a good fillyfriend she is, and how she could leave everything to good ol' Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie meanwhile was having such a rush. Her position meant she got to feel Dash fill up, her belly containing a massive, balloon-like stomach that could digest entire feasts with ease. She thought she smelled her own scent halfway through the meal, only to realize that Dash's bliss had crossed over into sexual pleasure. Then that got Pinkie really wet. Her fillyfriend was transforming into the perfect plump pet, someone learning to love her kink as much as Pinkie did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Pinkie ran out of food. She could tell Dash wasn't full yet - well, she wasn't \"full\" in that she could physically force down another bite if asked - but it would half to do. Dash's eyes opened, half-lidded. She was either sleepy, or... </span></div></div>",

Since then, Rainbow Dash continued to grow larger, having grown accustomed to the eating habits she had picked up. Now the Pegasus pony had grown to nearly the size of Ponyville, fortunately as pegasus pony, the town was saved from being buried under quadrillion ponds of pony fat by leaving Rainbow Dash on the top of a big enough cloud to hold her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRainbow Dash!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning her head down as best she could, displaying a full set of chins too numerous to count, Rainbow Dash saw Twilight Sparkle on the ground, looking up at her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Twi,\u201d Rainbow Dash said, \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilght gave Rainbow Dash a small smile and replied,</span></div></div>",

She was a simple turquoise Earth pony with a flat fuchsia mane with bangs. There was nothing at all out of the ordinary about this pony except for one thing: she was <i>fat</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing quite an active community, portly ponies, such as Mrs. Cake, were very rare in Ponyville and obese ponies, such as this one, were almost unheard of. For an inappropriate amount of time Pinkie soaked in the image of the giant mass of filly. She started at her big puffy cheeks, worked on down towards her half dozen chins, then to her wobbly stomach, and finally to her thick, trunk like legs and her flank which had on it a severely stretched Cutie Mark. All of the this, for some inexplicable reason, made Pinkie very excited. \"Wow!\" she shouted, showing her usual lack of filter \"You're really fat!\" \"Ummmmm, OK th-\" Pinkie cut her off and continued \"I mean, like, not just chunky like Mrs. Cake, but super duper jiggly, and soft, and oh my goodness can I hug you?!?!\" Pinkie was hyperventilating now and the fat mare was visibly uncomfortable. \"I'm sorry, I've got, uh, an appointment\" she responded as she waddled out of the store as quickly as her big body could take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie stood there, overwhelmed and feeling on the verge of something big. She knew now her life's calling: to gain weight. She didn't know why or anything beyond the fact that she knew it would be fun for her.

Have a super day!\" Pinkie chanted as she counted the customers payment. With her due paid, the customer went off on her way. With a smile, Pinkie went about performing the other common tasks associated with her job. Sugarcube Corner had to be her favorite place in the whole world, as the owners acted as adoptive family towards her, and her enjoyment of sweets and bringing joy to other ponies made this the perfect job for her. She went about the bakery, performing her job with an enormous amount of energy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...yet her usually energetic movements were hampered by her engorged girth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owners, Cup and Carrot cake, watched Pinkie work with looks of concern. Lately, Pinkie had been carrying a lot of weight on her body within the recent few months. Although vaguely pudgy when they normally knew her, Pinkie must have gained about three hundred pounds as of late. A large area of the ground beneath her was generously occupied by her massive stomach, sticking out almost a foot from each side. Her forelegs had fattened up to eleven inches at each thigh, tapering to eight at the calves that bunched up into her hooves (forced a foot apart by belly fat that stuck through by six inches). Widening at a few inches over three feet, her flank had marked her widest point. Her body had also lengthened a foot, and gained altitude of about one inch higher than her thinner self (now 4'3\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving each other a nervous glance, The Cakes seemed to somehow elect Carrot to talk to her. He trotted into the kitchen, where Pinkie was bringing a cake out of the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mr. Cake!\" Pinkie said through fattened cheeks. \"Do you need me for anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Pinkie, I was hoping to talk to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie Dokie! Just let me finish this cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, dear. I'll be in the bakery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes, Pinkie returned from the kitchen with a small vanilla cake, placing it on the counter before approaching Mr. Cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Mr. Cake, what do you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie...would you like to take some time off of work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie let out a horrified gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm so sorry. Mr. Cake! I only meant to taste-test that order of d-doughnuts, but they were just so good, and...I just couldn't help myself! I swear I worked really hard to replace them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry! I promise I won't let it happen again, just give me another chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Pinkie, I'm not firing you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I...really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! You haven't done a single thing wrong since you've worked here. It's just that...well, you haven't spent any vacation time at all since you've worked here, and we just though you might like a few days off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Oh! Well, thank you Mr. Cake! But I'm not really interested in having days off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Cake glanced nervously at his wife, who peeked through the door to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie...I really don't want you to rub this the wrong way, but Mrs. Cake and I are getting a bit worried about you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...We've noticed that you've...been getting...um...we're concerned that eating the foods in the bakery are catching up to you, Pinkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Mr. Cake! I eat lots of super healthy food when I'm not working here, and I get a lot o-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie, please forgive me for being blunt...but have you noticed that lately, you've been putting on weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat confused, the at least three foot wide earth pony looked down at her stomach, gently poking it with her hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I guess I am getting a little pudgy. But I can work it off really quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie, please listen...\" Mrs Cake pleaded as she joined the conversation. \"This isn't just some winter break gain, you're...I'm sorry, but you've gained a couple hundred pounds recently!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie took a few more moments to examine herself. She rarely did, occupied by her upbeat energy and selfless nature, and what she was now realizing did come as quite a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but I never really noticed something happen to me like this before! I don't eat THAT many sweets from the bakery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then in that case, do you think you should see a doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm sick or anything...I can always tell when I'm sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because you don't feel sick doesn't mean nothing's happening to you, Pinkie. If we visit the doctor tomorrow, we'll be able to know for sure whether or not this is anything serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie looked slightly downtrodden. She never enjoyed going to the doctor. However, she feared being sick even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you guys come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we will, Pinkie. What reason have we not to?\" Mrs. Cake replied warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile returned to Pinkie's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mr. and Mrs. Cake! It really means a lot that...\" Pinkie stopped talking as a surprised look crossed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I just feel funny...\" A feeling emanated from Pinkie's stomach that seemed to hybrid nausea with the sensation of falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, much to the shock of the three earth ponies, Pinkie began to inflate with fat. As she became fatter, she gained more altitude, making her six inches taller. Her stomach stood 15 inches from her sides between each leg, her forehooves now forced a foot and a half apart. Her flank and legs fattened noticeably, extending her length a few inches more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cakes gaped at the confused pink blob, baffled at her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-On second thought...\" Mr Cake stammered. \"We might want to go now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She forced the fat upon herself for thirty more seconds, before she finally ran out of breath and quit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she maintained her air supply, she began to realize how huge she now was. She now stood at eleven feet tall, her forelegs forced almost seven feet apart by fat seeping through by four feet. Each leg was fattened to four feet at each thigh.

Then Pinkie stopped after about a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty awesome, right?\" Pinkie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash just drop her mouth as she stared at the massive Pinkie in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie then went from eleven feet tall to thirty feet tall. She was now over fourty feet long and with a beyond big flank with a beyond stretched out cutie mark. She was now the size of a house. Her hooves were no longer on the ground and her face's cheeks were three times the size of a head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that she got so big in a short time is just uncanny. To top it of, she can get even bigger anytime she wants. Rainbow started thinking.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After giving it a few more pokes, she gave a gentle punch at the fat, which ricocheted back with surprising force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Dashie?\" Pinkie asked as she noticed her friend on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I'm fine...\" Rainbow said as she got back up.

Should we get other ponies to see this??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if all goes right, we won't need to...\" She insisted courageously as she trotted up to the massive pine tree Pinkie was laid next to. After a few minutes of climbing, she was perched atop a branch directly above the pink blob below. She gave one final deep breath as she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, and...\" Rainbow folded her wings back and jumped, sinking downwards and plummeting toward s the ground. She squinted at the wind stinging at her eyes, watching as Pinkie grew closer and closer. She clenching her eyes shut just as she impacted Pinkie's body, which was only a second before she was ricocheted upwards with tenfold speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO RAINBOW, GO!\" Pinkie cheered at the shrinking blue dot in the sky. Rainbow thrashed around as she tumbled upwards, forcing herself to maintain a vertical position. Once aligned, she shot her wings outward and flapped with all her might, fighting the atmosphere as it tried to reject her efforts. Ten seemingly eternal seconds of intense flying had passed as she fought the atmospheric cone with all her might, which at last started to give way as Rainbow was propelled forward in a deafening explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"KA-<i>BLAM!!!</i>\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's eyes widened as the blue speck exploded into several massive shockwaves of color, which shook the ground beneath her and jiggled her flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooohhhh!\" She awed in amazement as the color dissipated into sparkling bits of color. Ponies for miles had heard the explosion and looked up in awe as the sky was filled with shining colors. Rainbow looked behind her and gawked in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DID IT! <i>IT'S EVEN BETTER!!</i>!\" she laughed to herself, beaming with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the final waves of color gave way, the exhausted pegasus finally descended towards ground. She plopped back and panted heavily on Pinkie's stomach, who cheered her friend on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAY!!! YOU DID IT, RAINBOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...*pant*...I did...*huff*\" She'd managed to chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This calls for a celebration! I'll go to Sugarcube Corner and make the biggest cake I've ever made!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...*huff*...Pinkie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, Pinkie slowly wormed herself around so that she could walk.</span></div></div>",

I'll be fine.\" Pinkie said. \"Here I go again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie once again holded her breath to inflate herself even more. As she did that, she was beginning to cover the clearing. Rainbow Dash had to fly up in the air. Pinkie expanded more and more. She started to grow so tall, the ponies in Ponyville started to see a big pink blob. This included, Twilight, Rarity, Fluttershy, Applejack, and Mr. and Mrs. Cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in tarnation is that?\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n\"Oh my.

But, even doing so, she grew to a ginomous 70 feet. Various chins,hooves lost in her fat, massive cheeks, a flank the size of a house and a belly the size of a small town were just the main new things with Pinkie's new gain.

How something off by a few inches can unravel the greatest and most elaborate of plans, years of strategy being dissolved like salt in water. Destiny itself could be completely torn apart, in favor of the long taboo concept of chaos and entropy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was supposed to be Twilight. She was the last piece in the puzzle that would unlock thousands more, each in turn to be plotted out and completed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Pinkie not been a few inches closer to the center of the room, t would have all been perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia was obviously horrified to have seen Pinkie appear instead of Twilight, thousands of years of planning hurting into flames right in front of her. But nonetheless, Celestia was forced to watch the magic flow around Pinkie. and show her friends the new wings and horn she'd gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany ponies though Pinkie to be an abstract choice for a ruler, but for Celestia, to bring her onto the castle balcony and have her be declared the new princess of Equestria was an absolute nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, although initially nervous to her new role, Pinkie took her position with stride. With her newfound powers, Pinkie boasted a surprising prowess with magic. She also boasted a kind demeanor and surprising intelligence for her subjects, who grew to be very fond of their new ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Twilight's amazement, Pinkie's magic brought many new spells to the magic library, the most famous one being the food conjuring spell. World hunger came to a halt at the ability to conjure food at any time, which the world relished in. Ponies everywhere indulged themselves in massive feasts conjured at the wave of a horn, and as a result the average pony became significantly fatter. Pinkie blimped up even faster given her gluttonous nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite their engorged girths, many welcomed their new piggish ruler, always running the country with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same couldn't be said for Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2026..</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie awoke in the darkness, but the reassuring scent of vanilla and feeling of card board around her blobby cheeks reassured her into happily slurping away what was left of the ice cream inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the tub was licked clean, Pinkie lifted the empty ice cream tub away, allowing her blobby face to freely droop. She giggled as she looked down at her gargantuan stomach, which was a soft mountain of pink that stood up nine feet from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for another busy day!\" She cheerfully exclaimed as she heaved herself to the side and rolled out of bed. On all fours, Pinkie stood proudly at ten feet tall, her carriage-wide legs still (miraculously) touching the ground. Her belly was a massive dough-like blob sicking out over five feet from each side, tapering into her gigantic flanks with cutie marks larger than a grown stallion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite her grotesque size, Pinkie trudged through the doors with a massive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2026..</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was all cleaned up, Pinkie's wide coat bore a faint sheen, and her long mane had somewhat an ethereal translucence given her alicorn genes. For somepony so huge, she was quite a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo obese guards stood at the doors to the throne room of Pinkie's Palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, your highness.\" One staunchly greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, Mr. Aces! How are you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, your highness.\" He answered more leniently. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing great! Thank you!\" She chirped as she hauled her enormous bulk through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe throne was huge given its owner's weight. Once Pinkie had seated herself, she used her magic to levitate a tiara from a nearby perch onto her head, and rested her legs on her spherical stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Day court is now beginning!\" She announced.

First few days after Pinkie was chosen as new Princess, that inherited the country from Celestia, Twi was extremely depressed. Deep inside she knew that she was meant for something really big and important, and what could be more important than being a Princess? And suddenly all was done. But after seeing how hard Pinkie worked and how seriously she took her new responsibility the thought that all of it wasn't just an accident visited Twilight more often.<br>\r\n\"So Pinkie, how are you doing being one and only Princess?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh Twilight, it's so exhausting. Ruling the country, solving problems of my subjects, making new spells and trying not to miss lunch is super-duper hard. But I try not to fail. At least I can assure you, that there was not a single day when I missed lunch, ha-ha! You can probably see it by my belly. Wanna touch it?\"<br>\r\nThe question was very unexpected but at the same time very alluring for purple pony. She still couldn't stop to stare on this big pink sphere of fat. Twilight gulped and spoke quietly:<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't deny that I have such desire\".<br>\r\n\"Then do it, silly!\"<br>\r\nCarefully Twilight placed her hoof on Pinkie's belly and gently pressed it. It was so soft and warm, that she started to rub it. She looked up and saw that her friend-Princess was in absolute delight. Young unicorn had to confess to herself, that she enjoyed it as much as Pinkie. When after a few minutes a purple mare stopped, Twilight felt how she was lifted by magic and placed on that big pink belly, right before the beaming Princesse's face.<br>\r\n\"Oh Twilight, that was so good. I really enjoyed it and I thank you for that. By the way, I see that you too enjoyed my latest spell, didn't you?\"<br>\r\nTwilight's face turned red immediately. She also noticed, that she had her magical snacks more often with each day. She felt, how she became more pudgier day by day, but she just couldn't help it! The food that was conjured by Pinkie's spell was so much tastier than normal! Who in Equestria would resist from such delicious food?<br>\r\n\"Yes, my Princess, I had put on a little weight. I loose it very quick if you want\".<br>\r\n\"Oh silly filly, you don't need to call me Princess! And of course you shouldn't loose it. In fact...\"</span></div></div>",

Applejack was currently bucking apples at her family's Sweet Apple Acres, giving fierce kicks to the Apple trees that had been planted there by her Granny years ago. \"Phew! Well..that's the last of them apples, now 'ah can finally get back to Big Mac--Sis!\" Applejack was then interrupted by her younger sister and her friends. She then turned her head to see the fillies running up to her with their wagon with a bunch of pastries in them. \"Well if it ain't the Cutie Mark Crusaders, what y'all be doing with all that delicious looking food, got errands from Pinkie Pie?\" Applejack asked to the three fillies. \"Oh no, we made them ourselves.\" Sweetie Belle answered, with a feeling of pride coming from her tone of voice. \"Yeah! we figured if we worked together at baking we could get our cutie marks!\" Scootaloo cheered, flapping her wings in excitement. \"So I thought to  have you taste 'em, ya always did have good sense uh taste.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack put her hoof to her chin in remark Applebloom's statement \"Yeah, you're right 'bout that, but why didn't ya ask Pinkie Pie? She loves eating stuff like this.\" the mare said pointing to a cupcake and pie. Applebloom face changed to that of nervousness. \"Well...we were but...she's got an odd taste in food...\" she said feeling a hint of guilt. Applejack looked to her side, also feeling guilt. \"Well alright, then!\" Quickly saying to alleviate the slight awkwardness. \"Gimme one of those...apple fritters? Applebloom! you didn't make these treat from the stash of apples ah got for the market tomorrow did you?\" Applejack said with a bit of anger and suspicion. \"N-no ah took all the apples we used from those trees o'er there.\" the yellow pony retorted, pointing her hoof to a group of trees off the left side of the barn in front of them. What she said was only half-true, as they had taken a good amount of apples from both places. Applejack eyed down her younger sister, still suspicious of her. \"Yeah, we only took the apples from over there Applejack, honest.\" Scootaloo said crossing hr chest with her left hoof. \"Hmm...\" Applejack grunted taking her sister and friends word as truth now. \"Well alright, gimme one then!\" \"Sure!\" Sweetie Belle cheered, throwing an Apple Fritter straight into Applejack's mouth. Chewing for a few seconds letting the taste flow over her tongue and mouth, she slowly lit up with absolute ecstasy from the sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow!  Hmm mmh <i>that</i> is the best fritter ah've ever tasted! Give me some more food girls!\" Applejack shouted as she licked her lips to get any crumbs on her face. \"*gasp*! YAY!\" the CMC cheered simultaneously, at that moment they all looked at their flanks to find a cutie mark but, alas they were still blank. \"Ah-ah don't get it...\" Applebloom said in despair, \"Why don't we have our cutie marks? You love our food and we did 'em all right...\" she said looking down at the ground dejected and saddened. \"*munch* *gulp* Do-don't worry y'all three just need to keep at it, and I'm sure your cutie marks will appear.\" Applejack said in between her devouring of an Apple Pie from the top of the pile on the wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya sure sis?\" \"Yeah are you sure?\" Applebloom and Scootaloo said in response, with Scootaloo being a bit more demanding in her tone. \"Uh huh, just keep making this food, and everypony will love 'em! Now, y'all three mind if ah uhh help taste your goods some more?\" Applejack said nearly drooling at this point. \"Yeah! We got tons more in the kitchen!\" Sweetie Belle said, making a small hop in excitement, waving her hooves in the air. \"Great, just lead me to them!\" Applejack demanded as the fillies ran off to the Apple family's abode. The four ponies trotted along to the home, with Applejack going at the treats nopony's business, once they had made their way into the kitchen Applejack marveled at the sight of the mound of food and was delightfully surprised at how much the fillies had crafted. \"Wooow! ah can't believe y'all made so much!\" Applejack said nearly about to go in a trance, her hunger rising to levels it had never been to before. Applejack then nearly jumped into the pile, which was on the floor due to the girls going overboard and making too much to properly set on the tables.</span></div></div>",

Even after a hard day's work A had never eaten so much, it stumped the filly as to why this sudden change in Applejack's nature had occurred, were they really that good? She pondered on this as Applejack continued her gluttonous behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*half an hour later* \"UUUURRRRPPPP!!! Phew, that sure was a mighty fine fill girls.\" Applejack lightly rubbed her swollen gut, well part of it anyway now that it was nearly twice her size. Seeing that the entire horde of food they had made was now digesting in Applejack's stomach, Sweetie Belle poked her hoof into the taut skin of the nearly spherical abdomen. \"Wow, I didn't even know ponies could hold so much, I think we did better than expected.\" \"Yeah! those spices we bought from that old pony really did the trick!\" Scootaloo cheered pumping one of her hooves into the air. \"Yeah, but... ah' wonder what he meant by \"you'll be wanting to come back for more?\" \" Aw he must be some old cook with tons of old cooking secrets or something...\" Scootaloo replied not really fazed by what the old stallion said. \"Yeah, now come on girls we gotta make more!\" Sweetie Belle said as the three ran off to get more ingredients. Applejack was now alone, able to take in her fullness in peace. \"uurrrpp...ooookaaay ehh\" Applejack groaned as she stumbled to get herself up. \"Got...to....get...back... haaah to work! ahhh!\" the pony exasperated, falling to the floor after only taking 20 steps. Oh come on AJ,, you can do this hrmmph!\" Picking herself up once more she slowly made it out of the Apple family home. \"Haah...haah...alright, now just gotta...buck the rest of these trees and store the apples for tomorrow's sellin'...\" the farm pony realized just how difficult this would be as the mere action of <i>walking</i> was incredibly arduous for her. \"*gulp* Well....we ain't gonna get any bits if these apples are still on the trees.\" Applejack trotted up to the pasture, her now softer belly dragging just slightly on the ground. Bringing her body up to one of the trees she turned around and gave a hard kick...well at least she tried to. The only thing she managed to do was knock about 7 apples, looking up she saw she had about 13 more to go. Already starting to sweat Applejack groaned knowing just how looong this was going to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*5 hours later* \"Huff...pant...uggh...d-done.\" Applejack immediately fell down, covered in sweat, and nearly all of the energy in her previously was gone. Looking at the buckets she carried her apples in, she saw even with all her efforts only 5 were full the other 3 were only about a third full. \"Well..\" she said taking a bite out of one the apples, \" it may not be mah normal amount, but, I guess it'll do, I hope Big Mac and Granny won't be too displeased with what ah got.\" Taking another apple from one of the buckets, the earth pony yawned as she dragged herself in for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Applejack was on her way to the market, now that her yesterday eating had finally been fully digested a light layer of fat rimmed her body, making a small jiggle with each step. \"Well... that was a lucky break.\" Applejack sighed to herself as she remembered earlier how Big Macintosh questioned her on the surprisingly small amount of apples she had gotten for selling. <i>\"Erm AJ?\" the large male pony asked as his sister sheepishly walked up to him, having just woken up minutes ago. \"*yawn* What is it?\" \"Uh  why are these barrels so...lackin'?\" Tipping it down, the two ponies with Applejack becoming more ashamed by the second, looked down at the less than full stash of barrels \"Look, I'm sorry Big Mac, I--.\" Applejack was about to explain she had a late night snack unusual to self and due to being half-asleep ate from her apples stored for tomorrow, but Big Macintosh out a hoof up. \"Ya don't need ta explain yourself AJ, just make sure this doesn't happen again.\" Al-alright, thanks big brother\" Applejack said in relief, glad that her brother wasn't really irritated by the lack of apples. \"I'll see ya later, kay?\" \"Eeyup\" Big Macintosh replied with his \"catchphrase\".</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting her merchandise down, Applejack put up her sign declaring that she was open. \"Okay! Time to make up for my folly!\" Applejack said with determination. As time went on, Applejack realized she seemed to have struck gold  this day,  as her stash of apples were depleting faster than if Parasprites had eaten them.  \"Hoo boy! I can't believe how fast my apples are selling today, must be some sort of shortage around town. Seeing how many bits she had accumulated, Applejack saw it fit to take a bite from a few of left-over apples, gulping down  one whole apple in the process. \"Hey Applejack how's business going?\" Applejack then looked up to see Twilight and Spike with a small saddlebag fitted onto the pony. \"Oh, *gulp* hey Twi, Spike, it's going great! Ponies are buyin' apples like they're going extinct!\" \"Oh that's great!\" Twilight cheerfully said, clapping her hooves together in merriment. \"Say, whatch you here for anyway?\" Applejack said, propping her elbow on the edge of her cart. \"Oh we're here to get some food, Ol' Twilight here is becoming a glutton.\" Spike replied putting his hand over his mouth to non-discreetly hide his comment from the mare, chuckling in the process. Giving the baby dragon a might glare, Twilight quickly retorted. \"I told you Spike, I've been studying for days! I haven't had time to eat lately! \"Yeah sure, but that doesn't require you to eat out the fridge in the middle of the night and morning!\" Blushing in embarrassment the pony pushed the dragon away to avoid further humiliation. \"Well, we'll be seeing ya later AJ..hehe...\" <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Say did Applejack seem a little bigger than usual Twilight?</font>\" Spike said noticing the earth pony's increased girth. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Quiet Spike.\"</font> Twilight said in a quieter manner as the two walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling over the fact that the local librarian was seeming to get a sudden case of the munchies, Applejack went back to checking for any potential buyers, when out of the corner of her eye she saw a young colt with a brown coat and yellow mane slowly grasping a couple of apples in his maw. \"Hey give those back ya no-good thief!\" Upon being spotted, the colt sprinted into a full gallop away from the stand. Applejack then galloped off in a chase, making sure to quickly dump her bits into her saddlebags to make sure none of them got stolen while she was gone.  As she gave chase Applejack found herself getting tired quite quickly, starting to lose the thief in her chase. Just as she thought he was going to get away he darted into an alley and Applejack heard an audible smashing sound coming from it. Slowing down, surprised by what possibly could've happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrotting into the dark alley, she looked around for the pony. \"Hey kid, you alright?\" Suddenly then, Applejack saw standing over the colt who was now unconscious, in the unknown pony's hooves were her stolen apples. Looking at the pony she could see their enigmatic features beginning to be revealed to her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking upon the figure who apparently had stopped the would be thief from stealing her apples, Applejack could see the being was an old unicorn pony. His coat was of a grayish brown color, he held no mane but looking behind one could see a moderately long spiky white tail. Despite his age, Applejack could tell from his tail color, from it's hue was not entirely due to old age. The old stallion was rather tall, almost as much as her brother Big Macintosh, though not as muscular, he still had a slight build on him. On his body he wore full body black coat of some sorts with many pockets adorning it's length. His face had quite a few wrinkles, but he still looked very full of energy and life, which was most exuberantly shown in his gold eyes, brimming with strong confidence. As Applejack looked on at the pony, she gave him her thanks.<br>\r\n\"Whew..thank ya kindly stranger, that little varmit almost got away with some of mah valued apples.\" Applejack was still out of breath slightly, her belly heaving close to the ground with each exhale. \"It was my pleasure miss, little hooligans such as this one should be dealt with while they're young, lest they become something worse with age.\" The old unicorn replied, a grave, raspy voice coming from his maw, his lips contorted into a smirk as he eyed the unconscious colt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to look at the mare, the stallion asked her a question. \"Hmm, I do not wish to be prudent, but you seem to be in good shape, how is it you are out of breath? I doubt this little one could've given you too much trouble to follow...\" Looking to the side in an ashamed manner, Applejack had to accept she had made a dent in her physique as of late. Due to her gorging of all that food yesterday, the girl had in fact gained a little weight. It wasn't too much, 5 to 15 pounds at most, but enough to where still being unused to it, had slowed her down to the point a colt had nearly made off with a few of her profitable merchandise. Applejack took pride in her athletic abilities and it pained her knowing she was the cause of losing some of that. The mare winced, telling the honest truth. <br>\r\n\"Actually, heh...ah've gained a little weight and that boy would've gotten away if it hadn't been fer you sir.\" Rubbing the back of her head in embarrassment. Frowning slightly, the old pony gave his response. <br>\r\n\"That's too bad, but... as luck may have it, I have something on me that may do something for you...\" \"<br>\r\nWah? Really, you got something that can keep me fit?\" \"You could say that.\" the bald pony then telekinetically pulled a small plastic bottle out from one of his coat pockets. Inside it was full with a red powder. <br>\r\n\"This is here is a spice that will give you a huge increase in energy for a relative amount of time, and it makes a fine addition to any dish, my dear.\" He said giving it to mare. <br>\r\n\"Wow...what is this stuff?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I cannot give you that information...I normally wouldn't tell anypony this but you seem honest and trustworthy, I'm an old...\"spice maker\" from some years ago, ago and I've recently gone back into the business to help aspiring young cooks reach their potentials... I'd tell you more my fair miss, but I'd like to keep myself away from the public, they can be rather irritating to ponies of fame.\" Applejack smirked at hearing this. \"Aw shucks you can trust me, I won't tell anypony about ya, you can bet on that.\" \"Haha that I can see quite well...still one cannot be too careful when dealing with secret knowledge.\" \"Well whatever you say sir, now about this spice, do I just take a hoofful and eat it?\" the old unicorn eye's gleamed with interest in the manners of this mare. \"Yes, just dabble a bit onto your tongue and swallow, you should feel eager to continue your work and all the weight in the world on you won't make a difference to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shoot, that's mighty handy...<i>all the weight in the world</i>\" Applejack looked down at her slightly larger stomach with relief, glad that this weight of hers wasn't about to become a problem. <br>\r\n\"Well, I best be going now, you probably have to get back to selling your wares miss. I'll be taking this one here to be dealt with.\" The old pony then picked up the still unconscious colt and plopped the kid onto his back. \"Well alright, heh here's an apple free of charge for being so kind to me mister.\" Applejack then took one of the juicy red fruits out of her saddlebag and tossed it to the pony.  Applejack began walking back, but turned around to say one more thing to the old stallion. \"Hey! Ah almost forgot, the name's Applejack and when can ah see ya again?!\"  \"the old pony smirked upon hearing her. \"Heh don't worry, I'm sure we'll see each other again soon!\" Watching the unicorn slowly walk into further into the alleyways, Applejack turned back and made her way to her stand to resume selling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright boy, time to get off...\" the old stallion demanded to the colt on his back. The colt immediately opened his eyes, and slid off onto the ground.  \"Ha, how'd I do boss?\"the young colt asked gleefully to his older peer. \"You did a fine job, I think we've found a nice, good mare for our services... Applejack huh? Hehe, who'd have thought my first client in years would be one of the 6 heroines?\" the old unicorn then took a large bit out of the apple he had been given earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning to her stand, Applejack was relieved that none of her apples had been stolen by any other pony, despite her spending a good few minutes away from it. After about an hour or so of marketing and chatting with other sellers, one of which was a fairly new pear farmer who had just begun making her place in Ponyville's market, Applejack found herself getting rather winded, perhaps due to the heat or just feeling tired from standing all day. Remembering what that old stallion said, she took the bottle out of her bag, took off the cap with her teeth and dropped a few teaspoons of the spice onto her tongue and let it fall down her throat. Almost immediately, Applejack felt a powerful pang in her, much like the in the food she ate yesterday, albeit much stronger. \"Phew! Well I'll be! this stuff sure packs a punch, I feel rarin' to go!\" Applejack kicked her front hooves in the air. Finding new reserves of energy to use into goading ponies to buy her apples, Applejack sold a good 30 apples in just a short 12 minutes, at the moment she was something close to Pinkie Pie in terms of energy output. However, 3 minutes later an oddly strong feeling of hunger enveloped the mare's stomach, her belly growling for nourishment. \"Ohh...shoot ah need something to eat.\" she said rubbing her growling gut. Knowing she didn't want to use her bits for her own services, especially when she had plenty to eat at home, Applejack decided against buying something from the market, but....she was sooo hungry.\" Seeing how she had she made quite a good amount of bits selling apples and apple treats this afternoon, Applejack saw nothing wrong with taking a bite out of a few of her pieces of food, after all...even if she ate some of them, she had enough to sell to make up for whatever she ate. Taking a bite out of a juicy apple fritter, Applejack moaned as she let the succulent taste of the deep-fried pastry slide down her gullet. Being reminded of days in her youth when she would come home from playing with her friends, and come to get a big plate of her granny's famous Apple fritter recipe. Loving the taste so much, Applejack had another... and another and then she just moved onto to her other treats when all the fritters were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBBUUURRRRPPPP!!!\" Applejack loudly belched as she groggily brought her head up from the wooden stand, having rested it as she ate just prior. \"Oooh...sheesh gotta give it to that old unicorn, Ah think ah just gained an extra 20 pounds, ah still don't feel heavy but,...ah guess it doesn't help with full stomachs...how much did ah eat?\" Peering into the boxes of her stand she winced as she saw just how much she had truly eaten. Looking into them, the pony could see that there was only a hoofful of treats left, nowhere near accountable to how many bits she had made, something she'd have to explain once she got back home. \"Oh nelly, Granny Smith and Big Mac are gonna have a fit over this...\" Applejack bit her lip as she worried for her fate back at the farm. Then she got an idea, if she could get a hold of some more bits, she could make it seem like all the stuff had been bought. Still feeling the effects of the spice, Applejack decided one way or another she'd have to find some bits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well...I ain't gonna go home with this amount of bits to Granny.\" Applejack said to herself, with hint of guilt in her tone. Trotting about the market, Applejack scanned the area for any easy steals. Unfortunately, a lot of the ponies seemed to be using a chests with locks and keys for their sale income, which would be, to put it mildly, rather difficult to steal. \"Oohh come on, there's gotta somepony not being savvy today.\" Looking around a bit more, the mare stumbled upon a mare inside a tent selling tomatoes, looking just a bit older than herself, and more importantly... a huge sack of bits standing just behind the pony and her counter. \"Alright...here I go...\" Applejack sneaked up to the stash of golden coins, making sure nopony, especially the tomato seller, noticed her. \"It'll just be a few, she won't even notice.\" Applejack muttered to herself as she reached her jaws outward to the pile of bits. Taking a mouthful of bits, eying the mare a few feet from her, who by an extreme amount of luck on her side, was not garnering any potential buyers for her fruit. Bit after bit was put into Applejack's satchels. ( I don't believe it, she's just standing there! She'll never make business if she's isn't wary of stunts like this...I better take more to teach her a lesson...) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack then continued her thievery of the seller's hardworked money, going from \"just a few\" to \"more then necessary\". Putting in five more bits into her bag, Applejack looked back into the bag, noticing...it was empty. (Wow, I worked pretty fast in 5 minutes...Alright now to move back slowly...) Applejack thought as she crept out from behind the tent, slipping out with over 80 bits. \"Hehe...this is more then enough to satisfy Granny and Big Macintosh.\" As she walked back to her own stand, however something popped up in front of her. \"Applejack! What do you think yer doing?!\" What stood in front of the mare was a small, robe wearing, winged version of herself, her front hooves crossed, adorned with a small halo over her hat. \"What do you mean what I'm doing, and who are you?\" Applejack questioned to the floating angel pony. \"Who do you think ah' am, I'm your good conscience ! Y'know the thing that stops ya from doing bad stuff, what made you the element of honesty! What do you think yer doing, AJ, stealing hard earned bits from another pony, you know how hard it is to make your own pay every now and then, why would you steal from another seller?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey lay off will ya, you stupid feather brain!\" Suddenly, a red clothed, horned version of Applejack appeared in a puff of smoke, holding a pitchfork in her hooves. \"If Applejack wants to steal some money, let her, it's that mare's fault for not being careful, besides she's got things to pay for at home, and she needs to get money anyway possible.\" The two sides of Applejack's conscience trotted towards each other, with visible hatred leering from their eyes. \"You think Sweet ol Granny and big brother will like the fact that one of their kin STOLE a pony's entire stash of bits, because she herself ate her own wares?!\"  <br>\r\n\"You think they'll enjoy not having MONEY?! I don't know about ya sister, but I ain't going back with our crappy 20 bits!\" Deviljack then shoved her pitchfork into Angeljack's torso. At this point Applejack was groaning and stuttering, drawing bits of attention to herself from other ponies, as she grabbed her head in frustration, in pain from the internal turmoil going in her head. \"Applejack is NOT a thief, you're nothin' but a horrid part of her that's trying to lead her to ruin, and you won't win!\" Angeljack bucked into Deviljack's body, using her halo as a dagger sort of weapon.  \"Says you! I got me an ace this time, you halo wearin', weak pansy!\" Deviljack then took out a small vial, holding the same red powder that Applejack possessed. Dumping the contents into her mouth, she then morphed into a muscular, demonic, black pony devil, sporting a fiery mane and sharp, crimson eyes. \"Wh-what the hay?!\" Angeljack screamed as Deviljack consumed her in a wave of fiery darkness. \"Gaaahhh!\" Applejack's eyes opened, her pupils now quite dilated, the residual effects of something akin to a headache slowly going away. Pulling out the vial, Applejack, like her bad conscience did, poured a teaspoon of the powder onto her tongue, it's powerful pang of flavor filled her insides the moment she ingested it. \"Ooohh, that really helps me after that...whatever that was.\" Applejack said, trying to explain what she had experienced. Rubbing her forehead, the pony took a look at her bag of bits and her own cash she had earned, and decided it was time to go home, not much use staying at the market with no food to sell, and it'd be unwise to try and steal more now, considering it'd be suspicious if she were to be caught stealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya everypony! I'm back!\" Applejack exclaimed, opening the front door to her abode at evening. \"Ohh sis! How'd ya do today?!\" Applebloom asked as she ran up to her older sister, running past her brother, who was slowly trudging up to her as well. \"See for yerself!\" Applejack dropped her chest of bits to the floor, letting it thud heavily on the wooden base.  \"Over a hundred bits! Wow you sure did a hay's good sellin' today, right Big Mac?\"<br>\r\n \"Eeyup.\" Applejack chuckled, happy that she had made her family happy. <br>\r\n\"So, where's Granny Smith?\" <br>\r\n\"Over there.\" Big Mac pointed to the sleeping old mare in a nearby rocking chair. \"Ah well...ah guess ah can tell tomorrow... well I'm beat, I'll be heading ta bed now y'all.\" \"Aw, but sis, you just got home, ah wanted ya taste a few more sweets I made with Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo today!\" \"Aw shucks, don't worry Applebloom, I'll be sure to eat whatever you've made tomorrow for breakfast!\" \"G'night you two!\" \"Night!\" her two siblings said in response. \"G'night Granny.\" Applejack whispered to the sleeping, old mare, rubbing her head with her hoof. Applejack then made her way up to her bedroom, a sleeping Winoa layed in her basket. Placing her bag on stand, the vial fell as she moved it, landing in sheets. As Applejack fell asleep, changes to her body began, a latent effect of the pure, undiluted powder. Her body began to get bigger, adipose rapidly began to develop. Applejack grew and grew throughout the night, developing a second chin and quite a few folds, her small potbelly she had earlier the other day had turned into a full blown fold ridden gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh oh, phew... I haven't slept that good in ages, well better get up to start early morning buckin'...\" Applejack yawned as she stretched her body in bed, leaning over to get out of bed, she suddenly found herself crashing to the floor, waking her dog WInoa. \"Uggh! Wh-what the?!\" Applejack groggily wriggled about, eventually bringing herself up. \"How'd I get so fat?\" the pony muttered as her dog, surprised at her mistress's new size, pawed at the pony's mass of a belly. \"Don't worry Winoa it's still me...all of me.\" she looked to her sides, wondering how this would fare with her duties on the farm, and of course how her family and friends would take this new development on her body. \"Hey Applejack what was that nois--woah.\" Applebloom burst open her sister's door, Applejack winced as her sister saw her flabby body. \"What happened to you?\" Applebloom walked over and poked her hoof into a lower belly fold, \"I...I don't know, now come on don't poke me like that, it's feeling weird.\" \"Well...okay, let's just get morning work done with before we go into this.\" Applebloom trotted off, going down to tell Big Mac AJ was up and ready to go, and also that she might be a little slow today. Bringing herself downstairs, the mare embarrassingly showed herself to her family. \"Uhh good morin' everypony.\" Granny Smith and Big Macintosh's jaws dropped at the sight of Applejack's frame. \"Why child...what in blazes happened to ya last night?! Ya look like ya ate a whole two tree's worth uh apples!\" \"I'll talk about this later, right now I gotta get to work, okay Granny? Now, come on Big Mac, those trees aren't gonna buck themselves. Applejack deadpanned as she waddled out to the field, the stallion still at a lost for words, nodded and followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" AJ reared as she galloped towards the first tree. Picking up her hind legs she slammed her hooves into the tree. Which due to her increased weight and fat, did nothing but send ripples throughout her blubber. \"Pfft hehe...\" Big Macintosh couldn't help but laugh over his sister's attempt at bucking, it was a funny sight to see his sister jiggle so wildly, even if it meant she couldn't work properly. \"Don't laugh at me!...I'll show him.\" Applejack then remembered that vial of powder, that old stallion said it could make all the weight in the world meaningless to ya. \"Did I bring it with me?\" Applejack fiddled around in her folds, thinking it might've fell in there last night since she take her bag off, remembering it fell onto her bed right before she fell asleep. Searching around, Applejack found it stuck between two large folds underneath her belly button. \"Ah ha!\" but as she took hold of it, Applejack felt something... a small thought that told her not to do this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling this slight restraint inside her head, Applejack hesitated for a moment. True she absolutely needed to bring down apples to bring in income for her family, but would it be right to do so using this fancy spice? Something was telling her this wouldn't be right. Then out from a hellish portal on Applejack's shoulder, somewhat bruised and exhausted, came the angelic Applejack. \"AJ, stop...guuuh d-don't use it, it ain't right!\" <br>\r\n\"GET BACK HERE!\" from inside the portal roared a deep, distorted voice sounding vaguely like Applejack, suddenly a large claw that looked more like a disfigured hoof reached out from the hellfire, entrapping Angeljack in it's grasp, pulling her back towards the portal. the voice called out again, this time to Applejack herself. \"Hey listen, use that stuff here girl, show our brother what you're really capable of!\" the portal then faded away, leaving the mare to stare once more at the vial of powder. Looking down at her wobbly gut, and at her brother who was hard at work, having bucked a good 5 barrels of apples in the minute or so she had been dealing with her consciences. Taking the cork out, spatting it into a small fold underneath her left foreleg, Applejack dumped over half the remaining contents left in the vial, leaving about one more gulp. \"Alright, that should be enough for the day.\" Applejack's eyes dilated slightly, her body full of vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintosh lifted his right hind leg, striking the trunk with a powerful buck, the resulting vibrations traveled up through the tree to it's crown, shaking off all the juicy, red apples from it. Looking down, the stallion found that one of the apples had missed the barrel, reaching down to grab it with his teeth, his ears perked upon hearing the excited shouting of his younger sister. \"YEE-HAW!!\" Galloping towards a nearby tree, Applejack swiftly and gracefully rotated her body, swinging her hind legs towards the tree, she bucked it with immense vigor. The force from the kick, sent a loud resonating WHACK through the air. A bundle of leaves fell alongside the bunch of apples. Her kick left a noticeable indent in tree's bark. Big Macintosh was so surprised by AJ's sudden show of energy that he dropped the apple in his teeth. \"Come on Big Mac, we got work to do!\" Applejack shouted to her brother, noticing his awestruck status. Regaining his composure, the pony simply nodded, smiling at his sister's lively attitude. Even this sudden and mysterious weight gain she had acquired couldn't stop the spirit of the Apple Family, though he had to wonder just how did she get so....rotund overnight, it puzzled him, but he thought best to leave that kind of thinking for later, he had work to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two working ponies continued their bucking, with Applejack working at a faster speed then her brother, with equal power, she was proving to be quite an asset today.  Kicking and thwacking every tree with a powerful thrust of her legs, Applejack and Big Macintosh had finished their morning work in record time, only 2 hours and 26 or so minutes. \"Well looks like we're done huh Big Macintosh?\"<br>\r\n\"Eeyup.\" the stallion replied, agreeing with her. <br>\r\n\"Yep, good thing I had this tasty spice here, gave me a heck of a boost with it's taste.\" Applejack then pulled out the vial. <br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Big Macintosh stared the vial, curious of this spice. Taking it in his hoof, he opened up the vial and poured a tiny bit onto his tongue. \"Bleh!\" the red stallion, wiped his tongue of the stuff, his face contorted into one of disgust.<br>\r\n\"Woah, Big Mac? What's wrong?\" AJ said swiping the vial from him. <br>\r\n\"Too strong.\"   he said, still wiping his tongue of the strong spice. <br>\r\n\"Heh heh, well Ah'll check back with ya for the rest of the fields later today, I'm gonna go around town for a bit.\" Applejack trotted off, waving goodbye to her brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to the marketplace, Applejack smiled as she took pleasure in the livelihood of the ponies around her.  \"Applejack?\" hearing her named being called, the mare turned around to meet with a familiar face, two faces actually.<br>\r\n\"Ah well howdy Twilight, Spike, what brings you two here?\" the purple mare and baby dragon looked on at their friend with slack jaws, Spike started to giggle a bit, but was soon stopped by a quick glare of his friend. \"Oh we just came here to pick up some mints for Spike and a few other things, his breath has been getting more worse then usual...\" Twilight said waving her hoof in front of her snout. <br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Spike angrily snapped at the mare, embarrassed and irritated by the statement. <br>\r\n\"But more importantly, Applejack what happened to you...you look so...so...\" <br>\r\n\"Fat?\" the dragon interrupted with his blunt comment. He then winced in slight pain as Twilight whacked him on the head with her hoof.<br>\r\nApplejack blushed, she knew this would happen sooner or later. \"Well...to be honest, Ah'm not sure, just kinda woke up like this.\" <br>\r\n\"You...just woke up with all this extra weight? Hmm...\" Twilight veered her head closer to get look at the flab on the orange mare. Poking it gently, she saw it bob and shake slightly from the touch, it was indeed....fat. <br>\r\n\"Yep...aw but it ain't no biggie, I did all my morning buckin' with Big Mac in record time!\" Applejack then felt a pang in her head, a need to fill herself. Taking out the vial she once again dumped the contents onto her tongue and swallowed. \"Ah...that really hits the spot.\" <br>\r\n\"Hey Applejack where'd ya get that stuff?\" Spike pointed to the now empty vial, it's insides now filled with nothing but the faint remnants of the red powder. <br>\r\n\"Oh I got it at the market from some old pony yesterday, some sort of super tasty spice.\" <br>\r\n\"Really? I've never seen that kind of stuff before...can you tell me where to find some of that, I'd love to try it, maybe with a daffodil sandwich.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh well...actually I don't know where to find the guy who gave me this, he didn't  give me any info on that.\" As she said this, she again lifted the vial, expecting to feel the wonderful sensation of taste of that powder once again, but felt nothing. <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" \"W-where is it?\"  Applejack shook it up and down, trying to see if some would fall out.<br>\r\n\"Uhh Applejack, you ate it all, it's empty.\" Twilight said in a half amused half confused manner. Applejack, realizing this, started to get a little nervous. <br>\r\n\"Oh...well darn, I uhh oh sheesh I gotta go to the...little filly's room, yeah! I'll see ya'll later!\" Applejack ran off past the two, leaving them bewildered by the pony's sudden worry. \"AJ wait!...Guess it's urgent.\" <br>\r\n\"Applejack needs to stop eating all that powder, did you see how big she got?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh stop it Spike, there's no way a vial that size could hold ANYTHING capable of doing that to a pony's body overnight. still...I wonder just how she got like that in the first place, I think I'll go and check with Sweet Apple Acres later, now come on, let's go find you some mints, that breath of yours is getting awful.\" <br>\r\n\"Ugghh!\" Spike crossed his arms, pouting as the continued their trek through the market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarting past several alleys, Applejack searched for any pony who looked similar to the old stallion. Knowing he didn't like being seen in public, she figured she could find him by going to some place similar to when she first met him. After about 2 hours of running around rampant, the mare was starting to feel rather winded, all the energy gone, she felt very heavy. Stopping to rest in an alley away from the hassle of the market, she stood against a wall to rest.\"*gasp....huuaah...Hoo boy, I sure wish I had some of that powder, I....\" At that moment Applejack felt a pang in her belly, a low rumbling emitted from it, in seconds, the pony let out a rather massive belch, odd given her lack of eating today, beside the powder from before. \"BBBUUURRRPPP!!!!\" As she did though, something crazy happened, Applejack began to get fatter...much fatter. Her form expanded a good foot from her body, a large belly began to form and developed into segmented rolls, the mare developed a second and third chin, both them flopped violently as they bulged out from her neck. Her legs bulged with layers of flab. After a few seconds, the gaining stopped Applejack stood there, well over 350lbs, in an abandoned alleyway. \"W-what in the hay?! she said in panic, wondering what had happened. <br>\r\n\"Oh dear...Miss Applejack, you don't seem to be in the best of shapes.\" a gravely voice called out to her, from around a corner appeared the old stallion once again, a look of concern and worry adorned his face.  <br>\r\n\"Oh sir, am Ah glad to see you!, you got any more of that spice?\" <br>\r\n\"Don't worry child, I have plenty, but...it puzzles me....how did you become like this in only a day's time?\" he put his hoof to his chin as he said this.<br>\r\n\"Ah well...I don't know sir, it just kinda happened in my sleep and well...just now actually. <br>\r\n\"Hmm pity, well I'm sure you'll find a way around it.\" He then turned around to leave. <br>\r\n\"Wait! Uhh Mister, aren't you gonna give me some more powder?\" <br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh yes...100bits.\" <br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" Applejack questioned, not understanding him. <br>\r\n\"One hundred bits...for this much.\" Out from his coat pocket, the stallion pulled out a small plastic bag, holding around 5 times the amount the vial held. <br>\r\n\"1-100?! That spice is good, but I didn't think it'd be that pricey!\"<br>\r\n\"Well you're getting a lot more and this is very expensive to make, even an amount like this costs a fortune to produce. <br>\r\n\"But...I...I don't have that much with me.\" Applejack looked down with worry.<br>\r\n\"Such a shame...oh well, goodbye Miss Applejack.\" the old stallion put the bag back, and turned around again.<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" Applejack shouted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I...I can get more, just give me some time.\" Applejack's eyes darted around immediately thinking of places or ways of where she could find a hundred bits in short amount of time. Her belly wobbled as she darted off.<br>\r\n\"Boss!\" the young colt from before trotted up the old unicorn; in his mouth he held a small pouch. \"I got the stuff like you asked!\" <br>\r\n\"Ahh...good job Rascal,\" The old stallion opened up the pouch, revealing a kind of powder similar to that which he had given to Applejack, however this one had a strong purple tint to it. \"With this, control over Miss Applejack and essentially the Elements of Harmony will be mere foal's play.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah...but...uhhh Boss, I've been thinkin', why exactly did you give that first batch of yours to those three fillies? I mean...that seemed kind of risky.\" the small brown colt then readjusted his Gatsby. <br>\r\n\"When you\u2019ve been around as long as I\u2019ve have you know that for any good plan to come to fruition, you must first disperse a few \u201ctests\u201d\u2026and you also learn how to cover your tracks if need be. Now come on, let\u2019s get back to base, I bet Runner and Sunshine Spark are waiting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d Rascal smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way into the outer parts of Ponyville, going through old, abandoned alleyways, into the less populated areas, the two ponies walked into a large warehouse that by all means looked unused and unfit to be the abode for anypony, in other words the perfect hideout for the old stallion and his group. Going down the creaky and dusty staircase, Rascal and the Boss entered the basement, pushing open an ironclad door that had been made by one of the ponies inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s your pawn doing so far old man?\u201d a grayish blue, wavy maned, bespectacled young unicorn with a snarky disposition called from behind himself as he mixed and combined various potions and ingredients in bowls and test tubes. <br>\r\n\u201cNow is that anyway to talk to your elders Magus?\u201d he said with a slight chuckle. <br>\r\n\u201cMaster Mastermind!\u201d a young beige coated, scarlet maned, Pegasus wearing a navy blue hoodie ran up to the old stallion. \u201cIs your glorious plan finally starting to fruition?\u201d the mare squealed as she pranced on her hooves. The spectacled stallion frowned at her display of admiration for his superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo answer the both of you, they are going well\u2026 with one of the Element Bearers out of commission, the monotony of Equestria will be forever gone, and this country will finally see the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRascal!\u201d  Suddenly two other children ran up to the colt. A light yellow pegasus with a short jagged mane, the other was a cobalt blue unicorn with a mane that resembled that of a porcupine. <br>\r\n\u201cHow was your first time out with the Boss?\u201d Sunshine Spark asked with eagerness.<br>\r\n\u201cDid you do really cool stuff like what Magus and Scarlet Flower do outside?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNothing much, but I did help get Boss his first customer in years! And it was Applejack one of the Elements of Harmony!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWow, she\u2019s really important, He must be really proud of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course he is Shiny; otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be so happy. Look at him.\u201d Runner then pointed a hoof at the old stallion, who had been occupied with conversing with Magus over something. The old stallion had a confident smirk strewn across his face; his brow was angled downward showing arrogance and maliciousness, however the young ponies could not fully realize this kind of body language and merely saw the smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Have you finished the potion yet Magus?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, since I don\u2019t have any proper test subjects and since we plan for this to be used in the town\u2019s water supply; it\u2019s getting rather arduous to determine what works and what doesn\u2019t. I can only use these lab rats here\u2026but so far it only last for a few hours, an entire town of ponies with the current combination we have, would only be effected for just under an hour, and that\u2019s if they all got effected at the exact same time.\u201d Magus looked over at the group of white mice; they were rather obese and lethargic, different from the stuff that had been given to Applejack in that hers was made to induce weight gain instantly after a set of time had passed ranging from 5 to 10 hours and it also worked to heighten and cause adrenaline, with an addiction to the powder as well if enough was devoured. Previous samples like the amount given to the earth pony were not planned to have this kind of effect, but given how energetic some of the rats and Applejack had become after consumption, it made them easy to manipulate into wanting more. These newer concoctions were crafted only to induce weight gain and make the consumer lethargic, which would allow for an easy takeover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026well continue working on it, as long as I\u2019ve got Applejack in my hooves, the Elements of Harmony will be effectively disabled. \u201cScarlet Flower, come, I have a task for you.\u201d The beige mare face beamed with bliss as she heard her master\u2019s words. <br>\r\n\u201cOf course Master Mastermind!\u201d Scarlet Flower followed the stallion outside, bouncing up the steps with child-like glee.<br>\r\n\u201cTch\u2026so annoying, <i>Master</i> Mastermind\u2026\u201d Magus gritted his teeth as he continued his work for the old stallion, his nostrils flaring, making the trio of foals laugh at his over the top facial expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s just gotta be someplace I can find some bits\u2026I\u2026I need that powder!\u201d Applejack whispered to herself as she ran across Ponyville, looking around for anyplace, anyway to get some quick cash. Her rotund body was making it difficult to get around, and it also got her a large amount of stares, so her earlier actions of theft weren\u2019t a viable option anymore. Going from place to place, seeing anypony had some kind of immediate odd job that needed to be done, and while she did surprisingly find someponies needing help, her bulky flab made her rather inept as help. \u201cMaybe you should try an eating contest if you want some quick money hehe, I hear there\u2019s supposed to be a pie eating one tomorrow, with how big you are you\u2019ll probably do great haha!.\u201d One of the ponies she had met with told of her, and though it was rather rude in it\u2019s meaning, it did offer her at least a way to get some bits. \u201cAn eating contest\u2026Oh but I need some money to enter in the first place!\u201d Applejack grunted as she read the flyer she had found after speaking with the pony from before. Realizing something, she ran back home to get her entry fee.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His fur is pure white while his mane and tail consist of black and blue strips. He was slightly taller than Applejack and muscular features looks like he is a member of a modelling industry. There was not any touch of scratch or wrinkle on him as if he had not ever done any hard work ever in his all life. His green eyes looked toward Applejack which shows kindness and happiness.<br>\r\n\"I think this belong to you,\" chuckled the unicorn as he was passing the apples to Applejack.<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Applejack replied as she took the apples from him. She was still breathing heavily after the big chase. She just sat down in the middle of the alleyway to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will return this colt to his parents and they will give him a stern talking about him,\" the unicorn picked the colt up with his magic, \"and my name is Glory Sweet.\"<br>\r\n\"The name's Applejack,\" Applejack stood up to talk to him eye-to-eye.<br>\r\n\"Applejack! As in <b>THE APPLEJACK</b> that saved Equestria from Nightmare Moon and the element of honesty,\" exclaimed Glory.<br>\r\n\"That's me!\" grinned Applejack.<br>\r\nGlory Sweet was praising the tartarus out of her as if she was a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it peculiar,\" said Glory as he closely examined her, \"You are quite fit but yet you are out of breath and cannot catch this colt.\"<br>\r\nApplejack blushed as she touched her stomach. Her stomach slightly wobbled as she was sure that she gained about 10 pounds from her yesterday's food gorging. Rainbow Dash will be teasing her for a long time or until she lost the extra weight.<br>\r\n\"Ah think ah just gained some weight,\" rubbing the back of her head with embarrassment as she supposed to be fit who does all the athletic stuff.<br>\r\n\"Really! A little weight does not make any less beautiful. But if you still unsure about it I got just the answer for that,\" Glory put down his saddlebags and dig out a small vial with red powder. <br>\r\nApplejack wondered how the powder useful for and it helps her.<br>\r\n\"This will give you the energy boost you need for a good amount of time,\" he tossed the vial towards her.<br>\r\n\"Really!\" Applejack exclaimed as she quickly examined the powder. <br>\r\n\"Yes! Even a pony as big as a whale can get the energy and strength\" Glory posed in front Applejack, \"This is how I got this body and still be able to do a tons of things\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Glory,\" cheered Applejack, \"What is this stuff made out of?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but it's a secret,\" whispered Glory.<br>\r\nBefore she could say something else, Glory put his hood in front of her to warned her about something.<br>\r\n\"However you must keep it a secret. You can not show or talk about the powder to anypony. You cannot say who you got it from. You can not let anybody try or examine it. Do you promise?\" Glory glared into Applejack's eyes.<br>\r\n\"I pinkie promised that I would not tell anypony.\" Applejack did the motion of the pinkie promise.<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a promised,\" Glory clearly confused of what just happen in front of her. <br>\r\nHe carried the colt and walked away from Applejack. <br>\r\n\"Wait a darn minute,\"  Glory stopped for a moment to hear her, \"Where do ah see you again?\"<br>\r\nGlory just smirked as he just continues walking, \"I will just be wondering around. I am sure we will meet up again.\"<br>\r\nAs he turned around the corner Applejack stared at the vial in her hooves.<br>\r\n\"<i>Even a pony as big as a whale can get the energy and strength</i>,\" she repeated to herself to comprehend on how this small vial can do that much. She can even tell that he is not lying. She took a few spoonful of powder into her mouth a swallowed it.<br>\r\n\"Whoa nelly!\" Applejack was bucking around with full of enthusiasm and energy, \"Ah could wrestled a full-grown pig while in mah sleep!\"<br>\r\nApplejack rushed back to her cart to continue selling her produce. She sells a good amount of her product before she feel a strong feeling in her stomach.<br>\r\nShe was incredibly hungry. Applejack thought to herself that she could wait until dinner time but the rumbling from her stomach disturbed her and the ponies around her. She clutched her stomach, begging for her stomach to stop. However her stomach kept rumbling for food. She does not know what to do. If she eat the food, her family will be having a fit. If she doesn't, she could not maintain her composure and continue selling her apples. What should she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Applejack put her hat on one of the bedpost and hid the powder under the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the night, Applejack weight increases like bread dough rising in an oven. Her small belly became a large gut. She gained a double chin. Huge cheeks that make her face look adorable and her butt that now take up two seats. Applejack didn't notice what was happening to her body overnight. If Applejack was awake, she would describe it as the best sleep she had in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning come, Applejack woke up and removed the blanket off her.<br>\r\n\"This is the best dang sleep ah've ever had,\" Applejack rolled off her bed and slammed heavily on the ground, \"What the heck just happen?\"<br>\r\nApplejack looked all over her body and found she gained a lot of weight overnight. She could not think what could cause this to happen. However the middle of her thought was interrupted for the desire for more the red powder hidden under her mattress.<br>\r\n\"Today's a long day. Need more powder to power through the day,\" Applejack flipped over the mattress and took out the vial.<br>\r\nShe took another couple of teaspoons of the powder, \"Hooey! That's hit the spot. I feel like I could buck the whole apple orchard.\"<br>\r\nApplejack hid the vial under her hat and went down to see her family at the table having breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the table, Applejack's family were shock to see her.<br>\r\n\"What happen to you Applejack?\" asked Applebloom curiously on how she could gain so much weight in one day.<br>\r\n\"Look like you've just eaten the whole apple family feast all by yourself!\" Granny Smith finished serving all the meals to the family.<br>\r\n\"Not sure but don't worry. A working mare like me can work off this fat like butter melting in the sun,\" Applejack dismissed the stares from her family and took her seat at the table. The chair groaned under the weight of her.<br>\r\nIt was a sight to see Applejack finished her meal within only a minute. It usually takes her at least 10 minutes to finish her meal when she was in a hurry. It was like her didn't have anything to eat yesterday.<br>\r\n\"Ah'm taking the produce to the market. See you later,\" Applejack left the table and went to the cart.<br>\r\n\"Okay. Ah've gained a bit of weight. Just need to widen the straps and off I go,\" Applejack widen the straps to make it fit on her. It was a bit tight but it done its business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was setting the apple stand, many ponies were commenting about her weight behind her back. Nopony dared to ask her why she gained so much weight as she was a farmer and an athlete. They don't want to upset her and be bucked. Applejack continued her business like usual and once again met Twilight Sparkle and Spike.<br>\r\n\"Hey Applejack,\" Twilight tried to start a conversation without offending her, \"I would like another bushel of apples.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Twi,\" Applejack picked a basket of apples to Twilight.<br>\r\n\"Uhm... Applejack you looking a bit bigger than usual,\" Twilight put on a forced smile.<br>\r\n\"You mean outright fat,\" Spike speak the truth blatantly.<br>\r\n\"Spike!\" Twilight was shock to hear Spike like that.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Twi. Ah just gain a lot of weight last night,\" Applejack not offending by Spike's statement.<br>\r\n\"All of this in one night?\" Twilight poked her belly to see it is not an illusion. It rippled by the poke of Twilight's hoof. It was surely fat.<br>\r\n\"Do you know what cause this?\" Twilight was really curious about Applejack's new weight.<br>\r\nApplejack tried to think of something, she first thought it could be the powder but it couldn't have effect her that much.<br>\r\n\"Not really sure. Sorry about that,\" Applejack went back to her business selling apples.<br>\r\n\"Okay Applejack. Just make sure to ask me when you find something unusual,\" Twilight lead Spike away from Applejack.<br>\r\nApplejack heard the whisper from Spike, \"From a distance I swear she is like a cow but orange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack continued as business. When nopony was looking she took out the vial and swallow the rest of the red powder.<br>\r\n\"That's much better. Ah hope that Glory bring more of the red powder.\"<br>\r\nAfter selling all the produce, Applejack went to the same alleyway where she first met Glory Sweet.<br>\r\n\"Ah hope he is coming today,\" Applejack was impatient for more of that red powder.<br>\r\nThen something strange happen.<br>\r\nApplejack loudly burped, \"What the? I've only had breakfast.\"<br>\r\nApplejack body just blew up in fat. Her belly just grew so big that there are belly rolls and at least an inch off the ground while standing, her butts now take up three seats, and gained another chin. Applejack sat on her hunch and examined her body. Her belly touch the ground while sitting.<br>\r\n\"What the dang just happen?\" Applejack asked.<br>\r\n\"Applejack. There you are,\" a voice came from behind her.</span></div></div>",

It have been there for weeks and nopony even went in there. Applejack decided to have a try and see what do they offer. First time for everything she told to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack opened the door which give out a soft chime. Suddenly trumpets, balloons and streamers came out from everywhere. Applejack jumped up with fright as this was just happen out of nowhere. A male unicorn with grey fur and, black mane and tail came up to her with a happy grin.<br>\r\n\"Congratulation! You are our first customer!\" cheered the owner.<br>\r\n\"Wha th'?\" Applejack said.<br>\r\n\"You get the unlimited free food for this restaurant for the rest of your life,\" the owner kept cheering as Applejack tried to catch up what was going on.<br>\r\nThe owner pushed Applejack to the table furthest away from the door. He put Applejack to the softest and widest booth seating in the restaurant. The booth can easily fit all her friends with room to spare. <br>\r\n\"May ah ask what's your name?\" Applejack questioned.<br>\r\n\"You can just call me the manager. I will give you one of everything as everything for you is free,\" said the manager as he disappeared into the kitchen. <br>\r\n\"Wait th' darn minute. Ah can't eat that much!\" Applejack voice failed to reach the manager's ears. <br>\r\nApplejack waited for him to return. She didn't have to wait long as he came back at least a minute later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he returned, Applejack was in shock. Stream of foods and drinks floated onto the table in front of her. It is like a banquet for the whole family. Foods and drinks pile on top of each other until it towers over Applejack. Applejack looked amazed of how much food he could cook in that short amount of time. <br>\r\n\"Eat up before the food become cold,\" said the owner happily.<br>\r\nApplejack can see many kind of drinks and foods. There are many variation and flavors of soda and milkshakes. All the food appeared to be either covered in ton of grease, butter or fired. Applejack gulped as she just stared at it. Applejack took a hamburger out of the bunch and take a bite of it.</span></div></div>",

Just the matter of when. It could be tomorrow, next week, or maybe a year,\" Discord pondered to himself, \"Anyway, I will be spending with you every minute of your life.\"<br>\r\nApplejack gulped as he was right.

Whole of Equestria were looking for here but nopony could find any clue. Rewards and signs for any information leading to Applejack location but nopony ever try to claim it. Princess Celestia knew that missing one of the elements could spell disastrous to her ponies and her kingdom. Almost everypony lost hope finding her except for her closest friends and family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack had been underground the entire time with Discord as her company. Eventhough Applejack was a prisoner, Discord was keeping her <i>entertained</i> and <i>well-nourished</i>. Discord made sure she had enough space to grow by making the cave wider and things to do while she was bored. Applejack would be fed breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnight feast with snacks in between. If Applejack disobeyed by not talking to him or finish her meal, Discord would use his power to accelerate her calorie consumption to make her eat more. Sometimes Discord would do it just for fun when she wasn't looking. Applejack entertainment is watching movies on a film projector and reading books. She had to read books by Discord holding it in front of her face and Applejack telling him to turn it. However, what make Applejack angry, beside getting fatter, was Discord playing games involving with her flab. Discord would treat her belly as the softest bed and furniture is existence, the best trampoline and treasure hunting in her belly rolls. Discord would placed his hand in one of her love handles and pull out random objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen one month past by, Applejack was bigger than whale-like. Applejack is wide as Ponyville and her gut can reached pass the tallest trees. She is literally the biggest and fattest creature in the world. She gave up rebelling as she didn't have the will power to do so. She lost hope of getting back to normal as a consequence she eats everything that is set in front of her and does not complain anything about it. She would eat so much that she had gained a couple of bad habits such as sleep-eating and emotion-eating. She would eat in her sleep and eat anything when she is not bored. Even when she was bored she would eat. Applejack would eat a large feast by herself for every half an hour with meals in between. However she didn't loose faith of being found by her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FEAST TIME!\" Discord cheered, \"As this is our one month anniversary I therefore increase all your meals by 10 folds. I saw you wasting away a bit and always begging for more food.\"<br>\r\nDiscord summoned tons of junk food, each as big as a house, all going straight to Applejack's gullet. Applejack swallowed them all with little pain and effort as she got used to it. Applejack burped so loud that her whole belly wobble like jello and laid back waiting for her next feast. Discord played some games with her like finding an ursa major in her belly rolls and throwing food in her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Your friends still have no clue where you are even if you are the biggest thing in the world. I wonder how much does it take to find you?\" Discord pondered out loud.</span></div></div>",

When word spread out everypony were dying to try the new fast food restaurant. Everypony, who had tasted it, was extremely addicted to it. However the young fillies and colts seems to have no effect from them as well as Pinkie PIe. They all replied it as another fast food chain. The adults did not eat anything else but the food from the new fast food restaurant. Fortunately, Rainbow Dash got wind from it and distance herself from it like a plague. She needed to be in peak performance to be in the Wonderbolts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weeks passed by, everypony waistline just exploded. Now almost every adult have a belly the drooped and jiggly where ever they go but they are twigs compared to Applejack. Applejack was literately and figuratively the largest customer. Applejack was wider than three ponies with quadruple chins. The owner always kept a special place only for Applejack to enjoy her meal away from everypony else. Applejack would consume a meal that can feed a family of ten. Between each meal she would constantly order snacks and takeaway which all add up into a large family feast. Applejack didn't mind about her increasing eating habit. When somepony commented on her weight, she would brush it off and said she was a <i>'growing'</i> mare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Applejack weight rises, her working effort at the farm dramatically drops. She would need constant break for food and need to be move around by using a large wooden board with wheels to lie on. So Big Macintosh and Applebloom have to pick up her slack. Applejack had to move to the barn as she had to keep squeezing between each door and the floor creaked loudly, threatened to be destroyed by her weight. Whenever Rainbow Dash visit Applejack, Rainbow would tease about her weight and brag about herself that she could run around many times before Applejack could attempt to move. Applejack just ignore her and kept on eating. Despite the teasing, Rainbow was really concern about Applejack's health as she was the fattest mare in Ponyville. Everything that Applejack did was either eating or sleeping. Maybe both at the same time. It was a loss cause as Applejack was too stubborn to listen to Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a health inspection at the restaurant as there was a noticeable rise of obesity in Ponyville but the restaurant did not break any health law or did any illegal activity. The health inspectors could not do anything as ponies have the rights to eat whatever they want to eat. The restaurant was left alone and continue to expand the business. All the other restaurant and food chain close as almost everypony decided to only eat at the new restaurant. All the closed shops are bought by the new restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day at the restaurant, Applejack entered the restaurant through the back door.<br>\r\n\"Hi Manager!\" Applejack panted as she took her seat, \"another meal!\"<br>\r\nA stack of junk food stacked in front of her as she tucked in.<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" asked the manager as he sat across from her.<br>\r\n\"Nothing much,\" Applejack took another bite before speaking again, \"Ah just need ta find another source of income. Apples doesn't make a profit as it use to.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" the manager thought to himself and got an idea, \"What about an eating contest?\"<br>\r\n\"An eating contest?\" Applejack repeated what he just said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Getting the first prize and having the sponsorship would give the bits to cover any expense,\" the manager explained his idea.<br>\r\n\"Do ya think ah could do it?\" Applejack shoveled more food straight into her jaws as she waited for a reply.<br>\r\n\"Sure. I bet you are a natural. I could be your first sponsor. I could help you find others to sponsor you. You can get big buck from it.\"<br>\r\nApplejack thought to herself carefully and agreed with the idea. She would get to eat food and get paid for it.<br>\r\n\"Where do ah start?\"<br>\r\nThe manager gave the answer, \"Don't worry. I would handle it. I would be like your manager. I will find all the upcoming competition and pay all the expense to travel there.\"<br>\r\nApplejack couldn't believe her eyes and ears. \"You would do that for me. Why?\"<br>\r\n\"It's a win-win situation. You get the bits and I get to promote my business. And you are my friend and my best customer.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah'll accept the offer.\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent! I would bring a contract and you to sign it. I'll be back in a jiffy!\" the manager hopped off his seat and walked back to his office.</span></div></div>",

Every competitors cowered under Applejack's size as she grow bigger and hungrier after every win. She was nicknamed the '<b>Blackhole Stomach</b>' by the food eating community. Between each competition she would train to push her eating to the limit. Her crew, hired by the manager, pampered her while she eat and carried her to the eating competition. Her sponsor's logos were painted all over her body like a living billboard but she didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first half of the month, she would travel by train. However she quickly outgrew the train carriage and some tunnels were too narrow to fit so the crew hired a airship to carry her with the specifically-made harness for her. It was quite a sight to see an orange blob in the sky. Applejack just eat and eat until she was unable to reach the food herself. So the unicorns in the crew help her by lifting food straight to her jaw. Applejack became a machine with the only purpose to fill its bottomless stomach. During that time she gain the ability to sleep eat which exponentially increases her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the month she was the declared the fattest mare in Equestria. She was lifted back to Ponyville and dropped in a large field nearby the restaurant. Having won 10 eating competition in a row really take a toll on Applejack's weight. She was wider and bigger than the biggest barn in Sweet Apple Acres. This means she is wider than fifty ponies and taller than a three story building. She can easily fill up the town square and still needed more room. Applejack was currently lying on her back as food were levitated into her mouth. By lying on her back, the distance between the food and the mouth is shorter and she can communicate with other ponies without having to overtower them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job AJ! I knew you would be a natural. I will give your winnings to your family and leave you with your snack,\" the manager levitated the huge bag of bits to one of his employee so he could send them straight to Applejack's family. The bits that Applejack made in one month worth the same as working at the farm for a whole year.<br>\r\nApplejack just laid back while stuffing her face in food as she look around. She noticed that everything in Ponyville had change. The pathways were wider and all the doors in Ponyville is three times wider. Ponyville was devoid of adults. Only children and animals roamed the street. The children were doing jobs and taking care of the adults as the animals, trained by Fluttershy, transport goods and carry adults to each location. Majority of Ponyville's adults were too fat to do anything for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack!\" Pinkie's voice was heard from somewhere.<br>\r\nApplejack looked around but the limited vision because of the stomach make it hard to see anything.<br>\r\n\"Up here silly!\" Pinkie was standing on the top of her belly and hopped down toward Applejack's head, \"Wowwie! You should take part-time as a bouncy castle. You the best bouncy castle I have ever experience. That's saying a lot because I went to every bouncy castle that I have visited.\"<br>\r\n\"Good to see you again Pinkie,\" Applejack went back munching on her food.<br>\r\n\"Welcome back! We should celebrate your winnings and beating world records,\" Pinkie said, \"How should we celebrate it?\"</span></div></div>",

She tore out her dress from the Grand Galloping Gala, in the hopes that it would be enough of a distraction to draw attention away from any dirt or grime that might be tarnishing her coat. She was already late for Rarity's social, and had no time to clean herself. Hastily, she shoved the lime green skirt up her flank and tossed her saddle on top. She sat back on her haunches and picked up her apple collar with both hooves, but when she reached back around her neck to fasten it, she found that it wasn't long enough. She pulled it till the collar was practically choking her, but her neck was too thick for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack sighed heavily. She knew that she'd been getting bigger. She didn't mean for it to happen, it just started innocently a few weeks ago, when she couldn't gather the courage to talk to Rarity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn orange earth pony trotted briskly up to the Carousel Boutique. With her head held as high as an elephant's eye, she looked confident and proud, like she was daring the world to just try to mess with her. But even her spunky aura wasn't enough to stop a few strange looks amongst the ponies. This mare was no fashionista, and had only been to the boutique about four times, and only on legitimate business expeditions. So why was she going now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of her peer's quizzical faces, the pony gazed at the lavish door of the boutique. She took the rope hanging down in her teeth and pulled. Somewhere inside, a bell rang. \"Just a momeeeent!\" said a sing-songy voice. The pony at the front door stood patiently as a glistening white unicorn opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, hello there, Applejack, darling! What brings you here?\" said the unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alright, sugar, you can do this, just tell her how you feel,</i> thought Applejack, but before she could say anything, she was whisked into the boutqiue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Applejack, you simply <i>must</i> try on this new shirt, it will look absolutely <i>ravishing</i> with your color palette,\" said Rarity, sorting through her racks. She picked out a cream colored blouse and levitated it over to Applejack. \"Oh... dear... perhaps a bit <i>too</i> frilly... no matter, I'll just cut out the lace, add some starched collars... oh! And red buttons, oh you could simply <i>die</i> -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah appreciate it, Rares, but ah'm here fer a different reason,\" said Applejack. <i>This is it, sugar,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, dear? Oh, I am <i>so</i> sorry, I cut you right off, didn't I? Please, what were you going to say?\" Rarity turned around and batted her eyelashes. <i>Whoa nelly,</i> thought the earth pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah came here, to, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To, ask if... y...\" Applejack started to sweat. <i>Ask if you want to have dinner with me. It's not that difficult, sugar.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask if I? Spit it out, darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shoot, she's gettin' impatient.</i> \"Ask if you wanna ha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came to ask if I want help? Help with what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help with... preparin' food fer yer upcomin' social, yeah! Y'all will need somethin' to feed yer guests, and ah'm here on behalf of Sweet Apple Acres t' offer our top-notch services fer yer parties!\" Applejack grinned far too widely. <i>Celestia Damnit, Applejack.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to cater for my socials? Oh, Applejack, you are simply a <i>gem</i>! Pinkie Pie wanted to help, but I need something a little more substantial than cupcakes - oh, you are a <i>lifesaver</i>!\" Rarity threw her hooves around the earth pony, who was redder than the apples on her rump. Perhaps this trip wasn't such a waste, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, shoot, Rares, y'all know ah'd do anything t' help a friend in need,\" said Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity let go and looked at Applejack contemplatively. \"What do you say we meet tomorrow for lunch, and you can tell me all about the fabulous recipes you'll prepare for me... in the meantime, I still think that blouse will look smashing on you...\" Rarity gasped and her eyes twinkled. \"Puffed shoulders, that's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack stood by awkwardly while Rarity rummaged through her stocks, finding different things to improve the shirt. \"Ah'll just... be goin' now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, see you tomorrow, sweetheart!\" said Rarity, barely paying attention. Applejack backed out of the shop, then turned around, grinning ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sweetheart.</i> Well, maybe this wasn't such a waste of time after all.</span></div></div>",

Even though her crush, Rarity, was more well-acquainted to these fancy parties, Applejack was like a fish out of water when it came to these fancy galas, banquets, and other super-fancy gatherings that required a mare to dress up really fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, Applejack had to get some lessons from Twilight on how to behave in a very fancy party, especially this was the sort of lifestyle her crush was living in, the kind of society that Rarity herself had willingly embraced. So, if the cowgirl of a mare had to immerse herself in the Upper Class society in order to obtain Rarity's love for her....then so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Applejack, it wasn't exactly easy as she thought. After all, due to some of the treats and appetizers that these banquets had displayed out for consumption, it took a toll on AJ's appearance, making her weigh at an overall total of 270 pounds. Fortunately, due to building up some powerful muscles from Apple-bucking, Applejack could still move normally, despite the extra padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Applejack's drastic lifestyle change wasn't a complete loss. After all, Rarity had called her \"sweetheart\". And during the fancy banquet, Applejack wasn't aware of this at the time, but Rarity kept sneaking in glances at the orange Mare's thicker flankcheeks and frame, both with curiosity and an aroused feeling everytime the fashionista mare would look at the obese Applejack with her own two eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the banquet has ended and the guests had left for their homes, Applejack knew that she had to make her move now or never. \"Okay, Applejack. Ya' messed up first time 'round, it's now or never.\" She thought to herself, reminding herself that she needed to confess her love toward Rarity now, or never at all.</span></div></div>",

From there, combining the tension she was feeling and noticing that Applejack was just inches away from her, this made Rarity do something that nopony had saw coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she was acting out of instinct, Rarity lunged toward the rotund Applejack, forehooves wide open, as the she tackled the obese earth pony at her bulky abdomen, with the momentum causing Applejack to lose balance and fall on her back, with the white unicorn mare that was Rarity laying on the obese Applejack's fat-laden belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reaction, Applejack wasn't even expecting something like this from Rarity, which made the rotund orange pony even more surprised when she saw and felt Rarity wrapping her forehooves around the obese pony's fat belly, squeezing and holding all of Applejack's belly fat like a jiggling body pillow, as well as nuzzling her face into AJ's rotund abdomen, giggling in the process, almost as if the fashionista mare was enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity, what are ya' think you're doin'?\" Applejack said, confused as to why the one she had a crush on was snuggling her obese belly like some stuffed animal. In response to the rotund rather pony's confusion, Rarity stopped snuggling Applejack's bulky stomach, slowly getting down from the obese Applejack, displaying a beet red blush on her snow white cheeks, judging from what the rotund earth pony was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down and facing Applejack, Rarity began to nervously fidget with her own forehooves, still displaying a pair of crimson red cheeks and answered, \"I, um...I-I am deeply sorry f-for what you witnessed, sweetheart. B-But the truth is that I..I-I....I'm an FFA.\" Upon saying those last few words, Applejack saw Rarity's white face turn a pinkish-red hue out of pure raw embarrassment, as the fashionista mare turned her head, looking away from the obese earth pony almost out of shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite the very embarrassing confession, Applejack didn't understand what the word \"FFA\" had actually meant. In response to what Rarity had said to her, Applejack turned her chubby head to look at the embarrassed unicorn mare and asked, \"An F..F..A?\" \"It, um...It stands for 'Fat Filly Admirer'. I-I'm into fillies who are really REALLY f-fat, whether they're as big as you are currently, or as big as an ornate castle. I-I had never a-admit this corpulent fantasy of mine to anypony, n-not even S-Sweetie Belle or...m-my parents even k-know about it. G-Go ahead, call m-me a chubby chasing f-freak!\" Rarity answered, feeling emotionally distraught about confessing that she was into obese fillies to one of her five friends, sobbing and whimpering in the process from what she had did and said moments ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all of the ponies she had known, Applejack never expected Rarity to have such a...fatty fantasy. Then again, the obese earth pony could see from the look on Rarity's face and how the mare behaved, Rarity had a passionate love for being an FFA. But from seeing how humiliated Rarity had felt from telling her this, Applejack couldn't stand seeing her like this. So, in an effort to make Rarity feel better, Applejack slowly artist back up onto her hooves, despite her rotund frame, approached the upset fashionista mare and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, when the distraught Rarity felt Applejack's rotund frame being pressed against her own body, she was really caught off-guard. But as the corpulent earth pony wrapped her fat forehooves around the smaller unicorn mare that was Rarity, the fashionista mare felt....warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure she just revealed her deepest &amp; most treasured secret to one of her five friends, but when she felt Applejack embrace her in a big fatty mare hug, despite her cheeks still blushing, Rarity began to display a gentle squeamish smile. Then, Applejack began speaking to Rarity and said, \"Sugar, 'ya might have a thing for fat fillies, but 'ya ain't a freak in my eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Applejack stopped speaking for a short moment, as she felt her equine ears droop a bit and said, \"To tell 'ya the...the truth, Rares; Ah...Ah also have a d-dirty secret.\" From saying those words caused the obese Applejack to blush just as much as Rarity when the fashionista mare revealed that she was an FFA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on Rarity's end, this caught her attention, both reassuring her that she wasn't alone, as well as attracting her curiosity, wondering what Applejack's dirty little secret was exactly. From there, the fashionista mare turned herself around to face the obese earth pony in front of her, wiping some of the tears from her eyes with her forehooves and asked, \"Really? *sob* So, what is your secret, darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, instead of just confessing her crush on Rarity, Applejack quickly pressed the lips on her snout against the fashionista mare's lips, then toppled on top of the white unicorn, pinning Rarity down with the obese member of the Apple Family's own bulk and padding. Besides, they say that \"actions speak louder than words\" after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Rarity's reaction was that of pure shock and awe, almost as if her jaw just metaphorically dropped to the floor. But a few seconds after being immobilized by Applejack's thick soft padding, the kiss felt wrong....yet so right at the same time, which caused Rarity to slowly close her sapphire blue eyes out of bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after this chain of events, Applejack severed her passionate kiss with the unicorn mare, blushing even more as Rarity looked at the rotund earth pony on top of her and said, \"You...You're actually into dating mares, aren't you Applejack?\" At first, Applejack didn't say anything for a minute or two, blushing fiercely due to she was now at the point of no return. Then, Applejack let out a defeated sigh and replied, \"No, Ah...Ah'm not just i-into any mare, sugarcube. Ah...Ah, um....Ah-Ah'm into y-you....Rarity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom saying those words, it caused Applejack's chubby cheeks to blush even redder, until it spread out across the obese mare's plump face. From seeing how the rotund earth pony was reacting to confessing something as serious as love, Rarity could see from the furious blushing, the stuttering in her speech, and how passionate the kiss was, Rarity could see that what she had experienced definitely wasn't a farce; Applejack had this gigantic crush on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would explain to the fashionista mare why Applejack had attended various different banquets, galas, and many other gatherings for Equestria's nobility; she wasn't just doing this for the lavish experience that was the Upper Class, the corpulent earth pony was trying to bond and win Rarity's romantic affection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two mares, there was this odd moment of silence, but then, Rarity spoke toward the obese Applejack, who was still on top of the unicorn mare, and asked, \"So, um...h-how....how long did you have this gargantuan crush on me, A-Applejack?\" \"....Ever....Ever since 'ah s-started goin' to those f-fancy shmancy banquets with...with 'ya, sugarcube. A-At first, ah...a-ah thought it was all that rich pony food that was makin' me think that way, b-but recently, ah...ah began ta' have these weird dreams. Ya' know, about us, sleepin' together, kissin' together, gettin' married, startin' our own family. The kinda' stuff a stallion an' mare would do when they fall in love. But...that was when 'ah also started gettin' fat.\" Applejack answered, poking the right side of her thick jiggly belly with her right forehoof, causing her orange furry bulk to wobble and ripple from the action alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was an attractive mare to begin with, Rarity was more into falling in love with a stallion. However, due to her time with that dreadful Prince Blueblood, she thought what it would be like to have a romantic relationship with a pony of the same gender. After all, a same sex couple wasn't anything new, since she was aware that the DJ Pony mare known as Vinyl Scratch and the musician Octavia were already a lesbian couple. However, from seeing how serious Applejack was about being in love with the fashionista mare, Rarity had made up her mind and...</span></div></div>",

But from witnessing how deeply devoted Applejack was in having this gigantic crush on her (as well as being a good kisser), the fashionista mare began to understand that maybe having a romantic relationship with Applejack wasn't such a bad idea than she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Octavia was in a deep romantic relationship with Vinyl Scratch, so why not Rarity do the same with Applejack? Still pinned down to the floor by Applejack's obese frame, Rarity managed to pull her forehooves out from under the obese earth pony's fat-laden belly, as she then used her freed forehooves to grab AJ by her head, and quickly pressed the earth pony's snout and lips against her own, catching Applejack by complete surprise, yet also causing the obese earth pony's eyes to water out tears of joy, which usually doesn't happen often with a strong-willed mare like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut from what she had experienced just now, Applejack could only guess that her kiss from Rarity was a definite yes, as the intimate and passionate display of romantic affection lasted for a whole minute before separating, and Applejack asked, \"So...you're goin' ta' be my..M-Marefriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Rarity shed a tear from her right eye, as she slowly nodded once and answered, \"At first, I...I thought you were bluffing, darling. But...when you first kissed m-me on the lips with so m-much passion within that short moment, I...I-I knew that y-you were much serious about what you said. So yes, let's...let's be 'marefriends'...Applejack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying those words was more difficult than she had expected, as Rarity wrapped her forehooves around her lover's thick chubby neck, pulling the unicorn mare into Applejack's cushiony fat. And yet, for some odd reason, Rarity's fetish made her even more aroused, hugging the obese Applejack like some oversized teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after sealing the fate of their relationship, Rarity then noticed that she was still pinned to the floor by her marefriend's bulky frame, as she managed to get AJ's attention and asked, \"Y-You do realize that you're, um...still on top of me, right darling?\" \"Oh, erm...sorry 'bout that, hun.\" Applejack answered, just noticing that she was still pinning Rarity down with her fatty padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFigured that her newfound marefriend's body could use some air, Applejack gently waddled off of Rarity's body, being extremely careful as to not break anything, whether it was the fashionista mare herself or some very expensive antique. Despite her hind legs almost going numb and falling asleep, Rarity managed to stand back up onto her own four hooves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, after experimenting a bit to make sure that her limbs were still in good working condition, Rarity turned her head to look back at the obese Applejack, as the the unicorn mare let out a gentle but cheerful smile, now having a fat mare of her own to snuggle with. However, from looking at her newfound lover, Rarity then noticed....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although it was becoming a bit more obvious by the minute, Rarity could see that her marefriend was about ready to fall asleep, as Applejack's eyelids started to feel heavy, doing her best to stay awake despite fatigue setting itself in. \"It sounds like you are certainly ready to sleep, aren't you dear?\" Rarity asked, just as the rotund earth pony let out a loud yawn before speaking to the unicorn mare and answered, \"Uh..huh. *loud yawn*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaring about her newfound lover, Rarity decided to escort Applejack to the Carousel Boutique, since it was much closer than the Apple Family estate. Despite noticing a bit of the dirt and grime that was on her corpulent marefriend's fur, Rarity tried her best not to go all germophobic at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she was aware that the jobs on the Apple Family's farm sometimes require somepony to get a bit dirty, so Rarity couldn't blame Applejack for still being a little bit dirty. Overall, it was definitely a night to remember for the two mares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  ///<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after spending almost an hour of moving through the now empty streets of Ponyville, Rarity and Applejack finally made it to the fashionista mare's home, the Carousel Boutique. Getting through the wide double doors, Applejack entered her marefriend's 2 to 3 story home, despite her fatty bulk forcing her to waddle a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even though the somewhat long walk to Rarity's home made her even more tired, Applejack still struggled to stay awake until she got her rotund self into a bed. \"Here, let me help you.\" Rarity said, as she used her magic to carefully strip the strained dress off of the obese earth pony's bulky frame, unfastening the various clips and buckles that held up Applejack's Grand Galloping Gala dress, then moving said dress onto an empty mannequin and propping it there for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank 'ya *yawn* kindly, Rares.\" Applejack answered, feeling much more relieved now that her body didn't feel so constricted from her dress. \"Anytime, sweetie. After all, you didn't exactly look like you were comfortable in that itty bitty dress I made for you to wear so long ago.\" Rarity replied, gently patting the left side of her marefriend's fat belly with a forehoof, causing the fat on AJ's stomach to jiggle a bit on that side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after cleaning up Applejack's fur some, Rarity assisted the obese earth pony up the flight of stairs, as Applejack's bulky belly occasionally touched a step or two on the way to the second floor. Fortunately for the two marefriends, Rarity's younger sister Sweetie Belle was staying over at the Apple Family home with Applejack's own younger sibling Apple Bloom, along with Scootaloo, for the night, which gives Rarity and AJ some time to themselves for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite weighing almost 300 pounds, Applejack managed to get accustomed to her bulky frame, as she slowly got onto Rarity's lavish but very comfy bed. \"Whoa nelly!\" AJ said, reacting upon feeling how soft Rarity's bed was, despite becoming a giant walking pillow herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like my bed?\" Rarity asked, giggling a bit from her marefriend's reaction to laying in the unicorn mare's bed for the first time, just as she got herself dressed in her nightgown and sleep mask. From there, as Rarity walked over to her bed to lay down alongside her rotund lover, Applejack managed to turn her obese form around to face the unicorn mare, laid her chubby head on one of Rarity's pillows and answered, \"Ah mean, sure ah'm already a big huge pillow on hooves, but this....*giggle* Ya' bed's like a cloud, hun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do appreciate your compliment, dearie. But still....I think you're very very cute with all of that fat on you, Applejack.\" Rarity replied, as she leaned her head in to snuggle with her marefriend's rotund stomach, like hugging a large body pillow the size of two ponies. To the unicorn mare, it was a dream that literally came true before her very eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her magic, Rarity turned off the lights in the bedroom, giving both mares some shut-eye, just as the fashionista moved the sleep mask over her eyes to go to sleep, while Applejack slowly closed her eyes to finally gain some rest.</span></div></div>",

Ya' right 'bout one thing, Rares; Ya' definitely 'ave a thing for big fat fillies.\" Applejack thought, speaking upon reaction to seeing that what happened last night wasn't a dream; She had officially become Rarity's marefriend and vice-versa. And yet, from seeing how much the sleeping Rarity was enjoying the situation, Applejack couldn't help but have a small smirk crept along her slightly plump snout, just from how adorable the fashionista mare looked while sleeping on the obese earth pony's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from seeing how bright it was outside, Applejack was quickly reminded her of how late she was back at Sweet Apple Acres. Usually, she was one of the first ponies to wake up early to manage her family's farm, i.e. milking the cows, do a bit of Apple-Bucking, plow some of the crop fields, etc. This caused the rotund earth pony's ears to droop some as she thought, \"D'aw hayseeds, Ah'm late! Ah can't believe ah slept in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as Applejack was about to get out of Rarity's bed to head back to her home, she felt the sleeping fashionista mare subconsciously grab onto the rotund earth pony's fat stomach, almost as if she was subtly pleading for Applejack to stay in bed with the unicorn mare for a little longer. At first, from seeing this action alone made Applejack conflicted as to what she should do next. After all, she DOES represent the Element of Honesty, so this was a hard and difficult decision to make for the bulky earth pony.

Ah was just, um....nervous. Yeah, that's it!

In response, Rarity giggled a bit and answered, \"Maybe, darling. But I do know one thing for certain; You have developed quite a sweet tooth, Applejack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Rarity had said, Applejack realized that the fashionista mare was right; Ever since she started attending those fancy upper-class gatherings/parties, Applejack had developed a big sweet tooth, causing the orange earth pony to blush, just as she poked her large belly with a plump forehoof a few times, feeling how soft she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I still love you, Applejack.

However, there is only one way to know for sure, Applejack.\" Rarity answered, just as the rotund earth pony slowly moved her bulky frame out of the lavish bed and onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Rarity trotted around the bed until she was standing beside her rotund marefriend, as the fashionista mare looked back at Applejack, worried about their secret relationship, and said, \"I'll go on ahead and see who our 'guest' happens to be, alright sweetheart.\" \"*sigh* Alright, sugarcube. Just....be careful, alright?\" Applejack replied, as she felt Rarity deliver a kiss on her right chubby cheek before receiving a short but strong nuzzling from the fashionista mare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after giving AJ her affection, Rarity slowly walked out of the bedroom and down the flight of stairs, intent on finding out who would be visiting her at this time of the day when she hasn't even opened up her shop yet.

I, um...I-I was looking for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well I am glad to see you too, Fluttershy. But, what are you doing here so early, darling?

I cannot believe I almost had forgotten about it while I was with Applejack!\" Unfortunately for her, Fluttershy had just noticed Rarity's nervousness a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom out of concern for her friend, the yellow pegasus had a concerned look on her face, as she looked at Rarity and asked, \"Um, Rarity...are you, that is to say.....feeling alright there?\" \"Huh? Oh, oh yes, darling! I'm fine. I, um....I-I was just merely busy from attending a gala last night, hahahaaa. *nervous sigh*\" Rarity hesitantly answered, her voice cracking slightly out of nervousness, while her heart was beating a little faster, worrying if AJ was going to come downstairs and exposing herself to Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And just to make things worse, Fluttershy's vision was facing the side of the stairs, which meant that Applejack was going to be in direct line of sight of the yellow pegasus's vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Rarity, that was exactly what happened in front of Fluttershy, as the timid pegasus became fully aware of the much larger Applejack, taking in the sight before and only muttered, \"Oh. My.\" \"Oh hey there, Fluttershy. *nervous chuckle* What are ya' doin' here?\" Applejack replied, displaying a noticeable blush on her chubby cheeks while nervously adjusting her signature hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being taken by surprise in her friend's new bulkier appearance, Fluttershy spoke toward the obese Applejack and answered, \"Well, um....I-I was planning on spending some time  with Rarity at the spa this week. After all, we visit the spa every week. But, um....I mean, not to offend you or anything like that, but....Applejack....why are you, um.....so...f-fat?\" Understanding somewhat that she wasn't trying to hurt anyponies' feelings, Applejack first turned her plump head toward her marefriend Rarity, then back toward Fluttershy, as the corpulent earth pony let out a somewhat defeated sigh and said, \"Well...Ah guess we can't keep this a secret anymore, huh sugarcube?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it took a while to explain, both Rarity and Applejack had managed to confess to Fluttershy why the obese earth pony was in her current state and why she was in Rarity's home much earlier than the yellow pegasus. However, Rarity was more hesitant than her marefriend was, since it was her biggest secret she was confessing. After all, even though she was  revered as the bearer of the Element of Generosity, she wasn't exactly as honest as Applejack was, who was the bearer of the Element of Honesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough from Fluttershy's point of view, this was something completely unexpected from the fashionista mare, as she looked at Rarity and said, \"Oh. Oh my goodness, Rarity. I....I-I didn't know you were into something like this.\" \"*sigh* Yes, now you know why I'm greatly embarrassed by confessing such a thing to you or the others. I.... I-I feel like I am such a weirdo.\" Rarity answered, turning her head away from Fluttershy out of feeling ashamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sorry for her lover, Applejack walked/waddled toward the depressed Rarity, sat down on her fat flank, and wrapped her thick forelegs around the fashionista, pulling the unicorn mare into an obese pony hug, causing Rarity to be smooshed into Applejack's rotund but very soft belly. This in turn began to make Rarity feel somewhat better, as the unicorn mare then heard her obese marefriend speak to her and said, \"No, ya' ain't a weirdo, sugarcube. You're just.....different, but in ah good way, ya' know? Sure, bein' into fat ponies does sound  a lil' weird, but nopony's perfect. Ah mean, look at me! Ah might be the Element of Honesty and the best dang tootin' Apple-bucker in Ponyville, but ah also happen ta like mares more than stallions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing something like that from Applejack came as a big surprise to both Fluttershy and Rarity, as the rotund earth pony continued to hug the fashionista mare nuzzling her with a chubby cheek to show her love towards the white unicorn. Slowly but surely, Rarity began to feel much better and was purged from her ashamed depressed muck.....at least for now, of course. Though from seeing the two marefriends show their love toward one another, Fluttershy couldn't help but shedding a tear of joy, as she witnessed Rarity deliver a passionate kiss on Applejack's plump snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, Applejack remembered that she was running late on her chores back at Sweet Apple Acres, which made her more hesitant on accepting the fashionista mare's offer, where she spoke to Rarity and replied, \"Ah....Ah'm 'fraid ah can't join ya', Rarity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming both shocked and somewhat confused as well, Rarity raised a trim eyebrow toward her rotund marefriend, where she then realized what was making Applejack wanting to dent her and asked, \"....You don't want to come because you are worried about your chores back in Sweet Apple Acres.....aren't you?\" In response, Applejack nodded twice, causing her double chin to jiggle a little in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, knowing Rarity, Fluttershy understood quite well that the fashionista mare was a very persistent pony, especially when it comes to her friends. From there, Rarity slowly approached her rotund marefriend, where she then put a forehoof to Applejack's plump shoulder, gently swirling her hoof in a circle against AJ's fat, and then spoke toward the bulky earth pony as she answered, \"Applejack darling, I understand the commitment to your family, and I clearly am aware of the hard labor you endure to distribute the best apples in all of Ponyville, but.....I'm greatly concerned that you might run yourself ragged. I am well aware that you're quite a strong pony, but even somepony like you needs to understand their limits at what they can accomplish and what they cannot. So please......take a break from the chores and join us at the spa. After all, your chores won't be going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing what Rarity had said to her, Applejack knew that the fashionista mare did raise some absolutely valid points. After all, she might be one of the strongest ponies in Ponyville, probably one of the strongest in Equestria, but even she was well aware of her limitations, since the blubbery earth pony still remembers the whole incident that occurred when she restlessly tried to buck every apple tree in Sweet Apple Acres due to Big Mac's injury, which resulted in Applejack becoming exhausted, causing her to create several incidents, including making Pinkie Pie and numerous other ponies having food poisoning, scaring the living daylights out of a bunch of baby bunnies when she was aiding Fluttershy, and of course, the misfired launch of Rainbow Dash when she was attempting some new stunts to impress the Wonderbolts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Applejack was already quite aware of her limits. So, left with little to no choice, especially when it came to Rarity's persistence, Applejack let out a somewhat defeated sigh, then looked back at the fashionista mare and said, \"....Alright, Rarity. Ya' win, Ah....Ah'll go with ya' and Fluttershy to da spa.\" Upon hearing the corpulent earth pony accepting her offer, Rarity wrapped her forehooves around Applejack's thick fat neck, then gave the large country pony a quick kiss on Applejack's somewhat plump cheeks and then on her slightly chubby equine snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Don't worry, darling. I'm positive you'll have quite a wonderful time at the spa with us.\" Rarity replied, where she then let's go of the rotund Applejack, where she then guided the bulky earth pony out the Carousel Boutique doors, with Fluttershy following suit.</span></div></div>",

Although it was merely a simple trek from one location of Ponyville to another, there was no denying the fact that Applejack's established girth was somewhat of a surprise to some of Ponyville's denizens, as the rotund earth pony received an occasional stare or three, while she waddled alongside Fluttershy and her marefriend Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, after approximately 15 minutes of trotting through the streets of Ponyville, the 3 mares have reached their intended destination: The Ponyville Day Spa. Upon reaching the main entrance, Rarity opened the door so Applejack could enter inside, just as the bell that was connected to the door that notified the staff chimed repeatedly in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all 3 mares were finally inside the spa's interior, the near identical spa ponies, Lotus Blossom and Aloe, appeared before the trio, where Lotus Blossom then greeted Rarity with a brief hug and said, \"Rarity, darling! It is so delightful to see you and Fluttershy once again.\" \"Yes, I can say the same with you too, Lotus. Though this time around, I have persuaded Applejack to accompany both Fluttershy and myself here.\" Rarity explained, as Applejack blushed some out of slight embarrassment, using her trademark hat to cover up her face and snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Lotus Blossom and Aloe then took notice of the earth pony's blubbery shape, where Aloe looked at the obese Applejack and said, \"Yes, we have heard of Applejack's increase in weight quite recently. But still, its quite surprising to see her like this first-hoof.\" \"Anyway, getting back onto the topic at hoof, shall we proceed with the usual treatment, Rarity?\" Lotus Blossom politely asked, referring to the usual treatment the Ponyville Day Spa would deliver to Rarity, which included the following: Massages, Mud Baths, Seaweed Bath Wraps, Steam Rooms, Horn Filling, even a simple long dip in a hot steaming jacuzzi tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Rarity was fully aware that Applejack wasn't a regular customer for the Ponyville Day Spa, so she wasn't adjusted to all the treatments that both Rarity and Fluttershy would participate in.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although, as much as the fashionista mare felt very tempted to have her marefriend fully immersed in what the Ponyville Day Spa had to truly offer, Rarity had to force herself not to undergo such a route, feeling that this would most likely send the wrong kind of message to the rotund Earth Pony that was Applejack. So, in response toward what Lotus Blossom had asked mere moments ago, Rarity swiftly regained her composure, then calmly spoke toward the spa mare answered, \"...Yes, Fluttershy and I would like the usual treatment, Lotus. However, I would like to have Applejack here attend a Full-Body Massage, Mud Bath, and a nice, long, &amp; refreshing dip in the Jacuzzi. After all, this IS her first time being here, darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing such words from her beloved Rarity, Applejack began to blush a little in some form of embarrassment, seeing as how she wasn't actually accustomed to being pampered before. Of course, both Lotus Blossom and Aloe were very reassuring regarding the rather delicate situation at hoof, as Aloe spoke toward the fashionista mare and replied, \"Of course, Rarity! We'll be gentle on her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you would please kindly follow me, Applejack.\" Aloe said, speaking toward the blubbery Earth Pony with a calm, friendly, and reassuring tone in her voice. However, in her best attempt to reassure her bulky marefriend, Rarity laid a forehoof against the side of Applejack's large soft belly and said, \"Don't worry, darling. Fluttershy and I will join you shortly.\" Thanks to the fashionista mare's reassurance, Applejack followed Aloe into a nearby dressing room to change into some more suitable attire, waddling closely behind the Spa Pony in the process. From there, Lotus Blossom then guided both Rarity and Fluttershy into another dressing room to get changed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, both Rarity and Fluttershy exited the dressing room, now wearing towels wrapped around their equine frames, while still retaining use of their legs. \"I do hope that Applejack is alright.\" Fluttershy said, walking closely beside the fashionista mare. \"Well, we're about to receive such an answer, Fluttershy. Here she comes.\" Rarity replied, just as she then noticed Applejack waddling her way down the hall towards the fashionista mare and the timid pegasus. However, upon closer inspection, both mares began to notice several obvious things while Applejack approached them. Aside from her trademark Cow-Pony hat not present on her head, Applejack's blonde mane was undone from it's usual ponytail style, as the hair on her mane was let down and dangled off to the sides of her plump head and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Applejack's hair in it's current state, Rarity couldn't help but giggle a little out of finding the sight before her quite adorable for the rotund Earth Pony. However, it was also where Rarity noticed how small the towel was on Applejack, especially since the Ponyville Day Spa has never dealt with a customer of Applejack's size, weight, and bulk before until now. Doing her best not to offend her marefriend, Rarity then spoke toward a blushing Applejack and said, \"I must say, Applejack, your hair looks quite, um... beautiful, in such a manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks...Ah guess.\" Applejack replied, completely unsure if she should be feeling embarrassed or bashful from such an attempted flirt from the fashionista mare, just as Lotus Blossom then spoke up toward Applejack, Rarity, and Fluttershy and answered, \"Now then, if you girls would please follow me and we can begin the Massage.\" From there, the trio then calmly followed behind Lotus Blossom, while Aloe returned to the lobby desk to take up anymore customers that would drop by for a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, despite her rotund bulk and blubbery physique, Applejack was able to keep up her pace with both Rarity and Fluttershy, as Lotus guided the 3 mares into the bowels of the Ponyville Day Spa. From there, the spa pony led them to three sturdy massage tables, where they laid down stomach first, waiting for several masseuses to tend to them. However, due to her rotund features, Applejack had encountered some difficulty laying down properly on the massaging table, as her blubbery abdomen raised her off the table surface noticeably by a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the rotund Earth Pony managed to get herself comfortable, just in time for the masseuse ponies to arrive before them and began massaging Rarity, Applejack, and Fluttershy. Although both Rarity and Fluttershy were already well accustomed to such relaxing therapy, Applejack felt like she was in utterly pure bliss, feeling all of those tight knots in her muscles being unwound by the masseuse.</span></div></div>",

She had been able to grab a quick snack here and there, so she hadn't starved to death. But making herself a good, healthy meal took time, and time was one thing she hadn't had the last few weeks. As soon as she'd heard that Marie Quinn, owner of the largest modeling company in Equestria, was coming to Ponyville, she had kicked her ordinarily hectic schedule into overdrive. She didn't want a repeat of that whole Photo Finish mess, so she'd decided that she would model her designs herself this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the snack food she'd been sustaining herself with had taken a bit of a toll on her waistline, and she wasn't going to be able to get into <i>any</i> of her best outfits if she didn't manage to tighten...this...corset! She certainly couldn't let Marie Quinn see her like this; she'd die of embarrassment! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Rarity had been paying attention to her waistline, she would have known better than to start getting dressed with barely a half-hour before Marie Quinn was due to arrive.

Her corset was so tight that she could barely breathe, but that was a price she was willing to pay. She looked <i>great</i>, comfort be damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie Quinn, though she was the head of a modeling firm, didn't look like a model herself. She was shorter and heavier than Rarity, and her blonde mane was piled in a high bouffant. That particular manestyle would have looked terrible on most ponies, but Marie Quinn pulled it off through sheer confidence. Rarity had struggled to look her best; Marie Quinn <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome!\" Rarity said, much more breathily than she'd intended. She wasn't used to talking with all the air squeezed out of her lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Marie Quinn replied, looking around the shop.\"I was told that you make all these clothes yourself. Is that accurate?\" The blonde was curt but polite, and Rarity knew enough about the fashion business to be grateful for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she said as brightly as she could manage. \"Everything you see here is my original creation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me, why would a talented fashion designer like yourself--\" <i>Marie Quinn</i> just called her talented! Rarity was pretty sure that her sudden urge to faint was due to excitement, not a lack of oxygen. \"--want to work as a model?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, being a model is my <i>dream</i>!\" Rarity exclaimed. \"All the glamor, all the excitement! It's just the most wonderful job in the world! Of course, I adore designing, but one only has a short window in which one can become a model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am looking for a new model for a big upcoming campaign,\" Marie Quinn said, \"but I'm afraid you're a bit thinner than what I'm looking for.\" Rarity swayed on her hooves, her vision going momentarily fuzzy with shock (or maybe that was the lack of oxygen again). After all the hard work she'd put into making herself presentable, she was too thin!? She couldn't very well rip the corset off and show Marie Quinn her stomach, and besides, as soon as her schedule went back to normal, she was going to work the weight off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there anything I could do?\" she whined. She had been so excited when Marie Quinn made a special trip to scout her...it couldn't just end like this.</span></div></div>",

By the look of your build, you'd fill out nicely. Exactly the sort of pony I'm looking for.\" She must have been able to read the shock on Rarity's face, because she added, \"Otherwise, you don't really fit in with the campaign I have in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was taken aback. She absolutely hadn't considered this possibility. Why should she have? Before this moment, she had never heard of a job that required a model to <i>gain</i> weight. What's more, she wasn't sure she could do it. She put a lot of work into keeping up her appearance, and doing anything but keeping herself as trim as possible felt utterly foreign to her. In fact, she was holding back a shudder at the mere thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, she would probably never get another chance like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it,\" she said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie Quinn nodded. \"Excellent. You know your body, so I'll leave you to your own devices for, hm, two weeks, and then we'll see how you're doing. \"Welcome to Mare Quinn Modeling, Rarity.\" They shook hooves, and just like that, Marie Quinn was gone, and Rarity was left with the enormity of the choice she had just made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she did, of course, was to undo her corset and take several deep, calming breaths. It felt fantastic to be able to breathe normally again. When she no longer felt faint, Rarity examined her stomach in the mirror. It was noticeably bigger than she was used to, but not a lot--she doubted anyone who wasn't paying close attention would notice. All the same, she was happy to have a bit of a head start on gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's plan for the next fortnight was simple: since she'd started gaining weight by being too busy to watch her eating habits, she would try to keep up the same hectic schedule, but keep a better supply of fattening food available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving extra food around seemed to do the trick. Over the next two weeks, Rarity found herself grazing on sweets even when she wasn't exactly hungry, and she was doing her best not to be horrified by that. Oh, it wasn't so bad during the day, when she could munch and work without really thinking. At night, though, she had entirely too much time to think about what she was doing to herself. Only by constantly reassuring herself that she was only doing this to land a great modeling career, and that she'd certainly be able to drop the weight afterwards, was she able to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later, Marie Quinn returned to the shop.</span></div></div>",

The unicorn would have described herself as \"too nervous to even eat,\" but that was untrue: her pacing orbit took her between every single one of the treat dishes she had stashed around, and whenever she passed one, she snatched a few goodies to try and settle her nervous stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn point of fact, she was nervous <i>about</i> her stomach, and she hardly knew if she was coming or going. One the one hoof, her added chubbiness (which had settled mostly around her stomach and flanks) still didn't sit right with her. The little belly that had been barely noticeable two weeks ago had grown into something that drew the occasional astonished stare, though her friends either hadn't noticed or were too polite to say anything. It still wasn't very big, if she looked at it objectively, no more than an extra inch or two, but the reality hardly mattered when she <i>felt</i> like fat hog, did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hoof, though, getting a contract with Marie Quinn could change her whole life. Surely the glamorous life of a model was worth putting up with her awful belly, and of course Marie Quinn had only her best interests at heart. If Marie Quinn wanted her to be fat, well, then fat must be coming into fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's mouth was full of candy when the bell over her door rang; she swallowed it quickly before trotting over to meet Marie Quinn, all too mindful of the way her stomach wobbled. Marie Quinn's mane had gotten taller in the past fortnight, and for a moment Rarity forgot her own worries and just wondered whether she could possibly pull that style off--such was the power of Marie Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Ms. Quinn,\" she said, doing her best to hide her nervousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Rarity,\" Marie Quinn replied, her expression stern. \"Oh, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those two little words, Rarity's mind raced into overdrive.

Now she'd lose out on the modeling job <i>and</i> have to lose all this weight while depressed, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--ly been two weeks, but I admit that I expected more from you, Rarity.\" The unicorn had been so caught up in her panic that she hadn't realized that Marie Quinn was still taking. As she parsed out the older pony's speech, her blue eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you want me to gain <i>more</i> weight?\" she shrieked, rather louder than she had meant to. Marie Quinn just sniffed primly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously, Rarity. This--\" she patted the unicorn's stomach with one perfectly-manicured hoof. \"--is not nearly sufficient for what I had in mind.

I didn't know what you expected, so I decided to err on the side of caution!\" That was a lie, of course. She'd gained as little weight as she thought would be acceptable, but damned if she was going to let Marie Quinn know that she was anything other than enthusiastic about the offer to become a model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie Quinn's frown deepened a little. \"In that case, Rarity, I think it would be wise to set some firm rules.\" She circled the unicorn with a critical expression that made Rarity quake inwardly. \"You gained, what, 10 pounds in the last two weeks? I'm afraid that's not nearly good enough. In order for you to stay on track for this job, you're going to need to gain at least 40 in the next two, but from there we should be able to slow down a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite herself, Rarity let out a terrified little squeak. <i>40 pounds?!</i> That was ludicrous! And the <i>from there</i> was unsettling as well. What had she gotten herself into?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie Quinn must have known what Rarity was thinking, because she sniffed and said, \"Well, it wouldn't be so much if you'd done better. You just need to catch up.\" After another look at Rarity's horrified expression, she added, \"Are you sure you wouldn't like some assistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity shook her head in what she hoped was a very decisive manner. \"Oh, I think I'll be fine. As I said, I was simply unclear on what I was supposed to do. I doubt I'll have any difficulty now that I have a goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. But please understand, Rarity, that if you continue to disappoint me, I may not have a place for you in my upcoming campaign...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Rarity said, not quite able to meet Marie Quinn's eyes. \"I promise I'll do better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will see you in two weeks. Don't disappoint me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Marie Quinn was out of the shop, Rarity collapsed dramatically into a chair. 40 pounds in two weeks!? That was unthinkable!

She was quite good at following a plan when she needed to be--her daily beauty regimen was a testament to that. But she just didn't feel <i>inspired</i> to gain weight, and despite what she'd said to Marie Quinn, she wasn't sure that she could motivate herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a thought struck her: Maybe she could get one of her friends to help her!

Surely they would be supportive of her once they knew the excellent reason she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides, unlike whatever feeding regimen Marie Quinn had in mind, Rarity trusted her friends.

Rarity nodded, with an rather pained smile, and Pinkie went back to her loud whisper. \"Is the other game hornussen? Because I already know how to play that!\" To Rarity's utter bafflement, the earth pony produced a placard on a long stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Eventually, she pushed Rarity out the door (with a take-home bag of baked goods) to set up, which meant that Rarity wasn\u2019t even able to monitor her progress and make sure the party wasn\u2019t getting out of hoof. If there was one positive thing about her nerves, though, it was that she was used to eating when anxious, so at least she made good use of the dozen cupcakes Pinkie sent home with her\u2014and did it quickly enough that by the time she went back to Sugarcube Corner for the party, it was as if she hadn\u2019t eaten all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived, Rarity pushed the bakery\u2019s door open cautiously, unsure of what to expect. When she saw what was going on inside, she let out a breath she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d been holding. There was definitely a party happening in there, but it looked like a pretty normal one, without any indication that Pinkie had put it together with the intention of helping Rarity gain weight. When the white unicorn trotted inside, she thought she caught some of the guests staring at her, but she\u2019d felt like that ever since she started gaining. It might well have been all in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lot of food laid out around the bakery, even for one of Pinkie\u2019s parties, and the pink mare was particularly attentive about keeping Rarity\u2019s plate full, but those things were both much subtler than Rarity had expected. As the evening went on and nothing crazy happened, she found herself relaxing and genuinely having fun, even as she continued to munch on the treats Pinkie plied her with. The party wound down to the point where only Rarity, Pinky, and their four closest friends remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, she heard Pinkie whisper, \"Psst! Rarity! C\u2019mon up here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie wasn\u2019t anywhere near her, though\u2014that whisper had carried all the way across the room. The others stopped whatever else they were doing to look at Pinkie\u2019s display of anti-subtlety even as Rarity shuffled over, avoiding her friends\u2019 gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, everybody!\" Pinkie announced once Rarity was at her side. \u201cYou probably didn\u2019t know, but this party has a <i>secret purpose</i>: Rarity wants to gain weight!\u201d And she poked Rarity\u2019s tummy, causing it to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity went stiff, positively mortified. Her mouth dropped open, and Pinkie took the opportunity to shove a brownie in. Rarity struggled to swallow the unexpected mouthful, then said, \"Really, that\u2019s not necessary. I, uh\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was cut off as Pinkie fed her another brownie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t be shy, Rarity!\" the earth pony said brightly. \"We\u2019ve got a lot of treats left over for you! C\u2019mon, guys, who wants to help out?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rarity had already been eating more than she usually would at a party, and Pinkie hadn\u2019t been kidding about there being a lot of food left. The white unicorn was deeply unsure of her ability to finish it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait, Pinkie!\u201d Twilight cut in, levitating the next donut away before Pinkie could feed it to Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFantastic!\u201d Pinkie trilled. \u201cHere you go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed the tray of donuts to Twilight, who approached Rarity hesitantly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d the purple unicorn whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity nodded. \u201cBelieve it or not,\u201d she said, just as quietly, \u201cPinkie was telling the truth. I asked her to help me gain\u2014so I suppose I should\u2019ve expected something like this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had learned enough about being a friend by now not to comment on <i>that</i>, so instead, she said, \u201cThen, should I keep feeding you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Rarity said with a sigh. \u201cI <i>do</i> need to put some weight on, and it\u2019s not as though this night could become any more awkward than it already is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Twilight replied, still a little reluctant. \u201cBut if you want me to stop, just say so and I\u2019ll stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will,\u201d Rarity promised. She opened her mouth, and Twilight fed her the still-levitating donut, followed by the rest of the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it became clear that this was something Rarity was in on, rather than just some strange whim of Pinkie\u2019s, the other ponies were willing to help out as well, stuffing Rarity with an array of different treats well into the early hours of the morning. Despite Rarity\u2019s misgivings, she managed to eat every bit of food left over from the party. By the time she was done, she was so stuffed that she could barely walk.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rarity awoke the next morning to the sound of somepony knocking at her front door. She groaned and rolled out of bed, noting when her hooves hit the floor that she felt heavier than she had just the previous day. <i>And no wonder</i>, she thought as the memories of the previous night\u2019s feeding came rushing back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have time to dwell on it, though. She ran a brush through her mane and tail as quickly as was safe (brushing too quickly only led to split ends, after all) and hurried downstairs to answer the door, her belly swaying between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity opened the door to the boutique to see Applejack standing there, a forehoof raised to knock again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin\u2019,\" the earth pony said with a cheerful smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning,\" Rarity replied. \"My apologies for the wait, I\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slept in a li\u2019l, did ya? Well, it\u2019s no wonder, after last night. And on that note, I, uh, I brought you some breakfast.\" Applejack rubbed the back of her head uncomfortably as she moved aside to reveal the cartful of food she\u2019d brought with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity felt as awkward as Applejack looked, but she managed to say, \u201cWhy, thank you. That\u2019s very kind. If you\u2019d like to start bringing things in, I\u2019ll be out in a moment to help you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Applejack nodded and went to unload her cart, Rarity cleared off one of her worktables and quickly set it for a meal\u2014two places, though she wasn\u2019t sure if Applejack planned to eat with her. It was only polite. She couldn\u2019t imagine Applejack expecting her to eat anything after the previous night\u2019s stuffing. Even as the thought crossed her mind, though, she realized to her surprise that she <i>was</i> hungry, somehow. And that was just as well; by the time the two of them had fully unloaded the cart, the table was piled high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack helpfully slid a whole pie onto Rarity\u2019s plate, then stood back, smiling. \"Well, go on. Dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren\u2019t you going to join me?\" Rarity said, even as she cut a thick slice of the pie. It was a bit uncouth to eat before one\u2019s guest had been served, but the pie smelled <i>amazing</i>, and she was eager to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, Ah ate before Ah came over. This is all fer you. No need ta stand on ceremony on my account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s very kind of you, Applejack,\" Rarity managed to say before she couldn\u2019t help it any longer and started to chow down on the pie. It tasted as good as it smelled, and before she knew it, she\u2019d eaten the whole thing. She lifted a second one over to herself at the same time Applejack handed her a plate of fritters, but she just shrugged and alternated between the two treats. Her goal, if she wanted to gain enough weight for Marie Quinn, was to clear the table anyway, so order didn\u2019t matter, particularly when everything was so delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the unicorn managed to eat about two thirds of the assembled food before she had to pause to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, ya didn\u2019t tell us last night <i>why</i> ya want ta gain weight,\" Applejack said conversationally, though the look on her face suggested she\u2019d been waiting for a break in the gorging to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I suppose I didn\u2019t. Well, I have an opportunity to land a modeling job with a very influential designer, but this designer has some\u2026unorthodox ideas about the ideal model figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted you ta get fat, ya mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Rarity agreed. \"The amount she insisted I gain if I want the position is substantial, so I\u2019m grateful for the help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a pretty good idea what Applejack thought of the fashion industry, so she half-expected the earth pony to be judgmental of gaining for a reason like that, but all Applejack said was, \"Ah\u2019m just happy ta see somepony enjoy mah cookin\u2019 so much, no matter why ya want it. And on that note, would ya like any help finishin\u2019 the rest of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity looked over the food still on the table. She was indeed beginning to feel quite full, despite her resolve to eat everything presented to her. Letting Applejack have some of it wouldn\u2019t hurt the growth of her waistline too much, and it was the orange pony\u2019s food to begin with, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Go ahead,\" Rarity said. Applejack nodded, but instead of taking some of the food for herself, as the unicorn had anticipated, she took a slice of pie and stuffed it into Rarity\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph!\" Rarity\u2019s eyes widened with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are ya all right? Ah can be gentler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was going to say that she hadn\u2019t meant that she wanted Applejack to feed her, but she found her mouth already open and salivating a bit for the next bite. She closed it decorously and shook her head. \"I\u2019m perfectly fine. Please, proceed.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sometimes they\u2019d stay and feed her, sometimes they had too much other work to do and she was left to her own devices, but she was grateful to each and every one of them for the help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that help had certainly paid off. Rarity\u2019s stomach hung notably lower between her thicker legs and rump, and a double chin had fully formed under her plumpened face. If it wasn\u2019t for her still-immaculately-groomed mane and tail, she would scarcely have been recognizable as the slender unicorn she\u2019d been not so long ago. When she weighed herself the morning of Marie Quinn\u2019s visit, she found to her relief that she\u2019d gained 48 pounds, a little over what was required of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still nervous when Marie Quinn arrived and gave her a hard, appraising stare before even offering a greeting. But then the shorter unicorn smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good,\" Marie Quinn said, even as she continued to appraise Rarity\u2019s expanded figure, occasionally prodding her newly-acquired flab. \"This was much more what I had in mind when you said you\u2019d be willing to put on weight for this campaign. How much have you gained in the past fortnight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-forty-eight pounds, Ms. Quinn,\" Rarity replied, trying not to squeal with joy. From a pony as businesslike as Marie Quinn, a simple <i>you look good</i> was lavish praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie Quinn nodded. \"Good work. I think you\u2019ll fit this campaign after all. I\u2019ll have one of my assistants take your exact measurements, and then the shoot will commence in an hour or so. Here\u2019s the address,\" she added as she floated over a slip of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot? Forgive me, I thought this was for a runway show.\" Not that there was anything <i>wrong</i> with catalog modeling, but for all the effort she put in, Rarity felt she deserved to walk a runway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The runway show isn\u2019t until next season. In the mean time, I\u2019m doing a few print campaigns as a kind of preview. One doesn\u2019t revolutionize the fashion industry overnight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, I suppose,\" Rarity said\u2014although even if it hadn\u2019t, she certainly wasn\u2019t going to contradict Marie Quinn.</span></div></div>",

Her legs had thickened as well with a layer of pudge wrapped round them, transforming her once elegant walk into a waddle that only helped in adding to the jiggling of her belly. Her face had also filled out, plump cheeks framing her face along with an extra two chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to look in the mirror, Rarity\u2019s mind raced.

As she did this, Rarity\u2019s mind began racing with fears and worries. What if Marie Quinn decides she wasn\u2019t what the she was looking for and she had ended up gaining all this weight for nothing.

Can be done to thyself or another. Only usable once every thirty days.' How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it have any longing side effects?\" Rarity questioned. Upon hearing of the existence of a \"Pristine Spell\", Rarity was immediately eager to test it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...It doesn't say. My closest guess is that it would require a lot of maintenance to keep clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A minor sacrifice. Plus, you could always teach me how to use the spell on myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's a go, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Give me your best shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's eyes scanned the instructions as she assessed the actions and their difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhat complex...but with practice, I think you'll get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to try it on me first, just to get a grip on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be a good idea. If you want to do it now, step right there.\" She pointed her hoof towards a spot fifteen paces from her. Once Rarity was in position, she lowered her horn so it was pointing straight at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready.\" Rarity stood tall, accepting of the incoming magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then...3...\" Twilight's horn filled with magic, glowing bright purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2...\" A mauve aura surrounded Rarity, her fur tingling at the surrounding energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1!\" A constant beam from Twilight's horn silently and vigorously sailed from her horn's reserves towards Rarity, making the Aura pure white within contact. The white unicorn could feel her body be rejuvenated by the pure magic emanating through her body, as if she was bathing in a sea filled with comforting water that dissolved any filth or grime in her system and prompting her t-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><i><b><span class=\"clred\">K</span><span class=\"corange\">A</span><span class=\"cbyellow\">-</span><span class=\"cbgreen\">B</span>{c: teal}L</b></i></font></span><span class=\"clblue\">A</span><span class=\"cblue\">M</span><span class=\"cviolet\">!!!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth unicorns screamed in shock as a massive explosion sounded from above the library, rattling the entire tree and sending piles of books to the floor. The blast echoed on for nearly a minute as both unicorns were thrown to the floor in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was several moments of silence after the echoing resigned, only to be interrupted by the raspy cackling of a young pegasus entering the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that had to be one of my best sonic rainbooms yet! I bet everypony for miles hear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went silent upon realizing the library's disarray. Her eyes traveled around the room, then widened in surprise upon noticing the perturbed librarian standing inches within her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...heh heh...\" She gave a sheepish grin and chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow, <i>how many times have I politely asked you to please refrain from sonic rainbooms near the library?</i>\" She groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...lost count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight times! So how many other times are there going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow's eyes danced around the room before looking at Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you usually give up around fifty times.\" Rainbow laughed, but Twilight face-hoofed and went about replacing books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is serious, Rainbow! Most of my work here consists of testing spells and experiments that oftentimes require very delicate handling and steady concentration! Any distractions like that could seriously jeopardize a lot of hard work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow joined her friend in cleaning the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I thought your job was just to give ponies books and write library cards, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's far more than that, Rainbow! I also have to take in consideration the customer's knowledge, desires, and interests in order to give them a complete learning experience! Sometimes I have to do demonstrations or test spells to better understand the material I'm spreading, such as...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's eyes went wide with realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Rarity? We were just testing a spell right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow scanned the room and saw a door across the room with light seeping through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight went over to the door and knocked it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity? Are you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity?\" She repeated as she opened the door. \"Are you i...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow and Twilight gaped at the image before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe normally slim and styled unicorn must've had over a hundred pounds of fat injected into her. Her belly was now a large, round mass that hung just two inches above the ground, pressing against the interior side of all four legs and filling her underside as greedily as possible. Resting atop a large double chin, her head was fattened generously in the cheeks and jaw areas. Each of her upper forelegs was now eight inches in diameter, tapering into her fairly chubby calfs. But the show stealer was her flank, now her widest point and beating her wide stomach by three inches on each side, her hind thighs now at least a foot in largest width. Now twice times as wide, her new weight stretched her height to another six inches larger (Now 4'7\") and her length a foot longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmotionally, every ounce of shock and bewilderment was focused on the pony-size scale she stood on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2...231 pounds...\" She mumbled in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-R...Rarity?

How could a big blob of blubber like her ever hope to enter into high society? She would be a laughing stock! She slid down to sit, not noticing that the hard bathroom floor was significantly more comfortable than it should've been, as her mind continued to spiral through the usual 'No fat chicks' song and dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and Rainbow stood in the doorway watching their fat friend in stunned silence. Twilight's head tilted slightly up and to the left as she imaged the punishment for forced weight gain. Rainbow, on the other hand, was staring at the gigantic posterior before her. Not because she was attracted to it, of course, she wasn't into fat mares, but- 'Or any sort of mares at all!' She swiftly reminded herself -but it was surely the flabbiest flank the astounded athlete had ever seen. She continued to reaffirm her sexuality, Twilight mumbled something about becoming the fattest student in Magic Kindergarten, and Rarity took this opportunity to advance the storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Rarity raised a plump hoof and poked the bloated belly before her. It jiggled slightly, sending small ripples through the surrounding flab. With a growing grin, she poked at it again, this time chuckling at the unfamiliar feeling. It wasn't... So bad, she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up again, paunch swinging below her, and looked into the mirror, which was now several inches below eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat fashionista looked up into the mirror, admiring how her chubby cheeks framed her face so nicely. Behind her, the globular mounds of flesh that was her plot poked out from around her wide belly. At the sides, she could even see part of her own cutie mark! She shook it experimentally, giggling at the saucy feeling it gave her. 'Yes, this might just turn out alright after all...' she thought, before noticing a couple of colorful shapes behind her. She turned around to face her stunned friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you two?\" She inquired. Twilight continued to observe the ceiling while mouthing the words 'rag on a stick', and Rainbow continued to gape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow, dear, you simply must close your mouth, you'll start catching flies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow sputtered and broke out of her stupor. \"I- Sorry?\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm simply wondering if you're quite alright. Neither you nor Twilight seem to have moved in the last ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-uh-I've gotta go see ya later bye!\" Rainbow bolted out the front door, which swung shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How odd.\" Rarity stood stunned for a moment by the pegasus's fast exit, before turning to the other unicorn. \"Twilight?\" Twilight did not reply, so she stepped past her into the main room, her stomach growling quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door slammed open again. \"Twilight, I'm back!\" Called Spike, who was carrying a large bag of groceries which, upon spotting his curvacious crush, he dropped. An apple rolled towards her, which she picked up in her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Rarity? What happened to you?! Are you feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese unicorn simply laughed. \"Of course, Spikey-Wikey! I've never felt better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you-you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity ignored Spike's stuttering and turned her attention to his groceries as her stomach began to protest its intolerable emptiness. \"May I have one?\" She asked, holding the apple aloft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-y-you're...\" He continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was close enough to a yes for Rarity, who popped the apple into her mouth, chewing somewhat loudly and swallowing with an audible gulp. Wiping a bit of juice off her chin, she grabbed another item from his bag, and another and another, until she had devoured the entire load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quiet burp, she blushed. \"I'm so sorry, Spike, I seem to have gotten away from myself. I'm afraid I don't have any money on me to pay you back, though. Perhaps I'll sew Twilight a new dress to make up for it.\" She paused. \"Oh, but I'll need to make some adjustments to my clothes first...\" An imaginary light bulb illuminated her flabby face. \"No, wait- An entire new line! Yes! Big and beautiful, here I come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Rarity turned and waddled through the open door, wide flanks jiggling as she trotted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her friend's fat ass recede into the distance, Twilight awoke from her daydream, which had illuminated her to the troubles the ponderous pony was sure to face. \"Rarity!\" She gasped, grabbing a number of books in her magic, \"Come on Spike! We need to find a way to fix this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but Twilight!\" He sputtered, breaking free from his stupor, \"She's so happy! A-and beautiful!\" He added, somewhat quieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing, Twilight thought for a moment before answering:</span></div></div>",

Spike and Twilight watched as Rarity waddled outside through the front door, who waved goodbye as she departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I could get used to this...\" Spike said with a content tone. Twilight merely sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next week, Rarity remained just as chipper about her weight gain. Her other three friends, although astounded and perplexed, soon came to accept Rarity for the mare she now wanted to be. The same couldn't be said for the rest of the town, though, who fired hundreds of eyes staring in stupor at the obese unicorn waltzing by, sometimes snacking on a slice of cake. Rarity would always respond with an impenetrable cheer, completely oblivious to any harsh snicker or whisper, as if she thought most of them were ogling her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...which a small population actually were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, another strange turn for the unicorn was her appetite. The formerly lean mare would have normally eaten carefully and with reserve, always acknowledging what she ate and how she ate it. However, a lot of that will started to dwindle. Rarity would begin eating more with less reserve, particularly junk food. Sometimes, bystanders watching her eat would start to wonder whether or not she knew she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this only served to blimp her up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Rarity awoke with a stretch, pulling off her sleeping mask and letting in the sunlight. She was met with the sight of her mountainous stomach, colored red by the bedspread. Rarity smiled and sighed in content as she proceeded to rub her large belly with her forelegs, loving the prickly feeling of the blanket on her bloated arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a glorious day!\" She cheered with enthusiasm. With surprisingly less effort than expected, the rounded unicorn proceeded to roll herself off the mattress and onto the floor on all fours. Her stomach had grown to the point where it pressed against the ground and her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity proceeded towards the door, looking forward to her daily...</span></div></div>",

As she crept through the kitchen door, her belly and flank temptingly rubbed against both sides of the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, as Rarity proceeded to cook breakfast, she could hear the sound of hoofsteps approaching from the stairs. She turned to see her little sister, Sweetie Belle, whom from her perspective seemed to recently start to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Sweetie Belle! Ready for some Breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Yeah, sure!\" Sweetie Belle was yet to completely come to grips. Rarity gave a nod and turned back towards her work. Sweetie Belle walked to the table and pulled out a chair for herself, which she climbed on top of. As she watched her rather busy sister cook, she cocked an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are Mom and Dad coming over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I know of. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...just a lot of food there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Sweetie Belle, there isn't wrong with a mare pandering herself a <i>little</i> bit, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Sweetie Belle fell silent as she gave up her argument, in light of the past week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, Rarity approached the table with twelve plates hovering around her, one of which she gave to Sweetie Belle. She then seated herself with a metal folding chair, which even then groaned and creased under her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when do you eat pancakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since two days ago.\" Rarity said as she jabbed her fork into her stack. The two shared a somewhat average breakfast together, what with Rarity trying to ignite some small talk, but Sweetie Belle started to grow more silent as Rarity's forkfuls began to grow bigger. Rarity herself stopped talking as she seemed to get lost in her meal. Once her first plate was finished, Rarity immediately attacked another, catching generous mouthfuls on her fork and stuffing them into her mouth. Rarity constantly moaned in delight with her cheeks distended, her stomach noticeably distending with every swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle by that point had stopped eating, watching in stunned silence as her massive sister scarfed down that plate quicker than the prior.

For several minutes this went on in silence, save for Rarity's uncharacteristic scarfing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at last, Rarity had finally crammed the entirety of her meal into her tight stomach, which she rubbed with her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that was a wonderful breakfast, What say you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure...\" Sweetie Belle replied awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!

It sounded as if the contents of her stomach were bubbling up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but Rarity's eyes widened further as her stomach began to blow up further, but this time with fat instead of food. As Rarity's rear end began to droop over the sided of her chair, it finally gave way and was flattened beneath her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle stared on in horror as her sister inflated in front of her like a balloon, growing bigger and bigger right before her eyes. Even while seated, Rarity's head was growing closer towards the ceiling as her fat surged out from beneath her, an astounded look on her broadening face the entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Rarity's horn started pressing into the ceiling, however, her expansion started to slow down until it had stopped entirely. She still observed her body with the same look of shock across her obese face. She had to be at least 9 feet tall while <i>seated</i>, and her massive rear end was just as wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's long, massive arms felt at her globular stomach, now a 10-foot saggy sphere of jiggly, white flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-R-R...Rarity?....A-Are y-you alright?\" Sweetie Belle stuttered, barely able to find any suitable words.</span></div></div>",

No one is awake to listen...<br>\r\nNo one but a lone white unicorn.<br>\r\nRarity had slept wonderfully the night before. With her business on the rise, she had to be very organized with her schedule. Only 6 hours of sleep, then up at sunrise to prepare her shop. Work for 10 hours, in bed by 9, and a good amount of socializing packed in. As she sat up stiffly in bed, she glanced at her flank, finally proud of the truth.<br>\r\nFor years, Rarity had been known as the fashionista queen. Her dresses sold well, and her diamond pieces were exquisite. All was going well until she was sued for copyright infringement.<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Rarity had lied to the world. She was not a designer - all of her designs had been stolen from other ponies. She had invented the story of the diamond cutie mark, and slightly altered her flank to her liking. Though she did have wonderful taste, her real talent lay in a different kind of taste:<br>\r\nA taste for <i>chocolate</i>.<br>\r\nHer cutie mark had originally been three diamond-shaped chocolates, but before anyone could see, she had dyed them blue. Now, however, she was proud of her talent, and had transformed the Carousel Boutique into the <i>Chocolatier de La Ville du Cheval</i>. She specialized in dark chocolates with rich fillings, and always gave free samples.<br>\r\nThis morning, however, she found it a little difficult to get out of bed. She glanced down at her stomach. It had become a bit pudgier recently, but the other sweet specialists of Ponyville had assured her that a few extra pounds were to be expected in the candy business. It wouldn't be noticeable, they said. Rarity put a hoof to her tummy. It sank in just a little. <i>Not noticeable</i>, said the voices in her head.<br>\r\n\"Of course, Rarity. Nothing shameful about a few extra pounds. Not noticeable at all,\" she thought aloud. It would just take some getting used to. She pushed herself up off her bed and put on her slippers. She would wait to freshen up before the shop opened.<br>\r\nDownstairs, Sweetie Belle was waiting with breakfast. She had gained her chocolate-selling cutie mark after selling a bag of caramels, and proudly sported a chocolate coin, but it hadn't improved her cooking skills in the slightest. Breakfast was a charred mess. However, Rarity was not discouraged.<br>\r\n\"Oh darling, not this again. Come, I'll teach you to cook a proper breakfast,\" said Rarity. Sweetie Belle brushed off the insult and instead focused on learning to cook.<br>\r\n\"What are we gonna cook, Rarity?' she asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, we let's see, how much time before shop opens up...\"<br>\r\n\"Rarity, it's a Wednesday. We're not open on Wednesdays,\" said Sweetie Belle.<br>\r\n\"Is it now? I could've sworn yesterday was Wednesday,\" said Rarity, glancing over at their calendar.<br>\r\n\"Rarity, you've been really forgetful lately. Are you feeling okay?\" asked Sweetie Belle.<br>\r\n\"Of course I am, darling. I've never felt better. Now, let's get cooking, shall we?\" said Rarity with a smile. Sweetie Belle grinned in return.<br>\r\nWith nothing to do but cook, Rarity and Sweetie Belle spent most of the morning cooking every breakfast recipe they had. By lunch time, the kitchen was full with delicious meals and wonderful smells. Rarity had been much more patient with Sweetie Belle since she had revealed the truth, and the two had prepared an enormous feast.<br>\r\n\"Well done, Sweetie Belle! You did an excellent job,\" said Rarity. Her eyes fell over countless dishes: eggs benedict, French toast, broccoli and cheese omelettes...<br>\r\n\"What are we gonna do with all this food, Rarity?\" asked Sweetie Belle.<br>\r\nRarity's stomach growled. She hadn't had a bite to eat since the day before. \"We're going to eat it, of course!\" exclaimed Rarity.<br>\r\n\"Eat it? You mean... <i>all of it</i>?\" Sweetie Belle looked at the numerous plates. They covered all of the counters, tables, and windowsills. She had to push Opal out of the way to stop her from getting to them.<br>\r\n\"Well, why not, darling? There's no work today, why not have a little extra fun?\" and with that, she magically picked up a plate piled high with pancakes and stuck one in her mouth. As she chewed, she turned towards Sweetie Belle and gave a huge smile. Sweetie Belle smiled halfheartedly back at her, and followed suit.<br>\r\nRarity sat in a chair, moving the plate of sunny-side up eggs on it out of the way. As she was about to place it on a counter, she thought better of it, and instead. took a few eggs off of the plate and onto her own. She gobbled them up happily, giving plenty to her sister, who wasn't nearly as hungry as Rarity. Suddenly, she got up, claiming that she had to help her friends get their cutie marks, and rushed out the door. Rarity was left alone with a truckload of food.<br>\r\nIt didn't stand a chance.<br>\r\nShe sat back in her cushioned armchair, her legs sprawled out. This was her time alone: just her and the food. Why not have a little snack? She savored each bite of each dish, chewed every bit thoughtfully. Her stomach swelled. It had never taken in that much food when she was in the dress business. As she continued eating, she leaned further and further back, accounting for the size of her rapidly growing belly. Most of the weight was going to her stomach, and it was showing. Rarity's chair was making strange noises, but she took no notice. She was too happy with the delicious flavors. She was so hungry. Why had she run away from the food business? This was glorious! She slipped out of her chair and onto the floor so that she wouldn't be so uncomfortable. <br>\r\nChew, swallow, chew, swallow. Crispy waffles caramelized in syrup with soft, melted butter. Chew, swallow, chew, swallow. The size of her stomach was pushing apart her legs, and she lay on her back as she brought more food to her mouth. Chew, swallow, chew, swallow, chew, swallow. She had moved onto the sweeter treats now: Pinkie Pie's fantastic eclair recipe, drizzled with her own decadent chocolate sauce. It smeared all over her shiny white coat, but she didn't care. Chew, swallow, chew, swallow, chew, swallow, eat, eat, eat... all she could think about was how delicious each dish was. Her stomach was telling her she was full, but she didn't care. She didn't care about anything except these fluffy croissants with a savory marmalade. Chew, swallow, chew, swallow - stop.<br>\r\nShe moved her hoof to the right, where she had been putting each dish. There wasn't one there. She sat up - or tried to. She suddenly noticed the size of her stomach. It was a great deal larger than this morning - about the size of a large filly. Her flank was larger too - the three chocolates had stretched, and each was bigger than her hoof. She tried pushing herself up, but to no avail. Gasping for breath, she tried to put her feet on the ground, but she couldn't even see her feet. Rarity began to panic. Finally accepting that her body was incapable of getting herself back up off the ground, she used her magic to levitate herself back on her feet. She surveyed the kitchen.<br>\r\nPlates were lying everywhere. Crumbs, forks, knives, everything - but all the food was gone. She had eaten every single meal.<br>\r\nShe patted her stomach. It was immense, and she could barely stand on her feet, let alone walk. It really had all gone straight to her gut. That was when she noticed her heavy breathing. She felt at her neck. She must have had three chins. She looked at her hoof, and it was covered in chocolate, syrup, egg, and lots of other bits of meals. As she craned her neck to see her back, she saw that it was similar all over. She was coated in residue. She did the only thing she could think of, and began routinely cleaning up the kitchen. Washed a plate, place it in the cupboard. Wash, place, wash place...<br>\r\nAbout halfway through, Rarity noticed something strange. She couldn't put her hoof on it; she had been effectively cleaning, the plates were in the proper cupboard, what was it? She scratched her chin in confusion, and realized that she had a piece of chocolate in her mouth. She took it out, and looked down. As she had been washing she had been eating chocolate bars in a trance-like state. There were now a good many chocolate wrappers on the ground. Rarity spat out the chocolate and was about to throw it away, but thought better of it. What a waste to throw out such nice chocolate. She finished the chocolate and her cleaning as fast as she could, hoping that no one would stop by.</span></div></div>",

She was currently tied and carried by one of the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet pony!\" Rover shouted back, \"We are taking you to our Alpha. Underground kingdom needed you for gems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity kept yelling until someone shoved a piece of cloth in her mouth. Throughout the journey, she kept wiggling and muffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter travelling for hours since she was first ponynapped, she does not know the way to get back home if she could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here pony,\" Rover presented her to the underground kingdom. Most building were built out of stones and the gems were used for utilities. The biggest building is the giant stone castle in the middle of the kingdom that is decorated with gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Alpha want you,\" the guard carried her all the way to the entrance of the castle, \"King need see pony. Pony can show gems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance opened and brought to the dining room. The guard removed the cloth but kept her tied to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me back home! I have friends and family looking for me!\" Rarity yelled at the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for that. Do not be alarm. I am very sorry how they treated you. They're not the smartest of the pack,\" Rarity looked toward the voice it coming from and found a groomed white diamond dog with the fanciest royal apparel, \"Please calm down and I will explain what is going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity calmed down and greeted the king, \"Sorry how you see me like this. If I was going to meet a king, I would have wear a dress. Unfortunately being ponynapped does not give me time to prepare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king laughed as he untied her, \"Like I said, sorry about that. When I ask for somebody who can detect gems, I do not mean to kidnap them. Just give me a fresh start. My name is King Alpha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Rarity,\" she bowed, \"I am sure you do not mean any harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for understanding. I would like to have a nice chat but something urgent that only you can solve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What seems to be the matter?\" Rarity was invested in the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gems were going dry in my area. Our gem detecting technique was not efficient and we need for our utilities. We are consuming more than the gems are being produce. We are currently in a shortage and we need somepony like you to save us. If you can't, we all have to move and leave our homes behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Rarity gasped in the situation, \"I see you are in dire need for one. As the element of generosity, I would help you as much as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great,\" the alpha king shook her hoof as his tail wagged wildly, \"It would save us from destruction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry that our currency won't work with yours. So your reward I give you this instead,\" he pulled out a feeding bag and put a paw into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole arm went deep into the feeding bag. That was impossible as the size of that big is as big as a hoof. Just big enough to fit around somepony's muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go,\" he presented her a beautiful cupcake. It look like it was sculpted by a master. Not a crumb out of place, \"I hope this cupcake would pay for your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity stared in wonder of the cupcake and took a nibble. Her pupils went dilated and gobbled the whole cupcake to the very last crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was incredibly delicious,\" Rarity licked the crumbs off her lips, \"Why do you get this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. It was passed down from generation to generation. We do not know the origin of it. I hope you would aid us with this dilemma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly would!\" Rarity exclaimed, \"The food were impossible to pass up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Alpha and Rarity made an agreement. He would provide the food as she would detect any gems in close proximity. The lead guard guide her to the guest room with the best services and facilities for her to rest for the night. While she was gone, King Alpha was chuckling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got her. It was extremely good luck that I stumble upon the feedbag. To us it taste like cardboard but to her it is heaven. She couldn't leave us as this feedbag's food was so perfect that it make any other food taste like garbage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Alpha grinned as he saw her change over time. When she first woke up, she tried to make herself a light breakfast with tea. However, all the food she made just taste weirdly plain. The king offered her his food and she devoured it like a beast. While exploring the caves for gems, King Alpha would reward Rarity with more food after finding a cluster of gems. Every time she thought of going back home even for a visit, King Alpha would persuade her to stay longer and give her a large meal which made her forget what she was thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger she got, the more pampered she would receive. The maids would massage, bath and feed her as the guards would carry her wherever she needed to be. She got really efficient in using the gem detecting spell that she can find them from miles away.

Fluttershy nodded, and began working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished, the girls all sat down, and ate their meals. Fluttershy sat down, exposing her still big belly. Sweetie Belle, who was closest to Fluttershy, poked her belly, and said, \"You have quite a belly there, Fluttershy. I didn't think a single pony'd be able to eat that much in a single setting!\" Fluttershy blushed, \"R-really? I really don't eat that much here... I spend most of my money keeping my animals satisfied, so I guess I never noticed my large appetite.\"<br>\r\nApplebloom then had an idea in her head, \"Oh! I know how we could get our Cutie Marks! Cutie Mark Crusader Feeders! An' Fluttershy, with her big appetite, could help us!\" Fluttershy's eyes widened, and after a collective of 'Yeahs' and nods from the other Crusaders, Fluttershy said...</span></div></div>",

The Cutie Mark Crusaders cheered, and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, they collected all the food that was edible in the house in a big pile on the table. Fluttershy drooled at the potential delicious meal she would have this day. \"Open wide!\" The three Crusaders say in unison, as they feed Fluttershy some Pie they found in her fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the food was devoured, Fluttershy had a much larger belly. It now reached halfway to the ground sitting down in her chair. \"Oooh... that was so good...\" Fluttershy said, shaking her large, stuffed belly. But when the CMC looked at their flanks, there was no Cutie Mark. \"Hmm... maybe we just need to make her fatter!\" Scootaloo offered. They all nodded, and took off to Ponyville in search of more food for Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they returned, they came back with 3 wagons full of Sweets and Cake. Fluttershy immediately rushed towards the Wagons, and began to eat them all ravenously. \"Hey! We need to feed you to get our Cutie Marks!\" Applebloom complained. But then Sweetie Belle responded to Applebloom, \"It's not that bad. Maybe we can help her, I know a spell that can increase the amount of weight Fluttershy gains, which could speed up the process.

She loved all wildlife, and often thought of the animals around Ponyville as friends just as other ponies were. And recently she had been happier than ever. Why? She was always surrounded by animals, it was true, but lately she had been able to connect even with the more ornery critters around. Badgers and stray cats, even Opalescence and Angel had been ready to cuddle up to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the thing. Fluttershy had always enjoy cuddling, even if she was usually too frightened by other ponies to enjoy a hug. And recently, it seemed she had become more cuddly. It was no surprise, really. Getting closer to Pinkie Pie meant more sweets and parties, AJ loved to cook big family meals when she had guests over, and her other friends were all more active than her, even Rarity. So, in keeping up with her friends' diets, Fluttershy had found herself with rather a decent amount of fat on her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she had been concerned. What would Rarity think? Yet the dashing white unicorn still complimented Fluttershy from time to time on her appearances, the pegasus remembered with a blush. And her other friends? AJ was a stocky earth pony, Pinkie Pie had a certain amount of chub on her from her sweets, Twilight wasn't exactly fit... and Dash seemed to treat Fluttershy as off limits when it came to teasing. The speedster had been Fluttershy's personal protector growing up, after all. So her friends all seemed to not mind her rising weight. Still, Fluttershy realized she was at the tipping point, as it were. She looked at herself now, the way her pudgy round belly was squashed against the ground, rolling out from underneath her and giving an excellent pillow for the family of bunnies currently sleeping against her. She really was starting to enjoy this. And given how little she flied, it wouldn't really impact her life anytime soon. But she wasn't sure...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Surely a little more weight wouldn't hurt? Besides, while Fluttershy had never had problems with her figure, she was sure she could cut back if need be. After all, Rainbow Dash always made it look easy to stay in shape, so perhaps she could help Fluttershy, if it came to that? Either way, Fluttershy figured her animal friends deserved the comfort, and set about giving them a little extra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obviously easiest way to gain some extra weight would be to follow the path of the heaviest mare in their circle of friends, Pinkie Pie. Pinkie was rotund, not fat outright but definitely on the heavy side. It didn't seem to ever slow her down, which now that Fluttershy thought about it was an encouraging sign. Once she was done tending to her animal friends she trotted into town, deciding to visit Sugarcube corner for lunch and get a start. She was rather surprised to find almost nopony else about. Wasn't the corner usually more busy this time of day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy! Just the pony I was looking for! Well, kinda.\" Pinkie Pie greeted Fluttershy as the mare entered. The pink pony wore a huge grin on her face, and something made Fluttershy pause. Pinkie was sometimes a bit loud, and a bit scary, and something seemed to be up. She was looking for her? Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello Pinkie Pie. Did you need help with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guessed it!\" Pinkie replied, rounding the counter. \"I've been working all week to prepare for the Great Equestrian Bake-Off, and nopony seems to want to help me!\" Pinkie complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bake... off...?\" Fluttershy asked. Pinkie whipped out a flyer (from nowhere! Fluttershy knew better than to think too hard...) and showed Fluttershy what she meant. The flyer told of a giant cooking competition to be held in Canterlot, judged by the royal pony sisters themselves! Apparently it was the competitions' first year, but they were accepting all competitors and there was both a title and cash prize at stake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! I asked my other friends but they were all like 'You'll ruin my figure, Pinkie!' and 'I already ate four cakes, Pinkie!' and 'Please don't eat me, Pin-' whoops, that one's from a different script.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you need me to taste test?\" Fluttershy guessed. Wait, when had Pinkie taken the flyer out of her mouth? Where had it... oh, nevermind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Please please please, Fluttershy.\" Pinkie gave her wide, shimmering doe eyes, doing her best to look like a begging puppy. Fluttershy loved begging puppies. And besides, she hadn't exactly come in here for a light meal to begin with. Perhaps this would be a good way to start with her little, as Twilight would call it, 'experiment'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, okay Pinkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Pinkie rushed behind the counter, pulling out a decorated chocolate cake with berries stuck in the frosting. Fluttershy didn't exactly have much of a sweet tooth, but she did enjoy fresh fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you have to eat a whole slice, okay? That's the rules.\" Pinkie cut a piece off and pushed it towards Fluttershy, who trotted up to the counter. Taking a fork in hoof (who had designed these things?) she took a bare nibble. Ooh, that was pretty good. Then a second nibble. Despite how long it took the pegasus pony, Pinkie watched ecstaticly, never losing attention. Finally Fluttershy finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... nice.\" She said sincerely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice?\" Pinkie asked. Fluttershy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not, say, super-extra-mega-wowee-wow-wow deliciousness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, um, I guess maybe it was all that too....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Pinkie didn't seem to have heard her. \"Well, we can try again. And again, and again! This is going to be fun, Fluttershy!\"</span></div></div>",

They had moved to the kitchen as Pinkie had had to make more cakes, and no matter how good Fluttershy insisted the last cake was, Pinkie didn't seem satisfied. It was like she expected the cake to be some kind of religious experience or something. And sure, one slice didn't seem like a lot, but Fluttershy had eaten the equivalent of at least six whole cakes, maybe more. Sitting on the kitchen floor as she was, her bloated belly rested on the floor between her legs, forcing her to lean back in an unnatural fashion to give it more room. Before today, she hadn't known anypony (besides Pinkie Pie) could eat this much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're so close, Fluttershy! I can taste it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can, *eep*, I\" Fluttershy was interrupted by what had to be the daintiest burp in Equestrian history. She blushed brightly at the uncouth display, but Pinkie hadn't seemed to noticed, which was a relief of sorts. Pinkie looked across the kitchen, which become a mess of flour, frosting, egg shells, and so on. She rubbed her chin in thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we aaaaare low on some ingredients.\" she said. \"Thanks so much for your help, Fluttershy!\" The pink pony reached over and grabbed Fluttershy in a hug. Fluttershy whimpered at how tight her belly was. And with Pinkie squeezing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Buuuurp!* A much less dainty belch escaped from the pegasus. She turned as pink as her mane, throwing her hooves up to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh I'm so sorry Pinkie I didn't mean to please don't be mad I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee, good one Fluttershy!\" Pinkie grinned as she let go of Fluttershy. The timid mare stared with wide eyes at the earth pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Pinkie replied, blinking rapidly. \"It's a compliment to us chefs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, w-well, I, I should get going...\" Fluttershy tried to get onto her feet, failing at first as she underestimated the weight of her belly. With a heave she got off the floor, finding her belly swaying at knee-level. Her legs quaked at the weight, and despite all the sugar, she was already feeling lethargic. She was sure she could make it home, but it was already getting late and she'd probably need to go straight to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Fluttershy!\" Pinkie called.

She stopped at the top of the stairs and let Fluttershy's hoof go, which had her fall to the floor, holding her stomach and groaning in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry Fluttershy!

Fluttershy got in the bed as Fluttershy turned the lights out and got on her side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Pinkie, I could just sleep on the floor if there's not enough room.\" Fluttershy offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah it's fine!

As the figure drew closer to the moonlight, Gummy could see that it belonged to a rather pudgy Fluttershy who appeared to be sleepwalking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gummy knew that waking sleepwalkers was bad news, it was certainly awkward to have the pony looming above his bowl standing in place. <br>\r\nWith her eyes closed, Fluttershy slowly lowered her head inside the bowl and began to delicately sniff at the water. <br>\r\nWithout warning Fluttershy's tongue began to test the waters, lapping up Gummy's water into her mouth with vigor. It wasn't long before Gummy noticed that the original water level had decreased significantly, and more noticeably, Fluttershy's figure began to show the effects of her distended drink. <br>\r\nWith each lap brought into her mouth, her stomach seemed to droop down an inch or so further to the ground until she had to sit down. With no signs of stopping Gummy retreated to the farthest end of his bowl in case he were sucked up too. As Fluttershy's tongue rubbed fruitlessly against the glass bottom, the young mare withdrew from the bowl with a delicate hiccup. <br>\r\n\"Ooh...*hic*...Mmmm...\", Fluttershy cooed in her sleep, subconsciously rubbing her stomach which now resembled a beach ball. <br>\r\nStruggling to rise to her feet, Fluttershy managed to lift her pendulous belly from the floor and slept walked over to the door leading back to the main hallway. <br>\r\nFrom Gummy's vantage point he could see her taut stomach shifting from side to side, struggling to deal with its watery payload with each step causing the water to swish and gurgle.<br>\r\nPassing through the door with moderate ease and only managing to get briefly stuck once, Fluttershy made her way down the steps towards the kitchen, her stomach brushing up against each step as the hiccuping pony descended. <br>\r\nArriving in the kitchen, Fluttershy began sniffing at the smells of cookery that hung thick in the air, \"Mmmm...*hic*...\" the Pony lavished as she began to drool. Her stomach began growling as it was dragged across the floor, whether in pain or pleasure Fluttershy couldn't be sure.<br>\r\nAs the scents in the air drew into her nostrils, she was aware that two distinct smells were splitting off in different directions; the smell to the left lead to a massive table with goods to go on sale the following morning at Sugarcube Corner, whereas the smell to the right lead to a fridge packed full with so many goodies it had been left slightly ajar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though I went a teensy-eensy bit overboard.\" Pinkie shuffled her front hooves around, looking reluctantly guilty. Fluttershy put on her best smile. It was nice to be appreciated, and she hadn't really minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Pinkie Pie. It was nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie grinned, before suddenly leaning in and planning a close-lipped kiss on Fluttershy's cheek. Fluttershy stood stock still, unable to register the act. Pinkie leaned back, her grin now looking decidedly more coy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're nice.\" Pinkie responded. Then with a giggle she held up a hoof. \"See you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy realized that was her cue to leave, and with a very bright blush she turneda round and left. It wasn't until she was out of the shop that her brain even started getting into gear. Pinkie had kissed her! Now, some might take that as a simple, if over-enthusiastic, sign of close friendship. Except Fluttershy had already been down that road, years before. That had been how Rainbow Dash had shown her affection back in flight camp, once they were both a bit older. So Fluttershy had reason to believe that that had been a legitimate sign of affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat frightened Flutterhshy was that she wasn't really sure about how to feel about that. Her relationship with Dash had been short lived, but ended on good terms - they both got something out of being friends, but it turned out that a relationship just put too much pressure on them both. Since then, Fluttershy hadn't exactly had the courage to date anypony she didn't know. Stallions tended to scare her, as the only one who hadn't stared at her with obvious lust was Big Mac, who wasn't even interested in.... and she hadn't really thought about any of her mare friends before now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... maybe tomorrow she'd go back, and see what happened. For now, the introspection had filled the time between Sugarcube and home. Still feeling the effects of her cake-filled belly, Fluttershy heaved herself inside and headed straight for bed. It was in her bedroom that she found Angel bunny waiting for her, looking a cross between upset and worried as he sat on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, Angel, I'm sorry I was out so long. Pinkie just needed help with some cakes, and...\" Fluttershy stifled another burp as the digestion process set in. Angel glanced to his owner's suddenly rotund midsection, looking a bit perplexed. Fluttershy decided to clamber straight into bed, squeaking in surprise as her belly brushed against the fabric. With a little wiggling around she ended up comfortably on her back. Then Angel clambered up on her midsection. At first Fluttershy worried about the pressure, but once he settled it was really quite fine - she was stuffed to the brim, but the weight wasn't pulling her skin anymore and she had enough give that it didn't hurt. And from the looks of it, Angel had decided he approved of this, curling up ever-so-cutely on Fluttershy's belly. She smiled to herself. This might have been a good decision after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Fluttershy awoke content. She had slept soundly for once, not even awaking frightened at a bad dream or anything. Angel was apparently already up, as he was no longer on Fluttershy's belly. And speaking of belly, it seemed like the mare's had deflated over the night. Not by that much, and as she got up Fluttershy soon learned where it had all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready getting chubby, Fluttershy was now obviously overweight for anypony to see. Her belly was still quite pudgy, and she had puffier sides, just enough fat to round them out but nothing hanging yet. Her legs were thicker, as was her neck. Finally, her flanks had broadened some, sending a slight wobble across her as she walked. This was certainly more than she had expected to gain! Yet... Fluttershy definitely felt more cuddly. She was careful not to overfeed the animals yet couldn't deny she had always loved the squisher critters that gave her a hug, like baby bears or rolly-polly puppies. She just hoped her friends felt likewise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy would have to figure out what to do after breakfast, however. She was suprisingly hungry, and decided...</span></div></div>",

The two ponies both blushed as they left their embrace, Pinkie shaking out of her stupor and rushing into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I have a spread for you today!\" She jumped and skipped as Fluttershy followed closely. <i></i>The way she squished me<i></i> Fluttershy thought <i></i>It was so nice...<i></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flurry of motion, Pinkie lifted the blanket covering a few dozen cupcakes and more frosted cakes, all frosted with thick, multicolored sugary, fattening, icing comparable to Rainbow Dash's mane. Fluttershy's eyes widened as she consciously put a hoof to her heavier belly, it jiggling under her pudgier hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on! Eat! Put them in your mouth! Go, savor!\" Pinkie Pie urged as Fluttershy approached the deliciousness. A slow reach for the pink frosted pushed the crumbly goodness into the flabby pony's mouth. Pinky watched with eager eyes as the yellow pony continued to put away the fattening pastries.</span></div></div>",

Now then, are you ready for your punishment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy winced as if stung by an angry hornet, but whimpered and nodded* Yes Princess, I'm scared, and really really REAAALLLYY want to run away and hide, but I know that would be wrong. I'm going to accept any punishment you give me, its just as I deserve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crossed Celestia's features as a golden glint flashed in her eyes. \"That makes me ecstatic to hear.

If it isn't too much trouble, can you please get this to Applejack. Thank you.\" and sent it on its way. The message inside said that Fluttershy wanted Applejack to send over 30 bushels of apples. Fluttershy needed these apples partially to feed some of her many animals but mostly to feed her own immense hunger. Had she been a regular sized pony, she would simply have walked to Applejack's farm or market stall and purchased them, but her girth prevented her from walking because of the effort required to merely lift her giant body. Flying was also out of the question. She had never been that great of a flyer, but her recent weight gain had inspired other pegasi to adapt their mocking rhyme to \"Buttershy, Buttershy, wants another piece of pie.\" Oh, how she had cried after trying to create a water tornado for Pegasopolis. Especially hurtful was the way Derpy had called her a \"Muffin Vacuum\" and joined in the taunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Because of this, and the compassion of her friends, she mostly sent out notes to her friends asking for their help and they hadn't failed her yet. Surely enough, after about an hour, Fluttershy's pigeon returned with an invoice and following right behind was a cart full of apples being towed by Big Macintosh. Fluttershy waddled to the door and opened it. She stopped eating the last of the shipment of apple pies AJ had sent her a week ago and gathered the necessary bits from her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Big Macintosh looked at the huge yellow pegasus digging through a purse for his payment. Not since he had been given a love-potion or perhaps since he had been enchanted to love Smarty Pants had he felt such attraction for anything. He knew that no one had charmed him since he had traveled without stopping and had not talked to anyone in the past day. The way her fluffy cheeks and doughy stomach poked out delighted him to the extreme. As he was staring at her, she tried to walk out to hand him his payment and collect her apples, but something was wrong. Fluttershy was stuck halfway through her door, her gelatinous sides and underhanging belly blocking her from moving any further. She struggled and twisted her front trying to squeeze throught, but her fat flanks kept her from moving. \"SOMEPONY HELP ME! I'M STUCK\" yelled Fluttershy. Big Macintosh let down his apple cart and immediately ran off to try and pull Fluttershy from the doorway, but after a few paces, he paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait a minute,\" Big Mac thought. \"If I leave her in there, I could feed her apples until she bursts. No, that's horrible. I must pull her out. It's the right thing to do.\" Big Mac looked at Fluttershy helplessly wiggling her hooves in an attempt to move forward, then looked at his full cart of apples. He looked back at Fluttershy's blushing, sweaty face and then back at his cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Big Macintosh do next?</span></div></div>",

Using the rope that had connected his yoke to the apple cart, he tied a loop around Fluttershy's midsection, tied the other end to his yoke and prepared to run at top speed. He galloped off at a phenomenal pace and watched the rope become more taut behind him. The rope became fully taught, Big Mac dug in for one more step, and then THWACK, he was snapped back by the friction. Walking back to Fluttershy's cottage, he checked on Fluttershy, who had barely moved and had gotten a nasty rope burn from the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Big Mac tried again, running even faster than he had before, as he felt the rope tighten, he slowed down and dug in his heels to take more powerful steps.

He looked down, then looked up with a look of brilliance and sped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy yelled \"Don't leave me here!

When he was only a baby, he used to cozy up to his mother during blizzards, warm and snug in their den. Angel remembered how very plump his mother was and how her portliness translated into extra soft hugs and great cuddle sessions . She had long since died, eaten by a fox who no doubt had the best meal of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time, Angel was bitter about his mother's death, his mood testy and his outlook cynical. But then he met her.  The shy yellow pegasus's air of kindness  and infinite patience reminded him of his mother and helped him become a better bunny. He felt nothing but the purest love for his dear Fluttershy - romantic love. She reciprocated, but not in the way Angel hoped for. Her love was strictly platonic.  That is, until recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPonyville was snowed in and Angel and Fluttershy were having a quiet night in together, snuggling just like he and his mother used to. Angel grabbed a fold of her coat and burrowed into it. \"Eeee\" the little pony squealed. Fluttershy had bulked up lately, much to Angel's delight. The lack of animals to tend to and the fact that sedentary pegasi were much more inclined towards weight gain than their Earth pony and unicorn counterparts meant that Fluttershy always gained a few pounds in the winter. This, however, was no ordinary winter. In an effort to make her fall in love with him, Angel had taken up cooking. Each winter's night Fluttershy was treated to an excelled four course meal.  They'd bond and \"talk\" over a long dinner,  Fluttershy finally beginning to see the little bunny in a whole new light while slowly fattening into the wobbly giant she was to become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until recently, the weather and her solitary nature had kept Fluttershy largely indoors and isolated from her friends. Winter Wrap-Up was quickly approaching, though, and with that came the first chance her friends would get at seeing the happy, extremely disparately sized couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day of Spring is here. How do Fluttershy's friends react to the her gain and her new beau?</span></div></div>",

Soon after Twilight arrived a few months ago, she did a survey which showed the town's weight was almost twice the national average! Of course, with all the home-cooked meals and fresh air, the town didn't suffer as much from the negative effects of obesity as she expected, so she left it alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swung open her cottage door to reveal an extra-large carriage shaped like an apple parked on the path. Her friends were already climbing aboard, and she couldn't help but feel better about herself as she watched their plump forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had, at first, been reluctant to embrace the Ponyville lifestyle, but already her resolve was crumbling beneath a constant barrage of Pinkie's sweets and Applejack's hospitality, as evidenced by her body's slight adipose layer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was almost as big as Fluttershy, her size mitigated only by her active lifestyle. Her applebucking thighs were as round as the trees she bucked, and the belly swinging beneath her only seemed to add momentum to every kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's dress emphasized her curvy figure, particularly her plump, ladylike rump, in a way that would drive any stallion wild... And judging from the two pulling the carriage, it was working. Rarity had made sure to select the strongest specimens she could find, capable of pulling several mares as well as their own large forms, and Fluttershy couldn't help but blush as she saw some muscle flex beneath their pudgy legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was still built for speed, but through a combination of laziness and too much candy, she had grown a round little gut that pressed visibly against the fabric of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, Pinkie Pie. Her constant consumption of sugary sweets had taken a toll on her figure, yes, but not as badly as one might expect. In fact, she was the third smallest pony in town, next to Rainbow Dash and Twilight... Which admittedly wasn't saying much, considering the large gap between their sizes. Pinkie's backside was huge, round as medicine balls and never seemed to stop jiggling. Not that Fluttershy was complaining, as she watched her climb into the carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy? Do you need any help getting in?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy blushed, realizing how long she had been standing. \"Eep!\" She squeaked, before scrambling up the steps and onto her seat, which caused the entire carriage to rock violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike snapped the reins, and they were off to the Grand Galloping Gala!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fluttershy sighed to herself as she awoke peacefully to the sound of birdsong. The birds always loved to wake her gently when morning came. Fluttershy opened her eyes, seeing the sun coming up over Canterlot, off in the distance. It wasn't that her bedroom had a great view or anything. Well, it did, but Fluttershy hadn't seen it in months. She hadn't seen inside any room in quite some time. It was really rather difficult to when you had a belly as big as a 1-story house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Fluttershy was currently resting on her belly, a giant mound of fat that spread out several feet in every direction, keeping her so far off the ground that her comparatively stubby hooves had no chance of ever meeting earth again. Her multitude of chins led directly into the fat of the front of her body, all signs of a neck having long since disappeared. In fact, aside from the ends of her hooves peaking through her rolls, and two tiny wings attached her her back, the only defining body feature Fluttershy had left was a massive rear end, great rippled flanks that arched away from her, nearly swallowing her tail. Each cheek easily weighed more than Big Macintosh. Fluttershy took a deep breath and sunk further into her fat for a moment, causing more folds to appear around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had started when she was young. Pegasus ponies just weren't meant to stay on the ground. Between the lack of exercise she was getting and the heavy earth-pony food, Fluttershy had quickly developed into a pudgy filly. But that had only made her friends! Rainbow Dash, already her friend, seemed to like relaxing with her more, and as young Fluttershy bulked up her belly just became a good pillow for the lazy Rainbow. Her developing love of earth pony food was how she had met Pinkie Pie, who had to be solely responsible for a couple hundred pounds as she eagerly gifted away all the cakes, pies, and sweets that she could afford. And as she became increasingly inactive, she became a better listener, ideal for Rarity, who often seemed of two minds about Fluttershy's weight but had never bothered her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just ponies, either. Her animal friends loved to hide under her folds when it got cold, or rest on her when tired, and the more of her there was the more animals she could accomodate. By the time she started hitting immobility, her good friend Applejack would gladly cart her around, eager to help the mare responsible for about half their annual sales. Fluttershy had thought near-immobility had been the limit, until Twilight had shown up. Able to teleport Fluttershy in times of need, and otherwise magically able to remedy many of her issues with immobility, Twilight had helped Fluttershy expand to her current state. Every so often they moved her about for a change of scenery, helped her with necessities, as did the animals who brought her food from the forest and town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy wasn't just content because this was another peaceful day, however. Today was going to be a special day, today was....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fluttershy did her daily exercise, at least, what felt like exercise. She accomplished the gargantuan task of rolling herself upright so she could see ponies as they approached her home. Just as she finished panting from her efforts, and after a few apples to help regain her energy, she saw a purple unicorn walking towards her. Fluttershy squeaked in delight and waved her flabby hoof as Twilight Sparkle approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Twilight. Did you read the spells you needed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure did, Fluttershy. It's all in here,\" said Twilight as she lifted an old spellbook entitled \"Healthful Hexes for Heavy Horses\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" sighed Fluttershy, \"I miss being able to walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if everything works out right, you'll be up and walking in no time,\" replied Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy began to cry tears of joy for the ability to walk that she had lost quite some time ago. Twilight looked dutifully through her book and found the spell named \"Adipostulate\". Focusing her mind on the spell, a beam of purple energy shot from Twilight's horn to Fluttershy's body. \"Oh my,\" gasped Fluttershy as the tingling sensation of the spell tickled her mounds of pudge. Twilight had to grit her teeth to keep the spell from dissolving at once. After about 30 seconds of intense effort, Twilight let her horn relax and the purple energy field around Fluttershy disappeared soon thereafter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Di- did it work? Am I thin again?\" asked Fluttershy, who kept her eyes closed in anticipation of seeing her thin body once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, well...\" said Twilight. \"You might want to open your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy opened her eyes and looked down at her body, which was exactly the same size it had been before. Fluttershy started sobbing even harder, realizing she would forever remain immobile. \"Hey, come on, Fluttershy. There's no need for tears.\" said Twilight, reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. It's just... it's just that I... I wanted to be able to walk again and do the things I used to.\" heaved Fluttershy between huge sobs that shook her fat rolls like an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand. I did everything the book said to do. This spell must have been translated incorrectly from Old Equestrian.\" explained Twilight as she looked diligently at the spell. Fluttershy continued to sob as she removed a cake from her fat rolls, which acted as a pantry for her enormous appetite. Just after Fluttershy had finished her cake, and a couple of Applejack's apple fritters as a post-dessert dessert, Twilight said, \"Yep. That's it. That's definitely what went wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is? What went wrong?\" asked Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turns out there was an error in the translation of the spell's effects. This spell doesn't make you lose weight, this spell makes you GAIN weight!\" said Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Fluttershy do next?</span></div></div>",

Twilight cast the spell again, and Fluttershy weighed 4,000 pounds. While this happened, Fluttershy had a smile so wide, it could be seen for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fluttershy reached a weight that required Twilight to teleport up to her head to see her, Fluttershy said, \"There was a 5x and a 10x, yes?\" Twilight nodded, and Fluttershy asked...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was her spa day! Oh, how wonderful. Fluttershy had long loved the spa, ever since Rarity had introduced her to it, as it had helped her often badly-stretched skin and aching joints. Even though that latter of those problems hadn't occured for months, she still very much enjoyed the time together. At first, when she had become immobile Fluttershy had assumed it would be the end of her time at the spa, but not quite so. No, the spa ponies Aloe and Lotus were more than happy to help their biggest customer - Fluttershy literally required many of their spa anemities by the bulk. Thank goodness Fluttershy received such a sizable stipend from the mayor's office for keeping the animals clear of farmland. It was a farming town after all, her services were vital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was simply getting there, and again, Twilight had proved immeasurably helpful. She was such a nice pony, Fluttershy was glad to be her friend. In fact, there she was now! They'd need to get an early start after all. Up towards the cottage Fluttershy was situated outside of trudged a certain pudgy purple unicorn. Oh yes, like Fluttershy, Twilight had never encountered good old earth pony food before, and that coupled with the fact that being friends with Pinkie Pie pretty much automatically added 15 pounds meant that Twilight was already looking a little rounder than when she had arrived. Just a little sway in her belly and wobble underneath her chin. Fluttershy had never given it much thought, but she'd have to say it looked good on Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Twilight.\" Fluttershy smiled, earning a wave back from Twilight. She saw the mare huff, no doubt tuckered out from her long walk over. Fluttershy remembered those feelings. Her belly may have kept her off the ground, but not too much, and she only had to look down a little to talk to Twilight. It was enough to add a ninth chin though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Fluttershy. Ready to head to the spa?\" Twilight asked. Fluttershy tried to nod, essentially just bobbing her head around in her fat. Twilight gave a good-natured chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to check to see if you've gotten any bigger before we start.\" Twilight replied, trotting around to Fluttershy's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you ever so much for helping.\" Fluttershy replied, her forelegs wiggling as she subconsciously tried to bring them together in a gesture of thanks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it.\" Twilight replied. Fluttershy could barely believe how lucky she was; Twilight was always so eager to help out, and never asked for anything in return. Before they started, however, Twilight needed to know how much pony she was transporting. So Fluttershy was expecting the soft prod of Twilight's hooves in her doughy sides. She wasn't sure how Twilight was \"measuring\" her, but didn't know how magic worked. She had asked once, when Twilight had been so gingerly kneading her fat, and Twilight had thrown out a few big words that had stun-locked Fluttershy's brain. She had to admit, the touch of another pony was something she craved from time to time, there was something about it that differed from the animals clambering around her. It was why she so enjoyed when Dash used her as a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a little grunt from Twilight, and tried to look back over her mounds of fat to see if everything was alright. She assumed Twilight was just a little tired. Then, with a squeak, Fluttershy felt a hoof on her flank. That... that was a little unusual. Twilight's hoof must have just strayed accidentally. There was a lot of flank to accidentally touch, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy allowed herself to be prodded and kneaded, trying to stop herself from breaking out in a blush. She didn't understand why she was blushing, but the careful, gentle touch of Twilight's hooves nearly made her quiver. When Twilight came back around, Fluttershy could see the other mare's face was flush as well. Perhaps it was just the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Hold still.\" Twilight said, as if Fluttershy could do anything else. Twilight's horn started to glow, and with a flash Fluttershy briefly felt weightless. The sensation instantly disappeared, and she blinked as she found herself looking at the walls of the spa. Okay, so technically she was indoors here, but it was less of a room here, the spa mostly one big open space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, Mizz Fluttershy, right ontime!\" The accented voice of one of the spa ponies greated Fluttershy. Aloe, the blue mare, smiled as she greeted Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get started before Mizz Rarity gets here, no? Why don't we start with...\"</span></div></div>",

The dreams had always started off tame, he was simply lying in a bed relaxing, snacking on a couple of gems. As the dream went on however, he ate more and more gems and his body would grow bigger and bigger until he was hardly able to move anymore. <br>\r\nInstead of being alarmed by these dreams however, Spike found them... exciting? <br>\r\nThere was just something enticing about the idea of being trapped under piles of his own fat. These dreams had become alarmingly frequent, and each time Spike found himself waking up with his dragon prick excruciatingly hard. That was when he knew that these dreams weren't just something he would forget. No, Spike wanted to become fat, and he would get this wish no matter what it would take.<br>\r\nSpike knew that he had to be careful about this however. So he thought hard about how he would go about making this dream come true.<br>\r\nAlready an option had come to his mind. After being around a bookworm of Twilight's caliber for so long Spike knew a thing or two about magic and potions. It might be a possibility that he could home brew a weight gain potion. Not only this but this method could stay a secret, as he could easily brew counter potions.<br>\r\nOr he could take a more traditional weight gain route with eating. This would probably take quite a lot longer and a whole ton of gems. This would definitely be obvious to everyone. But maybe everyone knowing wouldn't be so bad after all...<br>\r\nHe didn't know what method he would pick, but he knew that this was what he wanted!</span></div></div>",

After all what would his friends think of him if they found out?<br>\r\nIt was too late to go back now, he had already begun \"borrowing\" ingredients from Twilight's lab. His thoughts were interrupted when he heard a shout from below his room.<br>\r\n\"Spike! Do you know where all the poison joke oil went?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, no I haven't seen it Twi. Have you checked every cabinet?\" he responded.<br>\r\n\"I've been looking all day! This isn't the only thing to go missing either. Anyway I'm going to head out and get some, I need it for a botany experiment on Everfree plant structure.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll see you later Twi!\"<br>\r\nTwilight left with a final huff of dismay, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n \"Perfect!\" Spike thought to himself as he realised he now had plenty of time to try out his new potion. He didn't feel right lying to Twilight like that... But sometimes sacrifices needed to be made to get what you want. <br>\r\nHe returned to his room in a hurry, pulling out his hidden makeshift alchemy station. With one last breath of dragon flame the potion had been finished. <br>\r\nSpike could hardly contain his excitement as he pulled the lukewarm flask of bluish green liquid  off the table and slowly divided it into perfect amounts. <br>\r\nOne dose of the potion would make the gain begin. A second dose however, would halt and reverse the effect.<br>\r\nSpike quickly grabbed two vials of the elixir with shaking hands, and laid himself down on his mattress. <br>\r\nHe took the plunge as he uncorked one vial and quickly swallowed it's contents.<br>\r\nOnly seconds later he felt his stomach rumble and fill with a strange, comfortable warmth. <br>\r\nOverwhelming arousal filled his body as he felt his dick grow outwards with a soft moan.<br>\r\nHe thought of just how much weight he would gain...</span></div></div>",

He chewed and swallowed, patting his distended tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike!\" Twilight said from behind him. Spike was startled and choked on his snack, hacking the shards up onto the library floor. The purple mare gave Spike a look as he turned to face his dear friend and he smiled sheepishly. \"What did I say about eating those gems?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike huffed and crossed his arms, a feat that had become rather difficult for him. \"Aw, come on Twi. You have no idea how good these are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight brought a hoof to her face. \"Spike, I know this isn't easy for you, but last thing you need is more weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike sighed and looked at himself. He knew she was right, he just didn't want to admit it. Once upon a time he had merely been slightly chubby, probably due to baby fat or some such anomaly. Now his stomach extended quite far in front of himself and, due to dragons having an odd anatomy, a pile of fat between his legs forced him to waddle. His chunky knees could no longer touch each other and his flabby arms were getting harder to move, as well as his tale. His face had a small layer of pudge that made it look like he was keeping something in his cheeks. No doubt about it, he was fat. Not getting fat, fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike pat his large tummy and sighed. \"I'm sorry, Twilight. It's just... this stunted growth thing is getting to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed sadly. She felt really bad about it and wished she could figure out what to do about it. Ever since Spike's greed induced rampage, it had basically been decided on that the young dragon would be stuck as a baby unless he gave in to his dragon nature. It had been hard for him to accept that he would be small for life and had turned to gems to ease the pain. Somehow through a reason Twilight had yet to discover, Spike's appetite and fat intake had increased greatly. She suspected it had to do with hoarding things, but that weren't any books on dragon training. She didn't even know of the excess fat was bad for Spike or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... Please spike, cut back on the jewels. Any fatter and you will fall through the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike wanted to make a snappy comeback but words failed him. He awkwardly stepped over to a chair and sat down with a heave. \"I know, I know... just let me finish this bowl.\" He quickly stuffed a bunch more rubies in his mouth and swallowed. His stomach rumbled happily, but still hungered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you getting all these anyway?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike opened his mouth to answer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It sloshed and jiggled from the force. \"I'm nothing <i>but</i> that. We'll both feel better if you just come out and say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked a bit unsure, but gave in. \"Alright, yes Spike, you are fat. You're obese.

Bye, Twi, I'll be back latter!\" Spike lumbered through the door of the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight considered stopping him, but decided against it. He was in a miserable position, after all. Surely one day with whoever was feeding him couldn't hurt too much, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't overeat!\" Twilight called after him. Spike didn't respond if he heard and she merely watched him waddle away. <i>He is kind of cute,</i> she thought with a smile as she turned back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike smiled to himself as he walked along the cobbled streets of Ponyville, earning a few stares from ponies walking by. He tried to ignore them as he made his way too...</span></div></div>",

I was worried you weren't coming to help me with my art project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike fanned himself, hoping he wasn't really sweaty. \"Don't worry, when Spike makes a promise he keeps it. So, uh... what are we doing again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie motioned for Spike to come inside, to which he waddled in and was glad that it was a double door he walked through. He could just fit through most other doors in town, and that was probably going to change soon. \"This time I need help sorting the jewels. You and Rarity are the only ponies- uh, pony and dragon- that can tell what are the best ones. And my project has to have the best of the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike nodded as best as he could. His thick chin and the new one forming made it a bit difficult. \"And what exactly is this project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie smiled as her eyes darted left and right as they walked into one of the back rooms. \"Oh, uh, you know... school stuff. It's gotta be pretty. Yeah. Pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike had stopped listening. His mouth salivated somewhat and his eyes became shiny. There were enough gems in front of him to keep him full for a week! Well, maybe a few days... or just two... at least until dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, go ahead and pick out the really good ones and you can have the rest. If there's enough of the good stuff you can have any extra.\" Sweetie shoved over a chest obviously meant to hold the high quality stones. \"I'll be in the kitchen getting us a snack. Holler if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike licked his lips as he approached the pile with arms poised to attack, then slapped his chubby cheek. \"Whoa, Spike, calm down. You need to watch your weight, just look at you!\" He looked back at his large rear end. \"Sure, it's not <i>your</i> fault that your growth is stunted and this is probably some weird side effect, but you shouldn't make it worse!\" His stomach gurgled at him. \"Then again, I'm gonna end up huge anyway. Maybe I should just- no! I'm not gonna let myself go! But... I might as well not fight it. I'll sort these and claim my prize.\" With a defeated sigh, Spike sat on his rump and again flinched when it barely took any time to hit the ground. He grabbed a handful and began to inspect each one, being sure to toss the good ones into the chest and the crunching the other ones. Much to his chagrin, as the pile shrunk, he could see himself grow. He could actually feel himself getting fatter with every swallow. Maybe he was imagining it, but he could swear that his arms felt a bit heavier with every reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last crunch he was done. Towards the end he had to roll onto his stomach to reach the last of them. He groaned as his body gurgled and rumbled from his feast. It wasn't a pained groan though, as he was actually still hungry. No, he groaned because of what a pig he made of himself. As he rocked himself back and forth to get back on his legs, he wondered how long it would take before he couldn't walk anymore. He envisioned himself having to be rolled everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a pang of guilt when he realized that didn't sound so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, finished already?\" Sweetie asked as she carried a platter of food on her back. She looked into the chest to see it was half full with jewels. \"And there's so many here. I don't think I need that many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike suppressed a moan, or maybe it was a cheer. That meant more high quality, extra fattening gems for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie nuzzled Spike's belly. \"Thanks for all the help, Spike. And here's a reward for you.\" She placed the platter on a coffee table. \"I made us lunch. Some hayseed sandwiches, an apple pie, some cup cakes, a few of those fancy chocolate bread thingies Rarity likes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh boy, more food,</i> Spike thought. He wasn't sure whether he meant that in an apprehensive way or not. \"You made all that just now? I was only here for... how long have I been doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour,\" Sweetie said before blushing. \"Uh, well, I bought the pie from Applejack, but I did make this other stuff.\" She grinned sheepishly. \"For you,\" she added softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike looked at the assortment of goodies and picked up a cupcake. \"I'm certainly not one to pass a free meal.\" Spike gulped the desert down in one bite. \"Mmm... so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie smiled. \"I'm so glad you liked it. Have as much as you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike opened his mouth to say something, but let out a large burp instead. He blushed, but Sweetie Belle giggled. \"You know, I learned from Pinkie that in some parts of the world that burping is a compliment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle, Spike grabbed another cupcake. \"Well, in that case...\" Just like the first, he ate it in one bite. He opened wide and belched as loud as he could, making Sweetie laugh harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be getting good then,\" Sweetie said after her fit, by which time Spike had eaten more food. Sweetie merely smiled at the sight.</span></div></div>",

To his chagrin, he found that his body rose like a mountain. He certainly felt like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie jumped onto his stomach and forced a burp out of him. \"I guess that means no seconds, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't (<i>urp</i>) don't think so,\" Spike said in a bit of a haze. He smiled up at Sweetie. \"If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to fatten me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie blushed and opened her mouth, but was interrupted as Spike's body rumbled. \"Whoa!\" she yelled as she instinctively held on tighter. Spike moaned as he felt an odd pressure in his belly- not just there, but his whole being. He belched louder than he ever had and closed his eyes from the discomfort of whatever it was pushing out. He opened his eyes to see if he was okay, but his mind froze from what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike watched in awe as he grew. This wasn't like when he became an adult dragon and grew in massive spurts. This was gentler and a bit more subtle. He was watching himself grow <i>fatter</i>. To his horror, he watched as the peak of his belly where Sweetie Belle was hanging on rise higher and higher. He felt his arms get heavier over his torso as he felt that get laden with fat as well. He felt his head being pushed back by what he hoped was only a second chin getting thicker. He even experienced the bizarre sensation of being lifted as his rear and even his back piled with blubber and pushed his up. Spike couldn't see it, but he felt the scales on his tail stretch to accommodate the new ponds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he came to a sudden stop. His form jiggled from the sudden growth and he laid there flabbergasted staring at the mountain that was now him. He must have gained at least a hundred pounds. Spike's body finally stopped sloshing, but his mind was running rampant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hay!? I'm huge! How did this happen? Am I sick? What will everpony think? Am I contagious? What if I keep growing, what if I destroy the town!?</i> He felt like he was going to faint.

He was getting fat because of her. Sure he was getting fat all on his own, but Sweetie sped up the process. And now he'd reached immobility way before he thought would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. He was going to get here anyway, he realized. He would have become this blob at some point. She wasn't trying to do this to him, she just had a crush that led to a pretty big problem. It was kind of awesome to have somepony doing stuff for him instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and put an arm around Sweetie Belle. \"It's not your fault. At least, not that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie sniffed and looked at him. \"So you're not mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike sighed. \"Naw, getting mad's too tiring.\" They both had a light hearted giggle at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike burped. \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Her crown and regalia were somewhere in her room, thrown to the side as if she didn't care, which she no longer did. For a powerful realization had struck her right as she sat down for supper. She could pinpoint the exact moment it happened, too. It was just as a servant asked the all important question that set of what Celestia considered to be a wonderful life in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you have soup or salad, Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her eyes went wide when the thought finally occurred to her. Why had she never realized it before? She blamed it on the fact she had to plan for her sisters return from being stuck on her moon, but that time had passed. At last, she could see the amazing truth before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, of course she was a princess, it was her title. But it suddenly hit her what that actually meant. She could ultimately do whatever she wanted, within reason, and nopony could stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of it,\" Celestia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant blinked. \"All of it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of it?\" Celestia's sister, Luna, asked from next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of it,\" Celestia confirmed. \"Except for whatever Luna wants. Just bring we the whole lot of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bowl of soup, thank you,\" Luna had said tentatively, to which the servant bowed and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid,\" Celestia said. \"I'm so hungry I could eat the moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna narrowed her eyes. \"Why the sudden hunger, dear sister? You always get salad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia chuckled gently. \"Well, is there a problem if I eat more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna raised a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia secretly shivered in anticipation. For the longest time she and deprived herself of tasty treat and glorious meals in an attempt to keep her image. But what did that honestly matter? Even if she became a blob, she'd still be the one who raised the sun and she'd still have all the power. Ponies would still have to listen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe consumption of the massive pot of broccoli soup and a massive salad bowl topped with the fancy dressing she usually save for special led to her, politely of course, asking for more food. That led to the spread in front of her. Crammed until just about spilling, the table was filled with a ten course meal that would make a normal pony full just from looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr it was, until Celestia had a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's mouth hung open as she watched the last of the pasta be slurped into Celestia's mouth. Celestia patted her brand new paunch and gave a dainty burp. Luna wasn't sure if she was impressed of mortified. \"Celestia... you do realize you just ate enough to feed a small family for a couple of days, do you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it grand?\" Celestia nodded. \"It feels wonderful to indulge oneself. Oh, I'm sorry, did you want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I do not. Honestly, this is not normal behavior for you. What has gotten into you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides that wonderful garlic bread?\" Celestia asked as she stared sadly at the empty bowl she had been lifting with her magic. \"I guess I just realized today that it doesn't really matter. I mean, really, who's going to stop me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants cleared the dishes and replaced them just as quickly with many different flavors of ice cream. Celestia magically lifted a spoon and licked her lips. \"Ooh, at long last. Triple chocolate fudge brownie, you shall be mine.\" She dug in and smiled as she smeared cool brown sludge on her pristine coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna sighed. \"I'm worried is all. You look like you've already put on about twenty pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia liked the bowling until it sparkled and grabbed another. \"Again I ask; what does it matter? we're immortal goddesses. A few extra pounds certainly isn't going to hurt me.\" <i>Or maybe a few hundred,</i> she thought. She didn't particularly care how much she gained as long as she got have more of this raspberry truffle flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked contemplative for a moment.</span></div></div>",

Those last few drops of vanilla would be hers if it was the last thing she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna herself had actually decided to indulge as well, though nowhere near the level of Celestia. She was tenderly working her own mint flavored ice cream and watching Celestia feast on more dairy treats. The darker alicorn smiled to herself as Celestia gave a little cheer when she got the last licks from the tub. She flung it aside and instinctively reached out for another tub with her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia grunted when she realized she couldn't reach. Something was blocking her from the food! Why did the table suddenly seem so close but so far? She looked down to see what the problem was and paused. Her rounded and stuffed belly had grown large enough to keep the rest of her away. She looked and saw that her haunches had grown quite a bit as well. In fact, all over she had gained a soft layer of fluffy fat. She felt her face in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did I eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled an a another tub of ice cream floated up to her. She smiled at her own foolishness at forgetting she had magic. But then she realized that she wasn't the one lifting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To say you've eaten a feast would be an understatement, sister,\" Luna said. Celestia turned to see the soft glow of Luna's horn. \"But somehow I get the feeling you are still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia blushed and nodded and Luna brought the tub to her sister. Celestia greedily swallowed more creamy goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say, you seem very chipper all of a sudden. Your demeanor is much happier... if not a noticeably thicker. Does this extreme gorging truly bring you joy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed and belched, giggled drunkenly as she massaged her bulging stomach. \"I'm not going to lie; I love food, my dear Luna. I just want to eat and eat and never stop. And then I have to admit... all this pudge isn't so bad. Actually it's quite comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pudge!?\" Luna blurted. \"You're fat and you know it!\" She gave Celestia's flank a playful poke. To her surprise her hoof sank in quite deep. Celestia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I have to be truthful, then yes I am indeed fat. Maybe i should stop for the- oh my.\" Celestia's face become even redder as Luna leaned into her sister's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite comfy, actually.\" Luna hugged Celestia's newly sized body, to which Celestia happily returned. Luna pushed herself up and the two shared a laugh together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this really does make you happy then I shall be faithful one hundred percent and help you eat to your hearts content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia beamed. \"Really? You don't mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna shrugged. \"I can't say I completely understand this fascination to eat oneself into a pile of gluttony, but you seem to be enjoying yourself. Your joy is my joy. And, truth be told, I've never had a pillow as fine as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia clapped her fore hooves together in glee. \"Oh, you don't know how glad I am to hear that. Now, if you'll excuse me, there is a five layer cake that has my royal seal all over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna, however, pushed the table away as Celestia reached out. \"Now, now, now, we can't have our precious ruler straining herself in any way. I think we can make you more comfortable for your feeding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia blinked in confusion. \"Comfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have ruled this kingdom for a thousand years by yourself. It is time to be pampered!\"</span></div></div>",

With a lot of magic and some strain they had gotten Celestia onto her bed, in the privacy of her own room. It was a room fit for pampering, as even Celestia's enlarged frame was dwarfed by the gigantic mattress. She laid backwards onto a mountain of pillows, watching the way her stomach filled out in front of her. She wondered just how much more she'd have to eat to fill her bed. The thought was not one of academic curiosity; the more she indulged, the more she wanted to indulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for what?\" Celestia thought to ask, losing sight of Luna as the other princess prepared the continued feast. Luna just reappeared, smiling, and levitated a tub of mousse towards Celestia's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything.\" Luna's voice was happy, sweet, and had a trace of something... edgier to it, not that Celestia could tell. She simply let her sister feed her, enjoying the delectable dessert. Luna took care of everything, switching up her foods so she never got sick of one flavor, wandering around the bed and shifting pillows and such. As Celestia ate her belly just became a bigger and bigger mound of fat, almost everything going straight there. But her legs thickened, her sides grew rolls, and more chins appeared while she was at it. And she was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Luna, I'm so happy\" Celestia cooed. \"How much have I eaten?\" She tried to rub her belly, finding her front legs harder to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get that.\" Luna spread her wings and fluttered on top of Celestia's stomach, which was now large enough for her to rest on easily. \"Not enough.\" She decided, her voice gaining more of that edge. She began to nuzzle Celestia's belly, shifting slightly to feel its mass. Celestia cooed again, loving the feeling. Her fat was like her body pampering itself, making itself more comfortable, the perfect receptacle for pleasure. Feeling Luna stroke and pamper her was wonderful, and Celestia couldn't think of anypony she'd want to do this more with than her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna slowly inched her way up until she and Celestia were face to face, and then the younger sister began to nuzzle her there too. She drew attention to Celestia's extra chins, thick neck, and pudgy cheeks, rubbing up against her. It was... sensual, certainly, but Celestia didn't shy away from these feelings. She needed them. She needed to feel like this, after being so strict and so alone for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna, I...\" Celestia stopped, realizing Luna's face was just in front of hers. So slim, her sister was, so tiny in comparison now. She could cuddle against Celestia so well though, that much was certain, and Celestia could imagine her sister falling asleep on top of her, playing with her and always being near to pamper her. It was a lovely dream. But she loved her sister so dearly, and her sister was working so hard. Didn't she deserve a reward?</span></div></div>",

She sighed contently as she gave a few of them a squeeze. \"You're being too good to me, Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna merely smiled as she lifted up a massive platter of various appetizers with her magic. \"Nothing is too good for my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining hall had been altered in but a few slight ways. Celestia now laid upon a mattress and was surrounded by pillows so as not to strain herself. There were now many tables to be seen, each with it's own selection of glorious food. Celestia's eyes were a bit glossy as she waited for the servants to finish filling everything up. She didn't want to wait for the wonderful smelling delicacies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide, sister,\" Luna said as she held a spinach wrap. Celestia greedily ate it whole a moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food, glorious food...\" Celestia said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Servants?\" Luna addressed, to which the assembled fifteen or so waiters and the ten guards stoically nodded. \"Let the feast commence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it began. Luna and the assembled ponies began to pick up food and bring it to Celestia's waiting maw. Aside from chewing, the Sun Princess had to do nothing as she was fed meal after meal. She amazed herself as she managed to get more and more into her mouth as she took bigger and bigger bites. She massaged herself as she felt her stomach get larger as it became stuffed with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind hazed over as she became lost into the wonderful sensations of the food she her soft body. She wondered why she had never thought to do this before. For the life of her Celestia could no longer remember why she didn't spend more time eating. Some part of her wondered why she wasn't feeling full yet, but she shoved that thought aside. If she got to eat more, why should she care?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sure can pack it,\" one servant commented as he carried the bowl that held the five gallons of pudding that had just been slurped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's already massive,\" another said from around back of the princess. \"Look at her flank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mah frank?\" Celestia asked with her mouth full of cake. She swallowed and turned to look behind her. Or she tried at first. Her new chins actually made it rather hard. \"Are these my shoulders? I thought somepony had put pillows around my head. Just how big am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiled and nuzzled Celestia's neck fat. \"To put it in perspective, your cutie mark is now half the size of a normal pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia's eyes grew wide and she once more tried to look around herself, this time with success. To her shock, she had grown huge. She reminded herself of a pear almost. Each cheek of her rump could hold perhaps three small fillies. She saw her stomach and gasped at how it had grown large enough to push the pillows of the mattress. She <i>covered</i> the mattress. Her once slender legs could now be mistaken for small tree trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her newly formed chest fat and and smiled despite herself. \"I must be over three hundred pounds,\" she said in amazement and maybe with a little pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed!\" Luna nearly shouted. \"To think you were a stick yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia laughed, causing her neck to jiggle. \"Yesterday I wasn't so hungry. But I think I look rather nice with all this extra padding. What do you all think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the servants and got mixed reactions. Some of them nodded and seemed to go along with it as servants tend to do. Some of them looked rather mortified at the idea. Most, however, were blushing and sweating slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you look lovely,\" one guard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye,\" agreed another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled warmly. \"Wonderful. Then I suppose you all wouldn't mind if I got bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red faced servants became even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiled. \"That shan't be a problem at the rate you've devoured my feast to you. The castle has almost ran out of food trying to satisfy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia blushed. \"Oh my. Well then...\"</span></div></div>",

Only a few. The rest looked disappointed. \"Are you sure? You can't be full after all this. Well, maybe you can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia wobbled on her legs, her muscles aching from lack of use and the extra weight. \"Well, no, I am still quite hungry. But as you said, there's no more food in the castle. We should all just go to bed and continue on with our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna sighed. \"Very well, if this is how you feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled in return. \"Thank you for indulging me, Luna. I would love to do this again sometime if we can.\" Celestia yawned and began to waddle to her room. She giggled as she felt herself bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants began the three hour long job of cleaning up Celestia's mess while Luna grinned. \"Faithful stewards, restock the castle as soon as you can. Celestia says she is not satisfied, so we must feed her until she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants, for the most part, seemed quite happy with the idea. \"We shall bring her snacks whenever we can,\" one servant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" Luna began with a mischievous smirk. \"Are you all enjoying feeding my sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ponies had once more gone red faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, I have a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia struggled to stay awake during the Court she always held at noon. She always had trouble listening to the noble ponies complaining about some such stupid thing or another, but today it was extra hard not to fall asleep in her throne. It wasn't that she didn't sleep well, far from it. It was that her dreams were filled with mountains made of cake and donuts as big as Canterlot and rivers made of chocolate and many other wonderful that were all for her to scarf down. It had be so much fun, even when she became so big that she herself could have been mistaken as a mountain. Just the thought of all that delicious food was making her drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... so, due to the... and because... raise tax on apples...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmmhh, apples. She could have gone for some pie right then. She could almost smell the warm goop inside a lovely crust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sniffed harder. Was her imagination really so wild, or did she smell apple pie? She blinked and saw a pie tin with a fresh pie floating in front of her. She turned to look at a guard who smiled up at her as his horn glowed. \"Feeling peckish, my princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia mouthed a 'thank you' and munched on the pie as the noble ponies droned on. Each time she finished, another treat floated in front of her. Soon there was a constant stream of food going into the solar princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, my lady?\" the noble pony who had been talking asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid she's a bit preoccupied right now,\" a guard said as he ushered them all out of the throne room. \"Come back tomorrow if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" the door was slammed in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Celestia asked groggily with her mouth full of cookies. \"Where'd they go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They decided to leave you alone today,\" the guard that brought her the latest tub of ice cream said. \"Just relax and let us make you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia burped in reply and blushed. \"I hope I didn't scare them away. Oh my goodness, I would love an ice cream right now, if you can get me some\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia ate without abandon as more and more food was brought to her. At last she decided that this was enough (although she is <i>still</i> wasn't full). She tried to sit up from her throne and met resistance. She blushed as she realized that her flank was so big that her bottom was wedged in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help, you say?\" Luna asked as she walked int the room. \"I can see our little piggy is filling up nicely. She's already too big for her chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia rubbed the back of her head. \"I can't believe I put on all this weight in less that twelve hours. What am I up to now, four hundred pounds?\" Celestia licked icing off her face. \"But food is just <i>so</i> good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Luna laughed. \"You thought that was a feast last night? It is time for a real feast.\"</span></div></div>",

Celestia looked and the dented throne and blushed. \"Oops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna laughed. \"I just don't have the words to describe my mirth right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia turned to her sister but noticed the guards were as red as she felt. \"Thank you,\" she said with a smile. \"You have no idea how hungry I am.\" Her stomach growled loudly. \"Or still am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble my lady,\" one said as they both bowed. \"You looked so hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we love seeing you so happy,\" the other said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia thought for a moment. \"Wait a minute, where did you get that food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kicked their hooves bashfully and Luna spoke for them. \"They cooked some of it themselves, but received quite a bit of help from the kitchen staff. In fact, most of the castle has been preparing to feed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia gaped. \"The whole castle... wants to feed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" She turned to the guards for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we like seeing you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, er... you're beautiful. Not that you weren't before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful?\" Celestia said with sparkling eyes. \"You mean I'm a whale and I'm beautiful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna clopped her front hooves together. \"Save your fantasies for later, I have a surprise for you. To the dining hall!\" With that, Luna trotted off. The guards made to leave, but Celestia used her magic and grabbed the one brave enough to speak his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come by my room later. All this blubber could use a good cuddle.\" She let him go and made a huge show of swaying her flanks and letting them jiggle. The guard's eyes rolled back and he promptly fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your eyes closed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're closed, they're closed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be prepared for you head to implode, sister, for you are in for a treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't mean for my mind to be blown?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whichever works. We are almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, something smells heavenly. Chocolate, and lots of it. And also familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are just about ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment... it can't be. Luna, you didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, open your eyes and prepare to go to heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia opened her eyes and almost cried. It was the best cake that had ever existed, one she had been taunted by only tasting it. A massive spongy cake with a name her glazed mind could not remember, cover in frosted donuts and eclairs and topped with the head of a literal chocolate moose. She practically drowned in her own drool at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That cake,\" Celestia moaned. \"The ultimate cake. The cake that makes every other cake <i>wish</i> it could have just a little of its frosting as to be a little bit closer to its magnificence. How is it possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surrounding servants all looked happy with their princess's reaction while Luna flicked her mane. \"It was a lot of luck that brought this sugary delight before you. I had originally intended to just have the actual cake part, but as soon as it was mentioned it was for you the chefs all came together and made this masterpiece of sinful food immediately. So enjoy yourself sister dearest; this monstrosity is all for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia pulled Luna and as many servants as she could into a great big flabby hug. \"Oh, you are all too good to me! What did I do to deserve this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna snuggled Celestia's fat despite how against decorum it was. At this point, she decided, decorum had been thrown out the window. \"No need to thank us, your happiness is all we require.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" Celestia said as she let them go and approached the gargantuan cake. Even though it was up on a table, she could see it was bigger than she was in height, and maybe even in mass. She floated a plate and fork over but it was quickly pulled away by Luna's magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to use manners with us. Go ahead and glut yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled and tore off a chunk with her magic. She bit down and actually did cry. She had only one slice of this amazing pastry/cake/chocolate/thing before and it wasn't enough. The explosion of flavor in her mouth threatened to rip her jaw apart. She might as well have been the jelly she was eating, because she fell to the ground as her legs gave way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo goooood,\" Celestia moaned as she took another bite. She entered a drunken state where all she wanted to do was eat, eat, eat! She worked her way through each part of the dessert methodically and she savored each nibble and lick she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all to soon, the cake was gone. Celestia chewed on the moose head as slowly as she could and let it melt in her mouth. Her snout, bulging cheeks, and massive jowl were covered with sticky sugar, sprinkles, cream, and chocolate. She was now almost perfectly round while sitting on her massive butt. She could hardly believe herself as she tipped to and fro in her cake educed stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, despite eating more than what was once her whole eight in cake, she still was not satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's mouth hung open at the sight of her rotund sister licking frosting off her hoof. She had not believed Celestia would actually devour the whole thing in one day, let only one hour! Celestia stomach gurgled a roared. \"It's not possible,\" Luna said aloud. \"You absolutely cannot still be hungry after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia blushed. \"Well, I might have room for a snack.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Celestia sighed in contentment as she snuggled deeper into her pillows. She shifted slightly and the blanket that barely covered her belly slipped and fell to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat\" she said, feeling too lethargic to even use her magic to lift it back up. It didn't seem worth it since it was obvious she needed a parachute to cover herself at this point. Her flab kept her warm enough anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked out the window from her perch on her bed and pouted a bit. Once again the castle had run out of food. Luna had been forced to reduce her meals down to the breakfast, lunch and dinner and to semi-normal proportions. She was allowed to eat as much as a normal pony, but no more. Celestia desperately wanted to protest this but knew that her new found hunger was difficult to keep up with. Besides she was now massive. If she got too much bigger she'd spill over the bed. She shivered a bit at the thought and realized it did not sound terrible. Quite the opposite in fact. She felt like a new mare with all the pounds added to her. So soft and jiggly like a water bed. She nuzzled her great big second chin at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle knock came from her door Celestia jumped with a start and her fat bounced around. \"Who is it?\" Celestia called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"White Wind. The uh, guard from earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled and said \"Come in please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite wind walked in with a serving trolley behind him and froze at the sight of the princess so amazingly fat. \"Wow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia giggled and beckoned him seductively. \"Come in White. Close the door behind you please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did as he was told and brought the trolley over to her. He stood there for a bit, awkwardly shuffling his hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Celestia asked. \"Are you going to get into this bed with me or will I have to use force?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind gave a small and excited smile as he removed his armor. \"Forgive me Princess. I am quite nervous actually\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please just call me Celestia.\" White Wind climbed onto the bed and became rigid as Celestia pulled him into a blubbery hug. Celestia was disheartened and thought that he was terrified, but he slowly returned the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is different\" White Wind said red faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia turned so that White Wind was laying on her chest and stomach. \"Do you really think I'm beautiful despite the fact that I'm so fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... well yes. I think all of this extra you is... pleasant. Yes pleasant is the word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia let out a little squee and held him a bit tighter. \"You don't know how wonderful it is to here you say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" he blinked. \"But everypony tells you that you are beautiful. What made me so different princ- Celestia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everypony tells me that I am beautiful or tells me I am the best thing since they invented ink or tells me I am perfect. Now I am an overweight slob. I have eaten enough in the past two days to feed a whole town. I haven't gotten a single compliment since all of this started and at most ponies just bring me more food to satisfy me. They are too scared to say anything and I know that quite a few of them like me like this\" Celestia smiles coyly as she pressed his whole face into one of her cheeks. \"And then there is you. You were brave enough to be something other than a guard. You told me I am beautiful and if your blush means anything then you meant it. It has been so long since a pony was honest to me. Such bravery has to be rewarded\" She leaned in and gave him a peck on the nose. He went limp and almost passed out. \"Did I overwhelm you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind shakily brought his head up. \"I'm fine Celestia\" he said dreamily. \"I was not expecting a kiss. I do not really know what I was expecting when you called me in here but I am happy I could make you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smiled and simply snuggled into each other for a while. \"I don't remember the last time I held anypony this close\" Celestia said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must get so lonely\" White Wind replied. \"We are taught in training to never try and get friendly with you. I'd be fired in an instant if anypony found us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed. White Wind chuckled at her adorably chunky pout. \"How many times do I have to ban that before they get that I want to be friendly with my guards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be too mad at us as you do raise the sun and the sun is far and out of our reach. Why would the magnificent mare that moves it be any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh a poet too. Am I not the lucky one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh thank you. Celestia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my tiny little pony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I... feed you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia's eyes twinkled. \"I thought you would never ask. What did you bring me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind's horn glowed as he magically lifted a large plate with a sliver lid covering it. \"Since the castle is out of food I had to do something simple. It is not much but this was something my mother and I liked to do. First a big plate of fresh chocolate cookies\" The lid was lifted and there was a pile of warm cookies underneath. Celestia looked ready to smother him at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness you have no idea how hungry I am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia opened her mouth and a cookie was placed inside. She chewed and moaned as is squished in her teeth. \"So warm and chewy.\" She swallowed and let another cookie be put in her mouth. \"Your mothers recipe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Family actually. I am a baker on my mothers side I suppose. More?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please\" Another disappeared into her. \"I don't think I've actually had a cookie for two hundred years since it became out of fashion to eat tasty things\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind forced a cookie between her lips. \"I will never understand why ponies that look like they are starving are attractive. A good mare needs some meat on her\" He placed a cookie on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it I am not the first fed by you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one other. Until then I had a hard time dating. I was never interested in them physically. Then I met this one gorgeous mare maybe a fourth of what you weigh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred and fifty? She sounds lovely\" This time he used a hoof to put the treat in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was amazing. Sweet with a healthy appetite and so nice to hold\" He sighed and stared at the cookie he was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to her?\" Celestia asked at seeing his faraway look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She couldn't stand the way ponies looked her and went on a diet. Now she is so thin she puts tooth picks to shame. I hated seeing her starve herself so we broke up. She is dating that Fancy Pants fellow now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor thing\" Celestia said as she enveloped him in her bulky legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is happy so what else can I ask for? This situation is pretty decent anyway\" He traced a cookie around her lips before she chomped into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could never go back to small portions. I mean really, food is so good! How could anypony deprive themselves of this?\" He placed a cookie on her nose. \"Now you're just teasing me\" She reached with her tongue and cheered when she pulled it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been giving them to you. You will have to work for the rest\" He held a cookie just in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia gave a fake sigh. \"But a fatty like me will never make such a long distance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe merely waved it in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine you brute.\" She made a show of tipping her head forward to reach it. She gobbled it and over dramatically panted. \"Oh I am so tired. How could you make a princess exert herself so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last one. You can work that jaw Celestia\" He placed to cookie between his teeth and wiggled his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia laughed and rippled. \"How sly of you. I think I can muster some strength for this one\" She reached her head forward and bit the cookie. She then surrounded his mouth and explored it to get the rest. White Wind became limp again but entwined his tongue to hers. This lasted for about five minutes before they broke apart and looked into each others eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best cookies ever\" Celestia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" he said tasting the chocolate that had once been on Celestia's teeth and looking ready to die without regrets. \"But I have got one more thing for you. Have you ever baked, Celestia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed. \"I can't say that I have\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe magically floated a bowl over to them. \"One thing common ponies sometimes do after baking is lick the bowl of any excess dough or frosting. My mother and I always made extra so we could munch on cold cookie dough\" He scooped a spoonful of uncooked cookies. \"We were never sure if we liked it better cooked or not so we always had both. Open up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia ate the chilly dough and jiggled as she shivered. \"So good. This should be the main desert at all the Galas. More!\" She had another bite and as she chewed he smeared some on her muzzle to lick off. It did not take long for the bowl to empty and she looked so sad when it did. She suckled the spoon to get as much of the taste as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would make more but as I said the castle is being restocked\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed and smiled up at him. \"It is alright. I just sort of wish I was full. Either that or I had an endless feast to munch on. But I'd rather you stay here with me anyway.\" Celestia amazingly turned over and covered White Wind with her belly and fore leg fat. \"And this will make it so you will stay with me all night\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind grinned like a fool. \"Try not to suffocate me.\" With that he laid his head on Celestia's other leg and they talked until they fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

She grinned when she saw she was alone and closed the door behind her. She lumbered through the royal pantry (how long had this been here?) and began searching for something tasty to eat. She found a bag full of apples and a tub of caramel sauce, much to her joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is better than dunking doughnuts in milk,\" Celestia said aloud. The let an apple sink in and pulled it back up dripping with sugar. She took a bite  and moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister!\" Luna shouted. Celestia spat her snack out in surprise. \"What do you think you are doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia turned to Luna with a guilty expression. She smiled feebly. \"Um... eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia, we had dinner twenty minutes ago. Have you forgotten the rules again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed and fell on her haunches which made her quiver and quake. \"I'm sorry Luna, I really am. I'm just so hungry all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rubbed her face with her hoof in exasperation. \"I know things are different in this era and we don't need to act so haughty anymore, but you don't act like a princess at all anymore. You don't wear your regalia or tiara anymore, you don't even try to listen in court, and you eat like a hog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia winced at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm sorry. It's not your fault you can't feel full. But really, this is most unbecoming. You don't act like a princess, you act like...\" Luna blinked as she watched Celestia regretfully lick some caramel off her original chin. Luna's thoughts wondered to the last two weeks of almost regular meals. The time Celestia discovered that grapefruit was dangerous, or when she first tried onion rings at that accursed White Wind's request. All the while, even when her stomach was growling, Celestia was smiling and laughing in a way that Luna barely recognized. It was back when they were still fillies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a normal pony,\" Luna sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Luna,\" Celestia said. \"I'm not trying to hurt anypony. I know that if I eat like I did the first two nights everyday Equestria would run out of food in a few months, but food is <i>so</i> good. I can't explain it, but all I want is to eat and eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna shook her head dejectedly. \"Having you been snacking behind my back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia's eyes shot around. \"N-no. Just these apples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked suspicious and and would later be glad she did. At that moment, White Wind Merrily walked in with a plate of brownies. \"Oh Celestia, I brought you usual after dinner desert,\" he sang before he noticed a guilty looking Celestia and an irritated Luna shooting him a death glare. \"Heh, heh. Maybe I should leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it right there,\" Luna said, shutting the door with her magic. White Wind nearly dropped the brownies in fear. \"So, you have been bringing my sister treats when I clearly told all the staff that doing so was prohibited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind was suddenly pulled away from Luna and into the pillow like fore legs of Celestia. \"Please don't be made at him, it's my fault. I should show self restraint but I don't. He's just being sweet to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind instinctively hugged Celestia before remembering he was in trouble. \"I am sorry, Princess Luna. Celestia- ahem, Princess Celestia has only been munching on thing. Really, the castle throws out more food a day than what I've been making for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna stepped up to them and Luna gazed into  White Wind's eye. \"Guard pony, tell me something, and be honest. Do you love my sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind gulped. They hadn't told anypony about their relationship for fear of paparazzi and Luna's wrath. But he decided it was do or die time. \"I... I do, Luna. I merely wish to see her happy. As it turns out, eating makes her happy. I'll do anything to please her and would never stop loving her and caring for her as long as I live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, sister, love this pony as much as he claims to love you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nodded fervently, making her upper body jiggle. \"With all my heart. He's kind and caring and talks to me honestly he treats me like... like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a normal pony,\" Luna finished. She smiled softly with her eyes closed. \"Alright, new rule; you can eat as much as you want whenever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia beamed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" Luna quickly added, \"he has to be the one to make it. You won't ask any of the chefs to cook you food if it isn't mealtime. If he can make it you may eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked incredibly happy. \"Luna, you have no idea how good it is to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you\" Luna pointed a hoof at White Wind. \"If you dare so much a chip her heart banishment to the moon will seem like a light sentence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite wind forced himself out of Celestia's grip and stood face to face with Luna. \"I would sooner die than break Celestia's heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked him over and smiled softly at them. \"Very well, enjoy your snack time. You'd better be out of here in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Luna. This means so much to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it. One of us has to be the bigger mare. Wait a minute, that's not me, is it?\" Luna snickered and Celestia groaned. \"Don't be like that, you really take the cake. And the brownies, the cookies, the ice cream.\" She laughed. \"Don't get angry with me, you are giving yourself more fluff than all the pillows in Equestria. I reserve my right as your sister to poke fun. You two enjoy yourselves while I make sure our country doesn't fall apart.\" With that Luna left Celestia and White Wind alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that worked out nicely, didn't it?\" No response. Celestia walked over to where he was still standing, unmoved from where he spoke to Luna. \"White Wind?\" She gently poked him and he fell over stiff as a board. \"I'll just carry you back to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife for Celestia was very different after her first super binge. First and foremost, she was now massive. Her Cutie Mark was stretched across her flank to where it was bigger than any of her royal staff. Her belly hung low between already thick legs and made regal walking impossible. Sitting on her rump completely actually raised her higher then any chair used too, not that any chair could survive her posterior. Her neck had long since vanished to be replaced by a mighty jowl. She was practically a fat filled pear if her body stopped jiggling long enough for her to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so wide that it seemed impossible to see around the over one thousand pounds that were Celestia without walking a little ways. Where once ponies got out of her way in fearful respect they now moved in fear of being squashed beneath her lard. The rich delegates at her court couldn't get a word in because they were so confused by the new shape of their princess. There was hardly a door in the palace she could fit through that wasn't a huge ornamental door. And she seemed so happy. Her servants were treating her less like a princess and more like a mother to be pleased. She had finally accepted the hidden glutton within her and life had become great. She loved strutting her blubber around the castle and seeing the stares of the aroused guards trying not to oogle her. She felt sexy and could hardly believe the effect she had on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia had an understanding Sister, a wonderful stallion taking care of her and a plate of brownies. Nothing could make this better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept to feel full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last one,\" White Wind said as he dangled a brownie over her head. She pathetically reached for it before falling back onto her pillow. \"Aw, my princess is all tuckered out.\" He shoved the brownie into her mouth and she chewed with a grateful coo. \"Be careful. If you eat like this you might get fat one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed. \"What are you talking about? I'm skinny and always will be.\" Their conversations consisted of nothings like this that were about how skinny or fat she was. Celestia pulled him close and gave him a kiss, allowing him to taste the chocolate he had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant what I said back there,\" White Wind said as they broke apart. He hugged against her thick chin. \"I love you, every pound. A better mare cannot be imagined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia almost cried with joy. \"Oh, my tiny little pony, I love you with every pound in my body. I don't know how I can express it better.\" Her stomach growled at her. \"Quiet you, we're having a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind laughed. \"Still hungry of course. You should have brought those apples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"Don't worry about it now. Just being here with me is enough for now.\" Her stomach growled again. \"Well, if you wouldn't mind going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind kissed here again and jumped off her to the floor. \"I will be back soon, my great big pony.\" He left her alone in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed contently an massaged her belly, kicking her legs slightly while feeling like a bloated water balloon or a stuffed pig. \"Calm down please. I sure wish I could make you full.\" She leaned into herself and began to dream about food again.</span></div></div>",

She moaned in frustration when her stomach growled at her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, bad tummy. Can't we go ten minutes without eating? I want to lay with White Wind.\" It gurgled back in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind chuckled and climbed her mountainous belly. \"Maybe this will help.\" He kneaded his hooves into her fat and she sighed in contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, yes, that's the spot. No wonder dogs like it so much.\" Her stomach remained silent as he did this. \"But I can't kiss you while you're up there. I wish there was some way to fill me up, at least for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind slid to Celestia's face and patted one of her chubby cheeks. \"Don't worry. Tomorrow I'll wake up and make enough extra blueberry pancakes to reach the ceiling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled. \"You spoil me, my tiny little pony. But, uh... could we get a midnight snack now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not even nine o'clock yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Celestia sighed. \"I'm just so hungry. It feels like everything I eat gets turned straight to fat.\" She rubbed the little bit of herself that she could reach. \"Not that that's terrible, but I would like to just hold you without having to be interrupted by my roaring hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know. I don't mind feeding you but it has to be annoying to not be able to go about your business without wanting to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind the eating part,\" Celestia said giggling. \"It's the hunger that gets me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhm. Too bad you can't just conjure more food with your magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia blinked at that. \"White Wind... after breakfast tomorrow, will you escort me to the castle library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe royal librarian struggled to keep her eyes opened as she nodded in and out of sleep. It sure was boring duty she had. None of the ponies at Celestia's School for Gifted Fillies ever came here to do any decent research, and the only pony who actually cared abut the dusty books had left some time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and turned a page of the book she was reading for the fifth time. She wished somepony would come with a desire to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the library began to shake with a massive tremor. The shelves rocked dangerously and books fell around the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earthquake!\" the librarian screamed before she jumped under her desk. As soon as it started, however, it ended. She shakily looked up to she her carefully maintained library a mess. She sighed. \"At least its something to do. Then the door opened and a disheveled guard stepped though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Presenting her royal highness, Princess Celestia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great white behemoth lumbered into the library, wedging itself through the door. The librarian rubbed her eyes at the site of Princess Celestia, a massive mare made of lard. She had heard Celestia had put on weight, but she had no idea it was to this extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hel... hello my... good... librarian...\" Celestia panted. \"I came to... to... I need a break.\" She promptly let her legs give out and crashed to the floor, making the room shake a bit. She wobbled with a silly grin on her face. \"That was intense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian blinked. \"Is she okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry,\" the guard said. \"She can walk just fine if that's what you're worried about. She's just a bit sore right now from the fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She tripped down the stairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian's eyes crossed as she realized she had actually experienced a marequake a bit ago. \"Right. How may I help you today? Will it be a diet book or a cookbook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard grinned. \"Ooh, there's a cookbook section? I'll gladly look at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was jok- never mind. Why is a half ton princess in my library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. She is hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you came to the royal library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did say you have cookbooks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant 'why is she a half ton?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, she's hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you messing with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia motioned to the librarian. \"Excuse her, White Wind, she hasn't caught on with what's happening. Good mare, to put it simply, I've embraced my appetite and and am glutting myself every chance I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian gaped at the massive princess. \"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia giggled. \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... because...\" Because why? It's not exactly like the librarian could tell the princess what to do with her body. \"Alright then, let's just pretend this is normal.\" She went behind the desk. \"Hello, and welcome to the royal Library. How may I assist you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please,\" Celestia said. \"I'm looking for matter related spells, specifically duplication spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duplication?\" the librarian mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind nodded. \"We wish to know if it is possible to multiply food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the tubby and blushing princess, who she just noticed wasn't wearing her royal crown and whatnot. \"Multiplication spells...\"</span></div></div>",

That's one of the basic laws of magic; you can't create something from nothing. In theory, you could turn something <i>into</i> food, but you can't make new food. The matter has to come from somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked crestfallen and felt a little dumb. How long had it been since she reviewed the basics of magic? That was the first thing taught after kindergarten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you do not mind if we look around anyway,\" White Wind said as he took Celestia's hoof. He was nowhere near big or tall enough to actually help her up, but Celestia appreciated the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to check out those cookbooks?\" the librarian teased. \"Better be careful. If you keep eating like I think you are then it won't be long until you end up bigger than a whale!\" The librarian immediately clamped her mouth shut when she said that. Why did she say that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia just took it in stride and offered a warm smile. \"You might be right. Wouldn't that be something?\" She sauntered off into the depths of the shelves, White by her side. The librarian sighed in relief, but was still tense and very confused. She gulped and tried to focus on cleaning up the books that had fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried very hard to the think about Celestia's hypnotic hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worse than nothing,\" Celestia said as she levitated a book back up onto the shelves. \"Master Star Force says the same thing as all the others; matter can't come from nothing.\" She smiled as a danish was brought to her her. She took a grateful bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not totally worthless coming here,\" White Wind said, being careful to balance the stack or books he had with him. \"I have got all sorts of new recipes to try. I think you'll love Zebra styled meals, they look to have a certain spicy flare about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nuzzled White Wind. \"You're always trying to please me. You don't have to work so hard for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. I want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia's smile became warmer. \"Well... I don't know what to do now. I was hoping for a way to ease my hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should just let things be. I don't mind feeding you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't mind being fed. I love it, believe me. I just wanted to actually feel full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm here for you. If you need anything, just say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed.</span></div></div>",

What do you have planned for me, my princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia got close to him and enveloped him in her fore legs and fat. \"Hmm, I think laying on top of you will suffice. All these pounds surrounding you, engulfing you, squishing you from above. You'll be absolutely smothered by all this fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind looked ready to pass out. \"Oh dear, how could I ever survive all that <i>mare</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll just have to be stallion enough,\" Celestia said sensually as she closed her lips around his. With a golden 'pop', the two vanished from the royal library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it!\" the librarian swore from the other side of the shelf Celestia's mass had just about been pressing against. \"Dear me, why did I want to watch that so bad?\" She thought for a moment as she noticed the cookbooks White Wind had forgotten. \"I wonder... How many other stallions like a full mare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind chuckled at Celestia with a pair far too small goggles. They squashed her face and looked a little uncomfortable, but Celestia said she was fine. White Wind had his own pair, though wasn't going to be of too much help. His expertise was in guarding and cooking, so he was there for moral support and looking up what ever Celestia may need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia scribbled furiously on a piece of parchment. \"Gah, so many runes to sort through. How many spells did Star Swirl actually come up with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically two. The rest were improvements of spells that already existed.\" White Wind opened a scroll. \"Ooh, time traveling for dimwits. Maybe I can stop myself from embaressing myself in school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Celestia asked, trying to turn her neck to him and forgetting she was too fat to do that. She shifted her form so she was looking at him. \"How'd you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A random tidbit I picked up from Miss Sparkle,\" White replied. \"You know she would go on those rants to anypony who had an ear when she learned something new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia's eyes lit up. \"That's it! White Wind, you're a genius!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia got out a fresh scroll and began to speak aloud as she wrote. \"My most faithful student Twilight Sparkle,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am working on a new project that I'd like assistance with. As you know, it is possible to transmogrify objects into other objects. I am attempting to duplicate objects and make an exact copy of them. It would be appreciated if you had any knowledge or ideas on the subject or could help me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sincerely, Princess Celestia.\" She rolled it up and made it pop out of existence. \"If Twilight Sparkle can't help me then nopony can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind smiled and opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are really determined to get something to eat, aren't you sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia and White Wind turned to see Luna standing at the door. \"Oh, hello Luna. I'm just performing some experiments. Not sneaking extra portions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that.\" Luna looked over the notes and runes Celestia had made. \"You're trying to completely change the face of magical theory as we know it. Doing so could revolutionize that way we live our lives. And why? Because my porky sister desires meals between meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, I fully support what you're doing. If you succeed, nopony will ever go hungry again. Maybe you'll even be satisfied.\" Luna began looking through the notes a little harder. \"I see you're on the right track at any rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled. \"Does that mean you'll help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded. \"Why not? It's been a while since we've had some time together. It sounds like... fun, I believe. Even if I don't think for a moment we'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia clapped her hooves together. \"Yay! Thank you Luna.\" She grabbed her sister in a hug. Luna blushed and hugged back, feeling a bit jealous that White Wind felt this every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scroll popped it front of Celestia and she opened it with her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it say?\" White Wind asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight?\" Luna asked. \"Is it Tuesday already?

She was so pleased that Celestia had decided to ask for her help with this matter. Twilight was so pleased that she used her newly learned and potentially dangerous long range teleport spell to make it in only a few minutes. She gave merry hello to the gaurds as she passed through the door. A servant was waiting for Twilight. He seemed a bit disheveled, but Twilight made no mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Star Swirl the Bearded wing, Lady Twilight,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blinked. \"But I didn't even ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed a hoof on her shoulder. \"I was told to wait for you. Yes, Celestia planned for you to already be here. No, nothing of world shattering importance is going on. We all really hope you can help her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she in trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing serious, but... be warned. Celestia's apatite has gotten the better of her.\" With that, the servant walked a few steps away before tripping and falling asleep on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight scratched her head and made a quick warp to the desired wing and knocked on the bars. \"Celestia, are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of her white colored teacher, Luna came up and opened the door. \"Salutations, Twilight. I trust you are well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked over Luna. Her regelia was barely hanging on and her crown was tilted. Her starry mane was limp. Despite this, she seemed almost giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.

Just... be prepared for a sight that will haunt the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight followed Luna inside and noticed the fallen books and scrolls all over the place. It looked like a earthquake had happened, but Luna said it was a marequake. But what was a....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's mouth hung open at the image before her. Celestia was eating a jelly doughnut with a plate of several others next to her head. She was laying on her side on the floor. A stallion brought another plat of doughnuts to her and pecked her on the cheek. Those things alone was enough to make Twilight's brain melt, but that wasn't the worst of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia was not fat. She wasn't obese. She was <i>masive</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, herro Twiwight,\" Celestia said through her treat. She swallowed. \"How was your trip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn't do anything for a minute except stare. Finally her brain reformed enough to form a thought. \"Princess... are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia blushed. \"Well, I had a little accident. I was so excited when you said you were coming that I... lost my balance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight suddenly realized what a marequake was. \"Celestia... why are you so... so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat?\" Luna interjected. \"Go ahead and tell her why you are fat, sister dearest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia patted her blubber. \"Don't get the wrong idea, Twilight. I'm perfectly fine. Healthy as always. I don't even think I can get sick anyway. The thing is, a few weeks ago, I had a realization. I love food. It's just so good that I could stop eating. My sister and the staff were so supportive that they let me eat to my heart's content. The thing is, after a few days of non-stop eating it became apparent that I can't feel full, or at least it takes a lot of food. I've never felt it, so I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight pointed at the stallion. \"And him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia pulled the stallion close and hugged him. Her forelegs were so thick that the stallion almost disappeared in her flab. \"This is White Wind, my new personal chef and coltfriend.\" She kissed him quickly but meaningfully. He returned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight wasn't sure how she felt. \"And you're... happy.\" It wasn't a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked almost like a filly caught stealing from the cookie jar. \"I am, Twilight. I know I'm a great big fatty now, but I feel good. I finally feel like... me, almost, if that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind was released and shook Twilight's hoof. \"It is nice to see you again, Lady Twilight. Eclair?\" He offered Twilight a doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shook her head and walked over to Celestia. \"Um... Celestia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my student?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I... may I hug you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled and reached our with her legs. \"Come here, my darling student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey embraced each other, and Twilight felt incredibly warm. \"It's so strange... I feel like a little filly again when you seemed like the great big powerful princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't think that changed all that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight chuckled and nuzzled Celestia's jowl. \"I guess it didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of hugs, jibes, and doughnuts later, Celestia finally stopped being lazy and picked herself off the ground. Twilight was a little intimidated by her size, but Celestia's motherly smile put her at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Celestia said as she waddled over to a table. Twilight giggled at Celestia's proud and hilarious waddle/strut. \"Think you can help us with this spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to duplicate items to make more food. I'm not sure, but we can try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked over some notes. \"I'm sure. This won't work at all. But it seems like it would be fun to waste our time trying to deny the laws of magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we get started?\" White Wind asked. Somehow he had conjured a plate of cupcakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I smell lemon,\" Celestia said as she levitated one and ate it in two bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked thoughtful for a bit.</span></div></div>",

That's a given. One thing I think they all have wrong, however, is that you can't make matter at all. It's simply about equivalent exchange. It's easy to turn something into something else. We just need to make energy into matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind scratched his head while looking over the complicated calculation on the other end of the scroll. \"You make it sound simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not simple in the slightest,\" Luna said. \"The amount of energy needed to do this is astronomical. It needs a higher concentration of power than my sister has pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia chewed on some sponge cake and looked thoughtful. \"Well... I am an alicorn. Maybe if Luna and I combine our power, we'd have just enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight scribbled a little more. \"This spell should definitely work. All it needs is power. If we can get it to work once, I'm sure we can tweak it afterwords for easier use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia daydreamed for a moment. She was surrounded by conjured food that was flowing into her mouth at a constant rate, a myriad of flavors passing her tongue and filling her stomach. Just growing bigger and bigger and bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister? Sister, are you dreaming about eating again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia shook her head. \"Sorry, you know how I am. Are we ready to give this a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" Twilight said. \"We're going to need everything you've got for this. You need to be mentally and physically peaked to do this. You need to consume energy and expend it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked ready to dance. \"So you're saying we need to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The more the better,\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked mortified for a moment. \"You had to say that, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, ooh, let's get them to make that quiche, and those wonderful spinach wraps, and it wouldn't be a meal without White Winds heavenly cookies...\" Celestia trailed of as she waddled to the dining hall. White Wind bounced behind her and Twilight followed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the quiche...\" Luna droned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had heard of animals that ate their weight in food between a weekly and daily bases. Celestia's gluttony seemed to have matched them, if not surpass it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harmph, omn, yum, ooooohhh, cream puffs, how I have missed you.\" Celestia popped puff after puff into her mouth while servant surrounded her with more food. Twilight hardly believe it as she watched Celestia actually accumulate fat before her very eyes. She grew like a sponge soaking up the meal and converting it straight to jiggling blubber. Twilight enjoyed the sight far more than she would readily admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna seemed a little frustrated with the situation, but was smiling all the same. Celestia was enjoying herself and that was all Luna could ask for. Well, no, she did want to ask her to stop, but that wouldn't be fair. She nibbled on her own meal and merely enjoyed her sisters happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind was obviously enjoying this as much as Celestia was. He hoof fed Celestia whenever Celestia wasn't feeding herself, which was most of the time because of her decadent demeanor. Whenever nopony was looking, he's sneak up behind her and hug her glorious growing butt. Celestia's eyes widened in surprise the first time, but the loved the feeling of being squeezed so tenderly. They both felt hot and giddy as she grew beneath his hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany hours later and the castle was once more out of food. Celestia's face was covered with sauces and chocolate that she struggled to lick off. White Wind was on her back... or maybe her neck fat, it was hard to tell, and was wiping of her face with his hoof and sticking it in her mouth to suck on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was baffled by Celestia's less than regal behavior. \"Wow. I'm not sure what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna pulled Twilight close and whispered to her. \"I understand that this is most uncouth, but let her enjoy herself. She's been ruler of this land longer than most can comprehend. She deserves to be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded. \"I know, I know. It's just... this isn't like the Celestia I imagined as a filly, or even the one I grew up with. She's more (and I can't believe I'm saying this), natural. Her happy face looks so real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiled. \"Thanks for understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia belched loud enough to rattle all the dishes around her. \"Well, urp, all the food gone. I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still not full,\" White Wind added after sliding down Celestia's cascading fat. He poked at her belly and made her ripple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. That's why we're doing this. Bring me the scroll.\" Luna and Celestia looked over the spell. \"All right I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I as well,\" Luna said. The sisters stared at a slice of cake and an empty plate next to it. \"If this work, and exact replica of this cake should appear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhh, strawberry,\" Celestia said. \"Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stood nearby by with notes to document this historic moment. White Wind Watched in anticipation as their horns began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an amazing flash and... </span></div></div>",

Twilight Sparkle began furiously scribbling down notes about this momentous occasion, while Celestia pulled White Wind into her flabby embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI... I do'nt belive it.\" Luna whispered \"We've successfully managed to create something from magic.\"  Twilight Sparkle, meanwhile was babbling to herself about different formulas and how more matter could be made from less energy and whatnot. Celestia scooped them all into a massive, flabby group hug. \"Oh I knew we could do it!\" she cried ecstatically. She and Luna suddenly felt fatigue hit them like a barrel of bricks heavier than the sun alicorn herself, said princess then promptly passed out and, luckily for everypony else, fell over on her back, causing another marequake and her huge body to  jiggle for several seconds before finally settling. Luna passed out as well, sinking into her sister's fat with a contented sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and White carefully pried themselves from Celestia's grasp and stood before the table. \"Can you believe it?\" Twilight asked quietly, \"We've managed to create matter from energy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm standing right here and I can hardly believe it.\" White Wind replied. He was actually starting to get giddy with the possibilities they had just opened up, he imagined Celestia surrounded by conjured food that was flowing into her mouth at a constant rate, a myriad of flavors passing her tongue and filling her stomach. Just growing bigger and bigger and bigger... \"Um, White?\" He was abruptly yanked from his fantasy by Twilight, who was standing in front of the table, looking at the replicated cake with fascination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come check this out will you? White Wind trotted over to the table and peered at the cake, it had indeed collapsed in the recent tremor and slumped in a heap, it did not look quite as appetizing as its template. Twilight carefully scooped up a glob of copied pastry and took a bite. \"The icing tastes watered down, the cake itself is like vanilla flavored paste and the filling tastes like underripe strawberries.\" She said with a sour look on her face. \"But it's actually quite filling.\" She returned to her notepad and hotter down some more notes. \"I'll have to research this further, but the recent events seem to have drained me.\" With that the lavender unicorn climbed onto her mentor's vast belly and fell asleep. White could do nothing more than the same, but not without trying some of the replicated cake first, it tasted exactly hoe Twilight described it, and it was indeed very filling. He then climbed up his marefriend's folds, snuggled into her jowls, and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

There was an explosion and a good deal of scorch marks left on the table and all ponies were blown back. But, as Twilight poked her snout over the table's edge, she could see that there definitely wasn't a new slice of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed. \"Sorry, Princess. I'm not sure if it was an error I made or lack of power, but it didn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna coughed and pulled herself back up. \"Experience is experience, Twilight. We'll simply have to try again some other time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to interrupt a moment,\" White Wind said as he pointed at Celestia, \"but we have a slight problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna and Twilight looked over at the mass of pony that was Celestia and they both stifled a giggle at the sight of her grand rear end. Her legs kicked uselessly as she struggled to get into a position where she could move. Her fat, however, would not let her roll to either side. She reminded all present of a turtle trying to get up from its own back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little help, please?\" Celestia whined a sweetly as she could. It was now, as she tried to see her valuable friend, sister, and lover in the room that she realized her own size. Her blubbery body prevented her from seeing most of the room and all she could see was her own fat. Celestia shuddered a little at how vast she was, and images of her growing larger filled her mind. She realized, if she succeeded in her quest and couldn't make herself full, she might eat herself into a castle size immobile blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also realized that she looked forward to the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, sister, I know you've become rather slug like, but you can't be lazy enough to use your magic to lift yourself back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... I can't. I'm out of magic. Used it all up for the spell that didn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rolled her eyes. \"Really, you couldn't of-\" Luna began but paused. She looked up at her own own with an expression of worry. \"I'm... I'm out as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight began to sweat. \"Uh, no offense, Celestia, but I don't think I have it in me to lift you with my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia waved a hoof, though only White Wind saw it past her fat. \"None taken. I have gotten a bit too big for my britches, haven't I? I'll just have to wait here until I recharge.\" She sighed and she expanded outward about half an inch. \"Oop, leftovers. Would you mind keeping me company, everypony? It can get lonely stuck on the flo- oof!\" White Wind had already hopped up on her and nuzzled her jowls. Twilight climbed up and giggled at the sensation of laying on her teacher's belly. Luna kicked off her shoes with a laugh and climbed up her sister as well. There was just enough of Celestia for the three of them to sit comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If somepony told me a month ago that I'd be sitting on my sister's stomach having tea time on top of her, I'd have sent them to a hospital for fear of their own mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea?\" Twilight said right before a cup of the brew appeared before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind smiled. \"I came prepared for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were prepared for Celestia blasting herself back and becoming immobile on the floor?\" Twilight said. \"You're even better at planning than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind chuckled. \"Not quite. I was prepared for the spell failing. Scones, anypony?\" A plate of the biscuits floated past them. Luna took one with her hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is unfortunate you are but one pony,\" Luna said after she swallowed a bite. \"I can see how my Sister would grow ever larger under the influence of your cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind blushed. \"You flatter me, princess.\" He bent closer to Celestia's head and magically lowered a scone and a cup to her mouth. \"Hungry, darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not not nice to tease,\" Celestia said playfully. She took a sip and a bite and sighed contentedly. \"Good thing you were ready for the inevitable failure. I knew there was a reason I kept you around.\" She opened her mouth wide and let two scones be pushed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was a bust,\" Twilight said. \"And idea what we should do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vere's mo may I'm witting,\" Celestia said through her full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you were,\" Luna sighed. \"I'm telling you, this isn't going to work. Plus, look at all the food you just ate. If we try this again, it won't be for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A point about that, actually,\" Twilight said. \"I think you might not have had enough time to convert the food into energy. We probably should have waited longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was too eager, you mean,\" Celestia said dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what happens when you are a greedy not-so-little piggy,\" White Wind replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia laughed. \"I'll have to know that I fit into my dresses just fine, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean those curtains you were wearing?\" White said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia blushed and giggled. \"I'd appreciate you not mentioning what we do alone in my bedroom, you cad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight laughed. \"Get me a picture, I'd love to see Celestia wearing a curtain to a ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rolled her eyes. \"Sometimes I wonder who is really the little sister in this relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind slapped Celestia's stomach. \"I think that's pretty obvious.\" They all laughed for another minute or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they settled down, Luna took another bite. \"In all seriousness, you can really cook, White. Why are you a palace guard and not a chef?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind blushed, magicking his armor off himself and setting in on the ground. This revealed a cutie mark in the shape of a wooden spoon and a sword crossed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically I am both. I found that cooking was my call, but so is protection. A friend of mine was being bullied while I was baking and I went to his aid. I valiantly used my spoon and the batter to drive the nasty colt off. Afterwords we had peanut butter cookies, and I had a cutie mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A multi-talent,\" Twilight said. \"Usually you see vague talents and not ones so specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was the chef for the barracks for a while and they loved me, but I took too long for the food and had to serve too many for it to be a reasonable job. So I settled for guard. I cannot complain, since I have the goddess of beauty as the softest bed in Equestria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia pulled White Wind into a hug. \"Flattery will get you everywhere. And three quarters of a ton of mare on top of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna laughed. \"I'm surprised that Celestia can be so paitient if you meals take time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I resent that,\" Celestia said with a silly edge. \"I am perfectly capable of waiting for White's amazing food. I'm not that much of a slob.\" They all felt their resting place rumble and jiggle beneath them. \"I wish I didn't have to, though,\" she added. Another scone floated into her mouth. \"Mmhh, so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Luna said. \"Somehow, someway, I'll get you to have the satisfaction of being full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little worried, though,\" Twilight said. \"What if her status as an alicorn and the mover of the sun makes it so she can't feel full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll their eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case,\" Twilight continued, \"All the food in Equestria wouldn't make her full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't thought of that...\" Celestia said. White Wind looked at her sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case,\" Luna said, \"then we'll stop when we get there. A ton? Two tons? It won't matter if we haven't even found a way to fuel her hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia had a few tears forming in her eyes. \"Thank you for being so understanding, Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just what sister do. Personally, I even a sister that I can use as a bed.\" Luna looked out the window. \"It's almost time for me to raise the moon. You'll just have to sleep here for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Celestia said slyly. \"We'll set up a day when you can sleep on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna blushed. \"Um, ah... Am I so transparent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia giggled. \"Call it sister's intuition. I know how comfy I am, Luna. You can even come back when you're done and we can have a sleep over on me tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Twilight cheered as she clapped her hooves. \"I'm great at ghost stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab a fold and get comfy, then, because I know ghost stories as old as Equestria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each giggled and Luna went off, feeling her magic start to return. She pondered the issue of Celestia's monster apatite and wished she had more candy from Nightmare Night to give her. Luna shrugged and went off, deciding it was best to worry about it some other time.</span></div></div>",

I need some sugar.\" Luna retreated into her room, panting from the exhaustion of having to raise the moon with so little magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached a chest a opened it, revealing her secret stash of goodies. \"Ahh, Nightmare Night, if there's one thing you do for me, it's give me something sweet to eat.\" She reached in and grabbed a hoofful of the teeth rotting candy and closed the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind wandered to the fact that the chest held just one town's worth of offerings to her as Nightmare Moon. It was enough to fill a pretty sizable chest. If she had visited every town in Equestria on Nightmare Night, she wouldn't know what she'd do with it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's eyes widened and she dropped the chocolate bar she was about to eat. If all those ponies made enough food, it would never fit in the castle. If every pony made something, there's be miles and miles of things to eat, more than one pony could dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark Alicorn grinned and laughed. \"Oh, sister of mine, prepare yourself for a meal you will never forget. If you aren't full after this then there is no hope to be had.\" Luna ran off to inform the palace and get her plan in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a week after the first indecent with the failed spell, and not a whole lot of progress had been made. Naturally, Luna wasn't going to let Celestia binge, especially since she had obciously gone from half a ton to who knew how much now. Still, Celestia enjoyed herself very much. She and Twilight would pretend she was that giant Alicorn while she was a little fill, safe in the giant mare's hug. She and White Wind would enjoy meals in the garden, talking of this and that and their love, doing the things that ponies in love tended to do. And she found her larger self all the more appealing, a self pampering form that made her feel relaxed and whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecretly, White Wind and Twilight knew of Luna's plan. Twilight was doing a lot of work to get things going, but White Wind had his own part that was very important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia was laying in the garden with White Wind at her side, enjoting her own reflection of the bollowing mare that stared back. \"Do you think it's wrong that I like staring at myself?\" Celestia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite smiled. \"I am not exactly the pony to ask. You will find that I am biased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia giggled. \"Fair enough. Still, I wonder why I find my blubbery self so appealing. I sometime wonder what it would be like to just eat and grow right out of the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia grinned to herself as White shivered in anticipation. White playfully swatted his mare's fat. \"You teasing cow. You know my opinion already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia wobbled, forgetting that she could no longer shrug. \"Maybe.\" She frowned at her reflection. \"I've been thinking, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fat, my eating, my growing. At, of course, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind patiently listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secretly, White... I find myself wanting to grow. I want to be bigger and fatter, until the only thing I can do is use my magic. To just laze around, basking in the glow of my sun. And even then, when I'm a blob of a pony, I just keep eating and growing anyway. Am I selfish? Am I disgusting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wing climbed up Celestia's neck folds and gave her a passionate kiss. \"Celestia, I'll love you no matter what. My love for you runs deeper than your body. And, besides that, this just sounds better to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's the problem,\" Celestia said. \"What will I be at such a massive size? Can I still make ponies happy? And what about you? You're my tiny little pony now, but by then, you'll be a speck. There's no way we'll be able to do anything together, especially if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind raised a brow. \"If?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we want children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind felt ready to explode. \"Celestia... are you really thinking of giving me that honor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sniffled. \"I've never felt this way about anypony. But I don't want you trap you with a mare that can't do anything, especially when we can't even make love together. We can barely do it now. And then there's the fact that I'll out live you, and if we wanted children-\" Celestia was cut off as White Wind pressed his lips against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled back, massaging her jowl. \"Worry not, my great big pony. I will always be here for you. If you desire to be fed until all you can do is wiggle your nose, then I shall feed you so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia had tears in her eyes as she nuzzled him. \"I'm being silly, anyway. It's not like I can have all that food anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, can't you?\" Luna said. Celestia, finally used to her large mass, turned her whole body around to face her sister, who looked ready to collapse. \"I have done it, my dearest sister. I have prepared a feast to end all feasts. If this doesn't satisfy you, nothing will!\" Luna stood on her hind legs and flailed wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia blinked. \"Luna, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may want to calm down,\" White Wind added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna took a breath and got back on her legs. \"Oh, yes, excuse me. I've been without sleep for the past few days. But it shall be worth it!\" Luna tugged at Celestia fat leg. \"Come, come, you must eat. A gluttonous, food filled life awaits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna, what are you talking about?\" Celestia asked, obviously worried but intrigued. White Wind only chuckled, letting Luna do what she wanted. \"Did you got the spell working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even close,\" Luna said as danced a little. \"A thought occurred to me a while ago. I have a night in which ponies give unto me piles of sugary delights, all because I bring the night and give them a scare.But what about you? There isn't a holiday to celebrate you and all you do for Equestria. Sure, we have the Summer Sun Celebration, but that's just for the sun, not you. So I decided; we need a knew holiday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia tried to let her jaw to drop, but it was quite difficult against her chins. \"You started a new holiday? For me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And everypony came!\" Luna cheered. \"To celebrate the wonderful, mother-like mare that raises that sun. To celebrate the bounty your wisdom brings, the ponies have decided to give some back. So the ponies of Equestria have come togather and they each have brought you a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia blinked a drool started to drip from her mouth. Her stomach rumbled, her body jiggling in excitement \"D-did you just say... everypony in Equestria brought me a meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna zapped them with her magic, and the next thing Celestia knew she was on a grand platform at the base of the mountain Canterlot stuck out of. Ponies as far a celestia could see, cheering for you, carrying packages of hot meals and desserts. Her nose was hit with the scents of a thousand home cooked dinners and she loudly rumbled again. More than that, though, she heard her ponies cheer and saw their smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia began sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-these ponies c-came... just to f-feed me?\" Celestia cried. She had never thought her subjects loved her so much, to come all this way just to bring her food, despite the absurdity of it, despite that fact that she was now a blubber ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did!\" Twilight said as she ran up to her teacher. \"Let me introduce you to the first Solar Siesta! A day where we celebrate the wise princess who's led us all these years. They each brought you something to eat and want to give you a hug.\" She blushed. \"I hope you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia grabbed Twilight, White Wind, and Luna in a hug and tried her best to absolutely smother them. \"Oh, oh, my ponies.\" She began kissing them each on the cheek. \"My ponies. My wonderful, blessed ponies. How could I ever thank you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat!\" Luna said as she pulled away. She cleared her throat, then shouted in her Royal Canterlot Voice, \"<b>We thank you for coming, ponies of Equestria, and showing Celestia your love. Celestia will be ready to eat for meals and will grow accordingly with your love. You may gather around her and show her your love, but be careful, as she will get massive.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia laughed. \"You say that as if you know so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna pulled out a chocolate bar and stuffed it into Celestia's mouth, earning a moan. \"I most certainly do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Wind gave Celestia a passionate but quick kiss, sharing the chocolate with her. \"I'll have a special present set up for you later, by great big pony. I'll see you later.\" White Wind and Luna walked away, while Twilight stayed to regulate the ponies that advanced. With a surprising amount of decorum, the ponies began to bring her meals ranging from the simple to the elegant. And all of them, young or old, classy or country, gave Celestia a hug as she ate. And Celestia made sure to hug each and every one of them back and to tell them how much she loved them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she ate, Celestia grew. It wasn't long before she ballooned passed a ton, and she just kept going, growing more pounds, more blob like, and more happy with every bite she took...</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s one of the most fundamental laws of magic which no pony can change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am sorry that I can\u2019t be of help to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour faithful student,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she read the letter, Celestia\u2019s heart sink. She had been so sure that Twilight would have been the one pony that could help her, but even the brightest student she had was able to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Celestia, it looks like we\u2018ll have to try on out own.\u201d White Wind said, seeing Celestia down at the news, \u201cbut we\u2019ll keep trying if you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed dear sister. If you still wish to try this impossible endeavour, we shall assist you\u201d Luna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia gave a small smile, happy for the support her sister and coltfriend giving her and that they\u2018re still willing to try even without Twilight\u2018s help.  Looking through her notes again, Celestia began to wonder if she was indeed just wasting her time trying to create food with magic, yet her grumbling belly pushed her to keep trying. However as time went on she was starting to get to the end of her patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps it is time you gave up sister.\u201d Luna said, consolingly to her older sister,  \u201cYou should go get some rest, I\u2019ll go get some of the staff to come and clean the place. It\u2019s a complete mess in here, total chaos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Celestia stopped what she was doing as an idea popped into her head. Smiling, she then turned to face Luna and White Wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe I know somepony that could solve this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Are you mad?!?</b>\" Luna yelled loudly and with the royal Canterlot voice, she can yell very loud indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Luna, remain calm.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm!? Sister, you\u2019re going to set Discord free, risking all of Equestria and our citizens, just so you can eat as much as you want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuna, I understand I am risking a lot for the sake of feeling full, but if he is the only one that can do the spell. I must try.\u201d  Celestia said. She then looked over to White Wind, \u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to admit, Princess Luna is right that it is dangerous to let the spirit of disharmony free.\u201d the stallion said, \u201cbut \u2026 I believe you know what you are doing, my Princess.\u201d he then smiled encouragingly at Celestria who returned the smile along with a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rolled her eyes and gave a sigh of defeat, \u201cOh\u2026 fine, you can try sister, but I insist that you at lest be careful and take some precautions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything will be alright.\u201d Celestia said as she waddled off towards the royal stature  garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia stared at the stature that was the petrified draconequis. For awhile Celestia wondered to herself if this was such a good idea. After all the things spirit of chaos had done and the suffering he has caused to countless ponies, including her own student and her friends, she wanted to just take a sledgehammer and smash the stature to pieces, but she knew that she couldn\u2019t do that. For one it would feel right and two, as much as she hated to have to ask him, Discord might be the one pony that could help her in finally feeling full. Soon her horn began to glow as she used her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white alicorn watched as the stone cracked and break off and Discord was free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYAWN! Ahhh, it\u2019s good to be free and stretch my legs again.\u201d Discord said as he stretched his body in the same manner as somepony getting out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiscord\u201d Celestia said sternly, her eyes never leaving the draconequis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, dear Celestia. How nice of you to greet\u2026\u201d Discord said as he turned to face the Princess, \u201cHoly Guacamoly Celestia, what the hey happened to you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia did her best to ignore the rude tone in the spirit of chaos\u2019 remark and if lecturing a disobedient  student, \u201cFor your information, Discord, after you were last imprisoned, in the last few weeks, I made a great discovery. I have a great love of food. I love it so much that I just kept eating. Fortunately my sister and the castle staff have been so very supportive and understanding, they allow me to eat to my heart\u2019s desire, although after the first few days of non stop eating, I found that I was never full, no matter how much I ate my stomach keeps wanting more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that is fascinating,\u201d Discord said as he snapped out of his shocked stupor, \u201cbut I really should go. Places to go, chaos to spread. Ta ta Celestia, be sure not to trip and cause an earthquake.\u201d with that, the mismatched creature snapped his fingers, planning to teleport away, but nothing happened. Blinking in confusion, Discord snapped his fingers again, yet still nothing happened. The spirit of Disharmony kept snapping his fingers, trying to get his magic working when a amused giggling reached his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is your doing isn\u2019t?\u201d Discord hissed as he glared accusingly at the massive sun Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smirk crossed Celestia\u2019s lips, \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I would set you free and not take some precautions, did you?\u201d her smile grew wider as she saw the sneer on the draconequis\u2019 face,  \u201cI had an number of spells, some of them worked and improved on by Starswirl the Bearded, designed for the purpose of weakening and containing chaotic magic. A magic shield had also been put around the garden to stop you leaving when you want. My captain of the guards is quite skilled when it comes to  casting shields.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know this won\u2019t hold me long.\u201d Discord said crossing his arms across his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong enough to keep you here and put you back into you stone prison if you don\u2019t listen to what I have to say.\u201d Celestia snapped back, shoot him a glare as cold as ice. \u201cIn any case, the reason I taking this risk in freeing you is because recently I\u2018ve been trying working on a spell that would more or less change the rules of magic. I had hoped to make a spell that creates food out of nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, all of my attempts have proven to be less then successful. I then realized that the one pony that can ignore this law to do it is you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Discord raised his eyebrow, surprised at hearing this. \u201cYou expect me to help you be able to get something for you to eat whenever you feel like?\u201d he let out a sharp laugh and leaned closer to the fat princess\u2019 face, \u201cforgive me for asking, but tell me, why should I?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the scowl he had expected, Celestia simply gave him a smirk as she replied, \u201cWell, Discord,  if you\u2019re not willing to help, Luna already have the Elements of Harmony ready for Twilights and her friends to use on you and trap you in stone. This time forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord considered his options. On the one hand, he refuses to help Celestia and risk getting  turned to stone by the elements yet again, but on the other hand, a part of him chuckled as he imagined the look on Twilight Sparkles\u2019 face when she sees what his work does to Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So it comes down to either getting beaten back into a stony prison by Twilight Sparkle and her pesky friends or have some fun turning one of Equestria\u2019s most loved rulers, the same princess responsible for his defeat and imprisonment for a thousand years, into a blob of blubber\u2026 </i>Discord thought to himself, <i> well that\u2019s a no brainer.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Celestia,\u201d he spoke up, a wide grin on his face, \u201cI\u2019ll do it, you can call off your sister and your precious little student.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt hearing Discord agreeing to help her, Celestia\u2019s face brightened, \u201cThat is good to hear, Discord.\u201d with a flash of her horn, Celestia turned off the spells keeping Discord contained. She then turned and make her way back to the castle with the spirit of chaos following, \u201cI\u2019m sure that in time, you\u2019ll see that you made the right decision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I well\u201d Discord replied, flashing a snaggletooth smile as he made a large apple pie appear out of thin air in celebration of regaining use of his magic, \u201cin the meantime, care for some pie?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hadn't seen Luna since their day in Ponyville. Well, more or less. Sure they had passed each other once or twice, but so far they hadn't even shared a meal together. After a thousand years, Celestia had been so excited to get her little sister back, and yet it felt like she hadn't returned at all! She had been determined to give her sister her space, but it was clear she'd have to do something to get them to reconnect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking a few of the guards got Celestia to the library, where she had been assured Luna spent almost all of her time. It was evening, in fact Celestia had just set the sun, so she knew Luna would be up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister?\" Celestia called as she entered the library. She got no response, but could hear a low muttering. So the goddess being began to trot up and down the aisles, trying to trace down the source of the muttering. She found it where she found Luna. The alicorn appeared to have attempted to entomb herself with books, her desk and all the space around her filled with books upon books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna!\" Celestia called, trying to get Luna's attention. The midnight pony looked up with a start, revealing noticeable bags under her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sister.\" Luna's voice was half-dead. \"Dost thou need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanguage. Right. Celestia mentally filed away a reminder to talk to Luna about updating her vocabularly, but now wasn't the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, sister? I haven't seen you in a week. You haven't had any trouble adjusting to the modern day, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trouble? Trouble?\" Luna's voice rose the barest hint before she controlled herself. Celestia nearly hit herself for that. It was so much harder to be tactful around Luna, and she had said perhaps the worst possible thing. She needed to make amends, quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you had your breakfast? Perhaps I can help with your studies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have had breakfast, thank you.\" Luna magically raised a mug of tea. Celestia blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna, that's no breakfast! Come, why don't we go to-\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"A...cafe?\" Luna said slowly, sounding out the word as she heard herself. Celestia sighed. Luna hadn't even grasped what the word \"fun\" meant, since it had only been invented some 300+ years ago. Once again, Celestia reminded herself one of the first books she would place in front of Luna would be a contemporary encyclopedia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a cafe. It's a small eatery with snacks that serves warm beverages, like tea, cocoa and coffee and treats like pastries...brownies, cupcakes...tarts...strudel...cake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia drifted off as visions of all those pastries swam in her head. Luna had to tap her front hoof on the floor loudly to get Celestia to shake it off. Luna stared and tilted her head back slightly, closing her eyes as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. Show us this \"cafe\" of which thou speaks.\" Luna said, hiding some interest in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outskirts of Ponyville, by a small dandelion field just opposite of the road, was a nondescript cafe known to only a few choice ponies. The drinks were warm and the snacks were sublime. Everything served inside was made from scratch using homemade recipes and even using techniques, ovens and...basically everything used in making their food and drinks had been passed down from generation to generation, of course repaired or retouched when necessary while whoever was taking the wheel for the appropriate ownership adding their own twists to meet with the changing tastes of contemporary ponies of Ponyville. Celestia look around, admiring the quiet and sunny day while Luna nervously stole glances, worried about how to behave herself in public. She tended to shy away when greeted in the street or even mutter a quiet and nervous \"Hello\" back as she passed by, trying to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sister waited for their afternoon treat to begin, they were presented with two frothing mugs of cocoa on a silver platter, used as a sign of formality by the owners whenever Celestia came to dine or just relax with a drink. Luna eyed the beverage curiously, but relaxed at the enticing sweet smell of hot cocoa combined with a generous dollop of marshmallow fluff floating on top. Celestia drank hers slowly, savoring the taste with the same grace as she did with just about everything. Luna, however, had no idea what to think as her first sip was...incredible. She had never tasted anything of what Equestria now had to offer in terms of sweets and this was just the start! Luna wasted no time in gulping the hot beverage down, fluff stained to the front of her face before licking it off and requesting a refill, using her ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE in her excitement. This at least assured that her request was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her refill was brought to her, Luna couldn't help but drool inside her mouth as she smelled a plate of warm, fresh fudge brownies brought to her. Just as Celestia picked one up for herself, Luna was essentially sticking her face in the plate and gobbling them up, crumbs flying in different directions and fudge staining her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DELICIOUS!\" Luna proclaimed, once again forgetting to control her voice. Celestia pulled out some fuzzy pink earphones and put them over her ears before Luna continued. \"WE WOULD LIKE TO TRY ONE OF ALL YOUR ESTABLISHMENT'S PASTRIES IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna proclamation brought forth what was seen by many, for her, an obligatory bolt of lightning that stuck dangerously close to somepony's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I can fix that.\" Celestia reassured the nearby ponies who witnessed the spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed as she watched Luna glut herself. When she said one of everything, she wasn't exaggerating. The waiter brought forth one order of each and every sweet treat they had on their menu. Celestia could only stare in awe as Luna somehow packed each bite away, showing no sign of slowing down or even hitting the wall as she made her way through all twelve flavors of the cafe's homemade cheesecake, all nine varieties of dessert pie and 25 different plates of cookies...just to name a few!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plates stacked tall enough they could reach to Celestia's head if placed on the ground once Luna had finally eaten her fill. The dark Alicorn's belly was absolutely bloated with treats and at least fifteen mugs worth of hot chocolate; her belly was almost as big as the rest of her body! Celestia could only stare, dumbstruck as Luna belched uncharacteristically, her face blushing a light shade of blue as she brought a hoof to hr mouth and shyly excused herself in a quiet voice. Luna cooed in a mix of pleasure and discomfort as she rubbed her hooves on her bloated, stuffed belly, falling out of her seat with a loud THUD while enjoying the feeling of basically turning herself into a food-stuffed balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed as she looked on at what was likely yet another, very unexpected, consequence of 1,000 years of cultural alienation. Food, she admitted, HAD improved much over the past millennium. She looked to the side so no one could see the Princess's fair white face blushing as she remembered how Luna's behavior had not been terribly different from her own whenever a new, delicious foodstuff had been created in the past. Luna moaned, her face tired and lethargic as she picked herself up as best she could, her glutted belly resting against the ground as she decided... </span></div></div>",

She raised her nose upwards, sniffing and searching out only the most favorable of scents. She finds a small street-side hay sandwich place with good cider in no time flat, swooping forward and dropping a bag of bits on the counter with a loud, jingly thud as her mouth waters. The pony at the counter stares in awe, wondering if Luna was merely being generous in paying this much. She learned otherwise as she saw Luna devour sandwich after sandwich with no effort, leading the pony to wonder if Luna was even actually eating them or just swallowing them whole. It only took her a good thirty minutes to finish all of them, her stomach bloated even further with her first lunch and about a gallon's worth of cider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she moved on to a bakery nearby, greedily eying the Sachertorte sitting in the window next to some muffins and teacakes. Fitting her swollen gut through the door as best she could, she placed her obscene order as usual, leading the pony writing it down to stare in awe and drop her pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia wandered around looking at bakeries wondering where her sister had gone to. She'd vanished for a good five hours now and the sun was setting. True, it wasn't exactly unusual in context that one who was formerly in command of night would be partial to staying out late, but Celestia couldn't help to worry for her dear sister. As she looked around, she saw what resembled a large, black shadow of sorts. A large, dark, round shadow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me...\" Celestia said to herself, her eyes wide and her mouth agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, there Luna lay in some oft grass on the side of the road. In her throes of binging, she stuffed herself so full even she finally gave in and decided to rest. Her body, now a large and bulbous 600lbs or so, lay with her legs pulled close and her head held low as she snored gently to herself. Luna drooled and smiled, giggling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no, more. As much as we enjoy thine foodstuffs, we are most filled to bursting at this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed, using her magic to lift Luna up and carry her back to the castle, as she continued to sleep like a babe. In a flash, the Alicorn Princess teleported all the way back to the castle, in Luna's room. Slowly, she placed her obese and beloved sister into her luxurious bed, which groaned under her weight, and tucked her in. Celestia gave Luna's fat body a gentle hug, Luna cooing happily without exactly knowing why in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet Dreams, sweet sister Luna.\" Celestia said with a smile, using her magic to slowly close the door behind her. Luna smiled gently, dreaming on about more cakes and creamy treats as the moonlight shone from the window on her smiling face.</span></div></div>",

Helping her squeeze out those awful feelings while she kept her expression calm and strong, just as her sister would need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll right, maybe she wasn\u2019t completely stoic. After all, if Big Macintosh could shed a tear at his sister\u2019s sadness, then she certainly could too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr more than just one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd let her own lip wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her sister as she cried against her, silencing her own inhibitions about Sweetie smearing chocolate over hear coat. Just a day after a spa visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Sweetie\u2019s happiness was far,<i> far</i> more important than any spa visit, or her mountain of work, or anything else she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her head down, and kissed the top of Sweetie\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie was her sister. And she would do <i>anything</i> to make her sweet little smile come back out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the touch of her lips, Sweetie stopped her shuddering, and looked up. Her eyes were no longer full of sadness, but each of the raw, red lines that cracked around their edges was matched by a cut through Rarity\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, who could have <i>done</i> this to her innocent, <i>sweet</i> little sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that would have to wait. After all, Sweetie required delicacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel better, hmm?\u201d she asked, widening her smile as far as she could without letting it seem strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Sweetie Belle sniffed again, but she did give her a smile. Even if it wobbled almost as dreadfully as it did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Sweetie,\u201d she murmured, with just a tiny hint of persuasion. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a momentary glance behind herself, and sat down as she saw there was no mess to get herself into. She patted the carpet next to her, and Sweetie\u2019s smile warmed her heart so well that she failed to notice that little swell of her rump spreading outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, for <i>goodness</i>\u2026</span></div></div>",

She was back to being the mature, calm older sister that Sweetie <i>needed</i> at this moment. Sweetie nuzzled against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had got it right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was merely the beginning. So that spurt of pride could stop right were it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight. She could do this. She just had to remember to be gentle with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened, Sweetie,\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie looked down again. She was possibly being pulled by her enormous eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo harsh. Well done, Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice faded, and Sweetie pressed against Rarity\u2019s side. Never before had she felt more compelled to throw her hooves around her and pull her into a big, tight, <i>sisterly</i> hug. But she didn\u2019t. That wasn\u2019t what she was going for, today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settled for another stroke through her mane. And another. And another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as many as it took for Sweetie to answer the questions that burned deep within her. What in Equestria could make her sweet, friendly little sister hide herself away for days? What would want, or <i>dare</i> to make her cry? What would make her seek out the comfort of over <i>a hundred bits\u2019</i> worth of imported chocolates?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not the time, Rarity.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was about Sweetie Belle. She was upset. No, she was<i> terribly</i> upset. <i>Frightfully</i>, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose chocolates didn\u2019t matter; none of this mess did. If only she could see Sweetie smile again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she would have to be patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seconds ticked by, with nothing but the sound of Sweetie\u2019s mane softly rustling under her gentle hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on, Sweetie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s it, darling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her hoof again, back to resting around Sweetie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just <i>choked</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to stop herself from going stiff. After all, Sweetie was upset. This wasn\u2019t the time for such\u2026 coldness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, she had <i>choked</i>. <i>Choked</i>?! And Sweetie called <i>her</i> a drama queen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, Rarity,\u201d Sweetie continued, in that voice of hers that wobbled and cracked and nearly did the same to whatever was holding Rarity\u2019s expression together. \u201cI was doing everything like you said to! I kept my breathing under control\u2026 I held onto the microphone when I needed to\u2026 I even kept my eyes shut most of the time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice cracked. Her green eyes stared directly into Rarity\u2019s blue, all wide and shiny and wobbling and <i>endlessly</i> cute, supported by a quivering chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, she could be forgiven. A thousand times over. For whatever it was she said. Or implied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Sweetie\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie let her gaze fall to the floor. A tear join it a moment later, but it was the only one. Which was good news for Rarity\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d she mumbled, her voice heavy. It called for another stroke. \u201cBut I saw some\u2026 some ponies in the audience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor darling\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe meant that. Truly, she meant that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026 I-I just froze up!\u201d she croaked. \u201cI could hardly breath anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cringed even further. Rarity felt her own lip wobble. Just the once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then Ms Cheerilee came over\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough was enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just\u2026 just <i>torturing</i> poor Sweetie, now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh\u2026\u201d she soothed again, wrapping both her hooves around Sweetie. She meant to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Sweetie Belle. I know exactly how you feel, but not to worry, everything will be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently rocked her little sister, like their mother had done with her all those years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths ago, actually. There was that fashion shoot that blighted her memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019ll everything be \u2018fine\u2019?\u201d Sweetie Belle cried. She just about refrained from turning her big eyes onto Rarity again. \u201cThose ponies\u2026 they were <i>laughing</i> at me\u2026\u201d Rarity gently nuzzled the top of Sweetie\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Sweetie\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m just not cut out to be a singer\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything, despite her years of learning to control her emotions, Rarity did jump this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. No. No!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Sweetie, I <i>refuse</i> to let you tear yourself up like this,\u201d she said, allowing a little bit of force back into her voice. Just a little, though. She didn\u2019t want to shake any lingering tears free. \u201cWhy, you\u2019re a far better singer than <i>any</i> of those ponies! You have the most <i>adorable</i> voice, Sweetie\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her cheek across Sweetie\u2019s forehead, and smiled down at her. She couldn\u2019t bring one out in her sister, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that \u2018cause you have to,\u201d Sweetie mumbled, every voice crack doing the same to Rarity\u2019s heartstrings. Again. \u201cYou\u2019re my sister\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I<i> am</i> your sister, Sweetie.\u201d She nuzzled her again. \u201cBut that just means I have more opportunity to hear your singing.\u201d She gave her a soft smile. \u201cBelieve me, Sweetie, you have the voice of Cade-\u201d No. She couldn\u2019t say <i>that</i>. That was <i>much</i> too\u2026<i> trite</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe voice of Cadence?\u201d ventured Sweetie, the barest hints of a smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to make them grow and flourish, Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter,\u201d she said, putting a hoof under Sweetie\u2019s chin. \u201cYou have a voice that would <i>melt her heart</i>, Sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity\u2019s nearly did the same. Underneath the huge, shiny eyes and behind the wobble, there certainly <i>was</i> a smile on Sweetie\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small one, yes. One that she might still be worried about if she saw Sweetie wearing it at the end of a school day, and then would most definitely not bite her hooves all afternoon over whether to check up on her. But it was a start, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Rarity,\u201d Sweetie said-no, wait, she chirped-before wrapped her hooves around Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. They both smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, darling,\u201d Rarity murmured, back to running her hoof through Sweetie\u2019s mane. She planted a kiss there, too. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of getting your confidence up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. That <i>would</i> be all of it, wouldn\u2019t it? If only she could get Sweetie to feel more secure in her own ability, then certainly she would be able to show it off more easily. The there would be no more heartbreaking routines like this, no more masses of bits disappearing into Sweetie\u2019s mouth, and Sweetie would get to show the whole of Equestria what a truly wonderful little filly she was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was brilliant. The perfect Rarity plan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it needed was somewhere to start, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked her gaze over to the curtains. Though they were still closed, and she held back using her magic on them during such a\u2026 <i>tender</i> moment, the little slivers of glorious sunshine that slipped through the gaps gave her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I know exactly where you can go for that, Sweetie.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Taking one last look at the wide, open street, she turned and walked back to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step made her hooves twinge, and dull aches that had nothing to do with the ones in her chest throbbed in her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she <i>had</i> spent too long just lying around on her bed. And eating chocolates. And feeling pretty miserable\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be thinking about that now. Even if it still felt like there was a whole in her chest, she was supposed to be thinking happy thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Rarity\u2019s warm, soft smile made it just a little easier to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome along, Sweetie\u2026\u201d said Rarity, a frilly hanky hovering in her blue glow. \u201cWe can\u2019t have you be a mucky-pup for when your friends see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t even move her head back as Rarity softly rubbed the cloth over her mouth. Something awful was just eating at her insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been <i>days</i> since she\u2019d seen Apple Bloom and Scootaloo. How were they feeling? Were they just as upset as her about the audition? Were they\u2026 were they\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t even anything sweet left on her lips for her to try and distract herself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere they going to be <i>angry</i> with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her eyes up from where they had dropped to, and aimed them squarely at Rarity\u2019s. Something made her sister look all blurry. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if they don\u2019t want to see me?\u201d she asked, her voice cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity opened her mouth, but closed it before she could say anything. She smiled, and her eyes softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Sweetie,\u201d Rarity said, but her voice was more like a whisper. Sweetie felt her sister\u2019s forelegs wrap around her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust being held there, with Rarity\u2019s hooves gently stroking her forehead, made that empty feeling inside seem a whole lot smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed her head against her sister\u2019s warm fur. She didn\u2019t want this to end. She didn\u2019t want to feel all cold and empty and lonely again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you go thinking such nonsense, darling,\u201d Rarity said, pulling away. She softly kissed her cheek. She was still smiling, and the way her eyes twinkled made Sweetie\u2019s middle feel all nice and warm again. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re just dying to see you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right, sis,\u201d Sweetie said. She stood up just a little bit straighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the others would be happy to see her again! They were the Cutie Mark Crusaders Best Friends For Life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could just imagine their smiles now\u2026 It was enough to make that empty feeling get even smaller!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity tittered, and nuzzled her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Sweetie,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNow run along and enjoy yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile was more of a smirk, now, and Sweetie couldn\u2019t help but match it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and galloped away, her heart singing again. \u201cSee you later, Rarity!\u201d she called over her shoulder, before setting her sights firmly on Sweet Apple Acres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe houses and smooth streets slipped away, and a rough track bordered by apple trees took its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t remember the trip to Apple Bloom\u2019s being this hard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, she stole a glance at the sun. It didn\u2019t seem to be burning any brighter\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. What was she thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Celsestia would never do anything like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer leg twinged again. That was it. She\u2019d been in bed for days, and her legs weren\u2019t used to running again, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just her being stupid again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she\u2019d been at the audition\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about Rarity\u2019s smile or Apple Bloom\u2019s or Scootaloo\u2019s or anypony\u2019s wasn\u2019t filling that gap in her heart, any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t help that she\u2019d had to run past her school. And listen to the piano through the open window. And hear the other fillies and colts\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHear them rocking along to the beats <i>she</i> should be rocking along to. Hear them having a blast belting out the tunes <i>she</i> should be belting out. Hear them being in the musical that <i>she</i> should have been in\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she <i>could</i> rock out, or belt out, or have anything to do with a musical\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped, and squared her legs. Her lips screwed up into a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne that she aimed at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. She wasn\u2019t going to let this get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t going to let her friends\u2019 first sight of her for <i>days</i> be her <i>crying</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she couldn\u2019t let it be of a frown the size of Opalescence\u2019s, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the unease that still lingered in her chest, she made her lips stretch into what she hoped was a happy little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she\u2019d brought some chocolate with her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she made it into the orchards and out of the sun, she felt a couple of trickles drip off her nose. For the first time in ages they weren\u2019t coming from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips, and tasted a little bit of salt as well as something cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she was in the shade, now, and the crunchy leaves and soft grasses felt much nicer under her hooves than the hard road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowed to a trot and got her breath back, though, something felt off. The chills in her chest continued to swirl and curdle, and they mixed in with the thoughts that only grew louder as she got closer to the clubhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Would</i> they be angry with her? It had been a solid few days since she\u2019d even <i>spoken</i> to them. That was enough time for\u2026 for <i>dozens</i>, maybe even <i>hundreds</i> of cutie mark crusades!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if\u2026 What if they\u2019d\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she hadn\u2019t been\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stop it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head until the trees blurred, and after she stopped she sucked in great gulps of air, just trying to clear her head. And to get her breath back even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t keep thinking like that. <i>Of course</i> they\u2019d be happy to see her! Of course they would!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was. Clinging to the trunk of a huge, mature tree, with the new telescope hatch poking out through the leaves up top and a fresh coat of paint covering up all the little patches and cracks, was the clubhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were voices coming from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren\u2019t loud enough, or she wasn\u2019t close enough to hear what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer <i>friends</i> were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran. Her legs moaned and ached, and she was sure she nearly fell over a root that looped out of the ground, but she kept running. She had to see them again. <i>Now</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scampered up the ramp, breath catching and whistling through her teeth. Her eyes closed as she stopped, and she heaved to catch her breath. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsides squirming with so many unanswered questions she couldn\u2019t make them out any more, she opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom sat on her rump, pointing a hoof at a pair of cards that were face-down on the floor. Scootaloo lay on her back, legs held limply upwards, her mane sprawling over her own cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them stared looked straight at her, their eyes wide and jaws hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of everything, just the sight of the two greatest fillies in the world and the most wonderful friends she could ever hope to have made a great\u2026 <i>something</i> of warmth shoot through her chest. It spread up to her muzzle, and blazed a shy little smile across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, guys,\u201d she offered.</span></div></div>",

Time to go get some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Apple Bloom lumbered her way down stairs. She noticed that Granny and Apple Jack were absent from the table. \"Big Mac, where Granny and AJ?\", she asked.<br>\r\n\"They had to leave for Auntie Golden Delicious' farm. They're having some problems with a fungus damaging their orchard.\", Big Mac replied, \"If you want some breakfast I can make you something.\" Apple Bloom responded, \"Nah, don't worry about it. I'll just go the Sugarcube Corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         With that decided Apple Bloom left for Sugarcube Corner.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Breakfast at Sugarcube Corner was not what Apple Bloom needed. She knew that being there was a mistake, yet there she was. Apple Bloom had only been at Sugarcube Corner for ten minutes and already on her eighth doughnut. She had ordered one dozen doughnuts and chocolate milk. It wouldn't be nearly enough to satisfy her. Apple Blooms appetite was a combination of hunger and boredom. Until recently she never had a problem with overeating because she had friends and family to occupy her. Now that she had neither of those things food was the substitute. She could go hang with her brother, but he would be working right now. She didn't like to bother Big Mac when he was working especially when the farm is short handed. She didn't even have chores at the farm to do. Apple Bloom's chores had been split between Apple Jack and Big Mac due to her weight slowing her down. Neither of them minded really, they did it out of concern for Apple Bloom. They were more afraid of her overexerting or hurting herself rather than her not getting them done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom finished off the last of her doughnuts. Her belly growled still. \"I'm still hungry. I got plenty of bits. Another dozen wouldn't hurt.\" Apple Bloom stood up and waddled over to the counter. \"I'd like another dozen, please.\" Mrs. Cake smiled at Apple Bloom, and gave her another box of a dozen doughnuts. \"Here you go Apple Bloom. It's on the house today. Come back up for more if you want. Somepony canceled a big catering order this mourning\", Mrs cake said. \"More doughnuts for free?\"Apple Bloom thought,\" I really shouldn't be eating what I got now, but I can more for free. Well my diet today was already ruined once i stepped in here. No reason to stop the feast now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom inhaled the second dozen faster than the first. As she stood up from her chair, it made an audible creak. She ignored it. Mrs. Cake saw Apple Bloom approach the counter again. \"How many this time, sweetie?\" She asked. \"I'd like two dozen this time, Mrs Cake,\" Apple Bloom replied,\"and some more chocolate milk to, please.\" Mrs. Cake gave her the doughnuts and milk, and watched as Apple Bloom waddled back over to her seat. When she sat down the chair creaked again. Apple Bloom ignored the sound. She gobbled down one sugary doughnut after another. Stopping only to get a breath or drink some milk. After devouring all but two of the remaining doughnuts, Apple Bloom was feeling really full. She slowly picked up both of the doughnuts with her fatty legs, and ate both of them at once. Then chased them with the last of her chocolate milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Blooms breakfast had left her completely stuffed. She leaned back in the groaning chair and rubbed her distended belly. She could almost feel herself getting fatter as she sat there. \"Forty-eight,\" she thought, \"I ate forty-eight doughnuts and drank probably a quart of chocolate milk. It's gonna take a while for this to digest.\" Her belly was gurgling and grumbling, but at least it wasn't growling. Apple Bloom fell asleep in the chair and awoke two hours later still in Sugarcube Corner. Groggy from her food coma, she raises herself out of the strained chair, and  nearly topples over due to her new weight. Before leaving, Apple Bloom caught a good look at her reflection in one of the display cases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was huge.It wasn't just her cheeks that were thicker. It almost looked like her entire face had puffed up, and what looked like a third chin was growing below the second one. Her neck and chest had packed on an inch of fat. Folds had formed where her chest met with her upper leg. The rolls on her fat laden legs were bulging more than before. Her barrel had a new inch thick layer of fat, hung just a few inches above the ground, and squished into her legs. Her vast flanks and butt had grown two inches thicker the latter of which sagged greatly. Her flanks were half the width of the door and wobbled so much that even waddling was tiring.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite how big she was now, Apple Bloom could only think. \"I'm bored. Should I go home or walk err waddle around town for a while?\"</span></div></div>",

I guess I'll wander around ponyville for a while\", Apple Bloom though out loud. She began her slow waddle around town. After walking around for about thirty minutes, a delicious smell wafted past her nose. Her belly growled loudly. \"Quiet, you. I'm gonna find out where its coming from. So just be patient,\" she said to her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom followed the scent to a back ally until she entered what looked like a small courtyard. Tucked in the corner of the courtyard was a old style brick oven. She stepped closer to the oven to get a closer look at what was baking inside. There were muffins inside, a lot of muffins. On a table a few feet away there were even more muffins. \"If there is all these muffins around that must mean that this is Ditzy's backyard.\" She was right, As if on que, Ditzy walked into the yard. \"Oh, hi Apple Bloom,\" Ditzy said. \"Heya, Ms. Ditzy, sorry I just walked in here. I could smell the muffins baking\", Apple Bloom responded. Her belly growled loudly again. Apple Blooms face turned bright red. Ditzy replied,\"Its ok. Sounds like your hungry. Would you like some muffins?\" \"Boy, do I ever!\" was Apple Blooms answer. \"Help yourself, there is plenty to go around,\"said Ditzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Muffins were much more filling than doughnuts, but Apple Bloom was able to ingest sixteen of them before she was full. \"Ah, thanks for the muffins Ms. Ditzy. They were so good,\" said Apple Bloom while patting her gurgling stomach. \"You're welcome Apple Bloom. A growing girls has to eat,\" responded Ditzy followed by and awkward laugh. \"How did she eat so many of those muffins?\" Ditzy thought. Apple Bloom just sat back on her massive backside. \"I may need to take a nap after that,\" she said,\" I feel another food coma coming on. Do you mind if take a nap here Ditzy?\" \"Not at all go right ahead.\" Ditzy replied. The grass tickled Apple Blooms belly as she waddled over to a particularly soft section of the yard. She quickly dozed off. Her one hour nap was filled with dreams of eating and food. When she awoke there was a plate with four muffins on it which she ate hastily. Apple Bloom slowly rose onto her hooves, which had been getting harder for her to do lately. She walked unsteadily back onto the main road.With each step her body quaked. It was getting more difficult just to keep her balance. She looked at the clock tower. \"Hmm, it's only three 'o' clock. No need to go home yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom continued her walk until she reached the park. Feeling short of breath, she decided to find the nearest bench and sit down. \"I *huff* need to find someplace to sit. *puff* There's a small bench,\" She said only to herself. Just seconds after sitting down, the bench broke under her massive weight. \"What the hay!\" said Apple Bloom as she tumbled onto her back. She squirmed in an attempt to get back on her hooves. After about 5 minutes, she managed to turn over and stand back up. \"Geez, have I really gotten that heavy? Nah, must have been an old bench.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok, Apple Bloom?\" asked a voice that Apple Bloom recognized as Twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine. Thanks for asking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, actually I'm glad that you are here. I heard from you were taste testing treats from Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo. I was wondering if you wanted to come taste test some of my families treats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sure, I'm not really doing anything right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Twist said excitedly, \"they are over this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom was shocked to see at least twenty ponies gathered around four picnic tables. \"That's your family?!\" she asked. \"Yep that's all of them,\" Twist replied,\" They live all across Equestria, but always gather together at this time of year to sample new treat recipes.\" Twist ran down to one of the tables while Apple Bloom hobbled behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can Apple Bloom join us for the afternoon?\" Twist asked her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she can, honey.\" Twists mother answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The following several hours were spent gorging on treats of various kinds. Some were hard candies others were pastries, and lots of chocolate. Apple Bloom had inhaled enough pie of differing flavors to equal three whole pies. She ate enough cake for four full grown ponies, and probably six boxes worth of Heart's and Hooves' Day chocolates. She wasn't done there either. She had drank three liters of the soda that Twist's uncle brought. Lastly, five of the containers of chocolate covered fruit were emptied solely by her. Her enormous, gurgling belly was very distended, and kept her seated right where she was. Twist and her family had already left for the evening. Twist had asked Apple Bloom if she wanted her to stay, but Apple Bloom ensured her that she would be fine on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom leaned up against a tree while she waited for her food to digest. \"I've gained so much weight today,\" She said to herself. She shook one of her legs, and watched the three inches of dangling fat sway back and forth.\" It's only the third week or summer vacation. Still another two months before Sweetie and Scootaloo come back. I'm gonna have to really watch myself now. I've gotten so fat that I broke a bench when I sat on it.\" Apple Bloom began rubbing her belly again. After a few more minutes, she attempted to stand up only fall back on her jiggling butt. She tried three more times before successfully getting on her hooves. As she waddled back through town, she noticed that her belly scraped the ground occasionally. Her wobbling flanks would bump into light poles and carts if she walked to closely to them. With each forward step, her hind legs pressed into her quaking belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom stopped in front a antique shop that happened to have a tall mirror leaned up against the wall. She couldn't even see all of herself in the mirror unless she stood three feet away from it. She got a good look at her fatty face. Her doughy cheeks looked as if they had been filled with whip cream. Her two extra chins had joined together making one thick, wobbly chin. Her gigantic belly stuck out to her sides another two inches. Sucking it in did nothing. There was too much fat too suck in. It forcefully squished into her front and hind legs. Her fattened legs had thickened even more. There was a three inch sheet of fat that wrapped around each leg. The pile of blubber that was her flanks and butt had swelled four inches wider making them stick out almost as much as her belly. They jostled from side to side with every movement Apple Bloom made. On top or that, the fat of her flanks was folding over the fat of her hind legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Most ponies would despair at this situation, but Apple Bloom's obesity didn't bother her not mentally anyway. Yes, it was harder for her to walk, and even more difficult to stand up. Her back ached ,and her legs were sore from carrying her bulk around. Apple Bloom didn't mind these things much. It just meant she had to sit down more often to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sun was going to set soon, so Apple Bloom started her slow trek back home. Humming a tune while she wobbled and jiggled the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She carefully stepped onto the front porch. She didn't want to repeat what happened in the park. The boards creaked under her weight. She opened the door and stepped inside the house. There was no light on in here either. After some fumbling around in the dark, she managed to find a lamp and turned it on. With the room illuminated, she could see her brother sound asleep on the couch. \"He must have been so tired that he did even bother going to bed,\" She thought. As quietly as possible, Apple Bloom started climbing the stairs. They too groaned as she stepped on them. <br>\r\nHer belly scraped on every step. It was a good thing the steps had been worn smooth, or they could have cut her. Apple Bloom didn't need light to find her room. It was straight down the hall from the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom waddled over to her nightstand, or at least she was until her extra wide flank bumped into the corner of her bed. She lost her balance and fell onto her side. \"Ooof,\" she said, \"Great now I got to try getting back up without making noise.\" She rolled over enough to get her legs under her, but struggled to lift herself up. Several failed attempts later, she tried to use her mouth by biting and pulling on the blanket on her bed. A few more tries and she pulls herself back up. \" *huff huff* That was a lot harder than I *huff* though it would be.\" She waddled over to the nightstand and turned on the lamp. \"There now I can see what I'm doing.\" She looked at a short stair case in the corner that Apple Jack had built for her. \"Good thing Sis made this for me so I can get in and out of bed,\" she said as she dragged it over to her bedside. She climbed the up, turned off the lamp, and lied down on her bed. Sleep came to her quickly. She was off to dreamland with in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0{ind ent} \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Morning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom woke to the sound of pans clanging. \"Big mac must be trying to cook breakfast again. He's the best brother ever, but he sure isn't a chef.\" Apple Bloom though back to the last time Big Mac tried making waffles. He burnt most of them. With the exception of a few that he got right. Apple Bloom climbed out of bed, walked into the bathroom, groomed herself, and walked to the stairs. She stepped down enough to see Big mac. He had clearly given up on cooking something for breakfast. A slice of bread with some jam and a cup of coffee lay before him. Apple Bloom's belly grumbles. \"That is no breakfast,\" she thought,\" maybe I'll wait till he goes out to the barn. Then I can head for Sugarcube Corner. Although he may want some company. He was on his own all day yesterday\".</span></div></div>",

I shouldn't go back to Sugarcube Corner, but the food there is certainly better than some bread with jam.\" With her decision made, Apple Bloom went back to her room. \"I make sure not to make a pig of myself this time.\" Apple Bloom needed only wait for twenty minutes before she heard the hoof steps of her brother as he walked out of the house. \"Alright time to go. About time he left, I'm getting really hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was still early morning when Apple Bloom left. She was sure to be the first costumer; therefore, she would get the freshest treats. The air near Sugarcube Corner was permeated with the scent of baked goods. It made Apple Blooms belly growl loudly every few seconds. Just as she was waddling up to the door, Mr. Cake flipped the the open sign around. \"Good morning, Apple Bloom,\" he said as he opened the door for her,\"you are just in time. The doughnuts just came out of the oven.\"<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mr Cake, I'd like a dozen of them and some chocolate milk please,\" She asked. \"Coming right up,\" he replied. Hesitantly Apple Bloom sat in the same seat she sat in yesterday. \"Please don't break,\" she thought. The chair creaked and groaned, but held her weight. Her doughnuts and milk arrived a moment later. Mr. Cake had brought her a mixture of several different doughnuts. There was glazed, jelly filled, powdered, and chocolate. \"Enjoy, let me know if you want anymore,\" he said as he walked back into the kitchen. Apple Bloom gobbled the doughnuts and drank the milk with in twenty minutes. Feeling satisfied she paid for her meal and waddled out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom wandered around for forty-five minutes before her belly growled. \"Ugh I just ate. I don't need to feed you again.\" Her belly growled again. \"Alright fine, I'll get some more food.\" She stopped at a small caf\u00e9 and ordered three cinnamon rolls. The sugary treats tasted wonderful, she would definitely be coming back to this caf\u00e9 again. With her belly silenced for now, Apple Bloom left the caf\u00e9. She meandered from one store to the next looking at the items for sale there was even a painting of her farm in one of the shops. An hour had past before a growl emanated from her bally once again. \"Oh you have got to be kidding me. I'm trying not to gorge myself silly today. Will you please knock it off,\" said thought to her stomach. It responded with another growl. Apple Bloom waddled over to a fruit stand and bought six apples. They weren't Apple Farm apples, but they were still sweet and juicy. After only ten minutes, her belly grumbled for more food. \"Oh for Pett's sake. Hmm, maybe I should snack on something more filling\", she said out loud. It took a few minutes, but Apple Bloom found a bakery that sold pie. She bought one cherry pie and wolfed it down. Her belly gave a satisfied gurgle. A few hours past, and Apple Bloom's hunger had returned. It was 11:30 a.m. \"Guess its time for lunch,\" she thought. She had plenty of restaurants to choose from, but she stuck with her tried and true place, Sugarcube Corner. Mr. Cake had greeted her as she entered,\"Hello again, Apple Bloom, what can I get for you?\" She asked,\" I'd like some vanilla cake, brownies, a big slice of peach cobbler with ice cream, and milk to wash it down with, please.\" Mr. Cake took her order and brought out four slices of vanilla cake, eight brownies, a bowl of cobbler with vanilla ice cream, and a tall glass of whole milk. Eyeballing her meal hungrily for a few seconds she dug in ,but made an effort to eat this meal a little slower and savor it. She paid and thanked Mr. Cake for the meal. Her journey around town continued, stopping every few hours for a snack until it was time to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This had become Apple Bloom's routine for several days with weight gain as the obvious result. Standing in her bedroom she viewed the changes to her body in the mirror. \"Just how much fatter did I get?!\", she thought. Her cheeks had not changed much, but her chin has certainly grown. It drooped 3 inches below her mouth. Her chest and neck were covered in six inches of flab that bulged out further than her chin. The fat on her legs was half an inch thicker and had rolls that covered her knees. The wobbling mass that was her belly had bloated by two inches. It was so big that it dragged on the ground under her. Her billowing flanks and posterior had widened by another four inches and rivaled her belly in shear size and girth. Her morbidly obese body wobbled and jiggled with the slightest movement. She waddled around her room giggling as the rug on the floor tickled her belly. She swayed to the left and right and watched her flab wobble. It continued to jiggle for a few seconds after she stopped moving. Apple Bloom came to a realization. \"This is awsome. It's like I'm made out of jello,\" she said out loud, \"Why didn't I try getting this fat before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A voice pulled Apple Bloom from her reverie.

She rushed downstairs as fast as her corpulent body allowed which wasn't very fast. She gave her sister and grandma each a big squishy hug. \"I'm so glad you back. Did you save Auntie Golden Delicious' orchard?\" Apple Jack tried to say something. but just couldn't speak. She was dumbfounded by her little sisters gigantic, obese body. \"Apple Bloom,\" she said,\" just what happened to you? You're enormous! How...when did you get so fat?!\" Apple Bloom looked like she'd just been slapped. \"Real smooth, AJ,\" Big Mac retorted.

You have any idea how boring it is with most of my family and friends not around?\" \"What about your brother here?\" Granny responded. \"He and I hung out some, but with him being so busy we couldn't do that very much.

Big mac shook his head. \"Nnnop,\" he said, \"I didn't see a reason too. She seemed to be enjoying herself.\" Apple Jack snapped back,\" And you think that makes it ok? It isn't healthy carrying around all that fat.\" Big Mac replied,\" You're right. It isn't easy for her to carry it around, but you are not a doctor ,AJ. We can't know if she is healthy or not unless you have the doc take a look at her.\" \"And that is just what I'm going to do,\" Apple Jack answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Jack slowly walked through town with Apple Bloom waddling beside her. \"You could have rode in the cart, you know,\" Apple Jack said. \"I *huff* don't need to. *huff* I can walk *huff* there just fine.\" The sisters continued the walk in silence for some time. \"You know that the doc is gonna put you on a strict diet, right?\" Apple Jack asked. \"You don't know that,\" Apple Bloom retorted,\"I don't want to loose it anyway. I like being fat. You can't make me loose it either.\" \"Alright, lets make a deal then,\" Apple Jack said, \"If the doc says that you need to diet then you have to diet, but if doesn't say you need to then you can get as fat as you want.\"<br>\r\n\" *huff* Deal,\" Apple bloom responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0----Doctor Stable's office---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom and Apple Jack sat in the waiting room for what seemed like hours; though, it had only been 30 min before Nurse Redheart addressed them. \"Dr. Stable will see you now, Apple Bloom,\" she said. Dr. Stable greeted directed them to room six. \"Alright, what can I do for you two today?\" he asked. Apple Jack answered,\" A check up for Apple Bloom. She has put on a lot of weight recently.\" \"I can see that. Please step on a scale, Apple Bloom,\" he asked. She watched as the dial on the scale spun around. 100, 110, 120, 130 the numbers climbed higher and higher till eventually it stopped on 207. \"My my, last time you were here you weighed ninety two pounds. Had a few too many slices of cake, Hmmm,\" he joked. He produced a measuring tape from his lap coat. \"This may tickle, Apple Bloom. Please try to stand as still as you can,\" he asked her. First, he measured her bulging neck it was eleven inches around. Second, he measured her legs. Her front legs measured eight and a half inches while her back legs were nine inches around. Next was her belly, it measured seventy five inches around. Lastly, her butt and flanks. they were bigger around than her belly and measured eighty inches. Dr. Stable then checked her heart rate, breathing, and reflexes. \"Alright we are done. Aside from the excess weight and muscle fatigue Apple Bloom is completely healthy. I would suggest an exercise routine to strengthen her leg muscles. Walking briskly and squats would do just fine.\" \"And a diet?\" Apple jack asked. \"Diet plans on one so young as Apple Bloom can do more harm than good, Ms. Apple Jack. She just needs exercise.\"  With the verdict given the sister walked out of the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I win,\" Apple Bloom said with her head held high. \"You half win,\" Apple Jack replied, \"You don't have to diet, but still have to exercise.\" \"And I still get to eat whatever I want.\" Apple Bloom retorted. Apple jack sighed in resignation. \"Yes, you do.\" Apple Blooms belly growled very loudly. \"I think we should celebrate my victory. Lets go to Sugarcube Corner, I'm starving.\" And so the sisters made way for Sugarcube Corner. Apple jack walked while her sister waddled beside her. Huffing and puffing the whole way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyday for the last month followed generally the same schedule. Apple Bloom would get up, do thirty five to forty squats. Then waddled laps around the house for a hour sometimes two depending on what she ate the day before. After her morning workout she was free to do as she wished. Which entailed snacking, wondering around town, eating, hanging with her family, eating, some attempts at getting her cutie mark, and more eating. Apple Bloom had ballooned a great deal over this month. If she had not been on the exercise routine, she probably wouldn't be able to walk or stand right now. Her gigantic, rotund belly gained eight inches of fat making it now thirty two inches wide. Her belly was as wide as she was tall! When measured it had a one hundred inch circumference. It firmly pressed against her legs, flanks and the ground under it. Her jiggling, flabby flanks had enlarged by six inches putting it at thirty one inches wide. That was ninety seven inches all the way around. Her hind legs fat had joined with her flanks making them look one third shorter.  Her neck and second chin had disappeared under a collar of fat fourteen inches thick and measured forty three inches round.  Her pudgy face had added a fourth of an inch of fat. Her sagging cheeks looked as if hey had injected with marsh mellow cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Over the month, Apple Bloom stashed away some of her allowance every week so she could buy enough food for a feast. She was currently at Sugarcube Corner pigging out on pies, ice cream, cookies, cake, nearly every kind of confection served there. \"Keep the food coming\", she said between mouthfuls,\" I got plenty more bits to pay for it.\"  Apple Bloom shoveled the treats into her mouth trying to eat as much as possible. She stuffed herself till it felt like her belly was going to burst. \"Alright, that .... that is all i can... do. So full.\" She sat back and rubbed now very firm belly. \"When all that digests, this huge belly will be so much softer and squishier,\" she thought. She looked at the table her food was on. There was a stack of seventeen empty pie tins, nineteen ice cream bowls, and thirteen brownie plates. She didn't bother counting the rest of the empty dishes. She knew that this was the most food she had ever eaten ever before. She slept for three hours since she couldn't really go anywhere while she digested. After her cat nap, she was ready to head back home. Trying with all her might and some assistance from Mr. and Ms. Cake she heaved herself back onto her hooves. The process left her breathless. \"Thanks. *huff* Don't tell my sis that I *puff* couldn't get up on my own ok. *huff* I'll see you next month,\" she said to them as she lumbered out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ponies stared at Apple Bloom as she waddled her way through Ponyville. \"Oh my Celestia, she is gigantic. How is she even standing. She should be on a diet,\" they whispered. Apple Bloom just ignored them. \"Wonder if I should make a stop at any of my other favorite restaurants on the way home?\" She thought.  \"I'm not hungry so now would be the best time to eat. I read in a book that if you eat when not hungry whatever you ate becomes fat.\" She thinks for a few minutes. \"Why am I wasting time! I got places to go and things to eat,\" she said to no one but herself. Apple Bloom changed her direction and began her trek to her next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First there was a ice cream shop, then Bon Bon's candy shop, then the market stalls, and finally a restaurant that was known for its big meals. Apple Bloom had stopped and eaten at four eateries and five of the market stalls. Her day had literally been an all day feast. She started her waddle back home, but was stopped by Ditzy. \"Apple Bloom,\" she said,\" you shouldn't  be out here there's gonna be a thunderstorm in half an hour.\" Apple Bloom replied, \"Why?\" \"Well you see, Ponyville has missed three scheduled rain showers. So the pegasi of Cloudsdale are gonna make it storm to make up for the missed showers. Come on you can stay at my house till the storm is past.\" \"Ok, lets go. I don't want to get caught out in the storm,\" Apple Bloom replied. She followed the wall- eyed mare to her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom stepped into Ditzy's house. It was a quaint home with a few furnishings. \"Make yourself at home, Apple Bloom. I'll fly to you home and let your family know that you are staying here till the storm is past.\" \"Ok, thank you, Ditzy,\" Apple Bloom replied. Ditzy went back outside and flew off towards Sweet Apple Acre's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom looked around Ditzy's living room. Noticing an extensive collection of fantasy books on book shelves in the corner. There was a small fire burning in the fireplace. It was nice and warm. Apple Bloom yawned. \"I don't think Ditzy would mind if I read one of these books, or maybe I should take a nap by the fire.</span></div></div>",

She took a random book from the shelf. The one she grabbed was leather bound. Its title read \"A Hero's Tale\". She had not heard of this book before. Apple Bloom opened the book expecting something like a fairytale story. Instead there was instructions. \"In this interactive story what happens depends on what decisions the reader, that's you, makes,\" she read aloud,\" Start at page one, choose your race and items, and one of three items. From there follow the instructions per page.\" Apple Bloom flipped the page over and saw picture of an earth pony, a pegasus, and a unicorn.  There were two pictures of each pony race a mare and a stallion. Apple Bloom choose earth pony mare. The next page pictured three items, a magical medallion, a round shield, and a spear. She chose the shield. With her character made Apple Bloom flipped to page one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom had been reading for roughly fifteen minutes when Ditzy had returned. Ditzy walked up behind Apple Bloom who was too enthralled by the book to notice Ditzy's approach. \"A Hero's Tale? I didn't think you would like a book like that,\" Ditzy said. Apple bloom squeaked. \"Oh I'm sorry, Ditzy. I should have waited till you got back before I messed with your stuff,\" she replied. \"Oh its not a problem. I'm sorry too. I didn't mean to startle you,\" Ditzy said apologetically, \"Are you enjoying the story?\" Apple Bloom nodded. \"Yeah, this is really cool.\" Ditzy lied down next to Apple Bloom. \"Mind if I join you?\" she asked. \"Not at all,\" Apple Bloom replied,\"Let read it together.\"  Hours had past by and Apple Bloom was getting close to the end of the story. She had slain a troll, saved merchant from a wolf pack, and helped rebuild a town. Now though she was trapped in a mansion with traps around every corner. Pictures, tables, and lamps in the foyer flew at her as if they were thrown.  She ran into a banquet hall to escape possessed furniture. With in was a feast fit for a king. An ethereal voice spoke to her,\" You look hungry. Come partake of this evenings dinner, traveler.\" Apple Bloom paused. \"It's a trap, Apple Bloom.\" Ditzy said, \"You should leave.\" \"Why free food is the best food,\" Apple Bloom replied. She decides to eat the food. \"Flip to page 251,\" she read. Apple bloom flipped to page 251 and read it aloud. \"The hero hesitantly took a bite of the sweet potatoes and was entranced by the taste. She took another bite then another and another. The food was enchanted! The hero couldn't stop eating. She was completely under the spell of the delectable dinner. She ate and ate. With each bite the hero seemed to get bigger and rounder. The buttons on her tunic popped off, and her leggings ripped as she got fatter and fatter. The ethereal voice cackled as the hero continued to gorge. You have met a terrible end.\" Apple Bloom giggled. Seems more like the best ending to me. The hero looks a lot like me now,\" she said and pointed at the picture of very obese hero.  Ditzy laughed. \"You're right the hero does look like you,\" she said. Another hour past and the storm had stopped, but neither Ditzy nor Apple Bloom had noticed. They were enjoying each others company to much to realize that the storm had passed already.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a knock at the door. \"Oh, that must be Apple Jack\", Ditzy said, \"I guess it's time for you to go home.\" Apple Bloom nodded. \"I guess so,\" she replied. Ditzy opened the door. It was Big Mac instead of Apple Jack. \"AJ said that Apple Bloom was here? I've come to take her home,\" he said. \"I'm coming,\" Apple Bloom replied. Grunting with effort she tried to stand. She tried and tried again but could not stand up. \"um, a little help, please,\" she asked. Both Big Mac and Ditzy had to help her. Her face red with embarrassment. After a few attempts, she was back on her hooves. Big mac thanked Ditzy for looking after Apple Bloom and they departed. Ditzy waved at them as they walked down the muddy Ponyville street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" *huff* Big Mac, can you promise *huff* me something\", Apple bloom asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you not tell AJ that I couldn't stand on my own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup, I promise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Big Mac.\"</span></div></div>",

Ms. Cake brought them out to the table Apple Bloom had sat at earlier today. \"Let me know if you want anymore\" ,Ms. Cake said. Apple Bloom ate the cupcakes slowly. Her belly gave a dissatisfied growl. Apple Bloom lumbered back over to the counter and ordered three pies with ice cream. They were delicious, but her belly still growled for more food.

Apple Blooms body expanded wider and thicker as she binged. Her flanks, over a yard wide, jiggled and covered more of her hind legs. Her belly billowed wider and wider. It forced her legs further apart as it surged outward by a yard and some inches. The fat of her chest had belly had joined together and spilled on the floor in front of her legs. The collar of fat that was her neck was as thick as several loafs of bread. Her front legs were more like globs of fat now. Eight inches of fat hung from the back of each leg and shook violently when moved. Apple Blooms face was laden with fat. Her chin creased over her neck fat and quaked when she spoke. Apple Bloom's butt sagged even lower than before and had rolls of own.

If ya enjoy being big and fat, then Ah won't take that away from ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The little, yellow filly smiled and hugged her brother. \"Thanks, Big Mac,\" she said. \"No problem, sis,\" Big Mac replied. \"If nothin' else, we should at least see the doctor and ask him if all that flab is healthy or not.\" Apple Bloom let go of her hug and nodded. \"Ok then,\" she said.</span></div></div>",

Tries her hardest at her mailpony job and just wants to live her life while securing a good future for her daughter Dinky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there is obviously a lot of room for overlap.

Then with a huff she turned back    towards the bowl of onion rings she'd been munching on and levitated one up to her mouth, savoring its slightly greasy but rich flavor before devouring it <br>\r\nin a single hearty bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Ugh, I hate my life!\" Trixie moaned as she ate another two onion rings and washed them down with a slurp of a huge milk shake. Since the debacle of a performance in Ponyville, the showmare had both figuratively and literally fallen on hard times. Her inability to live up to her boast of having vanquished an Ursa <br>\r\nMajor had spread quickly after her disastrous showing in the small town and pretty soon everypony's image of Trixie was not as a master illusionist and magician, but as a fraud and bully who embellished her talent, humiliated her audience and bewitched young foals with tall tales that encouraged them to imitate them in spite of the great danger they could put themselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hmmf, because somepony saying they've defeated an Ursa means they want you to bring an Ursa to town...what bucking hogwash!\" the unicorn cursed<br>\r\nas she swallowed another swig of her shake. \"They act as though they've never heard a performer promote herself before... sigh* she plopped down dejectedly and took a bite from another onion ring. As she chewed the crunchy fried treat Trixie stared at the various food stuffs before. Food.  It'd been the <br>\r\nonly thing that really gave her any sense of comfort, the smell and taste of it helping to smooth away the awful memories of that miserable day and the<br>\r\nhardships she'd gone through since. Pizza didn't run her out of town for just trying to book a performance slot, ice cream's coldness was soothing unlike the<br>\r\ncoldness in many a neighsayer's heart, and the burned lips she occasionally suffered from gobbling hot fresh baked cupcakes and cookies actually felt good<br>\r\ncompared to the burn she felt from others telling her to \"get over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Speaking of others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Trixie, I thought you were coming to the flea market with me.\" a stern yet gentle voice said from outside her room. Trixie groaned in frustration as the bedroom door opened with a shimmer of magic and a purple unicorn stepped in, her face wearing a mixture of disappointment and subdued resignation. \"You've been holed up here ever sense you came back and haven't done anything or gotten to know anypony.\" she added with some concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I already told you Twilight, Trixie wasn't leaving her room today nor this library, especially after what happened with those three yipping parrots!\" the former showmare replied as she stuffed another three onion rings into her mouth. \"Besides Trixie already kept her promise to model for Rarity's new 'plus-sized' fashions and taste tested Pinkie's newest 'flavor' of jello mold.\" she said the bit about the jello with audible disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Twilight sighed and with a glimmer of magic pulled the lounging mare towards her, Trixie appearing not to notice as she took a long slurp of her shake. She wasn't gonna let this go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes you did help Rarity and Pinkie, in fact those are about the only things you've down since I let you move in with me.\" the purple pony argued. Trixie only rolled her eyes as she chewed more onion rings. Twilight sighed louder. \"Look Trixie I know things haven't been going well for you show wise since <i>the incident</i>, but most ponies here at least have forgiven you and would like to see you preform again,\" the royal prodigy waited a moment before continuing, <br>\r\n\"Besides you could really use some exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     At the mention of the word \"exercise\" Trixie shot up and glared menacingly at the purple unicorn who only shrugged. Since the Ursa incident and due to  the resulting hit to her reputation, Trixie had spent most of her time weeping and stuffing herself with various foods and drinks. This had continued even after<br>\r\nTwilight had invited the depressed and food obsessed mare back to Ponyville and into her home in the hopes of giving her a new start in life, and the eventual<br>\r\nresult was the two hundred pound plus pony now standing before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Not that she'd ever acknowledge it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Trixie most certainly does not need <b>exercise!</b>\" the rotund show unicorn bellowed, causing her two extra chins and fat cheeks to wobble comically as crumbs and splotches of milk shake dripped off of them. Twilight fought  the urge to giggle as Trixie waddled around her ranting , enormous belly swaying like a blubbery pendulum, her fat pillowy rump bouncing and jiggling in rhythm with her gut. \"Rarity says Trixie's physique is its unique beauty and besides, those<br>\r\nhorrid flower gossipers got their just 'desserts' \" she finished her rant with a long slurp of her shake before glaring back at Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The purple pony shook her head realizing she wasn't gonna get anywhere with being blunt to her guest, \"Ugh never mind,  how about we just visit Applejack<br>\r\nfor today. She'll likely have some fresh picked apples for you.\" she suggested. Trixie's mood immediately brightened at the mention of apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Trixie did say Sweet Apple Acres has the best apples she's tasted\" the portly show off said. \"And a healthy snack sounds much better then <i>exercise</i>.\"<br>\r\nShe mouthed the word as though it were a slur against large ponies like herself. Twilight just rolled her eyes as she and Trixie headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

After sending the grey pegasus on her way though they spent the rest of the walk taking in the sights and smells of the warm winter day as they approached the apple farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n       \"Well howdy girls, it sure is good to see ya'll,\" Applejack waved to them from the front porch of the farm house. \"Ah've been waiting for ya'll, there's some good hot coco inside if ya'll want some as well as some nice fresh picked apples.\" The orange farm pony couldn't help but chuckle as she saw Trixie's face light up at the mention of food. Together the three friends step inside and into the kitchen where three mugs of steaming warm coco sat on the table along with a big basket of apples and surprisingly, a newly baked apple pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Wow AJ you didn't have to fix all this for us,\" Twilight started to say a bit embarrassed, but Trixie hushed her with a hoof. \"Oh Applejack that pie simply looks delicious, and those apples are scrumptious.\" the rotund unicorn said as she eyed the display of food and drink hungrily, a fact that didn't escape the cowpony's attention.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Heehee whoa there partner, you gotta leave some for the rest of us now.\" Applejack said with a chuckle as the three mares took their seats at the table. Trixie merely nodded in acknowledgement as she was already chewing on a piece of pie. AJ and Twilight both giggled as they sipped their cups of coco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"So Twi,\" Applejack began after cutting them each a piece of pie. \"How's getting a show gig for Trixie been going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The purple unicorn sighed as she took a long sip of coco, \"Not good I'm afraid, every place we've tried is either booked or won't even give her a second look.\" she answered dejectedly. \"Even when I try to explain how the whole <i>you know what</i> wasn't completely her fault we usually get told to go home.\" the young scholar pony taking care not to mention the word <i>Usra</i> in the presence of her magician friend. \"It seems as though nopony wants to give her a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Oh Twi you know how picky and stubborn some of them fancy ponies can be, \" Applejack responded taking a small bite of her pie. \"Have ya'll tried writing to the Princess about this, surely she can do something to help. I know overcoming a big slip up like that whole <i>you know what</i> business ain't easy, but she can't just stay in the library and eat snacks all day... no offense Trixie.\" the farmer added for the sake of her portly friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Mmmff, none taken\" the chubby blue mare said as she wolfed down her fifth piece of apple pie. Her already bloated belly was noticeably bigger from her current binge, as were her hips and rear. Applejack and Twilight both couldn't help but chuckle as Trixie let out a small belch before grabbing another juicy apple with her magic and all but devouring it in one hearty bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Anyway,\" Twilight said turning back to Applejack. \"Writing to the Princess sounds like it could work, the only thing is everypony even her tends to be busy this time of year with the preparations for the Hearts and Hooves day and the Winter Wrap Up celebrations in Canterlot. But I know she'll take some time out to help us, what do you think Trixie?\" The purple unicorn asked her busily snacking friend, who nodded her acceptance before returning to polishing off the last remaining apples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Alright then it's settled,\"  Twilight stated proudly. \"When we get back to the library I'll have Spike write a letter asking Princess Celestia to see if she find a place that will let Trixie preform.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>      Octavia was practicing her cello playing for an upcoming concert. As she slowly moved her bowstring across the instrument's strings, a soft melody echoed through the room and filtered out into the sun bathed sky. The cellist closed her eyes and for a brief moment, imagined herself on stage before a cheering audience of thousands of ponies, their applause mixing with her music to create a heavenly soothing tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    *Griggle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The sound of her stomach growling snapped her concentration and spoiled the dream like fantasy. \"Ugh, I guess it's time for a lunch break..\" the grey mare said to herself as she carefully placed her cello in its case before heading down to the kitchen. As she made her way to the stairway she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror and stopped. Sighing dejectedly she stepped towards it and studied her reflection closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Ugh, damn you baked goods.\" Octavia muttered. It was as much a jab at herself as it was pastries in general, since it was her gradual liking of them that had led to the figure staring back at her in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The large, rotund blubbery figure that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    Octavia's main motivation for wanting to move here to Ponyville was to get away from the drama and pandemonium of Cantorlot... and also reconnect with her younger sister whom she hadn't seen since they were fillies(unless you counted a brief yet chaotic meeting at the Grand Galloping Gala, which both mares preferred to forget). To say she'd been overjoyed to see her would be an understatement, as Pinkie was soon dragging the musician mare all Ponyville introducing her to everypony especially her closest friends and before throwing her a massive \"Welcome to Ponyville Long Lost Big Best Sister Who's the Bestest Best Violin Player Ever!!\"(she'd explained the differences between a cello and a violin to her later on). Other than the almost weekly parties and having to endure her hyperactive sibling's many wacky antics, Octavia honestly believed settling down in this small town had been a blessing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...and a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    During the time she'd been living with Pinkie the grey musical mare couldn't help but notice that some of her infinitely joyful sister's habits had begun to rub off on her. More than once she'd caught herself walking with a skip in her step or humming one of Pinkie's random songs that had gotten stuck in her head. Octavia considered those minor annoyances though compared to her biggest pet peeve...Pinkie's eating habits. Slowly but surely the celloist mare had found herself increasingly snacking on candy, cookies and other sweets whenever she wasn't preforming or practicing for a concert, instead of the usual and much healthier vegetables and fruits. The fact that the apartment she and Pinkie shared was located above a bakery didn't help matters, and it wasn't long before she'd started gaining weight.... a lot of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   \"Ah Pinkie, just look at what your sugary goods have done to me.\" Octavia said to her reflection dejectedly, her extra chin wobbling in response. Examining herself further served only to dampen her mood as she gazed down at her belly, it was as big and round as a jumbo beach ball and jiggled and bounced between her thicker legs as she turned to view her side, making the grey mare grumble. Turning her head a bit she caught sight of her much bigger and thicker flank, noting with disappointment as it jiggled with her every movement. \"I look like an overstuffed pig, how could I let myself go like this... \" The two hundred plus pound musician mumbled to herself as she continued studying her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oooohhhh Octavia, It's Breakfast Tiiiiimmmmmeeeee!! Come get your pancakes before the twins eat them and throw them all over like frisbees!\" Pinkie Pie bellowed from downstairs, snapping Octavia out of her self-critique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    \"I'll be right down in a second!\" she answered as she went to fetch her customary pink bow piece from the dresser. Snapping it around her chubby neck was getting more and more difficult. \"And to think this morning it's pancakes, my absolute favorite.\" the grey mare muttered as she finally managed to fit the little garment on and she began making her way down the stairs towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     The breakfast table seemed to call to her as Octavia took a seat across from Pinkie, who she noted was already at work gobbling down a stake of pancakes and scrambled eggs. \u201cHow she eats so much and hardly gain half a pound I\u2019ll never know.\u201d She thought bitterly to herself before fixing herself a modest serving of pancakes and buttered toast. Taking a cautious bite of the first pancake Octavia was suddenly reminded why she\u2019d come to crave Pinkie\u2019s and the Cakes\u2019 breakfast cooking so much lately, the sweet buttery taste combined with maple syrup was like heaven to her taste buds\u2026 and her stomach. \u201cThis is gonna go right to my flanks I just know it, but it\u2019s so divine!\u201d she thought with a blush before swallowing and taking another more hearty bite of the pancake. Soon she had finished the whole thing started eating the rest of her stack more quickly, till soon she was scarfing down the reminder of the pancakes along with a big helping of scrambled eggs and toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Several minutes later\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n       \u201cMy Mrs. Cake these pancakes are splendid!\u201d Octavia complemented as she wiped her mouth with a napkin. She had lost track of just how many of the fluffy delicious breakfast delicacies she\u2019d wolfed down, but she couldn\u2019t deny the sweet warm flavor that flooded her mouth with every bite and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cWell you\u2019re welcome dearie,\u201d Mrs. Cake answered as she and Mr. Cake gathered up the empty dishes for cleaning. \u201cOf course Pinkie helps a lot with the baking though some of her recipes are\u2026.unique.\u201d she added with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cHaha well I never would of imagined myself enjoying chocolate pancakes and cinnamon-coated jelly filled bagels, but that was before moving to Ponyville.\u201d The grey mare chuckled as she took a large bite of toast. \u201cIn fact living here may be just the best thing to happen to me, sure I miss socializing with the other members of my ensemble and my old music instructor but being able to just relax and not be flustered by all the dignified disorder of Cantorlot makes it worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     \u201cTell me about, some of those fancy fancypants ponies can be really really boring and some of them even don\u2019t like parties,\u201d Pinkie Pie added popping from beside her sister, startling her a bit. \u201cI mean I know not everypony wants to party all the time like Cranky Doodle and Matilda but they still like to have fun but those rich snotty ponies don\u2019t even like\u2026Mpphh\u201d Octavia stuck her hoof in her sibling\u2019s mouth to stem her tidal wave of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n     \u201cGoodness Pinkie Pie can\u2019t you see me and Mrs. Cake are talking,\u201d Octavia gently scolded her hyperactive sister, \u201cSometimes I swear you enjoy talking even more than you enjoy eating sweets\u2026 and\u2026baked goods\u2026.\u201d  The words filtered out of Octavia\u2019s mouth as the realization of what she\u2019d been doing that morning hit her. \u201cOh dear\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n      Mrs. Cake looked up from where she\u2019d been placing some dishes in the dishwasher and turned towards the pair, concern written on her face. \u201cIs something wrong Octavia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n       \u201cWell\u2026,\u201d the cellist began hesitantly. \u201cEver since I moved here I\u2019ve been gaining quite a few pounds.\u201d She said glumly as she put a hoof on her greatly bloated stomach for emphasis. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t help but feel like a prized pig, and worst I\u2019ve developed the eating habits of one wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n       Both Mrs. Cake and Pinkie looked at each other for a moment, before smiling warmly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every nook and cranny was filled up. Zecora's face was squished against her belly as there wasn't any space left. She still felt her body was still expanding and it was hurting her.

She can only stared at the stars hoping that anypony would spot her in the open space. <br>\r\n\"Hope my belly stop or my belly will pass the treetop,\" Zecora told to herself.<br>\r\nAs soon as she said that her belly grew a couple more inches higher and wider. Right now her rump is as wide as 50 adult ponies' rump side by side and her belly can operate as a jumpy castle. Her limbs are useless as she couldn't even wiggle it.

Destroying trees? Growing and rumbling?\"<br>\r\nThe squirrel tugged on her hair and pointed straight at the Everfree Forest.<br>\r\n\"You want me to find the blob monster,\" Fluttershy whimpered as thought of encountering it gave her the shivers.<br>\r\nThe squirrel kept tugging her hair and told her to help the animals.<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Fluttershy signed, \"I have to be more confident to face my fears. I could not always rely on my friends to solve all my problems.\"<br>\r\nFluttershy slowly trotted, with the squirrel on her back, to the direction it was pointing at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy observed the surrounding and found nothing out of the usual until she spotted the top of a fallen redwoods tree. It was one of the widest and tallest tree in the Everfree Forest. The tree was taller than 370 feet and 25 feet wide. Fluttershy theorized that it must have been a very big and strong creature. She gulped as she followed the tree trunk to find it's stump. When she continued trotting she found many more trees fall victim to the '<i>blob</i>'. She soon stop as she could not possibly see the stump as it was covered by something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the white and black <i>blob</i>. The white and black blob squished against many trees and piles of rocks surrounding it. Many trees and rocks were either swallowed up or were leaned heavily against by the massive blob. Some of them looked like it could break at any moment. She can see that is has fur believing it was a living creature. <br>\r\n\"Hello Mr or Miss Blob. Are you related to the Smooze?\" Fluttershy said with fear, \"Could you tell me why are you doing this?\" <br>\r\nBefore Fluttershy could lay a hoof on it, the <i>blob</i> rumbled. The blob expanded pushing more trees to the ground. Fluttershy gasped as she hid in a bush from a good distance. She can see the blob kept expanding until it stopped. She saw it grew a couple of inches more in every direction. The rumble stop and everything went silent. The squirrel ran away while Fluttershy was hiding. With no animals to talk to, she asked herself, \"Should I get my friends now or explore what it is?\" </span></div></div>",

I can't always rely everything on my friends.\"<br>\r\nShe flew up to see the very top of the <i>blob</i> and the area surrounding it. After investigating the blob she examined that it was four times bigger than the biggest barn in the Sweet Apple Acres. She also estimated that the blob will surpass the treetop by the end of the day at the rate it was going. As blob rumbled and increased in size, Fluttershy didn't fly away as she was prepared and a good distance away from it. She only saddened at the fact that more trees were destroyed by it. After circling it one more time, she noticed a odd marking on its side. She flew down and did not believe what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Zecora's cutie mark. Eventhough it was enlarged (big as a billboard), distorted by the uneven growth and obscured by many trees being leaned by it, she was sure it was Zecora's. She flew up and found one of her hind legs. That hind leg just dangled there being useless. The knees was obscured by all its fat and hard to tell where the hips was. She followed around the edge of the blob until she find the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zecora!\" Fluttershy gasped as she rushed there. <br>\r\nShe found her snoring without any sign of pain or annoyance. Zecora's cheeks was so large that each one could hide a grown stallion with room to spare. The cheeks forces her eyes to be squinted and her mouth look minuscule to it. Her unending number of chins blend with her fat chest that oozes between her two fore legs. Her fore legs are as useless as her hind legs. It looked like it needed a small herd of ponies to lift it up. Zecora's body rumbled again and expand further. More trees were destroyed but Zecora kept sleeping peacefully like nothing is going wrong.<br>\r\nNeeding the answers know, Fluttershy tickled Zecora on the nose with one of her wings, \"Zecora. Wake up. What's going on?\"<br>\r\nZecora quickly snorted and sneezed before opening her eyes. She found Fluttershy staring right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would become here much earlier, now I became so much heavier,\" Zecora said as Fluttershy now knew it have been going on for a while.<br>\r\n\"How long have you been like this?\" asked Fluttershy.<br>\r\n\"It has been a week, now the forest became a wreak.\" Zecora spoke as her cheeks and chins wobbled even with the slightest movement.<br>\r\nSuddenly Zecora's belly rumbled again. \"Oh dear,\" whispered Fluttershy.<br>\r\nZecora gained another couple of ten thousands of pounds. Zecora looked annoyed and frustrated rather than fear.<br>\r\n\"I got used to it. The surrounding I destroyed didn't hurt me a bit,\" Zecora grumbled.<br>\r\n\"What should I do?\" ask Fluttershy.<br>\r\n\"Get Princess Twilight! She knows what to do! I hope or my body forces to forest to go overload!\" urges Zecora.<br>\r\nFluttershy flew as quick as she can to get her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora just laid there waiting for them. Zecora could not do anything but to talk or hum to herself. Zecora spent most of her week sleeping as she could not even wriggle her hooves.

All the girls were surprised as this was the first time they experience this kind of situation. Twilight cast a beam of spell to stop the siren and turn the map back to its original colors.<br>\r\n\"What was that?!\" Starlight panicked as she hid behind her chair.<br>\r\n\"I don't know?\" Twilight looked at the table examining every detail on it, \"I've never seen it.\"<br>\r\n\"I know. It's a nemesis that with weird but wild powers that we must defeat.

Opps\"<br>\r\nTwilight just stared at her with twitching eyes, \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I left the book with the Cake's foals and they tore it up into shredded papers,\" Pinkie squeaked as she hid behind Applejack.<br>\r\n\"Let me get this straight,\" Twilight take a deep breath before ranting about how stupid that was, \"You left the only book of all ponykind about the cutie map in some foals hooves. Now it is destroyed with no way of fixing it and all can you said was opps?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Pinkie poofed into thin air and found her behind the front entrance door, \"Nice talking to you. I have to bake some cakes so goodbye,\" Pinkie slammed the doors leaving the other behind.<br>\r\n\"So...,\" Spike tried to avoid what just happen, \"Do anypony know that some nemesis that is overpowered that we need to defeat?\"<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha ha,\"  a voice boomed outside from the castle, \"Behold that nobodies waist would be untouched.\"</span></div></div>",

Her belly squished against the ground and her legs barely touch the ground. Her cheeks sagged and touched her shoulders. Her tail look comically small compare to her butt cheeks. Besides from that, Zecora seems to be in good condition.<br>\r\n\"Zecora!\" Twilight shook Zecora's face, \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\nZecora opened her eyes and was greeted by Twilight and her friends.

When she arrived home, she set off to work to find the cure. In the middle of the search, the cloaked pony appear in front of her. Zecora stood her stance and ask why was he here. The pony invited her to dinner. Zecora declined the offer as she was on a diet but the pony does not take no for an answer. All the doors and windows were locked with his magic and no sound can exit Zecora's home. With a blink of his eyes, plates of all kind of desserts appeared around her; pastries, chocolates and cakes. Her belly rumbled after seeing and smelling all the food around her. The pony said he stole them from the most well-known dessert shop of all of Equestria and it's all for her. Zecora tried to run away but the pony locked her into place. The pony floated a piece of cake in front of her face and force fed her. The pony casted a spell on her so as the cake landed on her taste bud, it would made her fell like she was in heaven. Zecora stopped trying to resist it and embrace the food. The pony smiled with glee as she gobble up the dessert so he kept sending more dessert straight to her mouth just to be devoured. Zecora kept eating and eating until she fell into a food comatose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That pony could make you grave for food,\" Twilight took note on another powerful spell, \"That's diabolical. Oh dear. What else can he do?\"<br>\r\n\"First thing first Twilight,\" Starlight poked at Zecora, \"We should move her to the castle.\"<br>\r\nZecora heaved and dragged herself to the door. It was tough for Zecora as her hooves just barely reached the ground and she have to drag the belly on the ground. Zecora was out of breath after pulling a few inches toward the door.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Rainbow Dash commented on the situation, \"It would take Zecora a whole week to get to the castle at this rate.\"<br>\r\n\"Zecora don't worry,\" Starlight cheered Zecora up, \"Twilight taught me to everything about teleporting.

Rainbow looked determine and professional. By that look, she mean business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow blew her whistle to gain Zecora's attention, \"Okay Zecora, we want to lose all your flab in every mean necessary. I don't want to hear any whining or giving up. I do not want any excuses. I want to see you sweat, your muscle burn and your fat melt away. Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Dash. Just don't be rash,\" Zecora stretch her hooves.<br>\r\n\"Okay, first drop down and give me twenty!\" Rainbow commanded.<br>\r\nZecora grunted as she attempted to do a push up but her belly was in the way.

Give me some crunches!\" Rainbow was clearly frustrated about the process.<br>\r\nZecora rocked herself side to side multiple times just to be able to lie on her side. By the time she managed to get on her back, she was sweating and out of breath.<br>\r\n\"Okay. Time out,\" Rainbow excused herself, \"Give yourself a break as I tried to think of something else.\"<br>\r\nRainbow left Zecora alone as she was wheezing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls and Spike were waiting at the cutie map table as they were waiting for Rainbow Dash. When she got back, they asked her about the process.<br>\r\n\"It's bad girls. She's too fat to probably exercise. She couldn't do a push up and rolling on her back is too much for her,\" Rainbow showed annoyance to the girls.<br>\r\n\"There should be a way,\" Rarity refused to give up, \"Zecora shouldn't be stuck like that forever.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe there is another way,\" said Starlight, \"Exercising in water would help her.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Twilight facehooved herself, \"Water reduces the gravity pulling on Zecora. This would sure to shed some pounds and build some muscles.\"<br>\r\n\"And we have the pool in it,\" Spike added in, \"The indoor pool of the castle is big enough for her.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait wait wait wait,\" Rainbow just heard something new, \"You mean you have a pool and you didn't tell us.\"<br>\r\n\"Nopony asked,\" Spike retorted, \"You spend so much by the lake and spending time at the spa that I think it isn't necessary. Twilight thought that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow tried to talk back but she was interrupted a loud rumble from the ballroom. All of them rushed to Zecora and saw her lying on her back while moaning for food as her belly kept rumbling.<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Rainbow deadpan, \"After eating a whole restaurant of junk food last night and you are still hungry.\"<br>\r\nZecora gave an unamused face to Rainbow, \"When you are as big as me, you want to eat all the apples including the tree.\"<br>\r\nTwilight summoned a huge bowl of salad that can feed four ponies, \"Here you go Zecora. No dressing and low calories.\"<br>\r\nZecora devoured the whole lot as if she haven''t eating anything all day. Zecora looked disappointed as she was still slightly hungry.<br>\r\n\"Increase in hunger and appetite is normal for larger ponies. All we need to do is to curb it,\" Twilight commented it, \"If we keep you on a low-fat diet and plenty of exercise, I'm sure you would be back on your feet.\"<br>\r\n\"How can you get rid of my belly when I can only move like a jelly?\" Zecora tried to rock herself back to her hooves but gave up as it was too much effort.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Water exercise is the best option. I just need to fill the pool.\" replied Twilight.<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. Twilight,\" Fluttershy tapped Twilight, \"I've some animal to take care of. So is it okay for me to leave?\"<br>\r\nAll the other girls said they have other things to do.<br>\r\n\"Okay girls. You can all go. The pool need to take time to fill it all up. It should be ready for tomorrow. We will resume Zecora exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls left the castle leaving only Zecora, Twilight, Starlight and Spike.<br>\r\n\"You work up the sweat so you needed a bath,\" Spike pointed out the obvious.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Not any shower or bath could fit you Zecora so we have to use water hose to wash you,\" Starlight walked out to fetch a water hose and a bucket.<br>\r\nZecora agreed as she waited for her bath. When they got back, Zecora felt embarrased as she was being bath like a big baby. They sprayed water all over Zecora and scrubbed her furs. They scrubbed every part of Zecora and made sure to clean between each love handles. Twilight used her power to flipped Zecora on her hooves to washed her back. By the end of the bath, Starlight and Twilight summoned many towels to dry Zecora within a flash.<br>\r\nZecora thanked them for the hospitality. Twilight teleported Zecora to the largest guest room for her to rest.<br>\r\n\"Zecora. This is your sleeping arrangement until we capture that cloaked pony. I already sent all of your belongings here.\"<br>\r\nZecora observed the room and found two king-sized mattresses (each king sized mattress can fit 4 ponies) without the bed frame.<br>\r\n\"We leave the bed frame because it might be tough for you to get on and you might break it. No offence,\" Twilight trying not to offend her.<br>\r\nZecora didn't get offended by it and dragged herself to the mattresses.<br>\r\n\"If you need anything, just ask me, Starlight or Spike,\" Twilight closed the door leaving Zecora alone.<br>\r\nZecora spent most of time reading for the cure. Spike brought in a large salad for her dinner.<br>\r\nAs it was getting late, everypony in the castle went to sleep. Everything seems alright but Zecora got a strange feeling about it.</span></div></div>",

The device landed on her belly and stuck out between her belly rolls. Zecora was happy at that moment when it was literately on her but she turned her smile upside down when she could not reach it. She could not roll over or sit up to reach it. She tried to shake her belly so it could move toward her hooves. Unfortunately it made it worse. The device just went deeper between her belly rolls and disappeared from sight. She can't do anything else but wait for somepony to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout three hours later, she filled out her whole room. Every nook and cranny of the space was filled with Zecora's fat. Everything in her room were either trapped, crashed or flattened by her fat. She felt the pressure of her body trying to push the wall of her room to make more space. Breaking down a crystal wall is no easy task. Zecora described the pressure as a soda can that had been shaken and need to be open to release the gas. Luckily one of the walls with the door to the hallway is the weakest one. The wall cracked by the pressure of Zecora's fat. Many cracks appeared on the wall until it was blasted out like a bomb. Zecora signed with relief as she wasn't still contain in the room and have more room to spread. Surely this would wake somepony up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Twilight, Starlight and Spike woke up by the crashing sound from Zecora's room. They all rushed to her and found a giant blob on white with black strips seeping out of her room into the hallway. They all correctly assumed it was Zecora.<br>\r\n\"Zecora. Are you alright?\" Twilight shouted at Zecora and all she can hear was her belly wobbling and the murmuring voice.<br>\r\nTwilight teleport herself, Zecora and the others to the ballroom. They all saw that Zecora was much bigger than before.<br>\r\n\"Zecora. What's going on?\" panicked Spike as he can still see her growing.<br>\r\n\"The device is in my between my belly rolls, find it as it is the controls,\" Zecora warned them.<br>\r\nStarlight search at the right side, Spike search at the left side and Twilight search from above. They search every part of her body until they found the device. They twisted the knob to stop the increasing mass. By the end of this fiasco, Zecora was 30 ponies wide and two stories high. She filled up at least half of the ballroom.<br>\r\nZecora was immobile. She couldn't even move her hoof or turn her head as it was too much effort. The only thing she could move was her face and the rumbling of her stomach.<br>\r\n\"How could this be?!\" Twilight frustrated at the result, \"I've put every kind of spells to protect from intruders and set up detection spells if he manage to pass through them.\"<br>\r\n\"He's good. Passing you means he can easily pass any other important figures. The whole world is doomed,\" Starlight theorized.<br>\r\nZecora belly roared that shook the floor of the castle.<br>\r\n\"I get the salad. You take care of Zecora,\" Spike went to kitchen to whip up a salad that could easily feed 30 ponies.<br>\r\nIt's too early in the day to go back to sleep so they take care of Zecora and waited for another meeting.<br>\r\n\"Zecora, how are you feeling?\" Twilight tried to make a conversation.<br>\r\n\"Besides being bigger than an elephant and hungrier than whale, I just need a massive scale,\" Zecora tried to joke at the situation.</span></div></div>",

All the girls were extremely annoyed and frustrated about the outcome. The cloaked pony managed to pass every spell to protect Zecora.<br>\r\n\"So,\" Rainbow asked, \"the exercise is a no go?\"<br>\r\n\"No,\" Twilight admit defeat, \"She is too fat to fit in the pool and her limbs are too heavy to move. She is so immobile that water could not help her.\"<br>\r\n\"So,\" Fluttershy asked, \"Is there no hope for her?\"<br>\r\n\"The only thing I could do is to give her a strict diet. I've been only giving her salad with no dressing, fruits and vegetable,\" Twilight smacked her head on the table.<br>\r\n\"I am sorry darling but where is Spike and Starlight?\" Rarity was the only one noticed they were missing from the table.<br>\r\n\"Zecora had literately eat everything that is healthy in my kitchen. I've sent them to the market to buy everything to feed her. Zecora had to eat as big as a feast every once per hour. By my calculation, she eats more than the whole population of Ponyville in a day at this moment,\" Twilight groaned.<br>\r\nThe girls heard the Zecora's belly roared throughout the castle, \"We will get you something to eat! Just wait for a few more minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike and Starlight came back with a large cart of food, \"We've got the food,\" both Spike and Starlight breath heavily after pulling it across the whole market and back to the castle.<br>\r\n\"Just feed Zecora and we take about this situation,\" Twilight commanded as she was in deep thought.<br>\r\nThey walked past her with the food and soon everypony in the castle can hear Zecora munching and moaning with relief.<br>\r\nWhen Spike and Starlight came back to the meeting, Twilight explained the dilemma, \"Her appetite is out of control and I am running low on food. The cloaked pony managed to evade me and make Zecora as big as small house. Zecora need to find a bigger place if she is still growing.\"<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea,\" Fluttershy told Twilight.<br>\r\n\"Really!\" Twilight was surprise for a solution, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Discord,\" Fluttershy was sound confident with the answer, \"He can summoned food and I can provide the space for her. All I need is the constant supervision of Zecora. She is unprotected if nopony look out for her.\"<br>\r\nTwilight tried to argue back that it was a bad idea but she could not think of anything else,\"Okay. We will go with your ideas. Is Discord up to it?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he will help. All I need is to ask him.\"<br>\r\nSpike burped up a letter and flew to Twilight. Twilight opened the letter and read what was going on.<br>\r\n\"Girls. We're ending the meeting early. Princess Celestia needs me,\" Twilight vanished from the room before anypony could ask what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight appeared in front of Princess Celestia, \"Princess, I've got the letter. What do you need from me?\"<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia was fat. Her belly was big as if she swallowed a beach ball. Her limbs have thickens and noticeably gained a double chin. Her butt filled up her seat. Luckily she was still mobile and her belly didn't touch the ground. She did look a bit thinner than in the pictures.<br>\r\n\"Twilight. Luckily you weren't inflicted like me,\" Princess Celestia lead her to a hallway.<br>\r\nWhile walking down the hallway Twilight asked what was going on.<br>\r\n\"My sister and I need to locate that pony. Do you have any lead?\"<br>\r\n\"No,\" Twilight felt disappointed about herself, \"I have no idea how to stop him. I failed you princess.\"<br>\r\n\"Twilight,\" Celestia frowned at her, \"We are princesses now. You do not have to call me princess. And how could you bad when I could not even stop him.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Twilight tried to change the subject, \"You look a lot thinner.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you Twilght,\" Princess Celestia smiled, \"I've been exercising a lot and cutting back on the cakes.\"<br>\r\n\"What about Princess Luna?\"<br>\r\nCelestia whispered to Twilight, \"You should see her yourself.\"<br>\r\nTwilight stood in front of Princess Luna's room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight was shocked at what she just saw. One word that Twilight describe Princess Luna was 'elephant'. She was taller than Princess Celestia by a few inches because of her added weight. Her belly swamped the ground while standing. Her triple thick chins and thick limbs made it impossible for her to wear her attire. Her butt was so wide that it could fill up 6 seats. Princess Luna was wearing her sweatbands while doing multiple exercises techniques at the same time. She was trotting in one spot, lifting weights and once in a while would do a jumping jacks that shook her whole room. She was covered in sweat and panting loudly. To compensate all the sweat, she consume tonnes of energy drinks and health smoothies. There were high stacks of plates with crumbs of salad left on it which shown that she was on a strict diet.<br>\r\n\"Greetings Twilight!\" Princess Luna kept exercising while talking, \"What art we discussing today?\"<br>\r\n\"Sister, could you please stop exercising? You've been at this for more than eight hours without break,\" Princess Celestia was seen clearly frustrated at her sister, \"You will tire yourself out. A short break would not damage your figure.\"<br>\r\n\"Not until my belly stop touching the ground!\" Princess Luna continued grunting as she kept exercising.<br>\r\nTwilight shook off her stupor and questioned about the situation, \"What happen to you? How come you are way bigger than Princess Celestia?\"<br>\r\n\"As you can see Twilight,\" Princess Luna flipped on her back and start doing pull ups, \"We attempt'd to use magic to dispel the trickery but that gent hath caught me and gaveth me a harsh punishment.\"<br>\r\nIt was funny for Twilight to see Princess Luna attempting to do a pull-up. All she managed to do was shaking her whole body and smashing her face into the giant belly.<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia dragged Twilight in to seat with her on some pillows next to Princess Luna.<br>\r\n\"We need to find a way to capture him,\" Princess Celestia set out a map of the world between the ponies and pointed many parts of it, \"This pony had been sighted every major city in every nation.\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't we set the best guards to hunt him?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n\"As soon as the subjects hath heard of our demise, *PANT* they flee and stayed away from him at all course. *PANT* Even the bravest of stallions,\" panted Princess Luna as she levitated a bottle of energy drink to herself.<br>\r\n\"He literally have all the power in the world. He can robbed a bank in open daylight and would still get away because no policepony would dare to confront him.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Twilight panicked, \"What to do? What to do?\"<br>\r\n\"We have the best ponies working on the spell to capture him but the experts said that it could take a 'while',\" Princess Celestia stressed out the last word.<br>\r\n\"How long is a 'while' exactly?\"<br>\r\nBefore Princess Celestia said anything, Princess Luna butted in, \"Years. More likely decades just to understand the basis of his talents.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Twilight gasped at the results.<br>\r\n\"Twilight head my words,\" Princess Celestia gained the attention of Twilight Sparkle, \"Do not attempt to capture him. We don't need another princess caught by his spell. Lay low and let him be. Until we get the solution just continued your business as best as you can.\"<br>\r\nTwilight had another thing to be shock at. Princess Celestia was telling her to let him be and don't do anything about it. However it was logical. Charging in with no plan or clue to stop him can be catastrophic for her.<br>\r\n\"Okay. I won't be stopping him. I just report him to you whenever I see him,\" Twilight admitted defeat.<br>\r\n\"Thank you for understanding,\" Princess Celestia smiled at her, \"Avoid him at all cost and just research about him if you can without confronting him.\"<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle left the princesses and teleported back home to her castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back, she saw Spike spoon feeding Zecora salad with Starlight and Fluttershy discussing about Zecora's relocation.<br>\r\nFluttershy noticed Twilight came back and talk about the summon, \"Twilight! You back. Anything bad happen to princesses?\"<br>\r\nTwilight signed as she addressed the news, \"Celestia told me not to look for him. Stay away from him and don't be in his way.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Fluttershy hugged Twilight, \"I know it's tough to not do anything but she knows the best.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks Fluttershy. I needed that,\" Twilight let go of the hug and gave a faint smile.<br>\r\n\"Twilight!\" Starlight rushed in to tell the plan, \"We've decided to place Zecora at the backyard of Fluttershy's house. It's a good distance away from the Everfree Forest and Fluttershy can watch over her. Rainbow will clear all the clouds and Applejack bring the supplies to build a fence around it.\"<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear but where is Discord?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n\"He's coming. He would be here any sec...\" Twilight was interrupted by a bright flash.<br>\r\n\"I'm here!\" Discord appeared in front of the girls. Discord now have a small potbelly but can be easily burn off.<br>\r\n\"Discord!\" Fluttershy hugged him, \"Thank Celestia that you are okay.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Discord shake his belly with his paws, \"Just a bit of weight. I got lucky I got away from him before I ended up like the princesses.\"<br>\r\n\"Discord. I require your assistance,\" Twilight gained the attention of Discord.<br>\r\n\"Ohh. Twilight needing my assistance. Must be soooo important and hard for her to do,\" Discord mocking.<br>\r\n\"I need you to feed Zecora salad whenever she is hungry twenty-four seven,\" Twilight poked at Zecora's belly.<br>\r\nDiscord literally had his eyes bulged out at what he just witnessed, \"We want me to be her personal nanny. What has she been eating? Giant wedding cakes for snacks!\"<br>\r\nZecora's belly roared at the mention of cakes, \"Discord please do not mention cake as it make my belly shake.\"<br>\r\n\"Discord. She needed to eat healthy to loose weight. I read that just stop eating can cause her to died from starvation. Ponyville don't have the crops to feed her everyday,\" Twilight begged.<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Fluttershy begged as well while showing puppy eyes.<br>\r\nDiscord couldn't resist Fluttershy's puppy eyes, \"Oh poop. Okay. I would be her nanny. But if I saw that cloaked pony, I would leave in a instant. Do I made myself clear?\"<br>\r\n\"Understandable,\" Twilight agreeing with the terms, \"Starlight! Let's teleport Zecora to Fluttershy's backyard.\"<br>\r\nEverybody in the room disappeared by Twilight and Starlight combined spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony appeared at Fluttershy's backyard. Zecora was a few inches above the ground before landing roughly which cause a small tremor on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Zecora. Haven't teleported anything as big as you,\" Starlight apologized.<br>\r\n\"It's no problem. May fall is cushion by my bottom,\" Zecora replied.<br>\r\n\"You still hungry, Zecora?\" asked Spike.<br>\r\n\"A bit peckish. Just feeling sick from mostly eating lettuce.\"<br>\r\nTwilight, Starlight, Spike and Fluttershy set the perimeter for Zecora. Soon Twilight's friends joined her to help Zecora get comfortable. Applejack put up a sturdy fence for animals to not stumble upon Zecora, Rarity made a huge blanket if she get cold, Rainbow cleared the skies, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie served refreshments. Discord was feeding Zecora with healthy and low calorie food while exercising to lose the extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day, everything was done. Twilight told everypony to return home and do not confront the cloaked pony. Twilight knew that Zecora would be meeting that pony again without any protection. Even though Fluttershy was nearby, she would be hiding under her bed. Only Discord was left alone with Zecora. Discord would make small talks with her to pass the time. Discord found it funny that Zecora would be still eating as she was sleeping. He was told that Zecora cannot sleep if she wasn't fed throughout the night. Discord was resting on Zecora's belly until he heard the cloaked pony.<br>\r\n\"Zecora! There you are!\" the cloaked pony approached her, \"Very hard to miss when you are bigger than that cottage.\"<br>\r\nDiscord gaped in fear. He knew he would be spotted if he use his magic so he hid between Zecora's love handles and pray to not be found.<br>\r\n\"Losing weight,\" the cloaked pony sunk his hoof into her flab, \"I know you don't want this to happen so I know the best solution for you to never lose a pound.\"</span></div></div>",

I let you go before and I would not let you off again.\"<br>\r\n\"Please!\" Discord begged on his knees, \"Leave me be. I won't be in your way.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" the cloaked pony laughed, \"You look a bit thin. Maybe a bit more meat on you can do the trick.\"<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Discord cried as he kissed his hooves, \"I would do anything! I don't want to lose my figure!\"<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" the cloaked pony was deep in thought, \"What is the best uses for you?\"<br>\r\nZecora woke up from the rumbling from her stomach, \"Food. I'm not in a waiting mood.\"<br>\r\nThis gave the cloaked pony an idea, \"Discord follow me. I got a job for you.\"<br>\r\nDiscord reluctantly followed him to Zecora's head. When they got here, Zecora was not surprise to meet the cloaked pony again.<br>\r\nTo greet her, the cloaked pony kissed her in her lips passionately. This made Zecora blushed uncontrollably and felt conflicted. This was the first time somepony was sexually interested in her but he was the one that made her immobile.<br>\r\n\"Zecora, have you been eating right?\" the cloaked pony was concern with her.<br>\r\n\"I'm here on a diet. I hope you are not going to rise a riot,\" Zecora looked unimpressed with the situation. She would cross her front hooves for emphasis but she was too fat to lift them.<br>\r\n\"Well the diet you have is not working,\" exclaimed the cloaked pony, \"You are losing weight. I just need to change your eating habit.\"<br>\r\nHe motioned with his hoof to bring Discord closer to him.<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord?\" Discord tried to be sincere as possible as he stood next to him.<br>\r\n\"From now on you are Zecora's maid, butler and chef 24/7. You had to clean her spotless everyday, feed her every time she is hungry even she doesn't want to, entertain her when she is bored and etc,\" commanded the cloaked pony.<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Discord repeated what he just said.<br>\r\n\"Her new diet will be involving high calorie junk food. Foods that are either fried, covered in lard/butter, high sugar content or greasy. Do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord.\"<br>\r\n\"If you tried to help her lose weight, I would know. The punishment is for you to be half as fat as she is,\" Discord wrapped his belly in his arms while trembling.<br>\r\n\"Show me if you can follow my orders. Feed Zecora the most fattening dish you can find. Extra-large.\"<br>\r\nDiscords walked up to her and mouth the word sorry. He summoned a giant fudge cake that is the size of a fully grown stallion.<br>\r\n\"No more,\" Zecora whined as the fudge flew closer to her, \"You will make my weight soar.\"<br>\r\nZecora tried to resist it but she couldn't as it smell delicious, her stomach starving and getting sick by only having salad.<br>\r\nWhen the fudge touched her lips, she devoured it like a savage beast. Chocolate and crumbs smeared across her mouth and chins and Discord wiped it clean for her. Zecora's belly still rumbled, asking for more food.<br>\r\n\"I don't want any more. You are making my mobility even more poor,\" Zecora cried.<br>\r\n\"Silly filly. Letting you starve is not healthy,\" the cloaked pony stared at Discord, \"You know what to do.\"<br>\r\nDiscord nodded at his request and summon a large greasy pizza which is the size of a small backyard pool.<br>\r\n\"No. Please don't. Mmph!\" Zecora's mouth was stuffed with pizza.<br>\r\nZecora just consume it with pleasure. She moaned after every bite and stopped resisting from eating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the feast, her belly's width grew another inch. Zecora groaned to herself as she just lost control to her appetite again. She would facehoof herself if her limbs weren't so heavy and sluggish.<br>\r\n\"Isn't it nice to be full and big,\" the cloaked pony slapped her belly and seeing it ripple like somepony dropped a pebble in a pond.<br>\r\nZecora tried to talk back but all it came out from her mouth was a gigantic burp.<br>\r\n\"See, your belly agrees with me. I know you are sick of just eating salad,\" he pinched one of her belly roll, \"Why fight it? Don't worry about your weight. Just eat with your heart's content. I know you enjoy eating junk food. Don't you want to be feeling full and happy?\"<br>\r\nZecora was going to dismiss the accusation but she second guess herself. Every time she eat rich food, she would felt like she was in heaven. She love the taste of sugar and butter when it touches her tongue. Maybe, somewhere in the back of her mind, she love to continue to eat without considering the consequences.<br>\r\n\"Remember Discord. Feed her or face my wraith. I'll be gone for a while but I would be back.\"<br>\r\nWhen the cloaked pony disappeared, Zecora was in a depressing mood as she knew she would never be able to move again.</span></div></div>",

Nearly half of the population of ponies were fat now. The mane 6 and Starlight were some of the lucky ones. Zecora, however, she was bigger than anypony could be. She was bigger than anything could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced to feed her or suffer a just as worst fate, Discord had to keep feeding Zecora and taking care of her as part of the orders he got from the cloaked pony. For Zecors to have plenty of growing room, Discord took Zecora to his chaotic Dimension. This way, she also couldn't be a threat that could possibly crush a few buildings in Ponyville. Or rather, all of Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her evergrowing weight, unending hunger, and constant eating, Zecora was now more a mountain of blubber than zebra. Most of the time, Zecora just ate day in and out gaining ton after ton. Because of this, she was so fat that she could cover all of Ponyville in her fat tenfold and maybe beyond that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora had given up on her willpower long ago. She just ate without hesitation. Sometimes even swallowing the food she was fed whole. The more she ate, the fatter she got. The fatter she got, the bigger her stomach got. The bigger her stomach got, the more food she could put in it. This also meant Discord had to put her feedings in overdrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was Hearth's Warming Eve. A great holiday if it wasn't for the cloaked pony still on the loose. Zecora knew if he were to show up again, she might grow even more massive than she was now.

Twilight Sparkle had given up just as he was starting to fear that she would find out how to stop him, and her friends were already too far plunged into the depths of disharmony and chaos to be brought back! Celestia was encased in stone as a bit of cruel irony and sweet revenge for the draconeqqus, her sister nowhere to be after things began going south. Yes he was indeed happy with the way things had gone, and it was only just beginning for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord sat in his throne, or rather laid on it as the chaos around him made him double over in laughter for one reason or another. Who knew exactly what it was he was laughing out now, for so many different things were going on at once and it was hard to tell. That's how it went with chaos, you could never tell what was going on or why it was! A couple of coughs and the snap of a finger later, and Discord was soothing his throat with a cool drink of glass, a trick of which he became fond of. He cleared his throat and was back to an upright position, \"Oh what a marvelous display! I'll never grow tired of this new world of chaos, it's simply too great!\" And he was right, for their was an endless amount of things he could do just with the snap of a finger, and many more ways to do such things as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where to start... Simply watching chaos unfold is great, but it would grow old with time. He needed something long lasting, something he could do himself while watching everything unfold naturally would still have its novelty. Discord's hand went to his beard as he stroked it lightly, then he began slumping in his throne while his mind raced. Body alteration came to mind, but he was very fond of the way he looked already, he looked simply chaotic! One hand went to his serpentine body, and he rubbed it up and down in thought. He was more or less ruler of the world now, was he not? Chaos was everywhere, and nothing could stop it thanks to the pitiful ponies giving up. With power like that one should look powerful! But... muscles were too much work, and simply giving himself the new look was too boring, not to mention his whole form would look unappealing to even him if he had a defined body. No he had to think of something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore thinking was done and he had come to a conclusion. His throne was big, and he was long and skinny, so what better way to kick off the chaos than by kicking up his heels and eating some cake? Yes, fat was easy to keep track of, and not too bad looking to boot! He'd do it naturally for the most part, better to have this a long lasting endeavor than to get to the end and be bored with it quickly. A foot stool poofed in to match his throne, and he reclined back with a satisfied sigh. A snap of the fingers and something tasty appeared in his hand, and he bit into...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soarin smiled to himself and felt butterflies zipping around in his stomach, along with the fritters he had munched on to boost his confidence. They hadn't really worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sitting outside one of Ponyville's restaurants- he had forgotten the name already- watching the hustle and bustle of the town market. He wasn't in his Wonderbolts uniformHis gaze was mostly upon the apple stand. Actually, he was watching the mare running the stand. Her golden mane underneath that stetson, her lovely orange coat, those adorable freckles, and that sweet smile she gave to everypony who passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly felt himself getting nervous and stuffing another sandwich into his mouth. He stifled a burp and mentally berated himself. Ever since the last Grand Galloping Gala where he had tasted the sweetest, gooiest, warmest... yummiest... satisfying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin wiped the drool from his mouth. Ever since he had tasted that pie the golden maned beauty had made, he found himself always craving a second helping of both that wonderful baked good, although 'good' wasn't a good enough word, and the wonderful smile just for him. It was easy, in theory; go up, buy some apples, start and conversation that leads to revealing he was the Wonderbolt that bought a pie from her, and get another. Work towards that smile later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was so easy, why couldn't he just get up and go talk to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More fritters, sir?\" somepony asked from behind him. Soarin turned to see an irate waiter holding a platter with his magic. Soarin opened his mouth to say no, but his stomach beat him to the punch with a gurgle. \"I'll take that as a yes,\" he said and let the dish clatter onto Soarin's table. Soarin sighed, took one of the pastries and bit with gusto. It was delicious, to be sure, but it wasn't that apple pie. Every time he tried to eat, he hoped to taste the same treat he had at the Gala. When he didn't, he wanted more until he did. This had increased his already voracious apatite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his large stuffed belly and remembered Sptifire's teasing words. \"Hey, keep eating like that and you won't be 'soaring' much longer.\" It was true, he had gained some weight since that fateful gala. He could still fly and do tricks, but his new belly and bigger flanks made it difficult to do both. He loved flying... but he loved food more. That wasn't an excuse to quit your job and team, though. However, he was petty sure he loved that mare more than flying AND food put together. He loved her cooking, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as he looked himself over. Why would she want him, anyway? She was a strong and independent farmer, and he was a lazy and fat flyer. He couldn't even stop a dragon. He didn't stand a chance at her heart. To make matters worse, he couldn't even bring himself to buy another pie. If he didn't get another bite, he was going to go nuts and possibly eat himself silly. He pictured himself a huge blob pining away for more and more to eat. He felt disgusted at how pathetic he was and how likely that seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon he was out of fritters again. And he was still hungry! How could he still be hungry after eight daisy sandwiches, ten plates of fritters, and five slices of lackluster pie? He felt like screaming from the madness of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Scuse me, sugar cube,\" a pony said from next to Soarin. He felt his eyes shrink and his muscles clench. He knew that melodious voice all too well. He turned to see that wonderful mare giving him one of those smiles, even if it was a confused one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. H-hi,\" he squeaked. He looked at his pile of dishes and felt disgusted all over again. Did she see him making a pig of himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't think me rude, but I couldn't but notice ya'll over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh sweet Celestia, she did see him. Soarin blushed and desperately wanted to hide under a rock. \"W-what did you notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare smiled again.</span></div></div>",

Now don't tell me... we met at an apple convention? Naw, that's not it. Yer from a delivery service? No, I'd be sure to recognize you. Yer one of Dash's pals? Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin smiled. Even if she didn't remember, just knowing he left a strong enough impression to be recognized despite his lack of flight suit and added weight pleased him immensely.  \"Not quite. I've met Dash. And you too, actually. You probably don't remember, though, since I was in uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uniform?\" she said. She beamed. \"Hot dog, Ah got it! Yer the one that bought the pie at the-\" she immediately closed her mouth, looked around, and leaned in close to him. \"At the Gala. Yer that Wonderbolt fella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin nodded. \"Yeah, that was me. That was a great pie by the way. I've never had anything better. My name's Soarin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack,\" she said happily and grabbed Soarin's hoof and shook it vigorously. His body wobbled violently from the force. \"Glad to know <i>somepony</i> at the stinkin' party liked my treats. I swear, those Canterlot ponies wouldn't know good grub if it got them square in the snout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin grabbed his stomach to stop it from shaking. \"Tell me about it. I'm always starving at the end of those things. Their food is so unsatisfying not like...\" he smiled sheepishly. \"Not like your pie was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack giggled. \"Why, if Ah didn't know better, I'd say you came all this way just for my home cookin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are drooling a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin gasped and rubbed the spit from his mouth. Jeez, he must look like such a slob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I like a pony who likes a good meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin's eyes widened as Applejack met his gaze and she poked his prominent belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you enjoy a good meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin felt like he could melt. \"I love food,\" he said dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, ya'll want to come to my home and get some real good fillin's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin could not remember the last time he had sat down to a family meal like this. His recent binges were certainly nothing like this, with a warm home cooked meal. He was at a large table surrounded by Applejack's family. He felt so strange, but not out of place at all. They were so welcoming to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yer one a them Wonderbolt fellas Scootaloo goes on about?\" Applebloom said. Soarin stuffed another spoonful of butter soaked mashed potatoes into his mouth and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A celebrity?\" Granny Smith said as she planted another helping of... well... everything at the table on his plate. \"To think my little Applejack knows such famous ponies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac merely said, \"Eeyup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin swallowed and waved them off. \"Oh, it's no big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is,\" Applejack said as she brought in -<i>oh rapture</i>- a steaming hot apple pie. \"Don't be all modest now. You do them amazin' tricks o' yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin blushed. \"Actually, I haven't done them in a while. I've been on a leave of absence for some time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that because yer fat?\" Applebloom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applebloom!\" Granny reprimanded before whacking her upside the head. \"That's impolite an' you knows it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin sighed a had another spoonful of stew. \"Don't blame her, she's right. I've been hungry for quite some time now. I've been putting on weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't nothin' wrong with a healthy appetite,\" Applejack said as she cut a slice of pie and placed in in front of Soarin. \"If a fella's gotta eat then a fella's gotta eat. You've had about four plates, Soarin, are ya ready for desert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin rubbed his bloated stomach in anticipation. He felt like he could eat for another hour at least, but that pie called to him. But... granny had made dinner. Did that mean-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah made it myself,\" Applejack added almost seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat tore it. Soarin stuffed the whole slice into his mouth. He felt like crying. It was so <i>tasty</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up, sugar cube. I made enough for seconds. Maybe fifths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the Apple clan made any objection as Soarin continued to stuff himself silly. The whole family ate a lot, but as farm ponies they needed the the extra strength. Soarinate three times as much as any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was delicious,\" Soarin said as he patted his finally full belly. \"I couldn't eat another bite.\" He felt so wonderful now that had had the pie within him. Maybe he could start losing the weight at long last. but then he thought back to when Applejack had said she liked a pony who liked food. Did that mean anything about his weight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack looked at the empty plates in frot of Soarin. \"So, where' ya'll stayin tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin had to think a moment to get past his haze of food and make a coherent response. \"Well, I was planning on going to a hotel nearby...\"</span></div></div>",

I am pretty out of shape.\" Soarin poked himself, regretfully staring at the accumulation of his mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can stay in mah room tonight,\" Applejack said. Soarin found himself glad that he didn't have anything in his mouth to spit out. \"That bed might <i>jus'</i> be big enough for the two of us. An' iffin' it ain't...\" Applejack went up to Soarin's ear, she she certainly didn't whisper, \"You'll make a right good bed on yer own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin felt like he was about to pass out. \"Th-Thank you Applejack. I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is getting purdy late,\" Applejack said. \"An' Ah figure ya'll gotta be tired after flyin' all the way here from Cloudsdale. C'mon, I'm right tuckered out.\" Applejack pulled at Soarin's hooves and led him up to stairs. \"Night, ya'll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night,\" Big Mac called, and the rest of the family waved after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin felt his head spin in joy. When he had come to Ponyville, he certainly had not expected to end up in Applejack's house for dinner. A pretty large dinner, at that. Now he was on his way to Applejack's bedroom to spend the night with her in bed. He felt like he could melt in pure happiness at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they reached the stairs and he began to climb. Flying was still relatively easy for him, since it was an act of magic. It still cause a bit of strain to life his heavier form. Walking didn't wind him since he was athletic, but he could feel the pounds. Now, as he climbed the stairs, his stuffed stomach swished to and fro and bounced against his legs and he once more felt like a slob. He was such a pig, and Applejack was still a wonderfully toned and fit farmer. She was probably taking pity on him, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Applejack said as she him into her modest little room. There wasn't exactly a lot on space, so Soarin found he had to take extra care not to bump his flank into the dresser that held delicate pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I just, uh, climb in?\" Soarin said with a nervous glance at the one-pony bed. He was suddenly doubting his pity theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack giggled softly. \"Well, that's the idea of goin' to bed, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, well, I'm so big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah know. Isn't it wonderful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin felt like he might explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya'll jus' get in an' I'll squirm into any extra space,\" She said before blowing out a lamp, leaving them in only the moonlight her window allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin squeaked and gently leapt into the bed, seeing how much feel his belly took up. Applejack worked her way into bed with him, getting a good deal of her body underneath him, using his as covers almost. She pulled the blanket up so it was over them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How ya feelin', sugar?\" Applejack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty darn good,\" Soarin said as he nuzzled into Applejack's neck. Applejack chuckled and returned the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah bet ya weren't 'specting tah be here tonight, were ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I wasn't. I mean... I've become a fat slob. I... ever since I tasted your pie, all I could think about was having more. I've been pathetically eating, hoping for another taste. I let myself go. Just look at me.\" Soarin slapped his fat underneath the blanket. \"I was worried, actually. I thought a strong, independent mare like you would be disgusted with a helpless fatty like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack smiled and began to feel Soarin's body. \"Remember what Ah said earlier? Ah said Ah like a pony that likes a good meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's voice became incredibly sultry. \"Ah <i>love</i> a pony who <i>loves</i> a good meal, iffin ya catch my drift. An' Ah do believe ya'll said ya <i>love</i> food earlier, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin broke out in a sweat. \"I did say that, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack rubbed her nose against Soarin's cheek and placed a leg over Soarin's flank. \"Ah'm a pretty honest pony, so let be be frank; Ah think yer cute. Not only that, Ah think yer darn right sexy. Ah thank ya'll fer tellin' me I'm a strong pony. Ah work out everyday on the farm, Ah have to be lean in order to buck apples fer so long. But that's not something I'm particularly fond of in a stallion. An' I sure as shootin' am independant. Ah'm also the most dependable pony in Ponyville, in case you didn't know. Ah like ponies dependin' on me. So to hear that all this time since the Gala you've been wantin' some of my sweets, well...\" Applejack gave him a peck on the nose. \"Ah can honestly say Ah'm pleased to know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin felt like he could die right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah like the idea of you dependin' on me, of needin' me. Ah'll make you all the sweets you could ever want. You don't have to do a thing. In fact, Ah'd hate you doin' anything. Ah want you to just lay here an' eat an' eat. How's that sound to ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet Celestia...\" Soarin murmured. \"That sounds like Heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha say? Ya wanna give it a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin thought for a moment. \"I want to so bad, Applejack. But we barely know each other. Not to mention I'm supposed to be a Wonderbolt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can take it nice an' slow if ya want,\" Applejack said. \"Ah'm in no rush. But ya gotta pick soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin sighed. \"I know. I just keep getting fatter. I wouldn't mind if I wasn't a Wonderbolt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Applejack asked. \"You'd earnestly pick me if ya weren't already a Wonderbolt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You know what? I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love flying, but I also love food. More than flying, in fact. And the first time I saw you smiling... I loved that more than anything. Seeing it now makes me want to stay here and do anything you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Applejack said, closing her eyes and leaning into him. \"Ah'd make you a great big stallion that depended on me for everything, as much as you'd be willing to let me do for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that sounds so nice,\" Soarin said, closing his eyes. \"I'll think about it, okay? I have quite a few bits saved up, and if I sold the home I barely use, I could fund your farm for life. Maybe once they see I'm not exactly getting in shape, they'll let me quit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Applejack said as they held each other close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin relaxed utterly, screaming in his mind cheers and praises. He could hardly believe how this had turned out. He was lying in bed with the most perfect mare to ever live, and she loved him as he was. He dreamed of eating her glorious cooking day in and day out, getting fatter just to please her, letting her cuddle him because it would make her smile...</span></div></div>",

He hiccuped as he took his first steps onto the lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Ah can't interest you in eighths?\" Applejack called after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin's stomach growled at the prospect. He turned around and opened his mouth to reply, but all that came out was \"<b>baaaaarrrp.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack let out a hearty laugh. \"Ah take it ya enjoyed breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was asking for more not obvious enough?\" Soarin replied. \"Believe me, I'd eat more of your cooking if the extra baggage wouldn't ground me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack walked up to him and nuzzled his cheek. \"Hmm, so one more plate of apple pancakes would make you stuck here with me? Ah might have to force it down yer throat, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin felt himself stiffen at the prospect of being force fed more food by the lovely mare before him just so he'd have to stay. \"Ohhh, believe me, I wouldn't mind. But I have to get back or I could get in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack made an exaggerated pout. \"Alright. Don't be a stranger, ya hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding?\" he slapped his stomach. \"I'm addicted. I couldn't stay away if I tried. Besides, with any luck, I'll be fired by the end of the day. I was, uh... supposed to be losing weight on my vacation...\" His face turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack patted the chub of his budding second chin. \"Looks tah me like ya put on a few pounds since last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had to wager a guess, he'd supposed he had put on about thirty pounds since meeting Applejack the night previous. \"I'm pretty sure they're going to be mad about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't worry about them. Remember there's one mare that thinks yer drop dead handsome.\" She leaned forward and kissed him lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin held himself back from crying out in joy, though it was obviously hard for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya'll come back back now, ya hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course,\" Soarin said with a wobble. \"Be back soon.\" He flapped his wings and began to float away from the farm, towards Cloudsdale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack sighed in content as he clumsily flew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinkin' he's the one?\" Granny Smith asked. from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck yeah. He's got the appetite fer me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, then. Jus' remember he's yer responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah wouldn't have it any other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin knew that tone and that phrase. They were something he had used on occasion, all for the same purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Spitfire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to the lockers with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't we already there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire looked around. \"Oh yeah. I'm so used to doing this, I have it memorized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's this about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soarin, I know I've been joking about your weight, but it's really becoming a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin sighed. \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were supposed to spend the past week exercising, but it looks like you get fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are blunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need it. There's no way you can do trick flying like you are, and we don't have enough time to whip you into shape for the next show. What were you doing? You look like you've been stuffing your face nonstop. Look at you!\" She slapped his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! That hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve it, you lug. Now we have to push the show back, and refund quite a few ponies their bits, Then we're going to have to spend more bits on a personal trainer. Do you know how much this is going to cost us just to keep your spot in the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Maybe you should give it to somepony else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire froze. \"What did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me.\" Soarin pulled out a chocolate bar and made a show of stuffing it in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire gawked for a moment before speaking. \"Do you have any idea what you just said? If you give that slot up, it's as good as quitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Soarin said through the goop in his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire shook his head. \"What's this about, Soarin? You love flying. You love being a Wonderbolt. Why are you doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spitfire, I'm sorry. There are some things I love more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire looked Soarin over. Her eyes suddenly widened and her frown became a grin. \"No way. You found her, didn't you? You found the baker babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if I did?\" Soarin felt his face grow hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a chubby chaser, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe practically choked on the melted chocolate in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Celestia, she totally is. Ha, ha, this is too rich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's fine,\" Spitfire said with a sad sort of smile. \"Your somepony else's stallion now. It's gotta be fate; One pie, and you're gone.\" She shook her head. \"She likes fatties, and you're the fatty for her. No problem with that. Clear out your locker, I'll get the paperwork ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're letting me go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's not like I can really stop you. You've worked hard these past years with the 'Bolts. You've contributed enough to more than earn all the bits you've made, since you made most of our most famous routines. Your head is where all you 'Bolt action was. So you let your body go; so big deal. Maybe we can set up a deal wher you're still giving us routine ideas and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spitfire... thanks.\" Soarin reached out and hugged his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged his neck flab. \"Whatever, you big lug. If you're going to get fatter, you'd better become the biggest stallion in the whole world, you got me? Be the best at whatever it is you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, heh. I just might have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and keep the suit. Old times sake, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure. But I might have a hard time fitting into the spandex now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitefire gave a sultry grin. \"I think somepony else is going to like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yer really here tah stay?\" Applejack beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'll let me,\" Soarin said back. Applejack leaped forward and squished into his fat. \"Ah'm so happy tah hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin melted around her as she squeezed him. \"So, uh... is your family okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course they are. Ah wouldn't invite some strange stallion tah live in mah room without tellin' them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they know that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less. You're now one of our pigs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin went stiff. \"Is this some kinda foreplay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack chuckled and her look became sultry. \"Why, is it working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" he squeaked, making Applejack fall onto her bed in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot tar, yer easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin couldn't work up the nerve to say she was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got back up. \"Well, is mah piggy ready for his eats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop calling me piggy,\" Soarin said, though he didn't particularly sound like he wanted her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't think so, Piggy. If yer gonna live here, yer gonna be mah piggy. An any piggy of mine...\" an apple tart was stuffed into Soarin's mouth, \"is gonna be a well fed piggy. How's that work for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin moaned at the flavor assaulting his mouth. \"That's works fine, Applejack.\" He swallowed. \"I think Piggy would like that a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack purred. \"Well, come on, Piggy, get into bed and we'll get started on yer pampering. I'm gonna make you not want to move an inch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin made to get in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Applejack said, and Soarin stopped. He turned around to see Applejack poking around in his bag. \"They let you keep the suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. For memory's sake. I might be able to squeeze in it, but if you're gonna fatten me up I won't much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, then let's make the most out of it. Put it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Piggy questioning his owner? There might not be pie tonight if that's the case,\" she playfully replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Piggy's a good Piggy!\" He put the suit on as quickly as he could. Applejack inspected the material that was stretching around his exaggerated form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Ah don't want you taking it off without tellin' me. I want to see you blow out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin felt he was about to blow himself from the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer gonna eat an' eat an' eat 'til that costume gets torn to shreds. Imagine it; a couple hundred pounds heftier, the suit is pinchin' ya somethin' fierce. All the fat held tight in a neat package, beggin' to be released. An' when it does...\" She gave Soarin a kiss on the lips. \"We'll blow right on top of each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get into bed, Piggy. Ah'll get you started on yer slop fer the day.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soarin sighed and his suit creaked a bit. He felt like Hearth's Warming Dinner, Wrapped up so tight. But he'd be lying pretty bad if he said the sensation didn't fill him with glee. He wondered just how much his suit would take... and how much weight he's have to put on to burst out of it. Some part of him hoped it would be a long, hard earned reward after many, many pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack licked her lips and crawled up onto Soarin's engorged belly, grabbing a pie from the spread of treats and desserts. \"Now open wide, Piggy, it's feeding time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin didn't have to be told twice as he opened his mouth and allowed the warms crusted slice of heaven to enter his mouth. He closed his eyes as sticky sweet apple flavored syrup washed over his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Piggy likes his ets, doesn't her? Get nice and full. You're going to be my prize pig, ya hear.\" She took a bit of some fritter herself before she slipped the rest of it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait.\" Soarin blinked and chewed. \"You said a <i>couple hundred</i> pounds heavier. Exactly how big do you plan on making me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack chortled and grabbed what had to have been the largest bowl of applesauce Soarin had ever laid eyes on. Gallons and gallons of sweet mush, with cinnamon and sugars tickling at his nose to tell him just how sweet it would truly be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big?\" Applejack purred as she began to relentlessly pour into him. \"Depends on how much you can take. As big as a couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moan wormed it's way through Soarin's throat as he began to fill up. Gulp after gulp, he felt himself reaching that full state he had once craved so desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ain't big enough. Big as this room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach churned ad grumbled happily as his eyes began to roll back from the flavor assault. The swelling was pretty obvious, his mass increases with each gulp he made. He swore he could feel his haunches getting pulled in tighter into his suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, not big enough. Bigger than my barn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin whined as he imagined himself so large. Not able to move, not able to fly, not even able to eat on his own. A blob of a pony, jiggling fat the spread out all around, just so much of himself. A big, blue blob of fat, only getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Could a pony even become so monstrously fat? He would need Applejack for everything, from baths, to feeding, to more... raunchy activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis suit became even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, still not enough. As big as a blimp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin screamed through the seemingly never ending mess of goop. He felt so full and tight already. He was always hungy whenever he ate anything else, but something about Applejack's meals made him feel full. Was it just because of all the carbs? It certainly felt like he was gaining weight in mere seconds compared to what it had been like before. On the matter of blimps, of wondered if being inflated felt like this. If it did, he hoped it would never stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a good place to start.\" The last of the sauce fripped into Soarin's mouth. He groaned and she licked at the excess sauce on his muzzle. \"A big blimp pony, fat... tubby... beyond obese. And every pound is all mine. A big baby pig, helpless without his Momma Feeder. Mmm, yes... a good place to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin's eyes spun and he tried his best to rub his stomach. \"Ooohh... I'm... I'm so hungry... feed me. It's all I can think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack picked up a large pot of soup. \"That's my good piggy. You'll be absolutely perfect in no time. Come on, we still got a whole table of slop for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin turned his head to the table, and how much food was waiting for him. It finally hit him just how demanding being a 'Piggy' would actually be. There was enough food to feed a normal pony for a week and a half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was his dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweet Celestia...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA monstrous belch escaped his lips and he did his best to lick at his lips to get any tiny morsel he might have missed, and was rewarded with multiple sauces and tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack whistled as she tossed a platter into the pile of dishes that had accumulated. \"Well, well, well. Ah'm mighty impressed, Piggy. I half expected you to pop during the funnel cake attack. But you held through like a real trooper.\" She kissed his taut belly all over, working his way up to his lips for a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach kiss was accompanied by a squeak and a creak. Sorin sure felt ready to burst, but he made no complaint as his mare tickled his bulging form. Each touch of hers was sensitive and sent his mind into a whirlwind of sensations. He half wondered if his suit was keeping him in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Soarin covered the bed before, now he engulfed it. His suit kept him round and shaped like a balloon a little too full, but even then he covered every bit of the bed he was on. A groan and gurgle were emanate from him regularly as his body set to the terribly strenuous task of digesting the largest meal he had even eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... ooohhh...\" Soarin moaned around her lips. \"I'm s-so stuffed. H-How big am I?\" His breathing was ragged and he screwed his eyes shut. His suit rumbled as his rear end did it's best to relieve the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're even better than Ah dreamed,\" Applejack sang. \"You ate it all like a good boy and you're <i>so</i> fat!\" She squeezed his farm in a hug, forcing him to expell more gas. \"We'll have to double up your dinner portions in about a week if you keep this up. How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Soarin didn't respond. A lazy smile was on his face as he snored, passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack smiled and kissed his nose. \"Good night, Piggy. Ya ate about a hundred pounds of food today, you've earned it.\" She wormed her way under his belly to use him as a blanket, snuggling into him. \"Maybe ya really can be mah big blimp after all.\"</span></div></div>",

Queen Chrysalis pulled out a piece of note and nailed it to the door. The note read, \"Gone for a while. Emergency from homeland. Please do not disturb my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Zecora found herself in a self-made prison underground. Her prison room is basically a big hole the changelings dug out from a wall and one of her leg was chained down so she wouldn't escape. Her only furniture in her room is just a stone slab as her bed.

Having your opinion would do wonders with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora, believing the food is cursed, tried to shut her mouth really tight but the other changelings gripped her mouth wide open. Queen Chrysalis slowly levitated the food straight into her mouth and shut it tight. With nowhere to go, Zecora have to swallow the food. Queen Chrysalis saw the lump in her throat went down into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Zecora stopped struggling. She went limp so the changelings let her go. Out of nowhere, her belly let out a loud rumble. Zecora was yelling in pain while rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora stared at Queen Chrysalis and begged, \"Food! I want your food!

Every dish she ate, she moaned in delight. The changelings absorbed the love she was emitting everytime she swallow the food. Zecora keep eating so much that she fell in a food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora stared at the test subject and concluded her result, \"Tone down the effectiveness of the food, Too suspicious if seen like this in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Zecora woke up from her food binge in a daze, \"What happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her sight become clear, she was shock to see what was in front of her.</span></div></div>",

You hardly can get out of your bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diet and exercise. That is wise,\" Zecora grunted as her belly dug into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a better idea. A stable job that fit your size,\" Queen Chrysalis lead Zecora to the hallway, \"This way will lead you to many tunnels but only one will lead you to the outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Chrysalis shoved Zecora's head to the other side. Zecora's eyes widened as she drooled at what she saw. A giant pile of fattening food that seems endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could stay here and be our love food cattle. Even though we could not pay you but we have many benefits. All the food you can eat and my minions will take care of you to maximise the love outtake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora's stomach roared loudly, \"You love the food you were given before. We make sure the effectiveness for your food only would stay the same. The others would be lowered so they don't end up crazy hungry as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora tried to look away but her the strong aromas of greasy food wafted into her nose, \"What do you choose? Looking for a exit with a belly like yours or a all you can eat buffet with top services.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No matter how much Zecora tried to resist the temptation, the aroma of the greasy food overtook her. Zecora dragged her body away from the tunnels and toward the buffet table. Zecora consumed the food with no manners. Zecora was gorging, burping and slurping loudly. Queen Chrysalis laughed at what she witnessed. Queen Chrysalis watched Zecora's belly grew bigger like raising dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would take our beneficial offer,\" Queen Chrysalis absorbed the love emitting from Zecora, \"Your love for food will help me raise a new army to not take only Equestria but the whole world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Chrysalis laughed maniacally with her drones. Zecora wanted to talk back but she was busy stuffing her mouth full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be so famished that you cannot talk back at me,\" Queen Chrysalis rubbed Zecora's belly, \"Come on. Eat up. It is all yours. Just ask if you want more. It will benefit both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora kept eating until she passed out. Queen Chrysalis observed her new gluttonous love making livestock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Another meal and she eat herself to sleep,\" Queen Chrysalis stared at her drones, \"You carry her to somewhere far away where no creature would run into us. At this rate, she would fill out this cave no less than a month. We need a place no one would accidentally run into us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drones heaved Zecora onto a large cart and pulled her to a place where nobody would surely find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding a new place of operation, Queen Chrysalis started production of making new drones and ordering the drones to feed Zecora. Zecora would always claimed that she would leave and find help. However, she would always stay put and eat in pleasure. Queen Chrysalis find the bigger that Zecora is, the more love that Zecora would emit during each meal. Queen Chrysalis noticed that Zecora would double her weight each day which means she double the requirement of food each day as well. Queen Chrysalis grinned as she knew she would create a bigger and stronger army that she would command than the ones taken from King Thorax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>7 Days Later</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Chrysalis have enough drones to initiate the first phrase of plan. After days of planning, she find a way to get food into all of the societies. She would start a fast food chain. She would simultaneously open one store in each nation and expand further over time. This ensure her that no nation would aid other nations if they are too fat to fight back. Queen Chrysalis rubbed her hooves together in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This plan would be perfect and it is all thanks to you, Zecora,\" Queen Chrysalis marvelled at the sight in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora is now almost 800 times bigger than her normal size. She does not resemble as a zebra at all except for her head, tail and hooves. She was more like blob. However, hooves were almost consumed by her flabby legs, tail look minuscule compare to her massive rump and her head is mostly cheeks that partially blocked her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora was lying on her back and can only see the sky and the rising belly. Her belly soar so high that she could not see the top. A funnel was tightly attached to her mouth so the changelings can stuff as much food as they can into her maw. Zecora couldn't help but enjoy the delicious food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. As soon I take over the world, I make sure to mention you for aiding us. As a reward, I make sure you are the fattest in the world and be recognised as the biggest blubbery love maker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora couldn't do anything but mumbled through the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, my subjects let's initiate the first phrase of my unbeatable plan!\" All the drones were separated into groups and flew to their designated nation.</span></div></div>",

Why else did you think they have holes in them? That's their hunger eating themselves up. Anyway, the changelings wandered the wasteland in an attempt to distract themselves from the gnawing of... whatever it was that filled up when they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had failed them. So close, <i>so</i> very close to getting the sustenance they needed to survive. At this rate, their only hope of living was to split up and become even less of a species than they already were, basically dwindling to extinction. And why? Because of her foolish pride, a desire to one up, to best her opponents. Even worse than that, she had made an idiotic and stupid error in judgement. If love was what gave them power, why couldn't some other pony use it as well? Now it was only a matter of time until they died off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back around to her false palace made of crags and stone, a mockery of a true castle. She lied on her motty old bed. She would have cried if she could somehow work up enough emotion to do so. As it was she felt too empty to even become enraged at herself, let alone the ponied that had thwarted her. She had enough power herself to last another few weeks at best, but it seemed worthless to even be alive that long if her children would die sooner if they didn't leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is how it ends,\" Chrysalis said to herself, her voice echoing through the halls. \"Wasting until I am but dust and as dead as what I rule over. All we wanted was love. Sure, we were going to crush their hearts and leave them as husks, but at least they'd be alive. We don't get that luxury, we didn't ask to feast on love. I'd much rather eat cake. Or strawberries. Strawberries are delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on her door and Chrysalis reverted back to her vile ruler persona. \"Who dares disturb me in my chambers!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A visitor for you, mistress,\" one of her henchmen said from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis scoffed and rolled into her tattered sheets. \"I told all my subjects that I wanted none to come to me. I desire peace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is different, my liege. The visitor is a pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately sat up, her eyes wide in shock. \"A pony? A flesh and blood pony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. They want to speak to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaped up and wondered if she should try to make herself presentable in some way before she remembered that she didn't own anything like a vanity. This was unlike anything she could be prepared for. Nopony ever came to her kingdom. What did they want? To attack? To mock them? She didn't have anything to give, so they couldn't want anything like that. She decided to wing it and just see what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was led to her 'throne' (a vaguely chair shaped stone with a chicken feather stuffed cloth for a cushion) and sat, trying to seem as intimidating as possible. \"Bring them to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lackey's nodded and brought forth the visitor...</span></div></div>",

She blushed brightly as her sister playfully poked her bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ever since they were young fillies Chaser and Flitter had pretty big appetites, being able to eat more one setting than most ponies in a day. The difference thought was that the athletic Flitter would quickly burn off any fat that accumulated on her body. Chaser on the other hoof was the living embodiment of the word \"couch potato\", as she grew older so did her love for food... and her waist line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   At the present, Cloud Chaser weighed just over three hundred and forty pounds, and at the current rate with which she was eating and lazing it wouldn't be long before she hit the four hundred pound mark. That didn't seem to bother her or her sister though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ahhh *BURP* that really hit the spot!\" the fatty pegasus said with a loud belch after polishing off the last donut and tossed the empty box in the waste bin. \"Those were the best doughnuts I've ever tasted, even though they all probably went to my flanks.\" she chuckled as she patted her huge belly inciting a laugh from Flitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I bet they were, though if you keep eating like this you're gonna fall through the floor,\" Flitter teased her heavyset sister, who merely blew a raspberry at her as she slowly eased her blubbery body off the sofa.  \u201cOh you\u2019ve been saying that for years sis and all that\u2019s happen is that I sink into the clouds a bit more.\u201d Chaser countered cheerfully as she waddled towards the kitchen, her huge belly and fat butt swaying and jiggling with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cBesides, I\u2019m far from the biggest pony around. Have you seen Wind Whistler, she\u2019s bigger than four Big Macintoshes and she walks on clouds like an angel.\u201d The plump mare snickered as she reached in to fridge for a jug of chocolate milk. \u201cIf a pegasus heavier than a dairy cow can fly and still work on the weather team than my fat ass is A Okay.\u201d She punctuated that last statement with a hearty wiggle of her big wobbling rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n   \u201cWell have you known a mare that can carry twins without gaining weight,\u201d Flitter commented as she took a seat at the table as Chaser poured them each a tall glass of the sweet brown dairy liquid. \u201cAnyways enough about growing waist lines, what are we gonna do today on our day off?\u201d she added with a hint of boredom in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n     Taking a big gulp of her glass of milk, Chaser mulled over what they should do. \u201cWell, Thunderlane and his brother are both visiting their parents in Colt Worth so we can\u2019t go see them, and I know you don\u2019t want to hear Ditzy Doo go on and on about all the different flavors of muffins.\u201d She said with a soft laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n     \u201cPffffttttHahah yeah that pony is truly obsessed with them,\u201d Flitter added chuckling. \u201cThough she does take good care of Sparkler and Dinky\u2026\u201d Suddenly an idea came to her and she smiled brightly. \u201cSay that\u2019s it sis!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n      \u201cOoohhh whatcha got in mind Flitter?\u201d Chaser asked eagerly downing the last of her milk.

Berry Punch had been living it up for the past hour at Pony Joe's Donut Parlor with Rainbow Dash and Applejack, celebrating her victory at the Sisterhooves Social with her younger sister, Pi\u00f1a Colada. Pi\u00f1a had been put to bed much earlier, and so the three older ponies had gone to Pony Joe's to take advantage of the complementary free drinks for winning the Social.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Awesome!\" Rainbow Dash said with a chuckle, not quite as intoxicated as Berry. \"How 'bout another round for the champ, Pony Joe?\" the unicorn called over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And another batch of donuts! Extra sprinkles!\" Berry added, swaying a little in her seat. She had always had a tendency to eat a lot when she got drunk, but tonight was different. She was feeling pumped from winning the Social, and even though she had already packed away a dozen donuts of various flavors, she was feeling ready to gulp down a dozen more! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you may have had enough,\" the wary Pony Joe called back. \"I don't want you making a mess of the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, come on, Joe,\" Applejack replied. \"She's the big champion of the Sisterhooves Social this year! Let her live a little. 'Sides, ya DID say she could have as much as she wanted fer free tonight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegretting his decision, Pony Joe nodded and levitated another baker's dozen of donuts to the three ponies in addition to refilling their glasses. Rainbow Dash smiled as she took a whiff of the sweet, delicious scent of the freshly-baked donuts. \"Berry,\" she proclaimed somewhat enviously, \"You are so lucky. I wish I could get free donuts and drinks. Heck, I bet I could win the Sisterhooves Social on my own! I'm just that awesome, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Applejack answered as she took a donut and bit into it, \"But too bad fer you, ya have ta have a sister to enter with ya. And it ain't about the winnin' anyway, Rainbow. It's about spendin' quality time with yer little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerry Punch giggled drunkenly, taking a big bite out of her second donut of the batch. \"Yeah -HIC- but I gotta say, the donuts and booze are a huge bonus!\" She topped off the donut with a gulp of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash barely seemed to hear Berry's comment, instead getting into one of their usual friendly arguments. Berry's focus remained on the food and the glorious, glorious beer. Grabbing a bunch of four donuts, she stuffed them into her wide-open mouth one by one, barely stopping to chew in her drunken greed and simply swallowing them mostly whole. She could feel each one filling her belly as she swallowed them, and was very much enjoying the sensation. So much so, in fact, that she decided to see how much better it would feel eating all the rest at once. Taking up the box, she tilted it up and let the remaining eight donuts slide into her waiting mouth, swallowing them all at once with a large bulge in her throat. \"<i>BUUUURRAAAAAAAPPP!</i>\" she belched heavily, bursting into laughter again afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two ponies at the table paused their chatting and turned to look at Berry, quite surprised. \"Woah, Berry, way to go!\" Rainbow exclaimed enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on there,\" Applejack interrupted cautiously. \"I dunno, maybe Pony Joe's right. Yer eatin' a lot, an' jus' between you an' me, Ah think yer gettin' a little heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, and Berry knew it; her eating habits were certainly having an effect on her figure. She had rounded out a fair amount in the past few months. Her flank was getting pretty big, and her belly was starting to bulge out -- especially now that she was stuffed full of donuts. But it couldn't be that bad, could it? After all, she'd still won the Sisterhooves Social, and she felt good. \"Ah, don't worry about it,\" Berry answered. \"I'm fine! I think I could eat two, no, THREE dozen more donuts before I got full!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPony Joe, overhearing this, groaned woefully.</span></div></div>",

Shining Armor brought a hoof to his belly, which had grown enormous and quite soft since the Empire resurfaced, and gave it a slight jiggle. While most other ponies would've dreaded gaining even a little weight, Shining Armor was most certainly not \"most other ponies\". To him, getting fat gave him something he didn't really have with his old job: true freedom. Sure, he loved his old job as captain of Celestia's royal guard,  but all that stifling work and exercise kept him from truly enjoying the finer things in life. He had been concerned about the weight at first, but he soon discovered he had a fat fetish that ran 10,000 miles wide, and 5 times as deep. A fat fetish that Cadence very happily and more than whole-heartedly both shared and.......\"indulged\" in whenever they wanted. Now, just over a year later, Shining Armor was now the dictionary definition of a complete and utter butterball. His belly now came close to rubbing against the floor, jiggling with even the slightest movement, his once toned rump now wobbled heavily like the soft pudding imaginable. Shining Armor was now well and truly obese. And he liked it. Loved it, in fact. While he had always been a modest stallion, even he wasn't above sins such as vanity or gluttony. Shining Armor had it all. A kind heart, good looks, money, and his every meal was a feast. Feasts that steadily grew larger and larger, much like the stallion who was lucky enough to be doing the feasting. Shining Armor shifted his bulk so his back was facing the mirror and began admiring what he and Cadence believed to be his best feature: his vast, growing ass. Admittedly, most of his weight went straight to his widening rump. He and Cadence decided that if he was going to be fat, he would be FAT.</span></div></div>",

His thick thighs slapped together with each slow step, and he was glad he knew anti-friction spells to avoid the worst of the rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it was a miracle he was mobile at all, weighing nearly a tonne at this point.

Anyway, on with the show!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStoryline 1: Fatty Batty - Although Twilight and the other Mane Six stopped Flutter-Bat, it didn't mean they fully cured their friend from being a bat-pony hybrid permanently. Now stuck as a mixed union between bat and pony, Fluttershy will now have to adapt to her new stature as a Bat-Pony. However, when Apple Season comes around once more, Fluttershy's bat-like cravings start to surface once again, and there's a large chance that she'll be packing on the pounds during her feasting. But will she still be the same old yellow pegasus she used to be, or will her feral hunger possess her to the point of no return?</span></div></div>",

His majesty Sombra, standing on a balcony, red robe snapping in the wind, armor and crown gleaming in the gloomy light of day, watched his kingdom from afar with a triumphant smile on his cruel face. He had finally done it: he had captured the Crystal Heart and restored himself to his former self, but there was still some loses he had to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ones that tried to send him back from whence he came, to imprison him in some sort of dark hole, had escaped to the lands beyond before the dark pony could unleash his power. Sombra turned his gaze towards the sky, which was cloudy with pitch dark clouds. This was the power the king casted, a shield that covered the kingdom; nothing could get in, nothing could get out, except his majesty himself, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sombra would never dare leave the safety of his empire, for he knew that this area was placed under heavy surveillance following the events that happened. An attack Equestria would also be fruitless because he had no dark armies to fight it with. For now he had to stay in his protective bubble, rebuilding his evil armies, waiting for the right chance to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that also had negative side-effects. Boredom quickly settled in, and watching slaves work, smacking away bits of rock from boulders, their pickaxes audible from up there, brought only so much entertainment. A yawn nagged on the king's mouth and he opened his mouth wide, exposing unpony-like sharp teeth, yawning loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding around was making him so awfully tired. A growl came from his belly. And hungry. Sombra headed back inside, to a richly, but darkly, decorated room. From the gloom emerged a dark pony-like figure, completely black in color with piercing white eyes and metallic wings. This was one of the king's creations, a dark entity that loyally served him no matter what. He didn't trust other normal ponies, even if they were just harmless slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell them to ready my bath and prepare me a meal,\" he barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entity asked no questions, but only said in a cold voice: \"Yes, your graciousness.\" And it disappeared back into the gloom, most likely teleported to its destinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even five minutes later the food and bathtub was ready. Removing his crown, armor and kingly robes, he climbed into the hot, steaming bathtub (which would have deserved the title \"pool\") with a sigh. It was rather strange but somehow they managed to get a large dinner table, stacked high with cakes, sweets and other fatty foods like fries. It was a lot, even for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he did not trust his slaves, he still used some, but only under strict surveillance from his spawn of black entities, which was now in the room, standing five feet from each other, forever silent and watchful, always ready to serve their master, which was being fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to be the king,\" said he, while being pampered, knowing little that the food he was consuming was causing his abdominal to bulge slightly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you do not know what this is then where have you been? It's practically everywhere on the internet. Anyway, here are the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. I do not care how fast any pony gains or how they gain just explain in a detailed fashion and make it good to read. It can be realistic or so fast they cover the earth in seconds, whatever you want, just try and put some effort into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. I enjoy futanari, burping, and crazy shenanigans so expect wild stuff...probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No Original characters, sorry but this show alone has more than enough background characters to flesh out for your ideas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. I do not enjoy scat of any kind, shrinking, guro (gore and death) or other types of expansion, so no fruit expansion or inflation at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5: If you are able to give a good enough reason, we can negotiate other fetishes... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow please sit back relax and enjoy the show bronies!</td>",
