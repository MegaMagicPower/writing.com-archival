He entered to see the kind young woman working behind the counter, who smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well! I haven\u2019t seen you here in quite some time, Midoriya!\u201d she chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve been a little busy with school\u2026\u201d Deku replied, timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell! What can I get you? Here for some All-Might merch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku looked up at the shelf behind her, seeing the latest figure that had caught his attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Can I get that one there?\u201d he asked. As he pointed to the figure, the tip of his finger emitted a slight green glow.  As he did, he noticed the cashier\u2019s eyes briefly flash green, before seeming to glaze over. Her mouth went slack as she just stood there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-uh\u2026 sorry about that little flash. I didn\u2019t mean to do that... \u201c he replied. She did not seem to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026 so can you grab the figure for me?\u201d he inquired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...As you wish, Master\u2026\u201d she replied in a monotone as she turned to grab the box from the shelf, and placed it before Deku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid\u2026 you just call me Master?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did, Master\u2026\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku\u2019s eyes widened as he placed the payment on the counter. She didn\u2019t go for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnap out of it!\u201d he said in a blend of worry and frustration. Her eyes seemed to light and she looked around in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026 guess I kinda spaced out there. Well, thanks for your business!\u201d she replied, seeming completely unaware of her previous condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith worry, Deku bolted to All Might\u2019s office at the school where he found the soon to be retired hero sitting in his more frail form looking over a lesson plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh. Young Midoriya\u201d he said, greeting Deku <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll-Might. We have a problem!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh? What kind of problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I uh\u2026 I discovered a new power I guess.\u201d he muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? That manifested already huh?  Listen kid. There\u2019s something I never mentioned.  You know how my power has been passed between a bunch of different people right? Like how I passed it to you? Well, each time that happens a new power is formed based on that person\u2019s\u2026 hrm\u2026 aptitudes. For you, it would probably be something more nerdy.  I mean er\u2026 brainey.\u201d he shrugged \u201cSo what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know yet\u201d Deku lied \u201cIt happened but I don\u2019t know how I did it or what the effect was. My hand just kinda glowed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026 well, may not hurt to try it out.  Just know it\u2019s pretty normal for people with One for All\u201d he added, before looking back at his work<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 I have some kind of mind control power like Shinso..?\u201d he pondered  \u201cMaybe I should test it\u2026 on\u2026 one of the girls\u201d he thought to himself, his temptation taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who would he test this power on?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a moment Ochako answered, wearing her black tank top and gym pants<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh! Hey Deku!\" she giggled cutely \"Where'd you go today? Nobody could find you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I went shopping then stopped to talk to All-Might.\" he added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. I see. Hanging out with teachers and not me huh?\" she teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh.. actually something weird happened with my powers and I wanted to talk to All-Might since well... since my powers are similar to his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of worry crossed Ochako's face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong with your powers?\" she inquired with genuine concern<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh. No no it's just... something weird happened. It was like I unlocked a new power and I don't know what it does yet. It didn't seem harmful but... I can't figure out what it does\" he pretended to mope.  The two stood in silence for a moment before Ochako stood aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come in Deku? You can use it and I'll see if I can tell what it does! Maybe it's something like mine!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku entered and Ochako closed the door behind them before sitting down on her bed and smiling at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Show me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku held up his hand and the glow emanated from his fingertip. As it did Ochako's eyes flashed greed briefly before returning to their normal color and emptily stared ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ochako..?

I guess it was all a dream.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said to himself before laying down again. He then thought \u2018What if I do have a power that hypnotizes people. I\u2019ll probably ask Uraraka tomorrow to come into my room and maybe hope nothing that power wasn\u2019t a dream.\u2019 He then went to sleep. It was Saturday today and all of Class 1-A had nothing to do. Ochako was in the common area talking to all the girls when the local cinnamon roll arrived to ask her something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey Deku-Kun. What\u2019s up?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Uraraka-San. I was wondering if you would stop by room sometime if you want.\u201d He asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO~!

While walking there, Deku looked at Ochako and became in lost as he looked at her. He then thought to himself \u2018She\u2019s so beautiful. Her gorgeous chocolate colored eyes, her beautiful brown hair, her adorable rosy cheeks. She\u2019s the perfect girl I could die for.\u2019 The two then arrive and enter his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what is it you wanted to show me again Deku-Kun?\u201d She had asked him.

I actually need help ummm...\u201d Deku taps his fingers together nervously as he tries to think of a task for her to do for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Actually their is one thing, you see my back and shoulders take a lot of strain when I use my quirk. It causes my body to become all sore and stuff. So I was wondering if you can help me feel better.\u201d Deku asks much to Momo\u2019s surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well I\u2019m not an expert on the subject but I\u2019d recommend you speak to a doctor, Chiropractor, or a Masseuse. Perhaps I may know a book about proper posture in combat for heroes.\u201d She asks earnestly, very confused why Midoriya would bring this up to her specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no no no, that\u2019s alright. I was thinking that you\u2019d be able to help me personally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry to say but even with my quirk I wouldn\u2019t know how to help you with this...Specific issue.\u201d Momo feels slightly awkward talking about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what I guess what should have said is-\u201c Demi pauses and gulps as he thinks about what he\u2019s about to ask. \u201c<b>I could use some help</b> with a back massage.\u201d He yelps out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo looks like she was about to say something before her eyes glaze slightly. she blinks a few times and shakes her head subtly before focusing back onto Deku. A confident smile appearing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh why didn\u2019t you say so in the first place. Of course I\u2019d help you with a massage Deku! I have limited experience but I\u2019m positive I can at least help you out now!\u201d She claps her hands together now eager to help her friend despite the strange request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Oh thank you Yamomo. You don\u2019t know how much this means to me.\u201d Deku smiles as his suggestion seems to have worked flawlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, no worries. I\u2019m going to try and prepare best I can but while I do take off your shirt and lie face down on your back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes of cour-Wait What?! Is all that necessary?\u201d Deny asks shocked that momo would suggest putting him in such a compromising position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply nods back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh but of course, I may not be an expert or have the proper facilities but I know at least the proper position to put someone in when giving a massage. Now quickly get ready.\u201d She urges him to comply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his shock Deku doesn\u2019t argue but is a bit uneasy feeling having Momo see him shirtless. Regardless he lays face down on her very soft bed. He waited anxiously for Momo as she preps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Momo I think I\u2019m ready. Uh.. what happens now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I get to work, and hope I remember enough to help out.\u201d She says this as she sits atop of Deku\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What are you doing?!\u201d Deku shouted, his face beat red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh relax, this is proper Masseuse practices. If you want me to help out with your back you need to calm down and let me work my magic.\u201d She replied as the power of the suggestion made her more focused on doing the task  than considering how inappropriate this may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right I\u2019ll try.\u201d Knowing that he\u2019s the one who asked for this, Deku does his best to relax and let Momo do her thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect now then let us begin.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo grabs both of Deku\u2019s shoulders and proceeds to massage them. Squeezing his shoulders, pressing down on his upper back, rubbing her soft warm hands along him. Even if it wasn\u2019t proper feeling Momo stop him was an amazing sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing.\u201d He said with a large blissful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, now I\u2019m going to try to do some deep tissue work. Hopefully this isn\u2019t too rough, I\u2019d like to remind you I\u2019m not educated in the matter so if I cause discomfort, inform me;\u201d momo explains before she leans in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she does realize or is oblivious to is that as she leans forward and down atop of Deku her large soft breast begin to press down on his back. As she moves around Demi can feel both of them press and rub against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you feeling better Deku?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes very much so!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo smiles as she was able to help Deku despite her lack of experience. Eventually finishing up and getting off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect well hopefully that\u2019ll make you feel at least a little better, like I said you should probably consult an expert on the issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right, I\u2019ll try to remember.\u201d Deku replies putting his shirt back on still thinking about the massage and smiling. Clearly the trigger worked like a charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if you wouldn\u2019t mind try not to bring this up to others ok? I\u2019m not really an expert like I said and it\u2019s kind of well embarrassing in retrospect.,,\u201d she said blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Anyways anything else I can do for you Deku before you leave? Do you still need help studying?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You mind looking at it?\" He lies quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei turns around goggles over her eyes, the jade light on Izuku's finger seems to move like a tendril around Mei's goggles. The gold of the goggles lenses turn a bright jade green as Mei goes still. Izuku grins as he walks up to Mei, \"Who am I Hatsume?\" A monotone voice answers back, \"I forgot Master\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku eyes twitch as he hears this, \"Is she an idiot!

He went out wearing beat up jeans, an All Might hoodie, and black socks. He searched almost every alley and asked anyone if they saw someone wearing a school uniform with blonde hair and fangs to no avail. Unbeknownst to the broccoli boy though, that same girl was secretly watching him from the rooftops with a black cloak around her. Izuku had decided to give up for today, until he got message from an unknown number. When he went to view it there was a video attached. He clicked on the video and what he saw surprised him. It was Toga. She was more happier than usual when recording this, but he noticed someone else was also in the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya Deku! I was watching you today looking for me! I\u2019m sorry if I didn\u2019t go to you first, but I did find someone who you would like to meet!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to over to the person and a light was shown on them. The light showed a very poorly made stuffed doll of All Might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your old friend All Might! He said he was about to turn me, but I was able to knock him out and drag him here! You better hurry or I might have to kill him. The location is at an abandoned warehouse in Mustafau, but you better get here in time! Tick, tock, tick, tock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku knee she only made the doll to have him come over in rage, but he decided to go anyways because he was able to find her. He was able to find the warehouse in a matter of minutes. \u2018Not only is she bad at making people, she\u2019s also pretty bad at being subtle.\u201d He thought to himself. He then opened the door in \u201crage\u201d as he went over to the fake All Might. He knew he was very bad at acting but he still tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, All Might! I hope I\u2019m not too late! I was so worried about you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was talking to the doll, Toga was about to sneak behind him and stab him until he turned around, put his hand in front of her as his eyes flashed green. After that, he saw Toga standing there emotionless. \u2018I hope it worked.\u2019 He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToga, can you hear me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes master, I hear and I obey...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her under his control, Izuku decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He saw Midnight in front of him, a big smile all over her face. \u201cDid you enjoy yourself master\u201d Midnight said that last part with a hint of confusion in her voice, like she didn\u2019t know why she called him that. This earned a small chuckle from Izuku who simply nodded, still feeling quite relaxed. He thought for a second before raising his arm once again. Before he even used his power Midnight already seems to be falling, as if her body knew what was about to happen. Then he used it again, his finger glowing a green that reflected in the beautiful R-rated heroes eyes. Without hesitation he began his commands.\u201dWhenever i say \u2018Funtime\u2019 you will do what just did again, but you won\u2019t do anything to me in trance. If when brought up come this I asked for you to do it again, you shall do it even better, making me feel better, understood?\u201d. A small nod was given by the tranced and smiling heroine. \u201cNext, when I wake you up, I will ask you to go get someone for me, you will do this without hesitation. You will tell them that their abilities are required in my room and that you will escort them to my room.\u201d Then Deku Brought her back up. \u201cHey Midnight could you do something for your amazing boyfriend?\u201d \u201cAnything for my master\u201d was her reply, no confusion in her voice this time, it seemed she had just accepted that he was her master. \u201cCould you go get...</span></div></div>",

It took a second for Momo\u2019s  brain to process what the hero had just said. That was all the time Deku needed to raise his hand. His finger glowed once again, the light reflecting in both girls eyes. Deku wondered if he could target someone or if it entranced any who saw it? He\u2019d figure that out later. \u201cMomo, when you are brought back up, you won\u2019t seem to be able to take your eyes of Midnights ass. And Midnight you will instantly start using the move you just used on me, understood?\u201d A nod came from both their smiling faces. \u201cAnd..\u201d Snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 girls seem to shake their heads for a moment. Momo looked she was about to question Midnights use of the word master before the R-rated hero began her entrancing move. She was trapped before the words could even leave her mouth. Deku smirked, \u2018it would make sense her made is weaker at the moment as I just brought her back\u2019. He pulled himself out of his thoughts to enjoy the show, midnight swaying and Momo leaning closer and closer. Her Mouth open and drool coming out. When he could clearly see she was fully taken down, he told Midnight to stop. \u201cNow midnight why don\u2019t I have some of that \u2018Funtime\u2019, and why don\u2019t you join in Momo, just follow Midnights lead!\u201d <br>\r\nAnd so it began, Mindight swaying so elegantly, with Momo not being a professional, but still putting on a show. Deku allowed himself to once again be drawn by their beautiful swaying bodies, enjoying the moment of bliss, their asses filling his vision. And his mind. All he wanted to do was touch them. \u201cYou can touch them master\u201d they both said in unison. He must have mumbled that outloud, somethings never change. Deku was so engrossed he only noticed how close they where when he felt his face lean into Midnights  ass, his tired head resting their as she swayed it back and forth, her ass still swaying in his minds eye as he once again drifted into trance, only to awaken to the sight of ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deku woke up, for the second time that day, from trance. Although the scene above him was very different to the one he was met with before. The two infatuated girls stood over him, breasts out, swaying gently before his eyes. He started following them as they went back and forth...back and forth. Suddenly Deku smirked, raising his hand for another time, so happy that he got this power, and made his finger glow. Midnight was already under before he\u2019d used his power, but Momo seemed to fight for a second before also falling into the glow and warmth of his power. Deku got up shakily, body still not completely with him, before he began to address the girls. \u201cWhat did I say about putting me under without permission Midnight?\u201d He said calmly. \u201cOnly do it when asked...\u201d came her quiet reply. \u201cThat means you\u2019ve been bad for your master, right?\u201d \u201cYes...\u201d was her reply, even quieter than before. \u201cAs punishment, I will make Momo use your own move against you, and let her do whatever she wants to. Sound fair?\u201d Izuku said with authority. \u201cYes master...\u201d was her more relaxed and dreamy reply, seeming okay with this punishment. \u201cMomo, when you are brought back up, you will use your ass and tits to entrance midnight. If you succeed you will be able to do whatever you want with her, within the law of course. Understood?\u201d \u201cYes master\u201d cam Momo\u2019s very happy reply. \u201cOkay then. And...\u201d *snap*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Momo began her display. She swung with ferocity, but also elegance. She was a quick learner, already almost ass good as Midnight with twerking. Using her breasts however, she was much superior. She could make anyone began infatuated with they way her tits shook and swung. Deku found himself with his mouth hanging open as he found himself being drawn in. He quickly pulled himself back, mentally scolding himself. \u2018Now is not the time... later however... I must remember to give Momo a trigger for her to do that to me.\u2019 And almost as soon as it began, Midnight was under. Momo didn\u2019t stop though, only moving closer, soon shoving her tits in the entrances woman\u2019s face, much to Deku\u2019s amusement. Suddenly Momo leans down and whispers something in the trances out heroes ear. Whatever it was, Midnight nodded lightly. Deku looked forward to finding out what Momo had asked her to do. He didn\u2019t have to wait long as Midnight can over and sat on him, seemingly purring. Maybe Momo has asked her to act like a cat. Deep in thought he didn\u2019t notice Momo approaching until her tits were swaying right in front of his eyes. It was quite a rude awakening and caught him very much off guard. He almost got caught to, but managed to bring his hand up and use his power. With a quick thought he said \u201cWhen I wake you up you may continue, but when I go into trance, you will wake me up immediately, ok?\u201d They both nodded, seemingly easily taken down, \u201cAnd... Up!\u201d Deku said as they all shot up again. Momo looked confused until she saw Izuku looking at her breasts. Finally she could get the chance to please her master in her own special way, with her own special move. A lot of the girls had similar moves for If their quirks wouldn\u2019t work and the attacker had the right sexuality. It was part of their toolkit so why not try and use it. She began again, slowly taking her master down as he drooled and started, the sight making her giggle slightly. Midnight sat on him, absentmindedly stroking their masters growing member. Momo has asked her to go distract their master, hoping to make the experience better for him. However when Master looked fully under, she felt she had to bring him back up, so she did. He shook his head slightly before his eyes were met with Momo\u2019s breasts. He fought to lift his eyes and met hers, a slightly confused look on her face. Midnight was still under Momo\u2019s control and didn\u2019t seem to notice anything going on around her. Suddenly Deku stood up and unzipped his pants, then his underwear, revealing his large member. Instantly both girls looked at it, seemingly unable to look away. Deku smirked, knowing his dick was now like their breasts, ensnaring and pulling in their minds until their only thought was to touch his manhood. When he deemed them suitably infatuated, he spoke up. \u201cWhoever can bring men and the other person down, can stroke my dick, otherwise I\u2019ll have to put it away again and no one will have any fun. This time however, I will be trying to keep myself up, so make sure to try your best. Oh also Midnight your completely free from Momo\u2019s control.\u201d Almost as soon as he was finished both girls surrounded him, Midnight juggling her ass better than ever before and Momo shaking her tits in a very weird pattern. I also noticed Momo trying more and more to get into both of our views, trying to go for both at the same time, while midnight focused on me, deeming me the hardest to take down. Unfortunately I was soon lost in the swirling flesh. Tits bouncing right next to my face and ass twerking in a most eye catching way. I soon find my brain turning off as I was taken down. Later I woke up to find...</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t really notice anything until He felt pleasure coming from my cock and a sultry voice drift into my ears. \u201cI won master. That means I get to please you.\u201d Said Momo. Midnight was staring blankly ahead just of to the left, obviously taken down by Momo. His thought process was interpreted by a new sensation on his dick. Momo has began sucking it as well as grasping the base. The pleasure was all encompassing, making the urge to release so great. But He couldn\u2019t, not yet. He was saving it for more fun later. So I, with much effort, lifted my hand. Momo\u2019s eyes seemed to recognise what deku was doing and began to dim as the light glowing from his finger gave them a new shine. She instantly stopped pleasuring me and looked at me dreamily. \u201cGet down on all fours\u201d He said in what Deku hoped was a commanding voice. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you up the ass, okay?\u201d All He heard was an affirmative grunt and a slight nod, so I began. At first Deku slowly pushed in, but once He deemed it safe, He began to go faster, sliding in and out of her jiggling ass. Between thrusts He manage to sputter out \u201cMidnight give both Momo and I some \u2018Funtime\u2019\u201d, making Midnight began to shake in front of Momo and deku  Soon Deku got lost in the motion as He watched Midnight go at it better than ever. Deku guessed she had got a lot of practice recently. Deku was just thrusting, almost mindlessly as He stared at the Heroine. Momo seemed as transfixed as Deku was, so I didn\u2019t worry to much. I did stop myself from falling again though, as I had to focus on what I was going to do. After a little bit it became too much and Deku had to release, causing Momo and Midnight to do the same. Good to know he could control their pleasure. Deku decided he\u2019d try something new. He\u2019d...</span></div></div>",

He was about to use his powers, but decided to have some fun with the hypnosis. \u201cMomo, would you mind making me a watch, a pocket watch.\u201d Deku asked. \u201cOf course master\u201d she replied, pulling a gleaming, silver watch out from her exposed body. She handed the chain to Deku. He swung it slightly, testing  how The 2 would react. They both started following the watch, prompting Izuku to continue. \u201cThat\u2019s right, keep watching it swing, eyes growing heavier, until\u201d *snap*. When He looked at the watch, He noticed it seemed to be glowing green. \u2018I guess i can imbue objects with some of my power\u2019 he thought. The 2 Seemed  even deeper than ever before, there eyes completely foggy and mouths slack jawed. Deku realised using his new quirk on an object made the trance deeper, but was harder to do. He wondered if he\u2019d even be able to do it on someone he hadn\u2019t already hypnotised.. first though, Deku made them do something he\u2019d had fantasies about. He made them start making out. The girls started going hard in front of him, barely stopping for breath. For a minute or too, he just enjoyed it, but he soon decided to move onto the next part, testing the new part of his power<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop\u201dDeku  said, making the girls instantly part, awaiting further orders. \u201cIn a moment you will go get Ochacko, while doing this, you will both act like your normal selves, but when you get back to this room, you will be like this again and tie Ochacko up in a chair that will be out, understood?\u201d He barely saw a nod from both women as they headed to the door, postures returning to normal as they left the room. \u2018This is going to be so much fun\u2019 Deku thought... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had put the chair in the middle of his dorm, he waited for the girls to return. Soon he heard talking outside his door. It sounded like the 2 were trying to convince Ochacko to come in. Finally she must have relented as my door creaked open, both girls returning to their original look, although Ochacko didn\u2019t seem to notice. She was to busy blushing at being in Deku\u2019s room. \u2018She must have a crush on me, which is good because I have one on her\u2019. Without warning the two grabbed Ochacko, much to her surprise. She didn\u2019t even struggle as they pulled her to the chair, brain still shocked by what was happening. She did struggle when they started tying her up, but by then it was to late. I casually walk over to her, watch held tightly in my grasp. \u201cDeku, what\u2019s going on?\u201d The worry was evident in her voice. It hurt to hear, so I decided to make her feel more relaxed. I pulled out the watch from behind me. \u201cDeku, are you trying to.. to..\u201d she didn\u2019t finish her question as she lost herself to the glowing watch. She was the easiest target. Maybe her crush on Deku was part of it, but that didn\u2019t feel like it all to Deku. He decided to ask her. \u201cHey Ochacko, why do you think you were so easy to take down.\u201d \u201cDone hypnosis before, it is my fetish.\u201d She said in a monotone voice. At first Deku was shocked but then his smile grew as he realised how good this was. Ochacko would be able to enjoy the mere action of hypnosis. He could please his crush so well. When he looked down he noticed how wet she was. \u2018I guess getting hypnotised by your crush can do that to you\u2019 Deku thought. After that Deku decided to...</span></div></div>",

The home of his friend and rival Katsuki Bakugo. And with that he remembered a childhood crush of his. Katsuki's incredibly sexy mother Mitsuki. As well, Deku recalled Bakugo mentioning that his father was going out of town on business for a week or so... this was his chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku approached the door to the Bakugo home and gently knocked.  After a moment, it opened, revealing the blonde haired, big busted milf; Mitsuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Izuku! It's been a while since I saw you last!\" she said with a smile as the young Hero stood before her. \"I heard you're in Katsuki's class! He talks about you from time to time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh uh... he does?\" Deku questioned. He doubted any conversation about himself coming from Ka-chan could be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm! Anyway, what are you doing here?\" Mitsuki inquired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Ka-chan asked me to grab something for him from home since I was in the area\" he said with a weak smile, hoping she didn't see through his lie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I know he gives you a hard time, but I always knew he relied on you\" Mitsuki joked as she stepped aside \"Come on in. I'll make you some tea\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku entered the house and made his way to Bakugo's old room while Mitsuki made for the kitchen. He rooted around for a moment before just grabbing some random nick knacks and tossing them into his bag in case Mitsuki asked, and headed out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out, he saw Mitsuki sitting on the couch, smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well! Take a seat! The tea's started so it shouldn't be too long. And I haven't talked to you in years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku sat down across from her, placing his bag beside him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soo. My little Katsuki was telling me about your quirk! Late bloomer huh?\" Mitsuki joked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah kinda. Did you see me use it in the tournament?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did! It looks like it has a lot of uses. Not like my Katsuki. Just a bunch of explosions.\" she grumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It actually does have a lot of cool uses! It's a really versatile power. It even has uses outside of fighting!\" he said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Show me. It'll be nice to at least be proud of one of the local boys for having a power that isn't just destructive\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku held up his finger. Mitsuki's eyes fixed on it with a smile. Then the green light radiated from his fingertip. Her eyes quickly flashed green in response before glazing over. Her lips fell from her smile to a neutral position as she stared ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd done it! Mitsuki was under his control! The question was... what to do with her?</span></div></div>",
