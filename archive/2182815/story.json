            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the sounds of a city coming to life and the bright sunlight piercing his bedroom window that woke Evan up. The lion stretch out while lying on the mattress of his absurdly large bed. So wide was it, in fact, that he could easily stretch out his arms and reach neither side. It was far bigger than he needed. Yet he didn't buy it. It was one of the features of apartments in places like Port Zaftig, Evan came to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just part of the culture here at Port Zaftig,\" said Simone when she was on the phone with Evan some weeks ago. She was one of the building managers and wanted to go over a few things about the rental agreement with Evan before he made the big move. \"You know how when most furs move, they'll just leave the plunger for the next residents? The same kinda goes here. The last tenet didn't want to have to pack up a bunch of his furniture, so he just left it for the next fur to have. Lucky you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky Evan, indeed. He had limited space in his car and there was no way he would be able to bring anything like a bed or couch or television or dresser with him. But he hit the jackpot, apparently. Not only did the last tenet practically left the apartment fully furnished, but the bed and the couch were absolutely massive. Hell, Evan figured that the couch alone was bigger than his old bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion scratched the cream-color fur of his flat abdomen as he yawned. He had woken up from a long nap and now it was late in the morning. However, Evan had only been in Port Zaftig for a few hours. Dawn was breaking as his drove over the final hill on his route. Rays of golden light shined off many of the city's tall skyscrapers. Rather than spending one more night at a dingy motel, Evan decided instead to drive through the night on the last leg of his journey. It had taken him nearly four days to get from his small hometown of Bastion to the city of Port Zaftig and the lion was so eager to get there that he was willing to stay up the entire night if it meant one less day on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to find his new apartment building located at the edge of town. Being so early in the morning, there was a parking spot for him in front of the building. He grabbed a couple of duffel bags full of clothes and approached the door. Out of a manila envelop, he pulled out a key card, a mail box key, and the key to his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typically, I'm there to see new tenets to their place,\" Simone explained over the phone. \"But none of the building managers will be there that day, so I'm sending everything you need so you can see yourself in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small black box was mounted on the wall next to the absurdly wide front doors. He swiped the key card in front of the box, and the light on it turned from red to green. A metallic clunking noise let Evan know the door was unlocked. He opened it up and walked through the warm and bright lobby. Nobody was around. The door to the elevator were equally as comically wide as the front door. When it arrived, Evan stepped inside and noticed the sheer size of the lift. It reminded him of a cargo elevator  at one of his past jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maximum weight: 12,000 pounds\" a shiny placard on the button panel read. Evan chuckled as he pressed the 7 button. His apartment was number 703.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway on the seventh floor was equally as wide as the doors. The lion could have easily driven a car down these hallways. He noticed that there weren't many other rooms on the floor. Maybe, he guessed, there were seven other apartments on the floor. This was far fewer than he expected, but when he opened the door to apartment 703, he saw why. Despite the cheap rent, the apartment was incredibly massive with a huge living room, a spacious kitchen, a vast bedroom, and a bathroom equipped with the largest shower stall the lion every saw in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a dozen trips to his car later and it was entirely unloaded. Various boxes and bags laid about the living room. Evan was in no rush to unpack everything, though. It was still very early in the morning and he was working on no sleep whatsoever. So he pulled off his clothes and jumped into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was a few hours later and Evan had just hopped out of the shower. He laughed when he first got in there. The stall was several times bigger than he was and wondered why any fur would need such a large shower to begin with. He padded his gold and cream colored fur dry and dug a fresh pair of jeans and shirt out of one of this duffel bags. Well, as fresh as they could be considering they've been in that bag for four days now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday marked Evan's first day in Port Zaftig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lion stared out the window, he pondered what he should do with the day. Port Zaftig was known for its clean beaches and bright oceans. Evan spent all of his life in a tiny town in a landlocked state. The lion had never even seen the ocean and considered spending a day at the coast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's stomach gurgling in protest. He placed a paw on it to sooth his empty belly. He realized that he hadn't eaten much in the last day. And while he packed some food with him, most of it was snacks to munch on while traveling. The lion realized that he should probably find a bite to eat nearby, or maybe take a trip to the grocery store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had saved up enough money to live in Port Zaftig for a few months without any financial problems. That being said, he'll eventually need to find work. The sooner, the better. So Evan thought it might be productive to hunt for a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, the past few days doing nothing but driving. The nap was refreshing, but still felt a bit exhausted. Perhaps the day would be better spent relaxing at home, maybe doing some unpacking, but in general taking it easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, he thought, he should be a good neighbor and introduce himself to the other furs on the floor, at least the ones on the left and right of his apartment. Hopefully, they haven't left for work yet or anything.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was not the white Sandy beaches or the deep blue ocean waves that Evan saw when he pulled into a parking lot next to the coast. What he first saw was an enormous snow leopard waddle. A quarter ton of lard wobbled and jiggled as the fur slowly plodded along, fat oozing out from underneath his tight swim trunks. Evan had to take a moment and gawk at the fur. Never before in his life had he see a fur so massively obese, so incredibly fat. The lion even saw, as the fur was waddling away, that his tail too was somehow fat as well looking like a long, plump sausage hanging lazily over the snow leopard's mammoth rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evan walked along the beach, however, he learned that the snow leopard fit right in. Many of the furs he witnessed were at some stage of obesity. Even furs that had hulking biceps and pecs still sported enormous guts. The lion, it appeared, was the odd one out as he made his was up the beach in his swimming shorts, a white towel hanging over a bare shoulder. Most of the northern parts of the beach we're sectioned off for tourists; resorts privatized those pars of the coasts for their customers. Only when Evan approached these parts of the coast did he begin to see furs his size again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for the initial shock of seeing so many furs so grossly overweight to wear off. But Evan's thoughts returned to the beach. This was the first time in his life he had ever been. Because his hometown was right in the center of the country, any trips to the coast would have taken several days just to travel there. So growing up, Evan's folks couldn't take him or his siblings to see the ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was then. Evan finally got to see the ocean!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion was overwhelmed with possibilities about what to do. Obviously, he wanted to take a dip in the ocean. The water was mostly empty sans a few heavy furs lazily paddling around. The lion could laid down his towel and do a bit of sunbathing. Evan always liked the slightly darker hue his gold and cream fur would take on with enough sunrays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking along the coast, Evan did spot a nice ice cream shop built right up to the sands. It was getting to get really warm, and a cone did sound good at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan didn't know anyone in town. Of course, it was his first day in the city. But it's never too soon to start making acquaintances. He might want to strike up a conversation with one of the locals.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now Evan was in a bit of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion had never been in the ocean before. He had never been able to swim around in such a large body of water. Growing up, the lion loved swimming. But the only place he could swim in back in Bastion was in one of his friend's small backyard swimming pools. But Evan now lived in a city where he was a short drive away from being able to swim to his heart's content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was exactly what he did for the past few hours. The coast was particularly empty. Many of the obese furs preferred parking their gigantic rears in the sand and letting the waves splash over them. Evan wasn't complaining. This gave him plenty of space to swim laps up and down the length of the coast without interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the lion didn't realize that as he was swimming the tide was going back out. Little by little, the lion was drifting away from the beach. It was only when the exhaustion hit him from hours of such physical activity that made him stop and take into account his surroundings. He was floating pretty far away from the coast. The large furs that littered the shore were only specks in the horizon. This greatly worried Evan. The lion was so exhausted that he didn't think he could swim all the way back to the coast or that anyone would hear him yell for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion began to panic. As he floated, he felt himself being pulled further into the ocean. If he didn't think of something and quick, he'd be lost at sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, not too far off in the distance, a spray of water shot into the air. Evan saw as a shiny, smooth dark grey head pop out of the water, take a deep breath, and dive down under the water again. A thick dark and light grey tail rose out from the water and slapped the waves on the way back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey!\" Evan yelled as he saw the head pop up again. The fur heard the lion and saw him floating in the ocean. \"I need help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aquatic fur stuck his head underwater again and gracefully swam his way over to Evan. A dorsal fin cut through the waves like a hot knife through butter. As the creature got closer, Evan could make out the sheer enormity of the fur through the clear waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shiny head popped up out of the water again. \"You need help with something?\" the dolphin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've been swimming for a few hours and didn't realize how far I drifted out and now I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a ride back to the shore?\" the dolphin cut in. \"No worries. It happens every once in a while. Here, grab on!\" He turned his back to Evan indicating for the lion to grab onto the dorsal fin. The moment Evan latched on, the dolphin took off for the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging on as tight as he could, Evan occasionally bumped against the dolphin's blubbery flank. The sensation reminded of when he was a cub visiting his aunt's house. She had an enormous water bed that Evan loved bouncing on and playing with. Colliding with the dolphin felt almost the exact same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took minutes before they were close enough to the shore that the lion could feel sand under his feet again. He let go of the fin and walked up to the beach, shaking off the water from his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dolphin steppes out of the water. The sun shined off of his rubbery grey skin. A bit taller than Evan, the dolphin had a few hundred pounds over the lion. His abdomen was encases by two enormous tires of blubber that reached nearly all the way around his back and formed sizable love handles. His pecs were two thick slabs of lard with black nipples the size of silver dollars. The skin on his belly and chest was much lighter shade of gray than the darker skin that covered the rest of him. His legs and rear were heavily muscled no doubt thanks to swimming, but nevertheless were covered in a considerable amount of fat as well. Even the dolphin's tail looked laden with lard. The fur was wearing small black swim trunks that looked like a sausage case on his obese frame with a hole in the black for his tail which was being stretched to its absolute limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, thank you! You're a lifesaver!\" the lion said to the dolphin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it's no big deal. I usually have to fish tourists like you out of the ocean once or twice a month.\" the dolphin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not a tourist,\" Evan replied. \"I live here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you don't exactly look the part,\" the dolphin said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind. My name is Keith, by the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shook. \"And I'm Evan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you! You like swimming? A few other furs and I meet one a week to take a nighttime dip in the sea. Absolutely nothing beats a sweltering hot day like a swim in some icy cold water.  Care to join? We're meeting up tomorrow night.\"</span></div></div>",

The combination of the heat and the few hours of sleep he had left him tired. The lion was just about to drift off to sleep when he noticed through his closed eyes that something was eclipsing the sun. Yet the moment Evan opened his eyes, a cloud of sand hit his face. Bellowing laughter was be heard as he brushed the sand from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lion could see again, he saw the culprit. Standing in front of him was an obese fox. Probably six feet tall and pushing past four hundred pounds, a red furry globe of a gut jutted out from the fox's midsection and hung far below the waistline of his swim suit, and two melon-like sacks of pudge rested on top of the mound. The fox's arms and legs were padded out with soft lard, and his face was accompanied by a thick second chin and puffed up cheeks which nearly closed up his eyes as he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, man?\" yelled Evan as he got up from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beach's for locals only!\" the fox yelled back as he stiffed his laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid idiot! I live here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox stopped laughing and eyed Evan up and down. The lion hopped this wouldn't end in a fight; that fox had the clear height and weight advantage. \"Bullshit. Go back to your fancy resort beaches. If I see your skinny ass around these parts again, I'll pound you into the sand!\" The fox turned around to walk away. Evan noticed the strain his heavy rump was making on the back of his trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurious, Evans stewed in his anger. What made that fox think he can bully people around, regardless of if they're a local or not? As he watched the fox waddle away, plans formed in his head for revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Evan just got to this city and it was pretty early to start making enemies. It sounded like the fox had legitimate grievances against the tourists who flock to Port Zaftig. Maybe if he talked to the fox, he'll find out what made him so upset in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps Evan ought to just let this whole thing go. Sure, the guy was a jerk. But there was no need to escalate the matter.</span></div></div>",

He had stopped to collect his belongings before heading over to one of the concrete building dotted along the coast where furs could shower off and change out of their swim suits. The lion watched from a safe distance as the fox entered one such structure. Inside, Evan peaked around a corner to see the fox showering his flabby body. The two cellulite-covered spheres that made up his butt were bare as his swim suit hung up on a hook nearby. The lion deftly snuck over and snagged the trunks off the hook. No other fur was inside nor did he think the red fox was aware of him, so Evan felt like he was going to get off scot free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until the quarter ton snow leopard he saw earlier was blocking the only way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, those don't look like they belong to you...\" the obese snow leopard said pointing to the tent-like trunks in Evan's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they are...I mean... it's just that...\" Evan stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow leopard placed a pudgy paw on Evan's shoulder and pulled him into his marshmallowy body. \"Let's go find out who those belong to, then!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat cat dragged Evan back into the showers. Evan struggled as he tried to pull himself away. But the snow leopard definitely had the weight advantage and all the lion could do was helplessly get pulled along as his slender body melded into the leopard's lardy frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lucas! Are these yours?\" The snow leopard yanked the trunks away from Evan who was still be held tightly against him. The red fox shut off the water and waddled over nude to the two furs, his belly hanging low enough to cover his privates. \"This tourist seemed to have found them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did he now...\" asked the red fox as he glared at Evan. \"Wait a minute, I remember you! You aren't going to believe this, Toby, but this skinny runt says that he's a local!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow leopard let out a laugh. \"This twig?\" He pulled Evan in closer as the lion's face burrowed deeper into the fat cat's moob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just moved here!\" Evan said shoving his face out of the snow leopard's flab who then released Evan, pushing him off towards a corner of the shower. He gasped and reeled as he picked himself up off the tiled floor. The red fox and snow leopard waddled towards him as the lion backed himself into a corner. Both furs, easily a half ton total, smirked as they slowly approached Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! A newbie!\" said the red fox as his belly pressed into Evan, pinning him against the shower walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow leopard soon joined in, his own gigantic gut joining in to force the slim lion against the walls. \"Huh, maybe we can show him a good time. Kitty looks pretty hungry.\" He pressed himself up against Evan harder who gasped and squirmed. \"What do you say, Kitty? Feeling hungry? Let us treat you to something, a welcoming gift...\"</span></div></div>",

The fat cat gripped the lion by the waist and pulled off his swim trunk, nearly ripping them clean off. Evan was about to scream until Lucas returned, who knelt his heavy body down in front of the pinned lion. He took his paws and heaved his gut forward on top of the lion, covering Evan's head, back and shoulders in red-furred fat. The lion's face was thrust into the fox's musky crotch, his face now being pressed into Lucas' soft thighs. Though he could not see, Evan felt the fox's member swell up, poking the lion in the face. Lacking much air, Evan began orally pleasing the fox, hoping that he'd be able to get Lucas off before he completely ran out of oxygen. Groans of pleasure came from the fox who started thrusting his hips back and forth, his member delving deeper into the lion's mouth. Evan suppressed the urge to gag as his muzzle bounced off of the fox's thick fat pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while that was happening, the snow leopard was yanking off his own swim trunks and positioning the lion's hips. He felt another enormous weight fall into his back. Now, the fat cat's belly covered the entirety of the lower half of his back. The lion felt something stiff prod around his slender rear until it reached its mark. Evan winced in pain as he was penetrated by the snow leopard, his wide hips settling into the lion's. Evan felt the jiggling of the leopard belly and the wobbling of fat thighs against his own thigh as the fat cat started rhythmically thrusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped under two colossal bellies, upper half swallowed up by the fox's thick thighs, lower half concealed by much of the leopard's flabby frame, were another fur to walk in they would have trouble spotting Evan as a part of the mass sans a paw here or there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan continued orally pleasuring the fox while the snow leopard worked his rear. The two bellies engulfing his back wobbled and jiggled. They felt like two huge masses of marshmallow as did the thighs of both furs. For what felt like hours, Evan was trapped in that jiggly, warm, soft mass. Eventually, the fox climaxed and the lion fought to keep the hot load from shooting its way down his throat. A deep groan and sudden sensation of something hot in his rear informed Evan that the snow leopard was now finished with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping and panting on the floor, Evan tried to collect himself. The two obese furs laughed to themselves as they covered their enormous butts back up. They eventually made their way over to the shower doors, unlocking it, and leaving the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's breathing and heart rate returned to normal a few minutes later. Hot white liquid was slowly making its way down the shower drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was incredible...\" Evan moaned, his own stiff member now dripping. The warmth, the softness, the feeling of being enveloped by hundreds of hundreds of pounds of lard, it was sexual experience none like Evan had before. And, judging by his erection, it was one he wanted again. </span></div></div>",

The two fat furs pressing their guts into him were caught off guard and lurched forward. Evan tried quickly slipping between the legs of one of the furs, the naked red fox, shimming along the floor to get free. But before he could get clear, he saw the mass of wobbling red fur come crashing down on him. The lion had the wind knocked out of him as nearly a quarter ton of pudge came crashing down on his chest. Evan struggled to breathe, his body from the shoulders up were surrounded by the fox's flabby thighs and belly. What little air he could take in was tainted by the smell of the obese fox's groin. He struggled to push the fox off of him. But the lion was only a fraction of his weight so the fox wouldn't budge. Evan heard the two furs laughing, their noise muffled by the layers of fat that were resting over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan felt like he was about to suffocate. Just when he thought he was about to pass out, the red fox was pulled off of the lion in a violent manner. Gasping, Evan saw as another fur, a bulky, muscular horse, throw the red fox across the shower. The fox's body jiggled as he landed hard on the ground. He turned to see the snow leopard running as best as his fat body could out of the showers, a panicked look was on his face. The red fox picked himself off the ground. Evan heard a loud slap then a yelp from the fox. The lion, still trying to catch his breath, saw as the fox waddled fast out of the showers, clutching his swim trunks in his paws as his bare rump jostled and shook with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" asked the horse as he picked Evan off of shower floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I think I'm alright.\" The lion took in the horse who had saved him. The fur was tall, easily close to seven feet, with light brown fur and a dark muzzle, a shaggy mane of blonde hair and a long black tail. The horse was wearing blue shorts that looked painted on to his thick, well-defined quads and glutes. His arms were equally as swollen. It was no wonder he was able to pull off the fat fox with the massive biceps he was sporting. The horse's chest was like two slabs of solid muscle. The only part of the fur that wasn't beefed up was his stomach which domed out into a firm ball gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were those guys attacking you?\" the horse asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. That fox started giving me crap about being a tourist or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, it's furs like that that give our city a bad name to visiting folks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's the thing though, I live here now! I literally just moved in today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse looked up and down Evan's body. \"Really, huh? Well, no offense, but you might want to bulk up a little bit. This city is filled with furs as big as those clowns, and plenty of furs will use their weight against you if they see they're several times bigger than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I mean, I guess I could stand to put on some muscle...\" The lion rubbed a paw along his flat chest. \"My hometown was pretty small, so they're weren't any gyms or anything. So I never got the chance to put on any weight or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Dorthy, you aren't in Kansas anymore!\" joked the horse. \"And you're in luck because there just happened to be someone you know who can help you out with that...\" He flexed his arm, making his already huge bicep swell up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a personal trainer! Have been for years\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, that's nice. But I don't think I can afford a personal trainer right now. I don't have a job and all of my savings are going to rent and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a shame. Well...actually...\" The horse looked at Evan's body, inspecting it all over. \"You know, I don't get too many clients like you. Skinny, I mean. Really skinny. So I don't get much of an opportunity to really show off what I do. I think there's a deal we can reach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's what I'm thinking. I'll be your personal trainer for free, help you bulk up and hit the gym. And in exchange, I get to document your change. Photos, and the like. All I ask is you let me use that stuff to build up a kind of 'portfolio' that I can use to show other furs the serious work I can do. If I can beef you up, I'd never be out of work again! Heck, I can even throw some cash your way too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want me to be some kind of before-and-after model like you see on those cheesy infomercials?\" ask the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before, after, and during. Look, it'll give me a chance to prove to other furs what I can do. Like I said, if I can turn a skinny guy like you into a meat mountain, I'll always have furs pounding on my door looking for help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion chuckled. \"I don't know if I want to be a 'meat mountain'...but okay. I think we have a deal.\" The lion stuck out a paw, and the horse shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Levi Werbeck! Glad to be working with you! Now, how would you like to begin? We could hit the weights hard. Though that might not be best for you since it doesn't look like you work out that much. But we can do that if you want to. Or, we could work on your nutrition. What you put into your body is almost as important as what you do in the gym!\"</span></div></div>",

Show off those biceps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>click click click click</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi snapped several photos as Evan, wearing only a pair of y-front briefs, flexed his arms. Though the lion hadn't been weight lifting for long, he had been making noticeable progress. Biceps were growing, his chest was firming up with muscle, his quads were thickening up, and his gluts were growing. Certainly, he was no mountain of muscles, but the lion still had beefed up a little bit. The furs were at Levi's house where, in addition to a private gym, the horse had made a spare room into a photo studio to document Evan's progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And turn around, tail up, we ne-\" The horse was cut off by a knocking on his front door. \"Huh, I wasn't expecting anyone today. Maybe a delivery or something. Let's take a break, Evan. There's a protein shake in the fridge for you. Drink that while I see what's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion stood nearly naked in the kitchen drinking from a shaker bottle when Levi stepped in ten minutes later. Following him was another fur, a zebra. Much like Levi, tall and with a unkempt mane of black hair, the zebra was quite muscular with bulky arms and thick quads and a beefy chest. However, this fur's gut was significantly bigger. Still round and firm, it stretched the tank top his was wearing to its absolute limit. The two furs were chuckling together when the zebra walked in and saw Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Levi. Who's this? Your new boyfriend or something?\" asked the zebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, no,\" said Levi. \"This is Evan. He's, uh, my newest client.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Client, huh? Is that what you're calling them these days?\" joked the zebra. He reached out towards Evan to shake. \"The name's Mac.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Mac\" said Evan as they shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mac and I have been friends for ages,\" Levi cut in. \"Apparently, he's in town for a few weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am. Has Levi been treating you well?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" said Evan as he flexed his bicep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra laughed. \"How long have you been seeing Levi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, only for a few weeks,\" replied Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so I guess you're not giving him any Juice? Making him work for it?\" Mac asked Levi. The horse hushed Mac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any what?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, look at the time!\" said Levi. \"Isn't it time for you to head back to your hotel, Mac?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so,\" chuckled Mac as Levi wrapped an arm around him, pulling him in the direction of the front door. \"Hey, hang on, wait a minute!\" Mac reached into his jeans pocket and pulled a wallet. The zebra pulled a business card from it and slid it across the kitchen counter towards Evan. \"Here, call me if you need a workout buddy and Levi's too busy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he won't need it!\" Levi said, practically dragging the zebra out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone in the kitchen again, Evan picked up the business card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MAC SLATER<br>\r\nBUSINESS ANALYTICS CONSULTANT<br>\r\n(901) 237-079</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lion finished off his protein shake, he remembered what the zebra said about some sort of Juice stuff.

Tail up, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>click click click</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a few weeks since Evan agreed to let Levi help bulk him up. Now, the lion stood in a makeshift photo studio the bulky horse made in a spare room of his house. Clad in only y-front briefs to show off as much of his body as possible, Levi was snapping photos of the lion's body from all angles to document Evan's progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd progress had been made. Levi went through Evan's diet and made some drastic changes. The lion, he found, was eating pretty much only enough to keep his body going.This wouldn't do, Levi had told Evan. There'd be no way for the lion to put on muscle if he wasn't properly feeding his body. In fact, Levi continued, there would be no point in trying to pack on some muscle until the lion had some serious calories stored away in his body. The horse laid out a diet plan for the lion. Three big meals, plenty of snacks, and (what Evan assumed) protein shakes. Levi would greet the lion with a large shaker bottle of light brown liquid when he came over to the horse's home to work out in his private gym. Evan would suck down one bottle before hitting the gym. Levi had the lion only working on light exercises, cardio and the like, which was a lot to a lion who had never been in a gym before. Afterwards, the horse had another shaker bottle ready for Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Evan liked was he saw was happening to him. The lion looked \"fuller\". His ribs no longer showed, his cheeks weren't as sunken. The lion developed a layer of pudge around his body, particularly on his midsection and rump. But this didn't bother him. He figured that all of it would be burned off when he started hitting the weights after going through his diet plan more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tail up, Evan! Show the camera those buns!\" said Levi from behind the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>click click click click</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that'll do it for the photos. Now, let's get to the kitchen and get another shake in you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion stood at the kitchen island sucking down a shaker bottle of protein shake. \"So, when do we start the weight training? I think I've been making good enough progress to start pumping iron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse shook his head. \"Yes, you've been making progress. But I still think we need to keep nourishing your body. You've been so underweight for so long that any sort of intense exercise will ruin all the work you've done so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Really?\" Evan said disappointingly. \"I was really hoping to start weight training soon. Is there anyway of, you know, speeding things up a bit?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulky horse thought to himself for a moment before heading over to his pantry. Inside, it was filled with massive jugs of various kinds of powders, powders the horse had been using for Evan's shakes. It was from here that Levi pulled out two large containers and placed them on his kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can add another shake to your diet plan. This,\" said Levi, pointing to the bright red jug, \"is a bit of a trade secret.\" The label on the jug read GLUCAMAX in giant font. \"Bodybuilders swear by this when they need to bulk up in a hurry. It's faster, cheaper, and healthier than any kind of dirty bulk. But the stuff's finicky. You have to follow the instructions on the side exactly as they say. This stuff,\" Levi pointed to the green jug which read VITAMOST on it, \"is probably the best vitamin supplement there is. You body hardly absorbs those multivitamin pills you get at the grocery market. But this stuff lets your body absorb all the nutrients. I've never actually used the stuff before, so I'm not sure if works or not. I could let you take this one home if you want to see if it works for yourself.\"</span></div></div>",

He figured what would come next would be warning nausea and diarrhea and whatever. It was just a nutritional aid; there couldn't be anything that terrible in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne tablespoon. Eight ounces of water. Stir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion swallowed up the stuff in a few gulps. It tasted fine, like a watered down fruit punch. Evan rinsed out the glass and placed it one his kitchen counter next to the powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late, so the lion went to the bathroom to brush his teeth. As he did so, he looked at himself in the mirror. He had only been training with Levi for a few weeks, and he had seen some results. But being around such a beefy fur wanted the lion to beef up himself even faster. He imagined himself with bulky arms, huge quads, thick pecs, and ripped abs. The bulking bug was biting him hard now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's mind went to the GLUCAMAX. It was supposed to help him along. But how? All he had was a just a small spoonful of the stuff. How was it supposed to help me when he had so little. Sure, there were the warnings, but Evan never took those seriously. What harm could there be in having another GLUCAMAX shake...or two, or three...</span></div></div>",

He was drinking so much of the stuff that he was through the entire massive tub of the powder already. And it was doing its job. The lion's stomach ballooned out, looking like a furry ball of soft pudge the size of a medicine ball. Almost perfectly round, it jutted out nearly a foot out in front of him. None of his shirts were able to cover the furry mass, though Evan wasn't too bothered by his bulk hanging out. \"Furs will have to get used to seeing a lot more of me when I really beef up anyways!\" the lion reasoned. Neither was he too bother by the fact that he had a fatter belly. \"And once I start cutting weight, this will all turn into a rock hard six-pack!\" he would say with a pat of his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, haven't been cheating on the diet or anything, by the way? Haven't been, uh, hitting up the burger joints?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Technically, that was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Well, I guess I'll have to adjust that plan. Umm, let's work on arms today then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's arms burned as he lifted the shaker bottle to his mouth. Levi definitely pushed the lion to the limit today. And if workouts like that kept up, then he'd be sporting some serious guns soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and have your post-workout shake,\" the horse said after they finished up with the dumbbells. \"I'll be in the other room working on what's going weird with your nutrition plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lion took a swig of the shake, he saw the pantry where Levi stored all of his powders. Looking around to make sure he was alone, the lion tiptoed towards it, his belly gently bouncing up and down as he did so. Gently opening the doors, he peaked at what all the horse was storing. There were loads of MASSALAYSE, the protein powders he had been using for weeks now. There was also some generic nutritional powders and the like. But tucked away in the back way a familiar red jug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More GLUCAMAX?\" whispered Evan. The jug was shoved way far in the back, and a thin layer of dust on it proved that it wasn't one the horse used often. \"I doubt Levi would notice it was gone...\" While it was true that the GLUCAMAX has done its job, Levi was now having the lion strength train, so there was no need for it anymore. But if Levi really wanted to make the lion into a \"meat mountain\", Evan would need all the help he could get, right?</span></div></div>",

Levi circled around the lion holding a small video recorder, capturing the lion's body from all sorts of angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. A few photos aren't going to do it. It'll help to have to video footage as well,\" the horse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...but why couldn't I...wear my normal workout clothes?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Afraid to show off your bulking body?\" Levi reached out and snapped the band on Evan's y-front briefs. The lion yelped. The briefs were significantly tighter than when he wore them for the first photo shoot many weeks ago. The diet plan, Evan reasoned, was really bulking him up. Though he had a small, soft belly forming, the lion's thighs and butt felt beefer, stronger, while maintaining a bit of jiggle to them. The briefs were snug, digging into his sides and making this slight lovehandles spill over. And they occasionally starting riding up into the Evan's swelling butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I...guess you're right?\" Evan panted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am. Now that's enough. Time for squats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, has the VITAMOST been working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan took a swing from his protein shake while the two furs hung around in Evan's kitchen. \"Yeah, I think so. I mean, I feel a bit more energetic. So I guess that means I'm getting more nutrition. Which means I can start pumping some serious iron! I can't wait to grow these bad boys!\" The lion flexed his arm, though there was only a small layer of fat on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi chuckled. \"In due time, you will. But we've got to make sure th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I got plenty of vitamins and minerals in me blah blah blah,\" he cut in. \"I guess I'm getting a little impatient. That, and I'm ready to work this off.\" The lion poked at the belly that was beginning to form on his midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll help to keep developing your legs and such,\" said Levi. \"I wouldn't be able to haul myself around if I didn't have some strong quads and gluts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, I guess,\" said Evan. \"And I know I've been beefing up when it comes to the leg department. Most of my pants are super tight! I need to size up. Get a few pairs that'll hold me until I start cutting weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy horse perked up. \"Oh really? So soon? Well, chug that thing down and we'll head to the mall! I'll buy you some more pants! My treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, that's being too nice!\" protested Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush.

Those briefs were looking tight!\" explained Levi. \"Besides, don't you want to show off those legs? You worked so hard for them! Now, let's get some burgers!

His arms were bigger, but that was because of the layer of fat building up on them. The same was true of his now soft chest. The lion sighed. He thought he would be building up some serious muscle by now. He had, but it really was only in his legs. Perhaps he needed to bring this up with Levi, ask him to start with the strength training. He felt healthier and that his body was more nourished then it ever had been, so why not work on that. Then again, Levi was the personal trainer, so what did Evan know?</span></div></div>",

As for the new underwear, while the lion preferred boxer briefs, his bulked up thighs were now rubbing against one another, shredding the legs of pretty much all of boxer briefs. Switching styles was the logical choice for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked through the mall, wider hips swaying and plumper butt wobbling around, Evan noticed a couple of furs off in the distance pointing at him and talking to one another. A bear and an otter, both pretty obese themselves, were very clearly discussing the lion. The otter was gesturing wildly; the bear looked skeptical. That is, until the otter pulled out his phone and showed him something. His jaw dropped and the bear glanced at the phone, then at Evan, then at the phone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, this wouldn't have bothered Evan. But this was an occurrence that was happening more and more often. Whenever he would go out, some fur would spot him, staring at him as he walked by or talking with a friend in hushed voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was really irritating Evan.

He's coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just act natural!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion stormed up to the bear and otter, both of whom were acting nonchalantly. \"Hey! Were you two talking about me?\" he asked pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? We don't know what you mean,\" the otter feigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>just</i> saw you two pointing at me and very obviously talking about me!\" retorted the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear sniggered. \"Sorry. But we don't get to see Project E everyday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Project E? What on Earth are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter's phone dinged. He checked it, giving the bear a nudge. \"Hey man, our ride's here. Say bye to E over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's Project E?\" demanded Evan. Both furs ignored him, waddling away towards the mall's exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Project E is...me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken an evening of searching around online in various niche forums until he landed on the main page for Project E.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>TURNING <i> THAT</i> INTO <i> THIS</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the left hand side of the page was a photo of Evan. It was apparent that the picture was one of the first taken by Levi all those weeks ago when the lion had taken up his offer to help him beef up after being harassed by those two enormous furs at the beach. He looked thin, frail even. Evan really didn't realize how sickly thin he looked back then until just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the right hand side of the page was a drawing. COMMISSION BY OTTERLYMAD, the caption read. The drawing was of a fur, a lion which looked striking like Evan, though the drawing featured a lion who was immensely fat. Lying on his stomach on a bed, the lion in the picture had an astounding massive rear, like two beach balls full of pudding. A tail, plump like a sausage, laid lazily along the lion's long buttcrack. Two thighs, each looking twice the size of Evan's things in the other photo, stuck out from underneath the vast ass. Rolls and rolls formed love handles resting atop the mass. The lion was looking back over his shoulder, propped up on pillowy arms, an expression of lust and cheekiness on his face, a slight double chin hanging from under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, Evan explored the site. Much content was behind a paywall. Yet there were plenty of photos of Evan's growth up for free. Even a clip from a video Levi shot of him working out on the StairClimber was up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion shut his laptop closed and tried to process what he just saw. Clearly, the hefty horse had ulterior motives. He didn't want to help Evan become a muscled hunk. Rather, Levi wanted to transform the lion into an object of his fantasies. That certainly would explain why the horse was so reluctant to get Evan working on arm curls and why he was so ardent about squats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a major violation of trust for Evan. Not only was Levi misleading him when it came to the personal training help the horse was giving, but he was also posting photos and videos of Evan online without him knowing. Sure, the website was obscure enough that not just anyone could stumble upon it. But that doesn't help Levi's case at all. The question is how would Evan confront Levi. He could be frank, tell the horse he found the site. Or Evan could just ghost on the horse. Though Levi wouldn't know exactly what he did wrong, it would be the least confrontational solution.</span></div></div>",

And all those photos of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright...that's... understandable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan had come over to Levi's place. But instead of the planned workout, the lion dressed down the horse, calling him out on the whole Project E business. While the horse certainly looked remorseful after the proverbial tongue lashing, he was getting no sympathy from Evan at all. As soon as the lion was assured that Project E's site was down forever, he explained in harsh language, Evan wanted nothing to do with the horse ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, wait here,\" Levi said despondently as he heaved his hefty body off of the couch. He left his living room, coming back moments later with a large stack of bills that he handed to Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's this for?\" he asked, flipping through the money. A quick count revealed that Levi had just gave the lion a few thousand dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's money I owe you. From the subscribers. It's just a couple of weeks worth, and not quite all of it. Had to paid the webmaster this week,\" explained Levi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...this is from that website? From people who paid to see all those...photos and videos of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is! Lots of furs want to see you!\" exclaimed Levi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're a sexy dude. Fat ass or no. But I think the extra junk in your trunk helps bring in more traffic,\" replied Levi. \"Plenty of furs out there are willing to pay top dollar to see a lion with a nice butt work it on a StairClimber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes way! I even had some guys willing to cough up some extra dough for special requests. One guy offered half a grand for a video of you showering in a pair of white briefs. Though I couldn't figure out how I'd get you to do that without letting the cat out of the bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion looked down at the stack of cash in his paws. Most of his life, Evan barely scraped by when it came to money. It was a miracle if his bank account had more than a hundred dollars in it. In fact, the most money he ever saved up was what he moved to Port Zaftig with, and that was drying up fast. Now here he was, holding a pile of cash that was a month and a half of wages from his job back in Bastion. And if Levi being honest, there was tons of more money to be made. If he kept going with this Project E thing, Evan might not end up with the body he wanted, but he might just end up with more money than he dreamed of.</span></div></div>",

Had he not been on a diet, he would have been on his second meal by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the blanket off of him, the lion sat up in his bed and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. He saw the thick roll of fat that spilled onto enormous thighs. Neither his belly or his thighs looked all that much smaller, and he became worried about what the scale would say. Evan got up and grabbed a pair of white briefs (Size XL), worked them up his chunky legs, and wandered to his bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, the lion stepped on his scale. He swore to himself when he saw the number: 231. Not only had he failed to drop any weight, Evan had managed to put on an extra pound. He glanced at the mirror next to him and examined his profile. He bit his lip seeing the two giant blobs of dough what was his rump. His thick tail hung lazily over the two  mounds. No wonder guys keep whistling at him on the street. Not many girls in Bastion were as thick as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling into the living room, Evan was startled by his roommate who he didn't see laying on the couch. \"Woah! Put some clothes on!\" the scrawny rabbit said as he flipped through the channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, Dave. It's not like you don't walk around the place in your boxers,\" Evan shot back. He reached a paw behind him and tugged the material that was bunching up in his butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but at least I walk around with something that actually covers my ass,\" Dave replied. \"Anyways, I brought some doughnuts back home from work. They're in the kitchen. Take the rest, I don't want any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave glanced over good shoulder towards Evan. \"Wait, didn't you demolish an entire carton of ice cream last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...it was sugar-free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's roommate turned back to the television. \"Whatever. They're in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion returned to his bedroom with a bright pink box in his arms. He tossed the box onto the computer desk. Evan booted up the computer and sat himself down on the wooden chair. It creaked loudly as his wide ass rested on it, spilling out slightly over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour, Evan mindlessly munched the doughnuts as he browsed the diet and fitness forums he frequented for more weight loss tips. He wanted to figure out why he failed to drop any weight. A paw reached for another doughnut to find the box was empty. \"Huh? Eight already?\" He threw the box in the general direction of his garbage can. It landed next to an empty pizza box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching for weight loss tips eventually devolved into just lazily browsing around the forums. Along with diet plans and ways to get more swole, users also tended to post weird stuff which Evan found to be somewhat entertaining. Last week, skinnining_cheetah posted a link to a website where some lunatic wrote stories about him wrapping up various country and western musicians in plastic wrap. Evan spent several hours reading those dumb yet funny story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tread that was getting some attention today. <b>A new kind of bodybuilding?</b> Evan clicked the link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>okay so don't ask me how I found this but k stumbled on this website where well check it out yourself. Oof. Talk about bulking</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's heart almost stop when he saw the link posted: ProjectM.com<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis paw trembled slightly as he clicked the link.  \"I swear to God, Levi, if I find my photos up again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PROJECT M: TURNING <i>THAT</i> INTO <i>THIS</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the left side of the site was a photo of a rather skinny tiger. Roughly the same age and height as Evan, but he was really thin, thinner than Evan ever was. The tiger only wore skimpy y-front briefs. The lion could almost count the ribs on the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the right side of the homepage was an illustration. COMMISSION BY OTTERLYMAD was the caption underneath it. The drawing was of an immensely overweight tiger, a body of rolls and folds and flab. His stripes we're all distorted because of the fat. The tiger was sat on a couch, taking up nearly the entire thing. His gut cascsaded down reaching almost to his knees. Massive moobs sat on the tiger's gut, and his head looked nearly immobilized by a thick ring of fat around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Evan searched through the new website. Like Project E, Project M had a paywall. Yet he was still able to see some free content. Evan saw thumbnails of various photos of the tiger in various situations but progressively looking fatter. At the bottom of the page was a video. FREE PREVIEW: M BLIMPS UP. Evan eagerly clicked on the play button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video started with the tiger, nearly nude, sat on a chair in front of the camera. A substantial ball gut rested on his lap. From behind the camera came another fur. His face was out of frame, but Evan could see the horse's thick quads and solid belly as he walked behind the tiger and set down a couple items on a table next to him: A funnel and a six pack. \"Ready, Matt?\" The lion instantly recognized Levi's voice. The tiger joyfully nodded. Levi stuck a funnel into his awaiting mouth, cracked open a beer, and began pouring. Evan skipped ahead to the end of the short preview video. The tiger's belly look visibly distended, clearly swollen with beer. The video ended with Levi giving M's belly a few pats with his hoof. The tiger let out a belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GAIN ACCESS TO ALL PROJECT M CONTENT FOR ONLY $99 PER MONTH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blanant advertisement brought Evan back to reality. While he was happy not to find his photos back up online, he couldn't help but think of that huge wad of cash Levi had given him when he was confronted about Project E. It was the most money the lion had made in a while, and it helped him stay in Port Zaftig a little longer. Had he stuck it out with Levi a bit longer, Evan reasoned he could have made enough money on the side to help him pay rent until he found a way to make some cash that didn't involve blowing up his waistline. But rather than being fat with some money in Port Zaftig, he was fat and nearly broke in Bastion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan let out a sigh. He played the video again, watching as the tiger's belly steadily blew up, belly inching outward, stripes slowly separating. Something stirred in the lion; his underwear was now tighter in more ways than one. He replayed the video again, attention fixated on the blimping tiger, thinking about what he'd look like in a month, in a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GAIN ACCESS TO ALL PROJECT M CONTENT FOR ONLY $99 PER MONTH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan found himself shaking slightly with an unknown excitement. His bit his lip, grabbed his wallet, and pulled out his credit card.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The plump vixen manning the beach-side ice cream shop handed Evan a huge paper cup filled with the chocolate milkshake he had ordered. Even though he was bad a guessing measurements, he ventured that there was easily a half gallons worth of the treat. \"Are you sure this is mine?\" he asked. \"I only ordered a medium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a medium,\" she said dismissively. The vixen glanced over Evan's shoulder and addressed the fur standing behind him. \"And what will you get, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan stepped aside. Approaching the counter was another lion much like himself, with a creamy white furred chest and abdomen, and greyish brown for covering the rest of his body. A thick mane of the same dark fur surrounded his head. The other lion was thin, like Evan. But rather than being scrawny, this guy was svelte with defined six-pack abs, cut biceps and quads, and the rock-hard rear characteristic of someone who spent much of their time in the water. The small black speedo he wore left little to the imagination as it hugged his body tightly. His long tail hung down lazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, can I get a scoop of cookie dough?\" he asked. The vixen didn't bother responding back to him, instead waddling over to the ice cream cooler to dish up his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Evan wouldn't have hung around. But something about this other lion reminded him of someone. He glanced at his handsome face, trying to figure out where he had seen him before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, are you...Jake McCarthy?\" Evan asked the lion. \"That famous swimmer guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yep! That's me! Famous swimmer guy!\" He stuck out his paw and Evan shook it. Jake McCarthy, even for a fur like Evan who never really cared about athletics, was a name anybody would recognize, especially after having captured four gold metals at the previous Olympics. \"Are you a fan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, not really. Sports aren't my thing,\" Evan replied. \"I asked because I wasn't sure if I recognized you from somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're the only one who has recognized me,\" Jake replied. \"I've been here nearly a week and not one has said anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you here on vacation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Rehabilitation.\" He turned towards Evan, showing him one of his muscular thighs. Even under his dark fur, Evan could make out a healed though still fresh scar. \"I tore a muscle bad a few months back. I needed to take some time off to let it heal from surgery and my manager said he knew a guy who knew a guy who had a place I could rent for a few months. Are you on vacation here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I actually just moved here. Last night, in fact. Had to drive for several days to get here all the way from Bastion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile appeared on Jake's face. \"You're from Bastion? I used to live there way back when! I moved away when I was 10, but I loved that place. Hey, did you go to Little Learners Elementary Sch-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, sir.\" The vixen returned. She plopped onto the counter a bowl with a single scoop of cookie dough ice cream in it. However, the scoop was the size of a small basketball. Jake's eyes bugged out upon seeing the mass. \"Is that a single scoop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Next customer, pleased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan held up his gigantic milkshake. \"Time for a cheat day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake chuckled. \"Heh, I guess so!\"</span></div></div>",

The swimmer appeared to be several months pregnant with a few cubs. He and Evan had spent much of the day hitting up any and all restaurants near the beach that tickled their fancy. Tacos, burgers, pizza, the duo devoured thousands if not tens of thousands of calories worth of food, though Jake was doing much, much more of the eating. Evan watched in amazement as Jake's flat abdominals ballooned out while the swimmer stuffed his face. At points, Evan swore Jake was going to explode, but he kept eating stopping to unbutton his pants. By the time evening had rolled around, Jake looked as if he swallowed on overinflated basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, doing alright?\" Evan asked, joining Jake on the couch. He carefully lowered himself down. The cream-colored lion was full as well, though not nearly as packed as his friend. \"Looks like you may have overdid it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake opened his maw and let out a loud belch. \"Nah. This was nothing.\" He gave the solid dome of his gut a firm pat. \"I've eaten way, way more before. Though usually it's a lot more vegetables and less ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan undid the buttons on his shorts; his extended stomach poked out a bit more. \"Really? How? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swimmers needs a ton of calories when they're training. It's a really intense sport. On days before meets, it's not uncommon if I suck down thirty thousand or so calories in a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, how come you're not a whale then?\" Evan asked in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I burn it all off! Like I'm going to with this!\" Jake gave his stomach another pat. \"Tomorrow I gotta hit the gym. I can't let my body waste away while I'm healing from surgery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on! How about one more cheat day?\" pled Evan. \"There are so many other places I want to visit! Like that burrito joint we skipped so we could go to that pizza place! One more day won't hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake let out a groan. \"I really shouldn't. I mean, today shouldn't have happened either. My agent and trainers would kill me if they saw all that I ate today.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evan tapped his foot impatiently as he waited outside Jake's apartment. The lion tugged on the tight waistband of his green swimming trunks. He had agreed to pick up Jake at 2pm to head down to the beach to swim, the first time either of them had hit the water in nearly two weeks. It was a quarter past two, and Evan pounded on the front door once more. If nothing, then he'd turn around and head back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Evan heard the stomping of feet from the other side of the door. It flew open. The greyish lion stood there with only a towel wrapped around his waist. A thick roll of pudge sagged over. His softened chest was tugged down ever so slightly by gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are,\" Evan said, his voice lathered with annoyance. \"Are you ready to g-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go swimming today!\" Jake interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cream-colored lion sighed. \"I thought we made plans,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I can't!\" the grey lion pled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-...why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't!\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why can't you? Tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake look exasperated. He yanked Evan inside by the paw and slammed the down behind him. \"Because of this!\"  The grey lion dropped the towel, exposing two meaty thighs covered in a thick layer of soft flab. His white tiny white swim trunks left little to the imagination. They appeared to be painted on his body; the seams looked ready to burst. Cheeks burning with embarrassment, Jake turned around giving Evan a view of his expanded backside. The formerly fit buns now appeared like two blobs of dough. The beginnings of lovehandles spilled over the top of the trunks and his tail hung lazily over his engorged ass. The trunk's logo was distorted by Jake's ballooned up butt. SWIMEX stretched across the lion's chunky rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan let out an oof. \"Wow, uh, been enjoying those cheat days, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's cheeks burned even more. \"Yeah, well, it looks like you've been enjoying them too!\" The grey lion shot a paw at Evan, jabbing him in the watermelon-sized paunch that was his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hasn't taken much convincing for Jake to take a second cheat day. It took even less effort for Evan to talk him into a third. The suggestion of a fourth cheat day was met with little protest. For the past two weeks, the pair of lions sampled everything restaurant Port Zaftig had to offer. They'd bounced from joint to joint, eating their fill, until Jake (having always eaten himself to the point of nearly exploding) would take a taxi home being unable to waddle around with his overstuffed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the extra thousands of calories made their way to Evan's belly. He didn't mind the extra weight that much. Being super skinny all of his life, the lion rather enjoyed the extra bit of pudge. But Jake had sucked down far more calories than his feline friend, eating as if he was carbo loading after a meet, eating as much as one of the large locals, sometimes more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...not so bad...\" Evan said, examining Jake's backside. He was being kind. In reality, one more burger and those trunks might split apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey lion moaned. \"I've got to lose this weight...And this means no more cheat days! You got it? I'm going to have to work my butt off if I'm going to be in competition shape when I'm done with rehab...literally work my butt off...\" Jake poked one of his plump butt cheeks. It wobbled only slightly being so constructed by his trunk. He looked Evan directly in the eyes. \"No. More. Cheat. Days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Evan said, begging off. \"No more cheat days. Don't you still want to go to the beach? I mean, you can swim and burn off some calories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Jake shot back. \"I can't let anyone see me like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? You probably won't even be noticed! There are a ton of bigger furs at the beach! Nobody will notice you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake groaned again, this time biting his lip. \"I really don't want to go,\" he pled. \"I'd rather lock myself up here until I drop a few pounds...\"</span></div></div>",

Each photo was accompanied by a stinging caption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Need a hand?</i> said a caption beside a photo of Jake trying to yank up the trunk that were sliding off his rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lay off the snacks, kitty!</i> was next to a photo of Jake biting into an ice cream sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lion to Landwhale!</i> There was a side-by-side comparison of Jake from a swim meet years ago, abs cut and defined, next to a photo taken of him at Port Zaftig, his abs covered by a thick layer of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan grimaced as he tossed the tabloid magazine into the coffee table. \"Yeesh...well, it's harsh but, you know, words can't hurt, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake huffed. Droplets of chocolate ice cream flew out of his mouth. \"I've already lost three sponsorships...\" The grey lion dug his spoon into the half gallon of ice cream sitting in his lap. \"Do you know how hard it is to get Nokies as a sponsor?\" He shoveled a massive wad of the frozen treat into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pang of guilt hit Evan in his stomach. \"Damn...but, don't you think you're taking it a bit...too hard?\" He gestured at the half dozen empty ice cream cartons laying around Jake's living room. They were all full earlier that day. The swimmer sat shirtless on his couch. His gut, a vast furry dome filled to the brim, rested on his lap. The soft layer of fat had swelled out into a hard ball. Evan could just make out to loose boxer shorts from underneath the mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake said nothing is response. Instead, he tossed the spoon aside and raised the carton to his mouth. The ice cream was liquidy enough for the grey lion to drink the rest. Evan anxiously watched as he drank, worried that the lion's poor belly might just explode. Audible creaks could be heard from Jake's stomach. Finished, Jake threw the carton aside and let out a low belched. A ring of chocolate stained his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it, if they think I'm a landwhale, then I'll be a landwhale...\" he groaned. Jake tried getting up off the couch. Yet the weigh of his immense gut made it too difficult and he collapsed back down. \"Ugh, do me a favor and grab me another thing of ice cream from the fridge? I don't care about the flavor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! Get a hold of yourself!\" pled Evan. \"You can't do this to yourself! Yeah, this all sucks but you'll slim back down and be back out there nabbing sponsorships again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey lion just gave Evan a look. \"Ice cream, now.\"</span></div></div>",

His ripped abs glistened. Evan had stopped by to visit and was recounting all the restaurants and eateries he had been to over the last week, which was many. The lion now sported a substantial pot belly which strained his shirt, forcing it to ride up and expose a few inches of flesh. He had stealthly undid the buttons of painfully tight pants when Jake wasn't looking to relieve some of the pressure due to his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you need to take another cheat day sometime,\" Evan said to Jake. \"You have no idea what you're missing out on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey lion finished his set and got up off of the floor. Grabbing a chair hanging off the back of a chair, he stared whipping beads of sweat from his brow. \"Nah, can't. Gotta make sure I'm at competition wei-\" Just then, a loud knock came from the door of Jake's apartment. He wandered over and opened it up. In came a svelte brown female cat dressed in tight yoga pants and a light jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda! Glad you could stop by!\" Jake gave the cat a quick hug as he ushered her into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I could stop by! But we have to make this quick. My taxi is waiting outside and if I'm too long I'll miss my connecting flight.\" From a bag from around her shoulder, she produced a stack of papers and handed them to Jake. \"Boilerplate agree, but give it a glance anyways.\" He took the papers from her and started skimming through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda spotted Evan siting on the couch and approached him. \"A friend of yours? Hello, I'm Miranda Fitzgerald. I manage Jake over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan got up to shake her hand. He noticed her eyes briefly darted down to his belly. \"Evan. Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a local?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am now. I moved here not long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" she said, her eyes again gazing at his gut. \"You certainly are starting to look the part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake interrupted them, handing the papers he just signed back to Miranda. \"Here, Miranda. Signed, sealed, delivered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, dear.\" She packed the papers back into her bag. \"Got to go. But remember that idea we talk about a few weeks ago? Maybe talk with you're new friend about it.\" She gave Jake another quick hug before rushing out the door, slamming it shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what was that all about?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Miranda had a short layover in town and took that was an opportunity to swing by and have me sign some papers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean the other thing she said. Whatever you two were planning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nervously rubbed a paw on the back of his neck. \"Heh, that. Just a stupid idea. Forget about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Tell me!\" Evan pestered Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. So, I'm thinking about cutting back on competitions because of my injury and whatever. And I've been thinking about going into the whole 'fitness' industry. Dieting and exercise, more specifically. I mean, I have a killer body!\" The grey lion gestured a paw along his well-defined abs. \"So I've got to know a thing or two about what it takes to get a hot body. I figured I could come up with a diet plan that furs would die to have. The McCarthy Plan, I'll call it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why did Miranda ask you to bring it up with me?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are looking a bit chunky these days.\" Evan instinctively tugged his shirt back down over the dome of his gut. He could only pull it down another inch. \"You might just be the first fur to try The McCarthy Plan! I mean, if I can't find anyone else to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of the reason I'm rehabbing in Port Zaftig is to try and find a big fur to slim down and show the companies my plan works. And this place is full of, uh, Miranda called them 'big fat fucks'. She's kinda right. If I can get one of these furs down to a normal BMI, I'll be raking it in! So if you want, you can help me scout around for a fat fur to enlist. Either way, I'm sure Miranda will give you a nice cut of the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I kinda need it...\" moaned Evan. \"I've practically eaten all my savings already...\"</span></div></div>",

He readjusted the ice pack on his face. \"God, that lady had a hell of a right hook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch. You doing okay?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just a bruised ego. And a bruised eye. But seriously, that's the 15th fur I've asked and all I've gotten was either a 'no' or a 'hell no'. I don't think you'll find anyone here who'll take you up on the diet thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed audibly into the phone. \"Alright. Well, I have a back-up plan. Swing by my place tomorrow, and I'll explain then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evan opened the door to Jake's apartment, his nose with hit with a cacophony of delicious, mouthwatering odors. Stacked all over Jake's apartment were loads and loads of takeout containers from restaurants all over town.  From what Evan had seen, it was an impossible amount of food even for two healthy furs like him and Jake to devour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan! Come in! Hope you're hungry!\" Jake gestured for the lion, patting a paw next to him on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally having another cheat day?\" Evan asked, sitting down on the couch. An enormous pizza sat in the coffee table in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Jake replied. Again, he was shirtless, showing off his amazing physique. Only a loose pair of shorts covered him at all. He reached over and opened the pizza box. It unleashed a wave of smells of cooked meat and melted cheese. \"Bon appetit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, Evan reached for a greasy slice and started munching. \"So, just what are you planning now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get this: If we can't find a fat fur to slim down, we'll <i>make</i> one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cream-colored lion swallowed a hunk of the pizza. \"Uh-oh...is this why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a foolproof plan! We get you all big and fat, then I'll help you get skinny again! You'll be even fitter than before! Skinny to fat to abs! It'll be great!\" Jake was excitedly bouncing up and down on the couch. \"I talked to Miranda about it and she thinks it's a great plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shoved the rest of the slice into his mouth. \"I dunno. I mean, I'm not sure about putting on a bunch of weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake reached out a paw and patted Evan's sprouting belly. \"I don't think you'll have a lot of choice in the matter as it is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan could feel his cheeks burn bright red. \"...how big?\" he asked meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, the bigger you get the more impressive the loss will be. And considering ju-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me how big you want me.\" Evan interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...around 500 pounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cream-colored lion nearly choked on his second slice of pizza. \"God! That's absolutely massive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Have you not seen the size of the furs in this town?\" asked Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's massive for me! That'll be tripling my weight almost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride,\" replied Jake. \"You already love eating, clearly. Why not make a few million bucks off of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan once again almost choked on his pizza. \"A few million dollars?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda did some back of the envelope math and think that's the cut you can make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, with that money I'd be set for life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you say, fatty?

You've been eating like mad, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan nodded as he repositioned himself on Jake's couch. The cream-colored lion had just stuffed himself full of sushi on his way over to the swimmer's apartment. His globe of a belly stuck out prominently, his shirt riding up past his bellybutton. Lazily rubbing a paw on the swollen mass, Evan leaned his body against the arm of the couch, laying slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. This isn't going to work,\" muttered Jake. \"At this rate, you won't be probably fat until...God, three years from now? Ugh, that's too long.\" The svelte lion started packing around the apartment, thinking of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing the best I can,\" Evan said. \"I dunno what's wrong. I was packing it on pretty quick a while ago. But I have no idea what it might b-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Quite! I think I just thought of something!\" Jake stood at the living room window, looking down at the rotund furs waddling up and down the sideway stories below. A smirk grew on Jake's face. \"You just need to get big. Doesn't matter how. In fact, it might be for the best to get you huge without all that junk food. It'd ruin your body and be a hard habit to break...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you thinking then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jabbed a paw at the window. \"This city is <i>full</i> of lard buckets.

And it'd be really easy to slim you down afterwards since you didn't really eat your way to being a quarter ton!\" the swimmer said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but how? Liposuction is a thing, but...reverse liposuction?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call around. There are a few doctors in this town who owe me some favors. The only thing to do is find a willing participate and...\" Something caught Jake's eye outside. \"Him. I bet I can...\" The swimmer rushed to the front door and quickly slipped his shoes on. \"Stay right there! I saw someone who would be perfect! Be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake slammed the door behind him. \"Well, it's not like I'm going anywhere anyways...\" The lion grumbled as patted his gut.</span></div></div>",

Utterly drained,\" the cheetah on the other end of the line said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they did take nearly four hundred pounds out of you! Too bad they couldn't get the rest! But I'll help you trim off the rest of the fat when you've recovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. And you sure you don't want any compensation? Money is not really an issue and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Nothing.

What luck!\" the cheetah said joyously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I guess you were just jogging in the right place at the right time! Rest up, Big Cat. Training starts next week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake ended the phone call and slipped his phone back into his pocket. He let himself back inside one of the hospital rooms where an incredibly obese lion laid unconscious. His blob of a belly and flabby chest nearly ripped the hospital gown apart. The sheet on his lower half did little to hide his tree trunk sized thighs. The oxygen mask strapped around his face was almost slipping off thanks to his enormous cheeks. The surgery had been a success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How our fat friend doing, Dr. Kirkpatrick?\" Jake asked the bulky bear who was fiddling with knobs and dials on machine hooked up to the gigantic lion in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stable,\" the bear said stoically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame you couldn't pump him up bigger,\" the swimmer said, examining Evan's new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another pound and he would have popped,\" Dr. Kirkpatrick grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake placed a paw on Evan's doughy belly. Brushing back fur, he saw long and jagged red marks along his skin. He let out a low whistle. \"Wow. 577, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thereabouts.\" The bear didn't look up from the chart he was scribbling on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long. He's on The McCarthy Plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, tubby. Turn to the side...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese lion's entire body wobbled about as Evan awkwardly shuffled himself around. He hadn't gotten used to moving with the several hundred extra pounds of fat on him. He hadn't gotten used to how slow and cumbersome it was to be a quarter ton fur. Hissing slightly as he moved, the stretchmarks all throughout his body shot out bolts of pain. Since the procedure, Evan's skin felt tight as a drum. But the creams the doctor gave him were healing his damaged skin, though the healing process wasn't over yet, and he needed Jake's help to make sure cream was spread all through his enormous new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake snapped a few photos. He needed some \"before\" shots for Evan's portfolio. \"God, look at that belly hang...\" he teased while taking a few more photos. \"Sorry, I'm not gonna help hold that thing out of the way when you need to pee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan blushed. \"Shut up and take the photos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dough boy. Now let's see that fat a-\" Suddenly there was a knock on the door. \"It's unlocked!\" Jake shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicked, Evan grabbed a blanket hanging off the couch and quickly threw it over his nearly nude body just before the door swing open and in walked a cheetah. A little on the chunky side, the feline sported a decent gut and thick thighs. The clothes he wore clung to all of his curves, and they appeared brand new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Alexander!\" Jake said. \"Come by to pick up your stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did...Am I interupting something?\" he asked, trying not to stare at the oversized lion standing in Jake's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, just taking some shots of fatso over here before he gets put on The McCarthy Plan!\" The swimmer held up his camera for emphasis. \"Isnt that right, tubbo?\" The grey lion tried yanking off the blanket wrapped around Evan, but he held on to it tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, okay...\" He spotted a box nearby the front door with his name written on it with a marker. \"Are these the workout out clothes you got me?\" Alexander asked Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! So you'll have no excuses for tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah grabbed the box before heading back out the door. \"Alright, see you tomorrow, Jake!\" He slammed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turned back to Evan. \"Drop the blanket, lardo!

Puddles of sweat formed in the underarms of his tent-like workout shirt. He hissed in pain as his chaffed thighs rubbed against themselves. Whipping beads of sweat frol his brow, he spotted Alexander and Jake walking by, finished with their own workouts. While it had only been a couple of weeks since working out with the swimmer, Evan could tell that the cheetah was already seeing results. His remaining potbelly had noticably deflate, and his arms were becoming less flabby and more built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Fat Cat. Nearly done?\" asked Jake as he and Alexander approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...a couple of minutes left,\" Evan replied, gesturing to the treadmill console. 2:14 it read in bright red number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked over at it. \"Nah. Can't be right.\" He mashed a paw down on the buttons several times. The remaining time now read 32:18. \"There you go, Tubbs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake! I...I don't think...\" the ballooned up lion struggled to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and keep waddling, Tubbs. I gotta hit the showers.\" Tossing his gym towel over his shoulder, Jake strolled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander stood there for a moment. He gave Evan a half-hearted smile. \"You're...you're doing well!\" the cheetah said, giving Evan a pat on his shoulder before going off to join Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan whined as he watched the timer on his treadmill tick down. A deep grumble roared from the lion's vast belly. He remembers his meal plan for the rest of the day. A single chicken breast, no sauce, and a cup of steamed rice. He sighed. Jake was practically starving Evan, and the lion wasn't sure how mu-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gone loco, amigos!\" the potty Chihuahua on the gym's television yelled. \"All this week at El Burrito Diablito we had one dollar taco! Ay Caramaba! Come in today and bring your burro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan licked his lips. \"Tacos do sound pretty good right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nHad Evan not been so focused on destroying the mountain of tacos in front of him, he might have noticed Alexander take a seat opposite of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Evan. Doing well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan nearly choked on the half taco he was currently munching on. \"Oh! Uh, Alexander! Umm, hey! Didn't expect to see you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah chuckled. In front of him were a few tacos of his own and a side of refried beans. \"Don't worry. Jake would kill us if he saw us here. This'll be our little secret!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Thanks. I just can't live on rice and chicken alone!\" replied Evan.  He saw Alexander eyeing the pile of crumpled up taco wrappers on the tray in front of the heavy lion. Little did the cheetah know it was Evan's third tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Jake's awfully ambitious. I don't think he realizes that, uh, bigger furs aren't used to eating so little.\" He began unwrapping a taco. \"After all, that's probably a normal snack for you, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. Totally,\" Evan mumbled. It actually wasn't. Never in his life did he crave so many tacos. But never in his life did he have such cravings for so much food, to eat so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same. Back in my...um, fatter days I'd swing by here and grab thirty or forty tacos. That, or go down to the Creamery, squeeze myself into one of the booths, and have chocolate sundae after chocolate sundae.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocolate sundae. The moment thoses words left Alexander's lips, the lion immediately lost interest in the few remaining tacos on his tray. His mind instead immediately became fixated upon ice cream, gallons and gallons of it. A twinge shot through his already full belly and it suddenly craved for the sweat treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, that sounds so good right now...\" groaned Evan, who was now staring off into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't it? I might stop by there for a scoop. Can to join me? My treat!\"</span></div></div>",

The now fat cat, through eyes blurred with sleep, frantically looked around his bedroom and spotted two things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was the several empty cartons of ice cream scattered across this bedroom floor. Although he had turned down Alexander's offer, the lion couldn't get ice cream off of his mind. Stopping by the grocery store on his way home, Evan intended to buy just a little bit, just enough to curve his cravings. But he ended up walking out of the store with tens of thousands of calories of the tasty treat which he greedily devoured that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing he noticed were the two furs in his bedroom: Alexander and Jake. The latter had a furious look on his face, and seeing the destruction from the night before along with the drips of dried ice cream all over the his fur, Evan instantly knew why. Today was supposed to be a weigh-in day, hence why Alexander was there and why Jake had let himself in. The swimmer was hopping mad to find his protege had gorged himself, breaking from his strict diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake! I'm sorry bu-\" Evan began, but the swimmer gave him a hard shove, rolling him over onto his vast stomach and exposing his blubbery rear in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, I think Evan...\" the cheetah said, his words trailing off. But the grey lion ignored him as he started taking off his black leather belt and yanking Evan's tail out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat fuck...\" muttered Jake before looping the belt and bringing it hard over Evan's fattened backside. It made an ungodly slap, and the cream-colored lion hissed in pain. \"Sad sack of crap!\" Jake brought the belt down again, harder this time. Once more, Evan yelped in pain. He tried rolling back over, but Jake shoved him back into position where he kept wailing on the lion's expansive ass, hurling insults as the cheetah stood meekly in the corner. After a dozen and a half lashing, Evan's rear felt battered and bruised. Tears had formed in the corner of his eyes from the pain he had endured; he could feel welts forming on his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, Jake treaded the belt around the loops of his jeans. \"Don't...cheat again,\" he grunted. \"Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Jake,\" whimpered Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do the weigh-in another day,\" Jake barked to Alexander before storming out of Evan's apartment. \"I'm too pissed to do it today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan hissed as Alexander applied another ice pack on his beaten rear. The cheetah moved the pack in slow circles around one of the blobs. It had taken him nearly an hour to ice the mass that was the lion's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't think Jake knows what it's like to...you know, be fat,\" Alexander said. \"He doesn't know that big boys get really bad cravings. I remember one time when I was big, it was the first day of a new diet for me but I had a really hankering for fried chicken and...well, let's just say that I had a small mountain of chicken bones to deal with the next day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it doesn't excuse him from...well...\" Evan shifted his backside, making the dual blobs jostle around a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I agree with you there,\" Alexander replied. \"You'd think he'd understand? I mean, his own diet is so strict that he must know what it's like to get those insatiable cravings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion perked up a bit. \"...I think you're right.\" He looked over his shoulder towards the cheetah nursing his rear. \"We should give Jake a taste of his own medicine. Find out what kinds of things he craves and unleash him on it! Maybe then he'll get off of his high horse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinnier cheetah looked hesitate. \"Oh, I don't know about that...Jake has quite the temper and I'd rather just stay on his good side.\"</span></div></div>",

The grey sweatsuit he wore clung to ever single roll and fold of his soft, blubbery body. Jake, his astounding physique constraining the roly-poly cat, stood stoically looking at the blob of a fur in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you really want to shed all that fat?\" he asked. There was not a note of kindness in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" the cheetah enthusiastically said. \"I'll love to finally get skinny! And money's no matter! I can ha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Alexander,\" Evan interjected. \"I'm sure Jake will work for fr-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send you an invoice for myself services,\" Jake said, completely ignoring Evan. \"How much do you weigh, Alexander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, my scale broke when I hit 600 pounds...\" the cheetah said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey lion let out a low whistle. \"Pretty big. This'll be quite the change.\" He then turned to face Evan. \"Quite the change indeed. Are you sure about this, Evan? I mean, we could just go bac-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure! I'm sure!\" he cut in. \"I'm sure Alexander will be a wonderful client!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake let out another loud sigh. \"Fine. Fine. You're loss, I guess. Alright, big cat, let talk about your diet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan huffed and puffed as he tried to force the flaps of his jeans closed. \"Come...on...these fit...the other day...\" But the sea of soft rolls that made up the lion's gut made the task essentially impossible. Defeated, he shimmied the size 48 jeans off his legs, entire body wobbling, and tossed them into a corner of his bedroom. \"Don't need them anyways...\" he muttered. That was true. He had no roommate, and since it was his day off, Evan had nowhere he needed to be. The lion shuffled his heavy body towards the living room, not before digging his boxers out from the vast crevasse of his rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving eaten away all of his savings in Port Zaftig, Evan soon came up short on rent. With no money and having failed to find a job in light of spending his days stuffing his face, the lion was forced to pack things up and head back to Bastion. He couldn't ask Jake for financial help. Not like he wanted to, anyways. After turning down Jake's offer to blimp up for his diet plan and hooking him up with Alexander, the grey lion soon stopped returning Evan's calls and texts altogether. At first, he reasoned that Jake was busy getting Alexander into shape. But after a few weeks of it, Evan figured Jake no longer wanted to see him for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan did bring back on thing from Port Zaftig: A newfound love of eating. He was easily hired back at his old job at a pizza place. These two factors meant the lion's waistline ballooned up quickly. It was nearly a year and a half since moving back to his hometown and Evan was already pushing past 300 pounds. He tried dieting a few times, yet each attempt failed and soon Evan was back to sucking down pizza after pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion collapsed on his sofa, his wide butt landing perfectly on the dent his weight had made in it from his sedentary lifestyle. The couch creaked under his weight. He struggled to lean forward due to his belly, knocking away the takeout containers in his coffee table until he found the remote buried underneath. Evan fell back again. His belly and moobs jostled around wildly. The simple task made him out of breath again. It was a strange twist of fate for him. While in Port Zaftig, he stood out for being a skinny fur among so many fatties. In Bastion, he stood out as being a fatty amongst so many slender furs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the channels, Evan was annoyed to find mostly boring programming and stupid daytime talk shows. He stopped switching through channel when he saw a vaguely familiar cheetah on the screen. He was thin, but Evan could tell there was some serious muscle under his form-fitting suit. Sitting beside him was Jake, looking as slim and svelte as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Alexander, you've had quite the weight loss journey,\" one of the shows host side. She gestured to a cardboard cut out of an extremely obese cheetah beside him wearing a familiar grey sweatsuit. \"What kicked everything off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was tired of being so big. And one day, I was jogging in the park, struggling to even move, when this lion pops up. 'Hey, big guy! Wanna train with the Jake McCarthy?' he asked and I'm all like 'THE Jake McCarthy?!?' and he was all like...wait, what was his name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Jake cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Anyways, so I get started working out with Jake an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shut off the television and toss the remote away. He then cursed himself. It would take him a while to bend down and pick it up again later. An effort he wasn't looking forward to. A loud grumbling erupted from his flabby gut. Reaching for his phone next to him, he dialed up the pizza joint he worked at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's Evan...Yeah, even on my day off...so I want two large supremes, a pepperoni, large, and a medium...yes a fourth pizza, don't judge me...and a medium ham and pineapple... charge to my account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thick paw hit the end call button and the fat lion sat on his couch awaiting the four pizzas that would make up his breakfast. As he waited, he thought about getting rid of jeans altogether and just wearing sweatpants all the time. He'd rarely outgrow those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's mind began wandering to the offer that Jake made so long ago. 500 pounds was such a huge number to get to. It scared Evan at the time. But now, here he was. In a couple more years, he'll undoubtedly be a quarter ton, and that's not with the allure of millions of dollars behind it either. A few more years beyond that and Evan figured he'll probably be as big as Alexander was when he stumbled across him and offered the chance to have Jake slim him down. Now that cheetah is fit and trim and probably rich. Now Evan was fat and lazy slowing turning into a blob. Why didn't he just take Jake up? Why didn't he ju-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock came in the door; his food must be here. Evan shook his head. He must have been lost in thought for quite some time. He cursed at himself. The pizza guy was here and he didn't have any pants on at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" he mumbled. \"Not like he hasn't seen my fat ass before...\"</span></div></div>",

It was filled of powders and ancient grains and God knows what. The svelte swimmer wrote out the instructions and had plenty of the ingredients shipped to Evan's apartment. All he had to do was mix it up and suck it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion took another small mouthful. It tasted like old dirt. Plugging his nose, he brought the cup to his lips and pounded down as much as he could muster. Evan nearly gagged but he was able to drink half of the shake. He sighed seeing how much was left. Taking the rest of the shake to the living room, Evan figured he could nurse the rest while watching television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't bad enough that the shakes tasted awful, it also had the effect of leaving Evan incredibly bloated all the time. His belly was in a semi-permanent state of feeling full to the point of bursting. Evan's shirts covered embarrassingly little of the dome of his gut, and the poor lion could hardly see he toes past the mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the probiotics doing their work!\" Jake had assured Evan. \"They scrubbing your body clean of all those toxins! And judging by how much you're blimped up, you must of had a load of toxins in you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion gently rested a paw on his painfully swollen belly as he eased himself down onto the couch. Grabbing the remote, he flipped on the television. Knives of Justice VII was playing and that was just as good as anything to mindlessly watch as he tried to drink the rest of this \"healthy\" shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe program went to a commercial break. A cow dressed in overalls popped up on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen and Barry's has all new flavors of ice cream available now! Check out Chocolate Cacophony! Caramel Collision! And Fudge Tribulation! Get them at your local grocery store! C'mon! Get MOOving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan whimpered seeing the ice cream. It had been weeks since he had any. Jake's diet plan was incredibly strict, and the lion wasn't suppose to have any sweets at all. But ice cream was his absolute favor. Maybe a little bit wouldn't hu-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"No. Gotta stick to this diet. Gotta stick to this...\" Evan glanced down at the muck in his cup. \"...diet. God, this stuff is terrible. Maybe I can bring it up with Jake to make his whole diet plan more...palatable.\"</span></div></div>",

The nearly spherical ball of fur, dense and firm, swayed as the fit lion wobbled it around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan said nothing. His cheeks burned with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake stepped back to take in the bellied lion in his apartment. Evan looked pregnant, overdue with triplets. The globe that was his cream-colored gut stuck out a little more than a foot, and sagged down slightly forcing Evan to leave his shorts unbuttoned. So big was the lion's belly that even Evan's largest shirt couldn't cover him up. When he sheepishly entered Jake's apartment, his formerly baggy grey shirt was almost riding all the way up to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimmer stared dumbfounded. It had been little over a week since Evan started on The McCarthy Plan. Yet the lion looked like someone had stuck a bicycle pump in him and blew him up. \"Did...did you cheat on the diet plan I gave you?\" asked Jake. Even if Evan did, he figured there was no way he could have eaten himself to the size he was now unless the lion got himself trapped in a grocery store or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" lied Evan. It wasn't exactly a lie. Overcome with cravings, the lion did splurge a bit and bought a couple of cartons of Jen &amp; Berry's. But there was no way that ice cream could have blown up his belly this big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing a paw along his temple, Jake let out a sigh. \"Uh...let's cool it with the diet plan for a while,\" he said. \"I obviously need to tinker with some things. Is that cool with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. That sucks, but you gotta do what you gotta do,\" replied Evan. Jake didn't see the lion's tail wag in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud sucking sound came from the straw as Evan drank up the very last drops of the chocolate milkshake he was drinking, the third for the day. Crumpling up the paper cup, he tossed it into the garbage can sitting in his kitchen. The lion gave his firm full belly, swollen noticably larger due to the near gallon of milkshake digesting in it, and burped a little bit. He then went back to the task at hand: Boxing away all of the strange and bizarre ingredients Jake had shipped over for Evan's dietary shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabinet he store them all in was nearly empty aside from one plastic jar way in the back. His belly made it hard for him to reach inside as it bounded against the edge of the kitchen counter. Sticking a paw in, inch by inch he pulled the jar out. But his paw caught an edge of the lid. The jar flipped on its side, rolled out of the cabinet into the countertop, and bounced onto the floor where it continued rolling away for several more feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan cursed. He walked over and picked it up, which took considerable effort because of his engorged belly getting in the way of him being able to bend down. Legs spread wide apart to make way for his gut, the lion bent at the hips until he was able to grab the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jar was of one of probiotics Jake had sent as part of the shakes. Evan never really bothered to read any of the labels on the containers the swimmer gave him. \"Pro...bascilla...mono...nuxtra...\" he muttered, trying to pronounce the name of the probiotic. He gave up pretty quickly and glanced at the rest of the label. Evan never before noticed the bold text on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ATTENTION: IT IS ADVISED YOU AVOID THE FOLLOWING FOODS WHILE TAKING THIS PRODUCT IN ORDER TO AVOID DIGESTIVE ANOMALIES: KALE, BROCCOLI, SPINACH, ANY DAIRY PRODUCTS, CASHEWS, AND ALMONDS.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, damn...\" Evan said, looking down at his blimp of a belly. He figured out what made him blow up so rapidly. Even though he only cheated on his diet with a bit of ice cream, the dairy in it must have interacted with the probiotic in his shake, making his belly swell up massively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake will glad to know this,\" he thought to himself. Then, Evan realized something. If he told Jake about what he found out, then he'd be back on The McCarthy Plan in no time being that the flaw in his plan would be fixed. His stomach churned at the diet of sucking down another shake that tasted like dirt. Perhaps this could be something he kept to himself, for a while, at least.</span></div></div>",

While not as comically obese as some of the patrons on the sands, she certainly hadn't been skipping any meals recently. Chub poked out from the straps of her bikini top, the bottoms were being swallowed up slightly by her pudgy rear, and a small belly pouched out from her midsection. Fatter than Evan liked his girls, she was still very pretty to the lion. She shuffled along for a few steps, awkwardly carrying the cooler until she lost her grip. The cooler landed with a dulled thud in a small cloud of sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You need help with that?\" Evan asked as he approached the female deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please!\" she replied. \"I'm not too far, just over there!\" The vixen gestured over to where several umbrellas had been set up in the sand a few hundred feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion grasps one of the cooler's handles; the vixen grabbed the other. Lifting it up, Evan was caught off-guard by its heavy weight and was surprised the vixen was able to lift it up at all. \"Oof, damn, having a party over there or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just me and the boyfriend today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Boyfriend? Rats</i>, Evan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? And he's not here to help you out?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's alright. Besides, that slowpoke would taken longer anyways,\" the vixen said, checking out the lion from a corner of her eye. \"I'm Emily, by the way. You're...not from around here, are you? Are you on vacation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Evan. Actually, I just moved here. Like, literally just moved here. I live at the Flora Street Apartments not t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!

To welcome you to the city!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be nice. Like, I literally don't know anyone in Port Zaftig yet,\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll be our guest and...ah, here we are.\" The two reached the umbrellas stuck in the sand. A large bag with a beach towel laid beside them. On the ground another beach towel, an enormous bright red one, laid in a sizable crater in the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Troy's not here,\" Emily said as the two set the cooler down on the sand. She squinted, looking out into the ocean. \"Ah, there he is, taking a dip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan brought up a paw to his eyes, shielding them from the bright sun. Light glimmered off of the water nearly blinding the lion, but Evan could just barely make out small patches of red fur out in the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be out there for a while,\" the vixen said. \"But why don't you cover over to our place tonight? I'm making fried chicken, and I always make too much!\"</span></div></div>",

Emily's boyfriend was easily four times the size of Evan. The obese fox would have looked out of place anyplace else beside Port Zaftig where it seemed like most furs were several hundred pounds overweight. But Troy and his medicine ball sized belly fit right in, though it didn't find in the black shirt he was wearing which had rode up several inches since dinner. This didn't surprise Evan much; the red fox had eaten enough food that would have lasted the lion several days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, hell of a cook,\" Evan replied, his paw still caressing his swollen belly. \"Need a girl like that in my life. How did you two meet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, internet,\" Troy said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? Great in the kitchen...great in the bedroom...\" The obese fox said, though he muttered the last part as to not be heard by Emily in the kitchen. \"I saw you checking her out. Jealous much?\" Troy gave Evan a wink. The lion certainly was a bit envious of the fox. The vixen, while a bit chubby, was curvy in all the right places and had a cute face to match. Somehow, the blobby fox had landed a girl like Emily. Evan wasn't sure why. While Troy was conventionally handsome, he was nearly a quarter ton. Evan not only felt he had a better body than the red fox, but a body that could do more to please a girl. The lion's mind boggled at the mechanics of love-making with a fur as big as Troy. How, after all, could he please a girl when Troy probably couldn't even reach his own junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatach boys talking about?\" asked Emily as she walked back into the living room, carrying two plates with a thick slab of chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls,\" Troy said, taking a slice of cake from Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?

And the obese red fox was gone moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion stood watch in case Troy came back. In his head, Evan went over the plan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweatpants? Check. Condoms? Check. No underwear? Double check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly made his way down towards the apartment Troy and Emily shared.

He just left for work a second ago an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nops,\" Evan said as he confidently strode past the chunky vixen into the apartment. He leaned an arm against the back of the couch. \"I'm actually here to see you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are?\" Emily asked as she shut the apartment door. \"Okay, uh, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan smirked a little. \"No, what's up with you?\" he replied. \"I barely seem to know you! I practically spent all day yesterday talking with Troy while you were slaving away in the kitchen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen was a little surprised. \"Oh, well, I've just been cleaning our place since it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan cut her off again. \"Doesn't Troy help clean at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"No, no. I take care of it since Troy is a bit too big to do it himself. He mostly...\" Emily gestured towards the sunken cushions of the couch where it was obvious Troy always parked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I bet you do a lot for him. Does he do a lot for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, he pays for the apartment, the bills, the food, th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan cut her off once more. \"What's it like having a boyfriend as big as Troy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily perked up. \"Oh, I love my big foxy boy! He's so sweet and kind an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was talking about in the bedroom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen started to stammer. \"E-evan...that's private...stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled. \"What can I say? I'm a curious cat! The mechanics of it all must be so...difficult...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen shifted around uncomfortably. \"It's...hard, yes...I have to do most of the work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he returns the favor, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked towards the ground. She said nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, oh poor girl...that's such a shame...\" Evan shifted his position. His hips now stuck out slightly and the outline of his erection was now obvious. He caught Emily glancing at it for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan, what are you up to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion sauntered up to the chubby vixen. He place a paw on her chubby hip. \"I just wanna make you felt good...\" he growled, grabby a pawful of her rear with his other paw. Emily bit her lip slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been a while...\" she moaned, wrapping her arms around Evan's slender waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing made Evan hungrier than an afternoon of lovemaking. The naked lion wandered through Emily's kitchen looking for something to sate his appetite. Peaking into the fridge, he saw that it was loaded with food yet none of it was particularly appealing to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled as he shut the fridge door. Looking around the kitchen, the lion spotted a small platter with a half dozen enormous vanilla cupcakes, each twice the size of one of his paws. Licking his lips, Evan made his way over and grabbed one, quickly devouring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Emily made hear way into the kitchen. Naked as well, her heavy chest swung slightly as she moved. \"Evan, did you find anything to...\" The color drained from her face as she saw the lion bit into a third cupcakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me, these are good...\" he groaned. Frosting coated the fur around his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen shuffled around nervously. \"Oh, um, Evan...I made those special for Troy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so good...\" moaned Evan, taking another hearty bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...I can whip you up something to eat of you'd like!\" she quickly suggested. \"I can make a great grilled cheese sandwich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shoveled the rest of the cupcake into his mouth, reaching out for another as he chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Evan. Those are really, really special ones I made for Troy...\" she quietly pled. \"Let me make you something else! Just please don't have anymore!\"</span></div></div>",

The smallest fur he saw was probably still weighed well over 300 pounds. Not like the lion was judging or anything. But it's hard not to notice when nearly every fur you see takes up most of the sidewalk and waddles at half the speed you walk. The only furs that weren't so obese were obvious tourists wearing \"I <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Port Zaftig!\" shirts and were snapping photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, though, wasn't Evan's concern. The lion's concern right now was filling his stomach on something more substantial than the gas station snack he had been living off of for the past four days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly an hour of walking, Evan spotted a few potential places. First, there was a a local bakery which smells of delicious freshly baked bread and various baked goods as he walked by. He also found a Mexican restaurant that was serving its lunch special pretty soon, and Mexican food was one of Evan's favorites! He had also passed by a seedy tavern along the way. Not only may they have something to eat there, but he could get a nice beer with his meal too. Or there was a pizza place called Purgatory Pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Evan practically brought no food with him. A meal certainly sounds nice, but he should probably do the mature thing and actually go shopping. Luckily, there was a supermarket not too far away from his apartment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The inside of the Heavenly Bakery smelt, well, heavenly. Delicious aromas wafted into the shop from the ovens in the back. The store smelled of baking bread and cookies. Display cases were filled to the brim with baked good, dozens and dozens of fresh loves of bread were placed in baskets, and tall elaborately decorated cakes sat in a cooling case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store itself had nobody else in it. It was late in the morning so Evan reasoned that this must be a bit of a regular lull in the day. The lion meandered around the shop. His eyes were drawn to a display case for doughnuts. However, it was almost empty sans about a half dozen. These doughnuts, though, were more like small cakes. Each one was bigger around than the lion's paw and stood several inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was eying one in particular, chocolate with chocolate icing on it, when he heard someone come in from the back. She was a panther with beautiful black fur and a cute face. A little shorter than Evan, her busty chest and pudgy belly strained the buttons of her flannel shirt. Thick hips and thicker thighs stretched her khakis tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, sir!\" she said. \"Sorry to keep you waiting! I had to pull a few things out of the oven. Is there anything I can help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no problem. I was just browsing. I haven't really eaten anything all day so far. I spent move of the morning moving my stuff up to my new apartment,\" explained Evan. \"So now it's time for breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just move to town?\" asked the panther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, literally got in a few hours ago. And now I'm in the mood for doughnuts, but I just need to figure out which one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One? Huh,\" the panther then grabbed a box from behind the counter. She sauntered over to the display case and placed all six of the oversized doughnuts in there. \"Take them all! Consider it a welcoming gift! Besides, it's getting close to noon so these will probably end up in the day old bin soon anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you!\" Evan eagerly took the heavy box from the panther. \"Are you sure I don't owe you anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, just promise you'll be a regular here!\" She flashed him a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know I will be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie! Got it! I'm Evan! You know I'll be back again! Now I'm going to go eat these! I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, enjoy!\" She waved as he left the bakery with his bounty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was one his way back to his apartment to devour the doughnuts. But he had spent most of his time in Port Zaftig in his apartment and there was plenty to see. There was a nice park across the street from his apartment. Maybe it would be nice to eat break there. The box he was carrying wasn't to unruly. He could eat while exploring the city as well.</span></div></div>",

There's no need to yell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick panda manning the bar slid Evan another bottle of Grendel's Own Cranberry Cider. It was the fourth the lion had and, along with the small mountain of fries he devoured, he was starting to feel a bit bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tavern itself had been pretty empty, the only other patron having left half an hour ago. Evan chalked this up to it being still pretty early in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking open the bottle, the lion brought it up to his mouth and started chugging down the delightful brew. The front door of the tavern squeaked opened, and the lion glanced over to see that a tiger walked in, blinking as his eyes adjusted to the darkness in the tavern. The first thing Evan noticed about him was, like the lion, this tiger was quite trim, maybe even a few pounds less than Evan. He also noticed that, unlike the tourists who frequented the streets in tacky flowery shirts and shorts, this fur was dressed in a simple shirt and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger glanced around, spotting Evan at the bar. He sauntered up, taking a seat one stool away from the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll have?\" the panda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have that's dark?\" the tiger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Broken Skull Stout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have one of those.\" The panda poured a tall pint glass full of dark brown liquid and placed it in front of the tiger. He brought it to his lips, made eye contact with Evan, and raised his glass to make a silent cheers. The lion raised his bottle in return. Both took healthy swigs of their drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat silently drinking. The panda grabbed a bus tub full of glasses and plates and went into the back. The tiger then leaned closer to Evan. \"Hey, is it just me, or this town full of fat asses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion leaned over. \"Yeah, I know, right?\" Evan said in a hushed whisper. \"Where are all the hot babes at? Isn't this supposed to be a beach town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all sheltered away at the resorts on their private beaches,\" the tiger replied. \"And I'm not going to book a night there just to stare at eye candy. Besides, I-\" He stopped talking when the overweight panda walked back in. She grabbed a couple of empty plastic tubs from the bar and walked into the back again. As she did, the tiger pointed at her wide rear and made a dude gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan chuckled. \"I've been here less than a week and still haven't found anyone with a BMI under 60.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger stifled a laugh. \"Oh man, that's funny! Are you just visiting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I moved here just the other day. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same. Work transferred me here. The ManufactCo branch needed a new Assistant General Manager. I'd have rejected the transfer if I knew how many fatties this city had.\" The tiger stuck out a paw. \"The name's Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion shook his paw. \"Evan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger lifted his glasses and downed what little remained of his beer. Evan did the same with his own. \"Alright, next rounds on me!\"</span></div></div>",

Beer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth felines sat at the bar of a tavern a few blocks away from the ManufactCo Building. Each we're sipping dark beers and talking about their day. Matt complained about the secretaries in the office; Evan complained about the buffoos working on the shop floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this fatty turns around and knocks this giant bottle of soda he was drinking from into the machine!\" said Evan. \"We had to stop the line for a full hour and get every clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt chuckled and shook his head before taking a large swig of his beer. \"Same shit happens upstairs. There's this one fat ass who always, <i> always</i>, bumps something off my desk whenever she waddles by,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion smirked. \"Careful. Pretty soon you'll be the fat cat knocking shit over!\" Evan leaned over a jabbed a paw into the swelling beer gut straining the buttons on the tiger's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jabbed Evan's gut back. \"Says you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the first time Evan and Matt had a post-work beer. The two cats would usually go out drinking most nights after work. And while they didn't get too terribly drunk, they did always leave with bellies full of calorie-laden beer. They did, however, really cut loose on the weekends, drinking at one or the other's apartment to the point of passing out, then going out and stuffing themselves on greasy food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of all the excess calories, both Matt and Evan put on sizable paunches, soft round beer guts that sagged over their pants and would balloon out onto their laps as they filled themselves up with beer. While the lion was slightly concerned about the weight the two had put on, the tiger was less alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's just a few pounds,\" Matt reassured Evan. \"We're still the only slim studs in this city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger took another long sip of his beer, making a face after swallowing. When the bartender was out of earshot, he leaned over to the tiger. \"Hey, does this taste...off..to you too?\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion nodded. \"Yeah, fatties here can't even pour a beer right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stifled a laugh. \"Hey, let's go back to my place.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a subtle grace, somewhat resembling a seasick hippo trying to perform the ballet, the two tipsy felines staggered to their feet from the oversized bar-stools they'd been perched on - which, as per usual in this abnormal town, were wider than your typical armchair and seemed designed as if they were meant to cup yoga balls instead of furs - making climbing in and out of them a little cumbersome for someone the size of Evan, but quite suitable for the average <i>boulder butts</i> that frequented this tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle Matt affectionately slumped into Evan's shoulder, wrapping one of his arms around the lion's neck for support, grabbing his half-finished beer off the bar with the other. Truthfully he wasn't <i>that</i> blazed, even though Matt looked slightly flushed, a cute tinge of red spreading across his muzzle, it was clear he just wanted to get into Evan's personal space. The tiger was able to pack away <i>a lot</i> more booze than what they'd currently consumed before getting seriously impaired. Sometimes Matt just got a bit more 'handsy' and 'playful' after a few drinks, Evan had found that out from experience. <i>And there was no harm in that</i>! The lion thought; the odd slap on his rump, random kiss on the cheek, occasional flick to the waistband of his underwear... a few teasing gropes to his package... it was all in good fun, teasing, it didn't mean anything, ya'know, <i>bro stuff.</i> It's not like it was gay or anything, that would make it weird. After months of hanging out together they were both firmly established heterosexuals who just liked hanging out all the time, like bachelors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could stumble towards the exit, however, the bartender called out to them; a buxom, yet rather portly looking bunny with long blond hair and wearing a rather revealing tank top emblazoned with '<i><b>Big Jugs n Mugs</b></i>', the name of the tavern. \"<i>Ahem</i>, boys?? Ain't you forgetting something?\" she said pointedly, confusing the duo for a second. Her expression was hard to read, she was grinning slyly, but there seemed to be an undercurrent of annoyance to her eyes. \"Yer hot wings, fellas, ya'll wouldn't want em to go to waste now would ya?\" pointing down to a half finished 'Medium' sized bucket of spicy Buffalo wings, of course, Port Zaftig's definition of Medium was more like a Supersized Jumbo Sized. \"Here, let me top em up for ya~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan wasn't exactly feeling hungry after all the wings (and hot dogs and sliders) he'd eaten that day, but who was he to refuse free food? It'd be rude. \"Haha oh, uh, thanks miss\" Evan sheepishly replied, cradling the now overfilled bucket of pipping hot bar food with one arm. He'd take it home, but didn't think he'd really eat it, maybe one of his fatso neighbors would enjoy them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, don't worry bout it, <i>studs</i>...\" the bartender whispered as the boys walked out, fishing a mobile phone out from her purse to quickly contact someone rather important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt's apartment was only a couple blocks from the tavern, it only made sense to walk (with Evan doing most of the heavy lifting, as the tiger hung onto him most of the way), and on a nice warm night, with a shortcut though picturesque Nightingale Park, it couldn't be more perfect. Like a scene from a fairy-tail, the two big cats left a trail of breadcrumbs as they traveled, except with freshly cleaned bones stripped of all the succulent meat littering the sidewalk instead. Evan hadn't imagined he'd be eating many, if any, of the greasy hot wings, but Matt decided it would be 'funny' if he hand-fed the lion, smudging the sugary sauce on Evan's face until he relented and opened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had that same strange, kinda bitter taste of the shitty beer from before, which Evan initially decided he didn't like, but was kinda growing on him. One wing turned into a dozen, and by the time they reached Matt's place Evan had consumed most of the bucket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late, so it was a forgone conclusion that Evan would sleepover. Matt's apartment was a lot like Evan's own, it looked like it was designed for someone who weighed half a ton. A bizarre quirk of Port Zaftig, it always baffled the lion when he thought too hard about it... so much wasted space, so much luxury for cheap, but it's not like he thought about it often.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Matt flicked on his ultra widescreen TV to the sports channel and rummaged around the fridge for more snacks and beer, Evan settled down on Matt's plush zebra-print sofa, which was as big as a bed and shimmied off his too tight trousers, as they felt like they might threaten to pop at the front at any moment. The room was dark, lights off, and as Evan relaxed, bathed in blue light from the television, he decided to polish off the last remaining buffalo wings in the bucket. Greedily sucking down one after the other as he waited for Matt. Evan's taut shirt was slightly riding up his over-bloated gut now, which had become dotted with a sticky sauce stains that might be a pain to get out in the wash later. It almost looked like he was hiding a pillow under his t-shirt, but the crescent moon of exposed cream colored flesh revealed the soft, gurgling truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was still curious about the odd taste, he <i>still</i> thought it tasted a little unpleasant, but in a good way! It was almost kinda addictive. In the back of his mind he wondered if maybe Jugs n Mugs sold bottles of the sauce he could keep in the fridge to spice up dull meals. Suddenly, a loud <i>gurgling </i>emanated from the Lion's stomach, which completely caught him by surprise. Did he still feel kinda hungry? Really?? That made no sense, he could literally <b>feel</b> how bloated he was. It was a little concerning, but there were a few wings left, maybe it wouldn't hurt to just finish them, that might fix it... but maybe it'd be wiser to just put down the bucket and ignore it, watch some TV... Or he could ask Matt, and maybe get him to bring some snacks too?...</span></div></div>",

With slight trepidation, the lion eyed his rumbling appendage wearily, giving it a few nervous pokes with his fingers... maybe it was a trick of the light, but he could <i>swear</i> he could almost see his gut growing larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><i><b>BBBWWUuUuUuRRPPP!!!</b></i></div></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Matt cheered, a goofy grin on his face as the tiger proudly strolled into the living room holding a excessively large dish of cheesey puffs, a jumbo sized bag of ChoOroCream Cookies and a couple of six-packs of his more expensive imported beer. \"Dude, you probably woke the whole neighborhood up with that one!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small blush washed over Evan's face, he could hardly believe <i>that noise</i> had come from <i>him</i>. He was also feeling kinda stupid for worrying so much about why his gut felt big and weird, it was just gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt dumped most of his goodies on a small coffee table in front of them, quickly hopping up onto the couch and snuggling up close to Evan (but not before grabbing himself a beer and large handful of cheese flavored empty calories). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the hot wings forgotten, Matt and Evan casually binged on cookies, booze and chips for the next couple hour, only half awake as they shared each other's warmth while mindlessly watching some rerun of a football game. Some time during the first hour Matt removed his shirt, and pants too, leaving him dressed only in a snug pair of briefs and socks. Evan wasn't sure why he found that <i>so distracting</i>, after all, this was his <i>bro!!</i> There was nothing more normal than two men cuddling up half naked if they were best pals, like come on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were unusually ravenous, demolishing the first round of snacks, and the second, and making a big dent in the third that Matt had brought out. All around the couch was a sea of candy wrappers, empty beer bottles and some grease stained boxes that hinted that the might have once contained leftover pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the game had ended, both boys were <i>beyond stuffed</i>, basking in the satisfaction that their combined hedonism brought. But it was still barely past midnight, so they changed channel and found a dopey horror movie to half pay-attention too. It was about weird cults and demons and gods or something. Some poor unwitting furs had been marked as tribute to them to ensure a bountiful harvest or something. Evan honestly could not give half a shit, and didn't bother trying to follow the plot, he was more interested in ogling Matt, and how his belly slowly seemed to rise and fall with every breath... how the impressive bulge in his underpants seemed to be getting a bit larger. No! He had to switch from that subject! Thinking about his bro like that was weird! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Matt... uhh, did that sauce taste kinda strange to you? You know, from before?\" Evan asked, as Matt casually turned to Evan, seemingly eyeing down the feline himself.  \"Huh, oh you mean the wings? I didn't have any of those... you said they tasted like that crap beer from the tavern right?... That stuff was nasty, heh, why the fuck did you eat so many of them? Fattie~\" Matt punctuated his teasing by pinching a small roll on Evan's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion blushed hard, there was a sudden twinge of life between his legs. Crap, he couldn't get a boner right next to his bro! \"Uhh, uhh, heh, well it didn't taste so bad, it grows on ya...\"<br>\r\n\"More like it grows <b>this</b> on you\" Matt quickly shot back, lightly shaking Evan's gut. The Lion could feel a <i>surge </i>of blood rush to his loins. He was inexplicably, explicitly rock hard, his cock straining a tent in his underpants, and a few bullets of sweat started to rush down his forehead... maybe, Matt hadn't noticed? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, oh and what's this??...\" All those hopes came crashing down, as Matt casually grasped Evan's bulge, making the lion give an involuntary whimper. \"Evan, you horny?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh... uhhh...\", is all he could reply, causing Matt to squeeze tighter on Evan's cock, rubbing the head though the fabric. A needy groan of pleasure escaped Evan's lips. \"Ha ha, man, you shoulda just said so... I can help you out, if you help me out yo\"<br>\r\n\"B-but, I didn't think you were...\"<br>\r\n\"<i>What??</i>\" Matt hissed defensively, \"Hey, ain't nothing weird about this, it's just a handjob, just two guys helping each other out, so long as you know, balls don't touch, we're in the clear. C'mon this is natural. And we're both the only studs in this city after all...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan let Matt's words ring through his head for a moment, they didn't seem to quite make sense, but right now pleasure was ruling his brain, and he only knew he wanted more. He nervously nodded agreement, \"Eyy, that's a good boy, let me do all the work~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's paws were like magic. Delicate enough to feel silky and soft, but his grip was firm and made sure every pump delivered a fresh wave of pleasure. \"Just sit back and relax bro...\" Matt whispered, and Evan did as he was told, folding his arms behind his head and letting his tongue loll out of his mouth. He was so tired and bloated there really wasn't much more that he <i>could</i> do at the moment, besides the occasional moan in pleasure when Matt did that thing with his thumb, swirling it over the his sensitive head. Pretty soon pre was gushing from Evan's dick, lubricating Matt's grip and making him a bit more sloppy with his ministrations, but it didn't take long before Evan gasped, as a big thick load of pearly white cum shot from his well endowed cock, coating his belly in ribbons of the hot sticky substance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan almost fell asleep right there, before he felt a small slap on his cheek, Matt was flushed, and giggling, \"Nuh uh, you gotta help me still~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpent, and half asleep, Evan wasn't sure what he was expected to do, but it seemed that Matt was already had his own ideas. With a sudden unsteady lurch, the tiger rolled himself on top of the Lion, their over-stuffed guts pressing together (though Evan's gut was visibly more bloated). A bit of drool coated Matt's chin, and he <i>growled </i>with desire. Grabbing Evan's cock again, but this time sandwiching it against his own erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan just groaned, half in pleasure, half in exhaustion, he hadn't had a chance at all to recover from his last orgasm and he was still  so sensative. But Matt payed him no heed, desperately seeking to get off himself, clumsily frotting with the lion. It felt so good, but both of them so near collapse... In the back of Evan's pleasure dazed brain, a thought occurred to him, balls were <i>blatantly</i> touching, but for some reason he didn't mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Matt came, hard, followed by a second orgasm for Evan. And the two felines crashed into a deep slumber almost immediately after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The warm beams of morning sun rays penetrated through the living-room window of Matt's apartment, which, if one chose to look out of, would give any fur a fantastic view of Zaftig Port and it's majestic beaches. However, the sun, and the waking world, were not exactly a welcome sight to the messy, slightly hungover big cat lazying about on Matt's bed-sized couch, who stubbornly refused to open his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV was still on, he could hear it playing some zany morning cartoons, and the smell of deep fried food was in the air. Causing Evan's nose to twitch in anticipation. He licked his lips, and a rumble from his stomach indicated that he was hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Evan sat up in shock, and grimaced hard as his brain shouted at him for moving too fast. All the memories of where he was, and what happened last night came flooding back to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, you're awake!\" Matt cheerfully shouted from the kitchen, \"I was feeling lazy so I ordered in some CoUgarEats, I think they got my ordered messed up, there was like five boxes of stuff here... we got everything, pancakes, bacon, little hotel pastries...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that Matt had somehow woken up a lot earlier then he had, and had the luxury of getting showered and dressed already. Evan didn't <i>know </i>what to think about last night, it all felt so surreal, \"Hey uhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, don't mention it, that's gay\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason that answer was completely satisfactory to the Lion as he lay there, paws casually rubbing over his still distended gut. It'd shrunk a bit after digestion, but he still couldn't believe he'd eaten so much, he was surprised he was hungry at all. A small layer of extra pudge was stubbornly caked to his frame. It was subtle, but much to Evan's annoyance he actually <i>felt</i> fatter. He poked a finger into his bellybutton, it was startlingly soft and deeper than he expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perfect timing for Matt to waltz into the living room carrying a positively <i>overloaded</i> plate of breakfast goodies, and neatly placing it on Evan's lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... arn't you going to have some too?\" the lion questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>*urp*</i> Nah man, I've already ate, I feel like a <b><i>hog</i></b> after last night\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan felt his stomach rumble, and he nervously bit into a waffle drenched in butter and topped with bacon. It was horribly delicious. <br>\r\n\"Hah... I was thinking, maybe we should cut back a little Matt? You know we don't wanna end up like all the other beached whales that inhabit this city...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger stifled a snigger, \"Hey this is nothing. We can cut back tomorrow and go to the gym to burn off anything. We're <i>nothing</i> like the average fatso from here. Don't worry, we're still the most attractive studs in this city <i>and</i> we're going to stay that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, maybe you're right! Yeah!\", Evan didn't know why, but Matt's boundless optimism and confidence was practically infectious. He could always talk a Evan into agreeing with him. And what he said ringed true right? They could start their diet tomorrow, or even later this day! Just a few weeks at the gym (Evan made a mental note that he'd have to to join a gym) and they'd look as slim as the day they arrived in Zaftig Port. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now though, he could finish off this delicious looking breakfast... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lazy day for both Matt and Evan, they both had the day off, so neither had to rush off for anything important. That meant they could spend the next few hours just chilling, while Evan lazily demolished his \"well balanced breakfast\" even though it was well passed noon and it had so many salts, sugars and fats it would make any nutritionist scream. After his second, third, and <i>fourth</i> plate, Evan decides he is finally sated. His gut was almost as packed and round as it had gotten last night... Matt is looking smug, busy scrolling on his phone, while the lion was just <i>dreading</i> the thought of getting up, but he knew he'd have to do so eventually. But not now, and he drifts back to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours of rest. Matt his still on his phone, munching away on a pack of glazed donuts, while Evan is <i>somehow</i> feeling slightly hungry again. This is getting crazy. He whines to Matt, who just chuckles and dumps the remaining boxes of breakfast food on the couch for Evan to pick at. They're <b><i>big</i></b> boxes, and two of them are still virtually full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan somehow finishes them off in an hour. Now he's <i>unbelievably</i> stuffed. He hadn't finished digesting his <i>first</i> breakfast yet... His gut weighs down on him like a heavy medicine ball. Matt suddenly decides to give him a <i>\"Brojob\"</i>. Evan falls asleep again after climaxing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour of rest. The first thing Evan notices is his gut still prominently sticking out, an overstuffed dome of food and excess calories. The other terrible realization is he's <i>still feeling slightly peckish!</i> What's the hell?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's tempted to whine to Matt to get him more stuff from the fridge, but somehow he summons up enough self control to resist the temptation. He can't ask for something more from the fridge... but he's hungry... but his <i>diet. starts. now.</i>... but he's so hungry... But then the lion remembers something! The bucket! The bucket of wings he put down besides the couch, the bucket that still had a few leftover pieces!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith far too much effort than should be required, he <i>hurls</i> his overstuffed gut to the side of Matt's couch, and much to the Lion's delight, it's still there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with himself, Evan scoops up the bucket, and quickly brings it to his nose. It <i>smells</i> fine, despite being left out overnight. However, there is something else, besides cold chicken wings, that catches the Evan's eye. A business card. Stuck near the bottom of the bucket?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith deep curiosity, the big cat quickly snags the strange object out and holds it up to the light. It's smudged with sauce stains, but a few licks and they quickly come off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Levi Werbeck</font></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Club Immotus Movens Gym/Health Spa, a subsidiary of Episteme Labs</div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Manager, Personal Trainer, Recruiter</div> <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">(901) 227-885</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan tilts his head in visible confusion, what was this doing here??? I mean, it was pretty fortuitous that Evan had just started thinking about joining a gym, and suddenly he finds a card like this (to think of it, he couldn't even remember the last gym he spotted in Port Zaftig...).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly occurs to the lion to check the other side of the card. After a few more licks a bit of pen scribbling can be made out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>\"You boys look pretty trim, if ya'll want to make some extra money, why not call my friend Levi, he's looking for a few strong boys, don't keep him waiting\"</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress! She must have slipped this card in with the buffalo wings! Evan guessed he must have made a good impression on the girl, a bit of pride welling up in his gut. But who was Levi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Matt, come look at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan showed Matt the card, who was equally dumbfounded, he'd <i>vaguely</i> heard of Episteme Labs, but they were like, a medicine company right?? He'd never heard of Club Immotus Movens, and nothing showed up online. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, you think we should call? I mean I have been thinking about getting a little more buff... this could be good luck ya'know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan fiddled with the card in one paw, his phone in the other. It did sound intriguing, but it also sounded a little suspicious, <i>maybe they'd ask for membership fees and then ghost them!!</i> But it couldn't hurt to call right?? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few moments of deliberation, Evan finally decided to just call the guy, after all, the note said something about making a little money too, and even though his job at ManufactCo paid <i>well enough,</i> it was always good to have a little extra cash in the bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone ringed a few times, the possibility that they might not even pick up crossed Evan's mind, but after the forth ring he suddenly heard a click!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, hello?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hullo... Is this uh, Mr. Werbeck??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yes speaking, who's this?...\" On the other side of the line came a slightly gruff sounding voice, rather baritone. Not exactly the type of person you'd want to waste the time of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, sorry! My names Evan... umm, I got a card... uh, I mean like a business card, from thi- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you two must be the new recruits I was warned about! Call me Levi! You boys came very well recommended!\" Levi's tone suddenly changing into something a lot more cheerful. Evan wasn't quite sure what to make of that information, so this guy had been told about them?? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, yeah, we got your card and we wanted to know more about your gym... and uh, it also said something about making money??... What is this about exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, <i>okay</i> lets not get too far ahead of ourselves. Let me just give you the rundown, I operate what you might call a rather uh... exclusive gym. I'm going to need some <i>helpers</i> soon and I - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helpers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helpers. Look, I can't reveal to many details at the moment, until I know you're right for the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... okay, can't you give like a basic idea of what to expect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm, I guess I can say, the job is <i>easy</i>, you'd be helping us test a new fitness model we've been developing, you'd be representing our brand, you know, those kinda things. I can also tell you we pay <i>very well,</i> and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>-*uurrp*-</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-uh, what was that??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh, sorry!! Excuse me, I uh, just had a huge meal...\" Evan was mortified, but Levi only chuckled in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I was told you'd make a great recrute and I'm already convinced... oh, and I can also tell you, if you accept our proposition, you'll have round-the-clock access to our state-of-the-art facilities, and <i>other perks</i>. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, ok!\" This sounded like a pretty good deal already from what he could gather, they were looking for furs to influence social media or something. He could do that, easy. Plus, Evan would be getting a free gym membership <i>and</i> an quick pathway to shed his small muffintop. \"Hey alright, so where do we sign up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah not so fast, I still have to meet you guys first, gotta see if you have the <i>right qualities</i> to be suitable for our program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uh, that's cool\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call you back with some more details later, the meet up is in four weeks, don't miss it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what he said?\" Matt questioned, a curious smile on the tiger's muzzle, \"<i>Dude</i>, this sounds awesome, we're gonna earn money getting ripped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still a few lingering doubts in the back of Evan's mind, but Matt seemed totally sold on this idea. \"Heh, I can't believe you belched right into the phone, you fattie.\" Evan blushed hard, he didn't want to be reminded of that embarrassing faux pas. And blushed harder when Matt brazenly stuck a digit into Evan's exposed bellybutton. \"Heh, I guess this couldn't have come at a better time for you, huh? A few more trips to the buffet and you've turned into a lardarse like everybody else in this town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-cut it out, <i>hahaha</i>, that tickles!\" Evan quickly slapped Matt's paw away, and tried to pull his shirt down to cover it (but it rid back up just as soon as he let go).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe it'd be better if I go represent to Levi myself, and you can stay home eating burgers. You <i>are </i>kinda a glutton bro, maybe you were <i>meant</i> to be a big. fat. hog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... hey no I'm not!\" Evan shot back defensively, \"besides, you ate almost as much as me yesterday\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wha?</i> No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then explain this!\" Evan punctuated his verbal assault with a slap to the side of Matt's belt-hanging beer gut, it wasn't as big as Evans, but it was still slightly bigger than yesterdays (though truth be told they were both still a hard \"small\" for a resident of Zaftig City) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, I'm just teasing you bro, no need to get so worked up!\" Matt was suddenly keen to drop the subject when his own weight was involved. \"Anyway, if we <i>are</i> going to be in this program, for serious, we're going to have to start watching what we eat and working harder to stay in shape, we can't be rocking up to the interview looking like a couple of blimps, are you sure you're up for this?

Ugh, it still wanted food. \"Blah, I don't know <i>why</i> I've been so ravenous since last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a little weird, the first thing we gotta do is put you on a diet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, c'mon... Really?!\" Evan whined, pleading up at the tiger from his position on the couch. \"Heh, okay okay, first thing we do is put you on a diet <i>tomorrow</i>... tonight lets get it out of our system by going on a <i>mega binge</i>, so we won't be tempted by any junk food\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words sparked equal portions of excitement and nervousness within Evan, he knew from experience how much Matt liked to overdo things, this was a hell of a way to start a diet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked sly, and gently patted Evan's stomach,\"I've got a whole cake in the fridge, a big one. I didn't know if I was gonna need it. You 're gonna eat it. <i>all. of. it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo summaries the following events, Matt dumped a <i>wedding cake</i> sized confection on Evan's lap. And then Evan, despite the lion's weak protest, proceeded to consume, without aid of fork or spoon, slice by slice, over three quarters of the cake. Packing it firmly in his still breakfast stuffed gut. The last couple slices had to be aided by Matt himself, who seemed to relish the look on the lion's face as every last crumb was forced into his gob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, much to Evan's horror, Matt actually dragged him out of bed. They were going <i>buffet hopping</i> tonight. Which included a veritable smorgasbord of options in a town like Port Zaftig. The night was early, and Matt stuffed his face greedily. He was serious, his plan was after tonight he didn't want to even <i>see </i>food without it making him feel sick. After the first few buffets Matt was tapped out, too stuffed to even look at another corndog or baked potato. But Evan just kept going, and Matt was all too thrilled to keep enabling him. Whenever the lion finished an eye-wateringly sized meal and just wanted to sit down and rest, the tiger just pulled him to his feet again and dragged him to the next foodie hot spot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the night Matt had to rent out a mini scooter just to carry Evan back to his apartment - his stomach was so overly-stuffed he just couldn't lift it! It was mesmerizing, his soft cream colored stomach distended like a big food filled beach ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Evan and Matt woke up with a <i>major</i> food hangover. They didn't remember much after hitting the third buffet, or anything after getting home, but judging by Evan's sticky bed-sheets they'd gotten up to some frisky business, or maybe brought a pie to be, or both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they awoke the first thing that hit them was the pain in their heads, and guts, and everywhere really. They were still uncomfortably full, and judging by the soft layer of extra adipose that had accumulated on their frames, last night had really done some damage. Matt looked like he'd gained a whole five pounds, and he was the lucky one. Evan looked, and felt, liked he'd gained a whole twenty pounds. His gut still looked taut, but visibly softer, with slight droop even while resting. He had the beginnings of moobs, and his rump was noticeably fuller. He was a genuine tubby kitty, at least by the standards of anywhere else in the world. In Port Zaftig he still looked like a tourist, maybe an overfed one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his gut still wasn't done digesting. To add insult to injury the first thing he heard when he woke up was his <i>traitorous</i> gut <b>*rumbling*</b> for more food. Matt made him a 'lite' breakfast of scrambled eggs, plump sausages, a stack of hashbrowns, bacon (<i>lots </i>of bacon), and a blueberry muffin. It was all consumed readily by the lion not just to quench his seemingly ceaseless hunger, but relieve the pounding headache he felt after downing far too many drinks last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, as if it was a miracle, lunchtime rolled around, and Evan realized he didn't feel hungry! He still felt way past bloated from the night before (and the generous breakfast)! He was full enough to skip dinner that day as well. Though he barely moved all day to recuperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan didn't bother to question why, why was it was over, why had it started. The best he could figure was he'd caught a strange bug, something that made him eat like a starving lion for over a day straight... but whatever, it seemed to have simply passed through his system, and he was satisfied to leave it at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <i>real</i> diet started the next day. At Evan's instance (coupled with the added urgency of his recent weight gain), they refocused their efforts on slimming down and living healthy. Matt's crazy plan had actually worked, somewhat, neither of the cats wanted to so much as <i>step foot</i> in a fast food joint, at least for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first two weeks was filled with short exercise sessions, small portions and, yuck... health food. To the surprise of Matt, and Evan most of all, the lion found he was actually quite good at sticking to his new Healthy Lifestyle regiment, even better than the tiger did. Matt kept sneaking chips and soda during his lunch-break, and didn't make much progress losing weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the tiger was making some visible gains in the muscle department. Per Matt's suggestion, they both ordered some basic exercise equipment to fill their spacious living rooms. Lift weights, run on a treadmill while watching tv, that sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion <i>forbade</i> himself from eating anything fattening. No burgers. No ice cream. No pizza. Nothing fun at all. And it worked, in the first two weeks Evan actually managed to slim down slightly. Not much, nowhere near as thin as when he first arrived in Port Zaftig, but he could fit an few extra notches on his belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Evan's other meals were things like 'Spinach Guava Juice', 'Steamed Eggplant with Quinoa' or 'Bean Soup'. It all tasted horrible. After months treating himself to whatever he liked, tasting all the exceptional wares of this city, anything 'healthy' now just left a bland, boring taste in his mouth. For a treat he was allowed an apple. How could a <i>plain fruit</i> be considered a <i>treat</i>? Honestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was one thing he was still allowed, beer. That was the only luxury he and Matt decided they wouldn't give up, it'd be sacrilege!  But they <i>did</i> moderate their intake a little so they didn't go overboard as much as before - and they usually burnt it off later with a little <i>'physical activity'</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all sex counted as exercise - Matt convinced Evan of the benefits of 'upgrading' their friendship, for their health, and they were now now firmly in the category of <i>\"Fuck Buddies\"</i>... but in a 'no homo' sorta way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan would gripe and complain about the diet (and have vivid dreams about endless hot dog eating competitions and swimming pools full of chocolate), but there were some positive sides to his new lifestyle - he felt lighter, more energetic, and he certainly didn't miss waking up feeling like a sweaty stuffed pig after a night of binging. One of the biggest \"positives\" was the way it had <i>drastically</i> inflated his and Matt's egos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he ever needed motivation, he'd just hang out with Matt, and they could shit-talk all day about their co-workers, friends, people they saw the street - ruthlessly joking about the countless land-whales that they'd had to deal with. How <i>anyone</i> could live like them if they tried putting down the fork once in a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Evan's puritanical diet of mung beans and cauliflower couldn't last forever. On the third week his willpower cracked. He simply <i>couldn't</i> refuse the gift of freshly baked donuts from the cute baker girl from Apartment 702. It would be <i>rude!</i> And after the first one, and it was <i>so</i> sweat and fluffy and amazing, he just couldn't help but finish off the box. And buy another box the next day as a 'reward' for doing so good. He just rationalized he would exercise extra hard that week to burn it off, that was the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason though, Evan was suddenly finding he didn't have the <i>time</i> to exercise as much as he intended. Work called. Or there was a <i>really</i> good movie on and he didn't want to spoil it by adding the sound of a treadmill running. It really wasn't his fault when he ended up not using the expensive equipment even once that week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was faring no better. His equipment was gathering dust, and his snacking was becoming an 'every meal' thing. He'd avoid eating the healthy food he'd planned, because 'well, less food = less fat' in his mind, and then he'd go to work hungry and inevitably down multiple candy-bars before grabbing a burger on the way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the forth week it was hard to recognize they were on any sort of diet at all - at least one not comprised entirely of pizza, pastries and pies. They didn't lift a finger when they weren't at work or the bar. And any pounds they lost before came piling back, <i>with interest</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the day of the interview came, and as Evan's cab pulled to the curb of the mysterious location Levi had given him, the lion worriedly pondered if his all <i>hard work</i> and <i>discipline</i> over the past month had paid off - as he struggled to zip up the brand new red tracksuit he bought only a few weeks ago (and preceding to lick-off an errant dot of caramel cream from his thumb that was leftover from a jelly donut he'd consumed moments earlier). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was nervous to say the least, he didn't exactly <i>feel</i> like someone who would be picked to represent a gym. Whatever that meant.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The building was not what Evan had expected. Though he wasn't quite sure <i>what</i> he had expected. It was essentially a giant cube. Very large, tombstone grey and had a small pair of double doors on the front. But the building had no signage at all, and the windows were blocked out with paint. It was very secretive, you would never know this was a gym from the outside. Matt had arrived earlier, so the plan was to meet up inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior thankfully looked nothing like the outside. The lobby was shiny and sleek, like 60s space age decor. There was a pleasant, calming vibe to the building, though it didn't look like any sort of gym or health spa Evan had ever been too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the front desk, a rather bimbo looking receptionist was filing her nails. She was a Mink, with long blond hair and wore mostly pink. Her waist was trim, but her breast and thighs were <b>huge</b>, creating a cartoony hourglass figure. She had to have some sort of difficultly walking around with so much cleavage. Evan knew he shouldn't look, but it was hard <i>not</i> to stare when everything was so... <i>prominently</i> on display. With a pudding butt like that, this lady clearly only <i>worked</i> here, didn't workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh, another new recruit?\" the Mink spoke up, the disinterest simply <i>palpable</i> in her voice, she glanced him over \"Must be. You're the last to arrive. Go see Levi, down the hall to your left. Room 310.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed the way with her file, and the tubby lion thanked her for the quick advice before heading off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly found the room he was supposed to go to... it was a waiting room, full of a dozen other applicants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven was shocked, he hadn't seen a room full of this many 'normal sized' furs in months. In Port Zaftig it was a <i>rarity</i> to see anybody weighing under 300 pounds, and here was a whole room of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, he actually felt a twinge of intimidation. They were all men, many of them pretty buff, or thinner than he was. There was a good possibility he was the fattest guy in here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was sitting in the corner of the room, next to a empty seat, looking slightly less confident than usual, obviously trying to suck in his gut. Matt waved the lion down to sit next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, this is kinda bizarre\" Evan whispered, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right? Everyone can fit on one seat here\" Matt replied, \"Uh... I mean I guess that shouldn't be weird, but after so long in Port Zaftig...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan glanced round the room to study the various applicants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite him was a tough looking red <i>Kangaroo</i> wearing a loose singlet, he was super tall and very beefy, with wide shoulders, bulging biceps and a thick tail. <br>\r\nNext to him was a <i>Shark</i> dude, almost as tall as the roo and just as strong looking, he had a few piercings on his left eyebrow and headphones draped around his neck. <br>\r\nNervously sitting next to him was a much smaller black <i>Mouse</i>, with big round ears and peach colored mask of fur on his face - he was the smallest in the room and looked a little shy next to everyone else. <br>\r\nTo his left was a very average looking <i>Coyote</i>, chatting to a similarity average, albeit sporty looking <i>Dingo</i><br>\r\nIn the far corner was a rather stoic looking <i>Hawk</i>; slightly buff, wearing blue jeans and <i>most stereotypically</i> a shirt with the flag printed on it. <br>\r\nClockwise, to Evan's side of the room, sat a... Lizard? Dragon?? Evan wasn't quite sure what he was since he was wearing a huge leather jacket over where his wings might be. It'd be rude to ask. He was certainly big enough to be <i>Dragon</i>, with brilliant green scales and yellow underbelly. <br>\r\nNext was a jockish looking <i>Raccoon</i>, wearing a Letterman Jacket, he seemed pretty bored and was tapping away on his phone.<br>\r\nA well built grayish-blue <i>Donkey</i> sat next to him. He looked like a workhorse, with strong arms, a stubble on his chin, and a small gut. <br>\r\nNext to him was a smug looking orange <i>Fox</i> relaxing in his seat, he was very slender and wore a tacky, far-too-loose Hawaiian print shirt. He reminded Evan of a movie star. <br>\r\nA rather zen looking <i>Crow</i> sat in the seat besides him. His hair was messy and wore a rather baggy looking wool jumper that was well worn with age. But his ratty garments didn't conceal how noticeably fit the avian was, he was lean, but well built.<br>\r\nAnd lastly a slightly podgy looking white goat with short horns, wearing khaki pants and a black shirt. Evan deduced he probably was a gamer, due to the bold print 'GAMER' printed on his T. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen of course was Matt and himself, who were suddenly feeling like they might not be the only studs in town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkwardly long wait was filled with lots of small talk about the weather and local sport, as one by one the other candidates were ushered into the back office to personally meet with Levi. As Evan was the last to arrive, sadly he would be last to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally his turn came, and Evan couldn't deny he was actually a little excited to meet this mysterious Levi for the first time. Entering the room, what he saw surprised him - a very tall, and <i>exceptionally</i> muscular horse sat on an wide executive chair, behind a very expensive looking desk. He had light brown fur, a dark muzzle and a shaggy blond mane. He looked like a veteran gym junky, with massive guns and well defined pecks. The only part of him that <i>didn't</i> fit with what Evan's expectations was the extra large <i>dough-ball</i> belly that firmly sat in the horse' lap. He looked perhaps like a <i>retired</i> gym owner, Evan concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, you must be Evan\" the horse jovially called out, rising to his feet to shake the lion's paw (his bulbous gut brushing against the desk, pushing it across the floor an inch or two). His handshake was as strong as the rest of him (Evan had to wiggle his poor crushed fingers afterwards to make sure none had been broken.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now you're a good looking guy, Evan\" Levi proudly stated, blatantly gazing over the lion's body like he was appraising a fine specimen of farm cattle. \"I think signing you up is practically going to be a formality\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a good start! \"Heh, thankyou, I guess\" Evan sheepishly replied, a little bit of confidence returning to him. After seeing all the fitter/slimmer men waiting outside, Evan was worried this wasn't going to be a sure thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, I'm still not totally clear what I'll be doing here exactly?\" Evan inquired, taking a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well I'll tell you what I told everybody else, this gym was set up with a purpose, you've seen what Port Zaftig is like. Blubber-balls everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan nodded his head in agreement, but thought it was perhaps a bit rich for the horse with the boulder gut to say such a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are plan here is to start a fitness revolution. We want furs that can set a better example working for us, the best of the best. <i>Real studs.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was an odd choice of words, but the lion generally got the gist of it. \"Uhh, but Levi, I'm not exactly the most... um, <i>svelte</i> Lion anymore, are you sure this is the right job for me?\" Evan grabbed a handful of his gut and gave it a wobble for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevi almost burst out laughing, \"Compare you to the average joe on the street, you look like toothpick... and don't worry, our program is all about making furs like you bigger. Much bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh like muscle building?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was good news for Evan, one of the main things he wanted out of this arrangement was a program that could help him get really buff. And maybe something that would help him lose a few pounds in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...besides,\" Levi continued, \"it's all about the <i>mindset</i> really, our profile dosser indicates you, and your tiger pal are really prime material for this program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?! Dosser?... You've been keeping tabs on us??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we had to make sure you were the right man for the job. You wouldn't have been invited here otherwise. Don't take it the wrong way, but this is a very private organization, we can't introduce ourselves to just <i>anybody.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan wasn't sure what to <i>think</i> of that. It was a little creepy. Just what did they know about him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now all I need from you is to sign this contract.\" Levi continued, suddenly pulling out a monster sized document from out of a draw. <i>Oh crap</i>, Evan knew there had to be a catch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't give me that face\" Levi pleaded, \"Look this is just standard legal mumbo jumbo, you know, covering our ass over liabilities. I promise you, we can make you a very rich man Evan. You know, I can even hand over your first paycheck right now, in advance, <i>have a look</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse pulled a cheque out of his breast-pocket - that's right, Evan realized, they hadn't had a chance to talk about pay yet. The lion took one look at the figures written down and almost gasped, he'd be paid <i>how much??</i> Needless to say, this <i>vastly</i> paid him more than his job at ManufactCo. And this was just meant to be a part time thing, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're already running over time, Evan, sorry but I really think I need an answer right now. Do you want in? Do you want to become part of project Immotus Movens?\" The horse pushed a fancy golden pen into the lion's paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh wait, but I can't just sign...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now, it's easy, your friend Matt did it without any fuss\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did? A few alarm bells were sounding off in the back of Evan's mind, something wasn't quite right. But if his friend did it maybe he was overrating. And after all, he signs legal documents all the time, practically any time he updates his phone he's asked to sign some weird document... and that was a <i>lot </i>of money... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, big cat, nearly there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan helped Matt down the hallway towards his apartment. The tiger was having a hard time walking as he was stumbling around and tripping over his own feet. When they got to the door, Matt fished his keys out of his pocket and tried unlocking the door. On the fourth failed attempts, Evan grabbed the keys from his and unlocked it himself, leading the tiger inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home, sweet *urp* home!\" The tiger yanked off his shirt and undid his pants, tossing both to the floor, exposing his orange and black stripes and extremely distended belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past week, the two felines hung out a lot, typically at one of the local bars. Both would have drinks, but Matt would usually overdo it and Evan would help him get back to his place. The lion didn't mind. He enjoyed Matt's company and liked having a friend in this city. Plus, Evan would stay over and, in the morning, the two would go to a delightful diner, The Hangry Hippo, for breakfast where Matt usually tried curing his hangover with an ungodly amount of greasy food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that food and empty calories in the loads of beer he was drinking was having an immediate impact in his waistline as his stomach had ballooned out into a beer gut, looking as if the tiger was swallowed a basketball. It now looked like an overinflated basketball thanks to the uncountable beers he had that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion kicked aside the discarded clothes as he shut the door behind him. Matt, clad only in a pair of white boxers, sat on his living room couch flipping through channels on the television. Evan took off his own jeans and shirt. Both furs were comfortable with each other's bodies (\"We're the only studs in this town full of fatties!\" Matt had once said) and the apartment wasn't air conditioning properly so it was usually pretty warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling buzzed but not drunk, Evan made his way over to the refrigerator where Matt always kept the best beers in stock. One benefit of being friends with the tiger was that he always let his friends take beer. So the lion opened it up and grabbed a bottle of Sierra Madre IPA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab me a can of Schmoor's!\" Matt yelled from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you had enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hAvEn'T yOu HaD eNoUgH?\" the tiger jokingly mocked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan chuckled as he grabbed a can of beer for his friend. \"Hey, where do you keep your bottle opener?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, it should be...bottom drawer by the fridge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the drawer was a random mess of various kitchen utensils: Spatulas of assorted sizes, whisks of assorted sizes, most of a set of measuring cups, and at the very bottom was the bottle opener. As Evan yanked it out, a large plastic funnel fell forward from way back in the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find it?\" Matted asked from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did!\" Before Evan shut the drawer, he saw the funnel and had a fun little idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my beer?\" asked Matt as the lion walked behind the couch. He looked over to see his friend holding the funnel. \"Wassup with that?\" he asked, gesturing towards the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up for a little challenge, big cat?\" asked Evan, cracking open a can of beer with one paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second for Matt to understand as he glanced back and forth between the beer and the funnel. He smirked. \"It'll be just like college again!\" the tiger said giving his bloated belly a slap. \"Alright, let's fill up this tank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt leaned his head back and Evan placed the funnel into his awaiting mouth. As he slowly poured it in, the tiger started sucking down the cheap beer. Evan cracked open another Schmoor's readying it for the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>gulp gulp gulp gulp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn went the second beer with no signs of slowing down by Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>gulp gulp gulp gulp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan watched as the tiger's already rounded belly swelled up even more, his orange and black stripes stretching out further and further apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>gulp gulp gulp gulp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeer #3 down, on to Beer #4, and the lion could hear creaks and groans from the inflating stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>gulp gulp gulp gulp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's eyes winched in pain as Evan poured in the sixth beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>gulp gulp gulp gulp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was getting worried now. The tiger looked ready to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>gulp gulp gulp gulp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the funnel emptied one last time, Evan pulled it from the tiger's mouth. Matt gasped for air while running a paw along his ridiculously full belly, hissing in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... alright...your tur-\" Before he could finish his sentence, he slumped over, quickly passing out and falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The parking lot to the Super-D-Duper Mart was filled with anything but cars. Tents, banners, and furs of absurd sizes filled the space. GRAND OPENING read a wide banner at the front of the supermarket. Evan found a parking space a few blocks away and walked towards the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what's all this about?\" he asked a young but fat Golden Retriever who was wearing an oversized shirt with the store's logo on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's our grand opening spectacular!\" he replied. \"Free food! Free merch! Go around a take a look! And here!\" The dog pinned a button to Evan's shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI SHOP AT SUPER-D-DUPER MART AND I <b>ONLY</b> SHOP THERE, the button read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks?\" The lion wandered around the makeshift festive for a bit. The Retriever wasn't lying; tons of free food was given out. Burgers, hot dogs, ice cream, even those comically large turkey legs the lion only saw on television. He grabbed a couple of hot dogs and made his way through the crowd, quickly observing that he was easily the thinnest one there. Even the thinnest fur beside him was still double the lion's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the far end of the parking lot, Evan heard the sounds of cheering. Squinting under the bright sun, he saw there was a small stage set up in the distance with a sizable amount of furs surrounding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree furs sat on the stage, the table in front of them had an impossible amount of pies. While all three were quite fat, the grey wolf in the middle took the cake. Judging by the legs Evan could count sticking from under his enormous body, it looked like the fur was being supported by three chairs. And no wonder, the wolf looked like he weighed half a ton with his gigantic gut spilling out in front on him, pushing his fat thighs apart, and hanging just a foot above the ground. He looked to be wearing a black and grey track suit made out of a silky yet sturdy material. The logo on it, two Ws with a line in between them, could be seen from Evan's distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...is that...\" The lion turned to a chunky squirrel next to him. \"Is that William...uh, McDuffy? That competitive eater guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <i>is</i>!\" she squealed. \"Can you believe it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel's friend turned to her and said, \"He's probably only here to promote William Wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"William Wear? What's that?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Clothes for the huskier fur', I think that's what the stupid ad keeps saying,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the hu-\" But Evan was cut off by the roar of applause. He looked over to see the wolf, an innumerable amount of empty pie tins in front of him, face stained with red cherries. A heavyset ferret with a microphone took the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, you're winner, Zaftig City's own William McDuffy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf raised an arm that looked bigger than one of Evan's legs in celebration as he dabbed his face clean with a towel. While looking over his admiring crowd, he made eye contact with Evan, an intrigued look soon appearing on his face. Just then, two heavily muscled rhinos approached the stage and helped him waddle offstage and onto a motorized wheelchair that looked more like a short tank with armrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan watched as William spoke in the ear of one of the rhinos, gesturing towards the crowd. The rhino nodded and scanned the crowd through his dark sunglasses until he spotted his target. He made his way through the crowd, making his way directly towards Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. McDuffy would like to see you,\" the rhino said in a firm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" the lion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Mr. McDuffy's business. He'd like to see you now. But Mr. McDuffy understands if you are not available right now. So Mr. McDuffy is willing to host you at his private estate this evening. \"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wait...Willy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan couldn't believe it. The fur standing (or rather, sitting) in front of him was Willy (or rather, William) McDuffy, his best friend from middle school. The two met in sixth grade when they were assigned seats next to each other in Mr. Murphy's mathematics class and they were joined at the hip since. They always played together, joined the same sports teams, took the same classes, they even had the same crushes. But at the end of eight grade, Willy found out that he and his family we're moving around the country that summer. The internet wasn't a thing, and neither was social media, so their friendship quickly dissolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! I knew you'd remember!\" said William, bouncing up and down in excitement. The motorized wheelchair groaned under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, sorry for not recognizing you at first,\" apologized Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I look a bit different since middle school,\" he replied. Quite different, in fact. Both him and Evan were teased by the other boys for being so skinny, easy two of the skinniest furs in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll say. So, what happened after your family moved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things weren't too bad after we moved. I went to high school and met this girl there. Trish was her name. She was my high school sweetheart. We were actually together all four years. I even proposed to her on our graduation day! But shortly after that, she (for a lack of a better term) broke my heart. The next thing I know I'm face deep in a half gallon of ice cream. Depression hit me hard. I ate my feelings, and back then I had a lot of feelings to eat. But then something amazing happened one day: I entered a hot dog eating contest shortly after my 19th birthday! It sounds silly, I know. I actually only entered it because of the free food. The next thing I know, I smashed the competition! Soon enough, I had an agent and I was on the road from competition to competition! And here I now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I didn't know eating competitions could be so lucrative,\" said Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prize money can be good. But I also got signed for endorsements, advertisements, and hey, I've even got my own clothing line!\" He gestured to the massive shirt covering up his torso. \"And don't tell anyone else this but I just inked a deal for a reality television show: So You Think You Can Eat? Keep it a secret! Nobody is supposed to know yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it really looks like you-\" One of the rhinos interrupted Evan to whisper something to William. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Georgio is telling me that we need to head out if I don't want to be late for the autograph signing. Hey, why don't you come by to my place this evening for dinner? It'll be great to catch up with you!\"</span></div></div>",

It was early in the evening. The air was still quite warm, and the wolf had changed into an colossal pair of shirts, his upper body bare, exposing a sea of rolls and folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what's that?\" Evan took a sip of his rum and coke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm retiring. From competitive eating, that is. Not all of it, though. I'll leave the door open when it comes to major events. But when it comes to the smaller competitions, I'm pretty much done. I've got other things to focus on! My clothing line, my television show, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's good. But what does your retirement have to do with me?\" asked the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to sound crazy, but I want a...prot\u00e9g\u00e9. I want you to be my protege!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion choked on his drink a little. \"What? Me? Why? I've never done any sort of competitive eating! And I've never really been interested in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you have potential!\" William assured Evan. \"And you'll have me to support you! I can teach you all the tricks I know!

It's not like I need the cash anyways!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still, I'm not sure about, well...\" The lion eyes up William's naked torso, a shapeless blob of lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey wolf laughed, his whole body wobbling as he did so. \"You mean this?\" He grabbed one of his rolls and gave it a hearty shake. \"This is more my fault than anything else. I've never been that keen on exercise, so I didn't really bother with burning off everything I ate. Besides, not all completive eaters are fat! Haven't you seen Tajiri Hakimono? That guy is thinner than you and even he'll give me a run for my money! So, what do you say, Evan? Please?\"</span></div></div>",

Simply put, the lion didn't seem to have the stomach to do it; he didn't have innate ability to wolf down obscene amount of food like the wolf could. Sure, he was able to eat more now than he could before, but that was only a meager difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I could eat anymore...\" The lion pushed away the remaining quarter of the pizza William had made up for his lunchtime practice. The two furs were in the lush dinning room of the grey wolf's home. Being his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, William insisted that Evan move into the guest room in his Port Zaftig home, figuring that the lion would benefit living around his new coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Not another bite?\" pled William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion let out a belch. \"Not unless you want me to pop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey wolf drove his electric wheelchair over to one of the wide windows of the dinning room and looked out it towards the ocean. \"This...this won't do,\" he said mournfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I'm doing my best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I believe you!\" William said. \"It's just that... I'm thinking you might need a little more...assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what kind of assistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam turned his wheelchair towards Evan. \"There's a doctor in this city. You wouldn't know of him. But he and I have talked back and forth with about appetite stimulants. I could call him up and see how his research is going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, drugs? Isn't that going to be problematic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you use stimulants before a competition, yes. Then you'll be disqualified. But when it comes to training, any trace of them should be out of your system before your first meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Still sounds risky,\" the lion warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I was also thinking about bringing in Dr. Ruben Cioran. He's a psychologist who has done loads of work when it comes to performance and mental conditioning. I've done him a few favors, so I think he'll be willing to check you out.\"</span></div></div>",

The obese wolf sat in his wheelchair in a corner observing the situation in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arm, up.\" said Dr. Kirkpatrick, sternly and stoically. Evan obeyed, and the bear clamped the lion's bicep with a kind of pliers, taking note of the device's readings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Kirkpatrick, it's been hours,\" William chimed in. \"I'm sure that our friend here is more than healthy enough for whatever it is you've got cooked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, Mr. McDuffy, I'm the doctor and you aren't,\" he replied, not looking away from the forms he was scribbling on. \"But I do think there shouldn't be any issues. Turn that direction please.\" The lion faced away from the bear. Dr. Kirkpatrick reached for a metal briefcase. Inside were dozens of identical vials each with a small injector attached to the end. He grabbed one, pulled up the lion's underwear, and pressed it against one of Evan's buttcheeks. A click, then a stabbing pain. The lion yelped as Dr. Kirkpatrick disposed of the now-empty syringe. \"The glutenous maximus is the ideal location for injection. It ensures a slow yet steady released of the formula.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan pulled his underwear back down and rubbed the sore spot on his rear. \"Are there any side effects that I should worry about?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear paused for a moment, staring off into space. \"...No. Nothing that a standard, over-the-counter medicine can't handle. Now, come here, William. I'll show you how to handle these medical waste containers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unusual sharp, stabbing pain in the stomach woke Evan up that night. The lion groaned as he clutched his abdomen. It had been several hours since the first injection, so he reasoned that it might be finally taking effect. But the typical pangs of hunger wasn't what he was feeling. Food or medicine, one ought to do the trick.</span></div></div>",

Hours and hours were spent putting the lion through all sorts of psychological tests and evaluations, many of which Evan was unaware even existed. William held off on any sort of eating practice, arguing that Dr. Cioran's time was limited and more important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he can crack into the skull of yours, you won't even need any sort of practice!\" the nearly immobile wolf claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the evening of Dr. Cioran's final night in Port Zaftig, he arranged a special event. A kind of \"exhibition\", as he called it. Evan was called into the dining room were a venerable feast was laid out before him. Whole roasted chickens and legs of lamb. Honey-glazed ham and pot roast. And loads upon loads of stemmed vegetables and bread rolls. Sitting somewhat away from the table in his electric wheelchair was William who was receiving a lecture from the Doctor as the lion entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and so, with the right kinds of psychological condit-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, hush, Doctor!\" said William, gesturing towards the lion as he took a seat at the table. \"Evan! Just in time! The Doc was talking all about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse approached Evan, placing a hand on his shoulder. \"As I was telling you, Mr. William, with the right kind of psychological conditioning, nearly any sort of mental barrier can be overcome so long as one's physical self isn't harmed in the process. This is what I hope to demonstrate with the Subject-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I have a name,\" Evan chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...with the Subject here tonight.\" Dr. Cioran continued, ignoring the lion. From a coat pocket, he pulled out a small dinner bell, a bell that the lion had seen dozens and dozens of times over the past weeks with the doctor. \"Three rings! That's all it'll take!\" The mouse shook the bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ding!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan didn't know what to expect. Nothing from what Dr. Cioran told him in all of their tests and evaluations prepared him for what might come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ding!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion turned nervously towards William who was looking on with eager anticipation. \"William, I don't th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ding!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's eyes shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a second later, Evan awoke. The first thing he noticed was the intense pain radiating from his stomach. He clutched his abdomen, now rock hard and packed with a monstrous amount of food, a belly as if he were nine months pregnant with triplets. Through eyes squinting in agony, Evan saw much of the food that once ladened the dinning room table was now gone, no doubt sitting in his gut. Chickens were reduced to carcases. Legs of lambs were picked clean. Dr. Cioran and William stared at the lion silently. The wolf's face held a expression of shock; the mouse's a sense of smug satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, I think you did it.\"</span></div></div>",

The lion stopped receiving his texts when it became apparent William was far too busy for his former best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan never quite meshed well with Port Zaftig. He could never make any friends with the locals, job were strikingly hard to come by, and once the lion's savings dried up, he had no real choice than to move back to Bastion. This didn't upset Evan all that much; he wasn't leaving much behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis family and friends welcomed him back with open arms.

Celebrating on stage was an overweight orca with plump limbs and an overinflated belly. He was wearing a tank top, stretched tight over his stomach, with a logo: Two Ws with a slash between them. Onto the stage came a super heavyweight wolf, William, though he seemed to have slimmed down a bit, enough at least to let him walk onto the stage without assistance. The orca was handed one of those comically oversized checks for a quarter of a million dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should have taken Willy up on his offer...\"</span></div></div>",

The enormous grey wolf had invited Evan over for dinner, yet the lion wasn't sure why. There wasn't much conversation during dinner as William was too occupied devouring piece after piece of fillet mignon being brought up to his mouth by one of his servants, a small team of nearly identical and fit Dalmatians. Much of the evening for Evan was spent awkwardly waiting for William to finish his small fest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda, I guess. I watched Paw Trek when I was a kid,\" Evan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother of the Dalmatians wiped William's mouth with an elegant cloth. \"That's good. That's very good. Boys, leave me and our guest alone.\" Without a word, the dogs left the spacious and adorned dinning hall, leaving Evan alone with the half-ton wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyper-obese wolf stared at Evan from across the long dinning room table for a few moments before speaking. \"Have you traveled much, Evan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, not really. My family was pretty poor growing up so we weren't able to do much traveling besides going to family reunions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same. My parents were just over broke when I was growing up,\" William replied. \"Which was a shame. I always wanted to see the world, visit other cultures, see historical sites and whatnot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, why don't you?\" asked Evan. He figured he knew the answer, but he didn't want to blurt it out impolitely. \"I mean, you seem to be doing well with the mansion and clothing lines and ea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm far too fat to travel.\" The fat wolf stated the obvious. \"If I wanted to travel across the country, I'd have to hire a personal cargo jet to get me around! Far too difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why not lose some weight, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf chuckled. His jowels bounced around. \"Tried that. But for every pound I lost, I gained two in its place. And I'm getting impatient. I'm still pretty young and full of vigor. I want to see the world now! Not decades in the future when I'm finally able to fit in only two airplane seats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Uh, sorry. But I'm a bit lost. What does this have to do with anything about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam lended forward in his extra wide chair. A couple rolls of fat bunched up around his chest. \"Psychology has made incredible advancements in the past few years, did you know? It's hardly talked about, but they are now able to, as it were, swap minds between furs. That's what I would like your help with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Evan said, puzzled at the seemingly impossible proposition William was putting before him. \"You want to sw-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swap bodies, yes!\" William cut in. \"Temporarily, of course. Six months, at most. You're body will be returned in a fine condition, I promise. And you'll be rewarded quite handsomely. I was thinking six figures, but we can hammer that out later. Money is no object. I all ask is that we keep this between ourselves. I can set things up so you won't have to deal with any of my businesses and whatever. But you'll still need to pretend to be me while all this happens. I don't want my shareholders dumping their stock when their poster boy suddenly has no idea what his own products are all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all nuts!\" barked Evan. \"You can't possibly switch bodies with me! There's no way th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam cut in again. \"I assure you! It's entirely possible! I've seen the procedure happened flawlessly with my own eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you swap out with one of your servants? Those Dalmatians are skinny enough, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey wolf scoffed. \"I can't trust those idiots with my body,\" he replied. \"They'd probably hijack it and pretend to be me for the rest of their life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what makes you trust a stranger?\" retorted Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't necessarily trust you. But you seem to know little enough about my dealings that it wouldn't make sense for you to pose as me,\" he replied. \"You'd crash my businesses and lose everything in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's certainly true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you say, Evan? I get to borrow your skinny body and travel around the world, and all you need to do is relax and, uh, 'fill in' for me while I'm gone. All for a pretty penny.

The second attempt with the body swapping procedure had fail, sending several painful shocks through the lion's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have to be awake for this?\" grumbled Evan. \"William gets to be asleep for this.

He indelicately ripped off one of the electrodes, taking a bit of Evan's fur with it. The lion hissed in pain as the doctor reapplied it an inch from it's original  site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of tinkering, Dr. Cioran seemed pleased with his work. \"All is better,\" he spoke as he returned to his station where boxes of knobs and dial sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if it do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Evan could finish the sentence, the mouse had flipped a few switches which sent bolts of electricity surging through the lion's body. Evan shortly lost consciousness as his vision filled with darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister William? Sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan felt a nudge on his shoulder. Groggily opening his eyes, the first thing he felt was his body, particularly numb and feeling as if several wet blankets covered his frame. When his eyes adjusted, he spotted a youngish Dalmatian standing over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister William? Will you be having breakfast in bed today? I'm afraid your food will be cold by the time we transfer you to the dinning room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan immediately remembered the procedure, and the agreement he made with William, and knew the part he had to play. \"Oh, uh, yes. Yes, I'll take it in here.\" It was strange hearing a voice that wasn't his leaving his mouth. But then again, it wasn't his mouth to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sir. We'll bring it it. Give us a minute.\" The fit Dalmatian, dressed in a velvety maroon jumpsuit, bounded out the door, gently closing it behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan went to work examining his new body. He tried to sit up but the immense weight of his belly and chest made it impossible to get up on his own. Lifting up his paw, moving slowly and heavily, the lion-turned-grey-wolf poked and prodded any inch of fat he could reach. \"God, it worked...\" he muttered as he squeezed a ham-size moob. Soft fat oozed out from his chunky paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom door burst open and the four Dalmatians, all in matching maroon jumpsuits, marched in. Two pushed trolleys loaded with plates of sausages, bacon, eggs, and pancakes. Evan's belly let out a deep roar. He wasn't sure when was the last time this body had any food. Parking the carts next to the bed, the four expertly propped up Evan's gigantic body. The dogs did all the work. All he needed to do was feel his lardy body jiggle and shift around as it was adjusted to an upright position. Evan eyed the food as they worked. At first, he was shocked by the sheer quantity of the meal in front of him. But then he remembered the incredibly fat body he was now in possession of and became intrigued at seeing just how much his colossal belly could hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving propped Evan up, the team of Dalmatians assembled by the tray, each taking a forkful of breakfast in their paw. Lining up, the first Dalmatian held up a fork covered in limp bacon up to Evan's mouth. He felt a little uncomfortable with the situation; Evan had never be fed like this before. But knowing he was supposed to act, and eat, like William, he opened his maw and the servant shoveled the bacon in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next Dalmatian stood ready for Evan to devour some sausages. Evan eagerly ate those. The next approached with cheesey eggs. Evan swallowed those with gusto. And soon he was mowing down bite after bite of breakfast, a Dalmatian ready with another forkful the moment he swallowed. For nearly an hour, this process continued uninterrupted except by the occasional burp from Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his breakfast disappeared into his gut, creaks and groans sounded from Evan's oversized belly. Two of the Dalmatians turned to each other and nodded. One moved to the opposite side of the bed and yanked down the sheet covering Evan's belly, exposing an ocean of grey-furred flab. Before Evan could protest, the two dogs sunk their paws into his stomach and began gently massaging the mass. He groaned, and seconds later a deep belch rumbled out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good breakfast today, huh, sir?\" asked a Dalmatian. It was the one who woke him up in the morning. Evan recognized the small triangle of black spots on his left cheek. He held up some sausages and Evan ate without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of breakfast, two of the Dalmatians worked on Evan's overfilled belly while two fed him. The pairs would occasionally switch. While all were excellent belly rubbers, the Dalmatian he recognized from the morning seemed to perform his task with a particular kind of skill and enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was on the verge of a food coma when he finished the tens of thousands of calories worth of breakfast food. Without a command, a servant dabbed his mouth and cleaned him a bit, getting grease off of the furred that surrounded his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a nap, sir?\" One of them asked. Evan nodded. Or, he nodded as best he could with the heavy collar of fat around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team joined up and spoke amongst themselves for a few moments. One seemed to volunteer himself for something. The other three nodded and exited the room, carts in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar Dalmatian approached the bedside and resumed massaging Evan's blimped-up belly. \"Figured I'd help with this, sir, to avoid any indigestion or heart burn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...'s good,\" muttered Evan, drifting off to sleep as paws delicately ran over his new hulking belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting on the widest recliner that he ever saw, Evan watched television on the biggest screen that he ever saw. At his side was a small platter piled high with lemon cupcakes. While they weren't one of Evan's most liked flavors, he sussed out that they were one of William's favorite and figured that if was going to indeed pass as the obese wolf whose body he inhabited, he better learn to love them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evan shoved an entire cupcake into his mouth whole, one of the Dalmatian servants (Jacob, he had learned) walked into the lounge, phone in paw. \"Mister William? Phone call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woof iff et?\" Evan chewed for a second longer and swallowed the cupcake. Crumbs and frosting were smeared on his bulbous cheeks. \"I mean, who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dalmatian shrugged. \"Evan, I believe his name was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Evan reached out a pudgy paw for the phone. Jacob turned and left his oversized master in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, 'William'!\" It was weird to hear his own voice over the phone. \"How's things going over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good! Things are good! No problems here. How about on your end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I landed in Paris earlier today and now I'm having lunch at this fancy bistro! Just waiting for dessert and...Gar\u00e7on!\" William babbled something in French before returning to the call. \"Anyways, just wanted to call in and check up on things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like I said, the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn walked three of his Dalmatian servants, dressed swim trunks. One carried a towel big enough to fit over a car over his shoulder. \"Ah, Mister William? Your bath is ready,\" Jeremey (one of the servants) said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bath time, huh? I think you'll like it!\" William said over the phone. \"I gotta admit, though. It's great to fit into a shower stall again! It's... dessert's here! Gotta go! Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the better part of an hour for the team of Dalmatians to scrub down Evan's enormous body. But they were thorough. Every roll and fold was cleaned, even his most private rolls and folds. He had to stiffel a yelp of surprise when Evan felt his huge buttcheeks part and washcloth slip inside the crevasse. The Dalmatians showed no signs of embarrassment at having to clean those areas of massive wolf body in front of them, so Evan just had to go along with the program. Besides, the lion-turned-bulky-wolf would probably get used to the bathing situation over the next few weeks anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for the oils?\" asked Joey, the Dalmatian first met after awaking from the body switch. The Dalmatian team had finished patting down Evan with towels, drying him off. William's fur was incredibly soft and smooth. Surely the oils must be the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey led Evan, slowly but surely, into an adjacent room where a low, heavily reinforced table was. The Dalmatian helped Evan lower his gigantic body onto the table. He then walked over to a wall with row after row of various glass bottles of different colors and shapes. Thinking for a moment, Joey grabbed a greenish bottle. Returning to Evan, the Dalmatian poured a small amount of thick liquid onto his paws and began massaging the oil into the fur of the grey wolf's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan observed Joey as he worked the oil into his fur. The fit, young, handsome Dalmatian was still in his swim trunks. His toned body was quite the contrast to the hyper-obese blob he was massaging. While the rest of the Dalmatian servants were pretty quiet and kept to themselves, Joey was far more outgoing to Evan, often making sure he was comfortable and, more importantly, not hungry. Not wanting to lay in silence for an hour, Evan figured this would be a good time as ever for a conversation.</span></div></div>",

After all, that's why we're bunked here so we can be ready to help at a moment's notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What about any days off? Have you even gotten a day off or something?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dalmatian poured more of the oil into his paws before working it into the fur of the grey wolf's vast underbelly. \"No, sir. But that's the job, I guess. I knew that when I signed up for the job. I don't mind, really. I didn't have much of a social life before getting hired on, Mister William. Well, I do mind every once in a while. Like, one of my favorite bands, The Flaming Hips, are playing tonight. But I suppose I can catch them when they come around again another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, Joey? Why don't you have the night off? I don't think I'll need all hands on deck tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Mister William? What if the other guys find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just tell them you're out running an errand for me,\" Evan said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" The Dalmatian started rubbing Evan's grey fur with renewed vigor. \"Gotta get this finished first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of soft footsteps woke Evan up in the middle of the night. Though his luxurious bedroom was nearly pitch black, he did spy a figure creeping beside his bed. \"W-who's there?\" he bark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry Mister William.\" It was Joey's voice. He clicked on a lamp on the nightstand. Evan saw that he was wearing stonewashed jeans and a tight black T-shirt that cling to his fairly muscular torso. In his paws was a folded black garment. \"I didn't mean to wake you up. I just wanted to drop this off, you know, as a thank you for the night off.\" He unveiled the shirt he was carrying. On the black shirt was the stylized logo of the Flaming Hips. While the shirt was huge, Evan figured it wouldn't even come close to fitting around the huge body he inhabited. \"I got the biggest size, but I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lovely,\" said Evan. \"Besides, it's the thought that counts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey smiled as he folded the shirt back up and placed it on the nightstand. \"Well, better let you get back to sl-\" The Dalmatian was cut off by the loud grumbling on Evan's enormous gut. \"Sounds like you need a midnight snack, sir. I think there are some lemon cupcakes left in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...that sounds so good right now...\" Evan had started developing a taste for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll grab some right now, Mister William!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't have to call me Mister William. You can call me Ev-...Will. You called me Will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dalmatian smiled again. \"Sure thing, Will.\"</span></div></div>",

The Dalmatian walked besides the electric wheelchair that slowly moved Evan's immense girth as the two furs wandered around the mansion grounds. Frequently, Joey and Evan found themselves talking and touring the grounds. The lion-turned-fat-wolf certainly enjoyed their time together. The Dalmatian was entertaining company, far more interesting than any of the programs on the hundreds of channels William had subscribed to and often found himself watching. The other three Dalmatian servants grumbled about how Joey was skimming out on his duties to hang out with the boss. But eventually they stopped caring. The more time Joey spent with him meant less distractions for them and their own work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJude opened one of the mansion doors as the pair approached. The sunlight almost shined off of his velvet maroon jumpsuit. \"There was a call from someone named Evan that you missed while out, sir,\" the Dalmatian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he leave a message?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Well, yes. But I couldn't understand himself. I think he was trying to eat and talk at the same time. And he didn't leave a number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" Evan said, rolling past. \"He'll probably call back.\" Jude closed the door behind them and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the plan now, Will?\" Joey asked the obese wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan let out a yawn. \"I was thinking about a nap. I slept terribly last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. Let's get you to bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Call over some of the guys to help move m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I think I can handle it!\" Joey piped up <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan gave him a skeptic eyebrow. It normally took at least two of the Dalmatians to maneuver his massive body into his bed. \"Okay...if you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Joey was able to get Evan in bed by himself. It took some time and some lifting from awkward positions, but the Dalmatian was able to get the blob to bed. Huffing and panting, he helped Evan pull off the loose grey jumpsuit he was wearing. Evan laid nude in bed watching as Joey shut the curtains of his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you, uh, like a blanket, or something?\" Joey asked, while seemingly to nervously rub his paws together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. I'm good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, umm...sleep well!\" Joey leaned down to shut off the bedside lamp. As he did so, he swiftly move his face over towards Evan. Planting a quick kiss on him, he turned out the light and dashed out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...uh...\" Evan said to himself in the dark. Over the months of getting to know each other, it appeared like the Dalmatian had caught feelings of the obese wolf. He had seen Joey occasionally behave oddly around Evan and being around his crush probably was why. He smirked to himself. \"It's good to know my charm still shines through under all this fat...\" he thought to himself. But there was a bit of a dilemma of what to do. In a few more months, William will be back and so too will Evan be returned to his normal body. Any sort of relationship between him and Joey would be seriously compromised then. While he certainly would like to take the pup out, if anything became serious, Evan would have to come clean about the situation. Then again, who said he had to date him? He could always keep Joey as a piece on the side. William never said anything about not fooling around with a servant, after all.</span></div></div>",

Instead of the usual maroon jumpsuit he wore, the fit Dalmatian was wearing jeans and a t-shirt, both of which showed off his excellent physique. \"Thanks for taking me out! I had a really good time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two furs had the typical dinner-and-a-movie date. Or as typical it could be when going out with a gigantic fur. Evan felt a little awkward and self-conscious as he carefully maneuvered his wheelchair around the restaurant, occasionally bumping into tables and having to apologize to the other patrons. But soon, Joey had him feeling relaxed and at ease, laughing as smiling as he devoured all four of his entrees. Afterwards, they went to a nearby theater to watch the latest in the Knives Of Justice series. Luckily, the theater was quite empty so nobody minded it when Evan parked his wheelchair in the aisle. Joey sat in the seat closest, and it was close enough for them to hold paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a really good night too!\" Evan replied. Joey smiled and the two remained there, struggling to figure out just what to do next. \"So, do you want to g-\" Evan was cut off as Joey leaned in and gave him a passionate, long kiss. \"Eh, wow. You're a good kisser...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, thanks,\" the Dalmatian replied bashfully. \"Oh, I think the others are asleep right now. I'll help you get ready for bed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys can just leave the carts by the bed. I'll take care of things from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey commanded the other Dalmatians from the bed where he laid next to the enormous wolf. They did just as he said, leaving the carts of food beside the bed before shuffling off. It was strange at first, seeing their coworker snuggling up in bed next their oversized master. But they eventually got used to it, and grew to like how eager Joey was to help Evan alone when it came to things like eating and bathing. This left them with loads of free time that they didn't have before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun, Joey,\" said Jude. \"I'm gonna have a smoke break...\" He shut the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dalmatian threw the blanket off of him, revealing his nude sculpted body. Evan watched with lustful eyes as the dog slowly sauntered over to one of the hot trays and grabbed a sausage link. \"Hungry, Willy?\" Joey asked, dangling the link above Evan's awaiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could bite down, the phone on the nightstand started to buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey sighed, popping the sausage into his own mouth before handing the phone to Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan! How's it going?\" It was still really weird to hear his own voice come through the other end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Wi-...uh, Evan! It's going well, and you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going great! Just had lunch in Tokyo! Now I'm off to-\" William began prattling on about his trips and everything he's seen and all the places he ate. Bored, Joey climbed atop the obese wolf's body, straddling his legs on either side of Evan's enormous belly, and began rubbing small circles into his lard. This cause Evan to let out a groan. \"What was that?\" William asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nothing! Nothing!\" Evan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I'll stop boring you now. Oh, can you please arrange a ride for me from the airport next week?\" the wolf-now-lion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ride for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the airport! I'll be back from my trip!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's heart sank. \"Oh...it's, uh, been six months already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know! Time flies! Anyways, a ride, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, yeah. I'll set something up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! Ciao for now!\" He hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan tossed the phone aside onto his large bed and let out a sigh. \"What's wrong, Willy?\" Joey asked. The lion had totally forgotten that William's trip was coming to an end soon. That meant he'll be back in his own body soon. But sat upon his gigantic belly was a Dalmatian he caught feelings for in his short time posing as the wolf. Evan was unsure what to do. He could tell the truth to Joey, but William might find out he talked about the body swap process and refuse to pay up. And that's even taking into consideration what Joey might say or do. The lion then thought about keeping quiet about the whole thing until the end. He would get his money and...let whatever happen between Joey and William. The actual William.</span></div></div>",

He spent much of the day on the site and, lucky for him, found more than a few places that he thought would hire him. While it was true that the lion had enough funds to last him at least a couple of month in the city, Evan decided that it would be better if he found work sooner rather than later. Besides, he reasoned, if he found a job fast, he could use that saved up money on something fun instead of using it for rent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne posting he qualified for was as a data entry clerk at Qual-U-Tech, a technology firm downtown.

ManufactCo assembled loads of different machines and parts for other companies, and it sounded like they need a warm body to press the right button at the right time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpisteme was a research lab that Evan could figure out what exactly they researches. But that didn't matter to him. They were seeking a receptionist, and the lion was sure he knew how to greet people and work a phone line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, none of the restaurants or resorts for tourists were hiring. The only posting he saw was for a waiter at Z\u00e3f, a luxury restaurant. \"MUST MEET SPECIFIED PHYSICAL ABILITY AND APPEARANCE REQUIREMENTS\" the posting said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, a local pizza place called Purgatory Pizza was hiring a cook.

It only took him a couple of hours before he really got into the swing of things, and soon enough he was crunching numbers like a pro just on his first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled as Evan walked into the break room to take lunch. The only other fur there was an enormous snow lepard, probably Evan's age, easily past 500 pounds, his button-up shirt clinging to the vast curve of his gut, two chairs were parked underneath each cheek of his bulbous butt. Tufts of white fur peaked out from between overly stressed buttons. The lion gave the snow lepard a nod. He didn't return it, instead taking a massive bite of a burger. It was his third, judging by the wrappers all over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the fridge, Evan went and grabbed for his lunch: A microwave Shepard's Pie he grabbed from the grocery store on his way into work. But it wasn't there. Searching around, he looked for it all throughout the fridge, sure that someone must have moved it around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey,\" he asked the snow leopard, \"have you seen a...\" On the table was the tin pan the pie came in sitting empty beside him. \"Uh, I think you might have eaten my lunch...\" Evan gestured towards the evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing?\" he asked, glancing at the empty tray. \"Didn't see you name written on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan walked over to trash can; the green box the pie came in sat on the top. \"Uh, yeah it did.\" He held up the box. EVAN :) was written in big letter on the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow leopard shrugged as he swallowed a bit of his burger. \"Sucked anyway.\" He let out an enormous belch before going back to work on his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it too personally,\" said the heavy-set panda at the water cooler. \"Besides, there's no point fighting him. Toby's dad is a pretty big deal with the company. One call to Daddy Dearest and you'll be given the pink slip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shook his head as he took a sip of water. \"Still, you can't just eat someone else's lunch! That's their property!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panda shrugged. \"With Toby, it's just easier to find ways to work around him. Pretty much everyone in the office either goes out for lunch or packs something healthy since he won't eat anything green. I do the latter. Not like I'm complaining all that much.\" He tugged on his pants, showing how loose they were around his thick waist. \"Probably dropped 30 pounds thanks to that brat.\" He drank the last from his water cup before crumpling it and tossing it in the trash can. \"Back to the salt mines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan continued to stew in anger over Toby eating his lunch. From what Andrew had just told him, nobody in the office likes Toby or his behavior, yet everyone is too scared to do something. He wasn't going to let that fatty walk all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Evan walked back to his cubicle, he began having second thoughts. He needed the job and the money, and picking fights with one of the executive's kids wasn't going to help. Perhaps this was a blessing in disguise. Evan wasn't the best eater, and packing in healthy lunches would not only be more nutritious but also deal with the Toby situation.</span></div></div>",

The moment he opened the door, he heard a tragic moan from one of the stalls. Toby had been in there since lunch, and the laxative he laced his \"lunch\" with were still doing their work. As he washed his paws, Toby continued to bellow in agony. Evan smiled as the door shut behind him, though there was a twinge of guilt in the pit of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day during his lunch break, Evan came into the breakroom with a sackful of burgers from the Burger Barn next door. As usual, Toby was alone and currently devouring a small mountain of burritos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Evan said, holding up the sack of burgers up to Toby. \"Truce?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the obese snow leopard a minute to put two and two together and realize Evan was the reason he had spent half a workday in the bathroom. He grabbed the bag with a fat paw and looked inside. \"Fine. Truce.\" he muttered. From the bag, he pulled out a couple of greasy cheeseburgers and tossed the bag back to Evan. The lion almost dropped it. \"Take the rest,\" Toby said as he unwrapped a burger. \"Looks like you need them more than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shrugged before sitting down at the table with Toby. The two felines ate the rest of their fast food fest in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evan walked out of the Qual-U-Tech offices one Friday, he tore open his paycheck and was delighted to find that it was much larger than he anticipated. Examining the pay stub, he found that his hourly wages were set much higher than he thought he'd be getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did my dad, uh, 'fix' your paycheck?\" asked Toby as he waddled up to the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he...wait, did you have anything to do with this?\" the lion asked Toby, waving the check around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say I pulled a few strings. But don't let anyone else know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're secrets good with me!\" replied Evan. \"Wanna grab a bite to eat? My treat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, sure. But I'll pay more myself,\" said Toby. \"Otherwise I'd eat your whole paycheck away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two felines were at Purgatory Pizza with two enormous pies sitting in front of them. Toby had already demolished nearly an entire pizza on his own. Evan ate quite a bit, though his belly was started to strain the buttons on his shirt. But he had gotten used to that feeling. His frequent fast food lunches with Toby were starting to fill him out. And the lion ventured he put on forty pounds in just a month. This would have worried him had he not been in Port Zaftig. Even if he had several more months like that, he'd still be a wisp of a fur compared to the rest of the town's population. Evan carefully untucked his shirt, giving it a bit more space to accommodate his swelling belly as the lion reached for another slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when Toby was about to grab the final slice from one of the pizzas, a phone rang. The snow leopard sighed as he fished his phone out from the pocket of his tight dress pants. He glanced at the screen before answering. \"What do you want dad?...I'm having dinner with a friend, so I'll take care of it whe-...Yeah, I said a friend...Guy from work...Evan... Administration or something...I mean, I guess.\" Toby handed the phone over to Evan. \"He wants to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion was caught off guard, quickly swallowed the pizza he was chewing on, and took the phone from Toby. \"Hello, uh, hello Mister Toby's Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fur on the other end of the line chuckled. \"You're a funny one, Evan! You can just call me Edgar. Is my son being truthful? Are you his friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so. I don't see why not.\" Toby wasn't paying attention. Instead, he was starting on the other pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh blessed be,\" Mr. Edgar said. \"My son... isn't the most social boy around. Never had many friends growing up. Acquaintances, sure, but never friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he seems to be a cool enough guy!\" said Evan. At this point, Toby was eating slices stacked on top on each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This may seem unusual, but I'm passing through town on my way to the annual Qual-U-Tech shareholders meeting. Would it be possible for you and I to talk in person for a few minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure. I don't see why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, what's your address? My car can pick you up tomorrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the phone call was over, Toby had managed to squeeze himself out of the both and order another pair of pizzas.</span></div></div>",

In the back, the lion sat across from an older looking snow leopard, a spitting image of Toby sans several hundred pounds. The slight fur was dressed smartly in a business suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what did you want to talk about?\" Evan asked. He felt awkward dressed as causally as he was: Sweatpants and a red t-shirt that was failing to cover his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I'm glad that my son is finally getting out there and making friends,\" said the older snow leopard with a proud smile. \"He has been on such an antisocial streak that I fear that he'd be a recluse forever. But...my fears are not entirely absolved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure he'll make plenty more friends if y-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar shook his head. \"No, not like that.\" He looked listlessly out the tinted windows of his limo. \"Like any good parent, when I slough off this mortal coil I want my child to be well off. Toby is sure to assume my position in the company and I'm not sure that he'll b-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan cut him off. \"But Toby's pretty clever! I'm sure he'll do a fine job running Qual-U-Tech!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he can ever put the fork down!\" barked Edgar. He took a moment to recompose himself. \"I'm sorry for that. I mean, my son's waistline has been steadily growing for the past few years. He has not always been as...voluminous.\" From his breast pocket, he produced a photo and showed it to Evan. It was of Toby, years ago, thin as a rail, a soccer ball under one arm and a bright smile on his face. Edgar put the photo away. \"I doubt he can be an effective business leader if he eats himself to the point that he's stuck at St. Elmo's Home for the Mobility Challenged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah I guess I can see that,\" Evan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a rather, uh, thin fellow,\" said Edgar, choosing to ignore the gut the lion was sporting. \"I'm sure that if some of your healthy habits were to rub off on Toby, you'd be rewarded handsomely.\" The snow leopard gave Evan a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'll do my best, sir,\" Evan said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why the hell are we here?\" asked Toby as he and Evan walked into the Whole Tomato, a local vegetarian restaurant in Port Zaftig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you said I could pick, so here we are!\" he replied. \"Besides, all the pizza and burgers are doing a number on my stomach. I need someone green for once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby just grumbled as he looked at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later and both felines sat down at a booth. Evan had chosen a chef's salad. On Toby's tray were several tofu b\u00e1hn m\u00ec sandwiches. \"Those look good!\" said Evan enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better be good...\" grumbled Toby again as he took a huge bite out of one of the sandwiches. \"It's alright,\" he said through a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good!\" Evan began pouring some dressing onto his salad. \"So, I've been thinking about shedding a few pounds and thought that you mi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you and my dad been talking?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no...just that time at Purgatory...\" lied Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese snow leopard rolled his eyes. \"He's always trying to convince me to lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's so bad about that?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby huffed. \"He's trying to control what I eat and do even though I'm not under his thumb anymore. He was a total dictator when it came to food while I was growing up. I got grounded if I complained about eating vegetables, wasn't allowed candy even on Halloween, hell, I didn't have a proper birthday cake until I was 19.\" Toby ate the rest of his first sandwich in a couple more bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Damn...\" Evan felt less sure about helping Edgar slim Toby down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now I eat whatever I want, whenever I want. And he can't do anything about it. He said he'd cut off my inheritance if I don't get skinny again, but I know what grandpa's will said and he don't have that much control of the money. The last couple of years he's back off, but I know he wants some way of controlling what I eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing what Toby had to say about growing up with a father so strict when it came to food, he was no longer so eager to help his son lose weight. In fact, Edgar seemed to be using Evan as a pawn to control his son from afar. Then again, Toby was pretty tubby. And if he keep eating the way he does, the snow leopard would be a blob in a few years.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The old, blue shirt Evan decided would now be he workout shirt rode up a bit, exposing a few inches of his belly. The lion didn't bother fighting it anymore; it just kept riding up again no matter how many times he tugged it down. Besides, he was more bothered by how his grey cotton shorts kept riding up on him, giving him quite the wedgie. He worried about how he would deal with that during their run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Toby changed into his workout clothes, the lion wandered around the snow leopard's apartment. Plastered all over the walls were posters of models and athletes, male and female, in seductive poses showing off their trim muscles and flat tummies. One such poster hung prominently over Toby's extra wide couch. A grey lion laid clad only a Speedo which showed off an impressive bludge, six-pack abs and cut thigh muscles, and a stoic expression on his rather handsome face. JAKE MCCARTHY it said in the lower right corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan took a mental note. Toby certainly seemed to enjoy looking at fit furs, and maybe he could use that knowledge later on to his advantage, perhaps to convince the rotund feline to spring for a gym membership or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Toby waddled into the living room. The black sweatsuit he wore was rather unflattering. Clinging to every roll and bludge of his body, the top failed to completely cover up the big cat. An equator of white fur peaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get this over with,\" grumbled Toby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two furs were at a nearby park. It was early in the evening. The sky was a dark shade of purple and the air was light and chill. Perfect weather for a jog. Or, at least, jogging is what Evan planning on doing. While Toby gasped and huffed as he shuffled his body in what a fur his size could call a jog, the lion found himself walking beside the snow leopard at a snail's pace. Being much smaller, Evan found himself leaving Toby behind in the dust even after a few seconds of jogging. Not wanting to make Toby feel bad on his first run in a very long time, Evan stuck beside him even though it meant not jogging at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly 45 minutes for Toby to make one lap around the park, a circuit Evan figure he himself could do in under fifteen minutes. Panting, sweat pouring from his forehead, Toby jogged past the park entrance and thus beginning his second lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Evan was confident that he didn't necessarily need to babysit the obese feline the entire time. \"Okay, uh, catch up with you in a bit, big guy! It looks like you got this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...kay...kay...\" huffed Toby, waving a paw in Evan's general direction. The lion watched the enormous snow leopard disappear around the bend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the street from the park, Evan spotted a brightly lit sign. <b>PORT ZAFTIG CREAMERY</b>, an ice cream shop. The lion licked his lips. A scoop of chocolate ice cream or three certainly sounded good right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his lunch break that Monday, Evan was pleased to see that Toby had ditched his typical meal of thousands of calories worth of fast food and had opted for a salad. \"Looks good!\" Evan said about the snow leopard's lunch as he popped leftover pizza into the microwave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I guess.\" Toby grumbled as he stuck a forkful of lettuce leaves into his mouth. His white button-up shirt didn't looked as incredibly tight on him, the lion noticed. Evan figured that even making a few minor changes to Toby's grease-soaked diet would have an immediate impact on his waistline. Toby must have dropped a dozen pounds since starting his diet. \"Why am I doing this again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, so you don't have a heart attack before you turn 30,\" remarked the lion. The microwave dinged <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been thinking about getting into weight lifting,\" Toby said as Evan sat down to join him. \"Found out there's a gym not far from my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thaffs goot!\" Evan struggled to say through a mouthful of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm kinda nervous though. I haven't been to a gym in a while. Wanna come with? I think I can get you in for free for a couple of days if I get a membership.\"</span></div></div>",

The snow leopard flexed an arm in one of the gym mirrors. Though still heavily covered in pudge, the lion could make out the beginnings of a small bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down through the park, belly bouncing out of his workout shirt yet again, he made his way to one of the drinking fountains. Dipping a paw into the stream of water, he dabbed his forehead. He then ran in place for a minute, cursing as his shorts dug themselves deeper into the crack of his bubble butt. Turning on the camera on his phone, he snapped a selfie of himself, giving Toby a thumbs up. Convinced that it would fool the snow leopard, he sent the photo. Wiping off his forehead and yet again digging out his shorts from his rear, Evan left the park and made his way over to the Port Zaftig Creamery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your usual, Evan?\" asked the portly Corgi manning the shop as the lion parked himself down on a stool in front of the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Well, make it a large today, Davie!\" said Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Large it is!\" The Corgi replied, wondering when Evan would start ordering his ice cream extra large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting himself into Toby's apartment, Evan was surprised to see not Toby but a zebra sitting on his couch. A messy mane of black hair, he had meaty pecs, bludging biceps and triceps, and a ball gut big enough to stretch his tank top tight and force his defined quads apart as it jutted out in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi?\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra turned to face Evan, eying the pudgy lion's body. \"Hey...you're, uh, Evan, right? Toby told me ab-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby waddled into the living room with a wide scale in his paws. Wearing just a loose pair of boxer shorts, the snow leopard's belly wobbled and bounced around. Evan immediately noticed that while Toby was still several times larger than him, his belly was evidence that the big cat had shed quite a few pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good!\" said the zebra. \"Sure you won't break this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, Mac,\" Toby shot back. \"This one can handle 700 pounds so I'm sure tha-\" He spotted Evan. \"Oh, Evan! Good timing! I was just about to check my weight! Oh, and this is Mac. He's been helping me with figuring out weight lifting and stuff at the gym. Mac, this is Evan. He's helping me slim down a bit, though he's more into jogging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, a real cardio bunny, huh?\" Mac said. Evan ignored the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the scale on the floor, Toby eagerly stepped on it. Mac checked the number on account of the snow leopard's gut being to vast to see past. \"It says...522.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Down nearly twenty pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done!\" Evan congratulated Toby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you're turn Evan!\" Mac said, gesturing for the lion to hop on to the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...I'm good! I don't ne-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Let's see how much you've lost!\" Toby egged him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan began protesting. But Mac with his mighty muscles buffaloed the chubby lion onto the scale. He was grateful that the zebra didn't yank off the bulky hoodie or baggy sweatpants Evan was relying on to cover his flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it say, Mac?\" asked Toby excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...251!\" declared Mac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan tried not to make it obvious that he had been shocked by the number. He knew that his weight was getting a bit out of hand. But the lion didn't think he had gained <i>that</i> much, nearly a hundred pounds since moving to Port Zaftig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" Toby said, giving Evan a pat on the back. \"That's loss of...wait, what did you weigh before? I don't think we checked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...268,\" Evan lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Huh, didn't think you were that heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...just dense, I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dense, huh?\" Mac asked, raising an eyebrow skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was shocked to see how fat he had gotten and immediately made plans to turn his gain around before he got completely massive. This meant no more ice cream and actually exercising. The lion knew his fat ass needed to get back into jogging. Hell, Mac seemed to have helped Toby drop some weight. Maybe the zebra would be willing to help Evan too.</span></div></div>",

The lion sat up on the bench as he stretched his arms out. He could feel his biceps burn, but it was the good kind of burn. The zebra had certainly showed to Evan why he could charge what he charged. In the little time they've been seeing each other, the lion had already put on some decent muscles. His arms and legs were bulkier with muscle, and his chest and butt (both still sizable) were less lard and more beef. His doughy belly had deflated slightly. While Evan wasn't absolutely sure that he dropped any pounds, the lion was certain he packed on some noticeable muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're done?\" asked Evan. \"Then I'm gonna hit the showers.\" He groaned as the lion got back onto his feet, grabbing his towel from the floor and using it to dry his sweat-soaked forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, before you go, have you heard from Toby at all?\" asked Mac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.

Tomorrow was the day Evan would really start jogging again. One more sundae wouldn't hurt, the lion reason.

I'll need something from you,\" Mac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here. Let's discuss this somewhere else.\" He grabbed a napkin from the dispenser and pulled a pen from his shorts pocket. \"Ever been to the Old Cheesecake Factory? Good food. Tomorrow at 7pm. Here's the address.\" Mac slid the napkin over towards Evan who shoved it into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavie waddled up and set the massive sundae in front of the zebra. \"Here you go!\" He grabbed the empty dish in front of Evan and waddled into the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac slid the sundae over to Evan before getting up from the stool. \"Here. My treat.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Evan left the Old Cheesecake Factory, the poor lion was stuffed to the brim. Rather than coming in ready to talk, he walked in to see Mac sat at a table in the corner of the restaurant. Several plates of appetizers and a couple of entrees were waiting for him. The buff zebra beckoned Evan to eat, and so Mac watched on as bit by bit the entire tables-worth of food filled his belly. Mac simply watched, an occasional grunt came from the heavy zebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac invited him out again and again and again. Each time, they met at a restaurant and each time the zebra had a collosal amount of food waiting for Evan. He would be commanded to eat and he would eat, eager not to let displease Mac and ruin his chance at getting some serious cash from Toby's dad. The snow leopard was slimming down fast and packing on some serious muscle too. Edgar would surely reward the lion handsomely for motivating his son to lose weight. And every time they met, the zebra simply watched the lion gorge himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Tuesday morning at work, Evan sat at his desk typing away at his keyboard. He stifled a burp; the lion still felt full from last night. Mac brought him to a burrito place where he was made to devour several enormous burritos. The buttons on his shirt strained against his billowing gut. Evan chalked it up to being so bloated, but deep down he knew he'd be needing to size up. He was just worried about seeing how big all of his meals from Mac were making him. The plump lion hadn't weighed himself in weeks. But judging by the ball of lard slowly taking over his lap and thick thighs and bubble butt stretching his pants to their limit, judging by his awkward waddle he had developed, judging by how quickly out of breath even the easiest tasks made him, Evan ventured he must have crossed over 300 pounds long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doughnut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan twisted around to see Toby behind him, holding open a bright pink box full of treats. The lion grabbed a few. As he did so, he noticed how loose Toby's dress shirt was getting on him though his muscled biceps nearly explode out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" said Evan, before shoving a doughnut into his greedy maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Toby said. \"So, uh, how's the diet going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...great! It's going great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Because you're looking pretty...\" The snow leopard's eyes wandered down towards Evan's ballooning gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I'm...uh, bulking! You know, bulk and cut and all that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby raised a skeptical eyebrow. \"...is that so? Well, hopefully you get around to cutting pretty soon.\" He turned his large body around and waddled back down towards his cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan let out a sigh. As he stared as his pillowly paunch, the lion knew something needed to be done. Unless he spoke to Mac about what the zebra was up to, he'd be bigger than Toby ever was in no time. But if he opened up to Toby about what has been happening to him, the snow leopard might have an idea about what to do.</span></div></div>",

He stretched a bulky, muscly arm across the back of the couch. \"Well, well, sounds like you have a particular financial interest in making sure our mutual friend of ours trims down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And now it's your turn to explain...well...why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I've been feeding you so much? Taking you out and making you eat to the point of bursting? Making you turn into a blimp of a lion?\" Evan shyly nodded. Mac's eyes wandered down to the mass of flab that made up the lion's stomach. He tugged down on his shirt when he saw Mac stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you call it. But yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I loaded this up when I found out you were coming over. Here. Watch.\" Grabbing a remote from the coffee table, Mac clicked on the television. Paused on the screen was, from what Evan could tell, some kind of old cartoon show. The zebra hit the play button as THE LOONY LION popped up. Suddenly, the lion realized what it was. The Loony Lion was a fairly popular cartoon back when he was growing in Bastion. But it was on the cable channels, channels his parents couldn't afford.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two furs watched in silence was the episode played. Evan thought the plot was kind of dumb. The Loony Lion had a sudden bill to pay but no money to pay it with. While walking down the road, he sees a flyer for a sumo wrestling contest. As he signs up, the Loony Lion sees all of the other furs signing up to be be twice or three times as fat as he is. Through happenstance, the lion is able to find enough food to bulk up. And on the first day of the tournament, he arrives weighing a quarter ton. His globular gut taking up most of the screen as he waddles through the door and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Right there.\" Mac paused the episode as the Loony Lion is showing off his new, enlarged form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what? What am I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where it all started,\" the zebra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where what started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My obsession for all things fat felines. Big cats. Sumo-size...\" Mac grunted as he glanced back onto the screen. He tore himself away a moment later. \"You see, some time ago, I finally decided that I'm going to get a fat feline in my life. And I was lucky when our friend Toby waddled his fat ass into the gym. But he seemed adamant about losing weight, and I couldn't walk away from his offer to pay triple my rate. I was able to admit defeat when I see your plump butt wander into Toby's apartment and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to stop you there,\" Evan cut it. \"I see where you're going! I'm not going to be a fatty just so you can get your rocks off over some weird thing you're into!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac chuckled as he scooted closer to Evan. The zebra tried to grab a roll of belly fat, but the lion slapped the beefy zebra's hoof away. \"Yes, you are,\" he moaned. \"I'm getting a big cat. And it's either going to be you or Toby. And since you need our fat snow leopard friend to slim down, I don't you have much of a choice. I can ruin Toby's diet like *that* and you'll be left chubby and broke instead of fat and rich. Come on, Evan. It won't be so bad. I'll get you one of those cute sumo diapers things you can grow into...\"</span></div></div>",

Thick ropes shot from Mac's cock as his hoof worked harder, landing all over Evan's bare belly and chest. The lion averted his eyes, not wanting any to hit him in the face. Just a few more seconds and he knew he'd be able to take off the bright pink loincloth and shower off Mac's jizz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Mac finished. The bulky zebra sat nude on the edge of his bed, his cock now deflating, dripping. \"Fuck...still hot...\" he panted. \"Now shower off. I've got a cheesecake in the fridge waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his queue, Evan began tugging the loincloth off. He danced around, digging the material out from his rump, shimming the garment down his thick thighs, panting and grumbling the entire time. Mac watched as the lion's entire body jiggled about and felt his cock stiffed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan kicked the loincloth to a corner of the room. He felt Mac yanked his tail, pulling the lion back towards the zebra. A hoof slapped Evan's bulbous rear hard. The two doughy masses wobbled around violently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changed my mind,\" grunt Mac. \"I'm ready for Round 2. Whadda say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed once more. \"The Loony Lion is ready for action...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his work clothes so tight they look painted on, an ass so wide his office chair was starting to give way, and a belly constantly grumbling for treats, Mac's frequent feedings were really taking a toll on Evan's waistline. The lion crammed a protein bar down his throat, hoping it would quell his stomach. Glancing over his shoulder to make sure nobody was watching, his swiftly undid the buttons of his slacks. He sighed as his belly swelled out an extra inch or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I need a bigger wardrobe...and a bigger chair,\" muttered Evan, shifting his hips as they rubbed against the armrests of his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it had hardly been more than a month since he agreed to plump up for Mac, the zebra had taken full advantage of the situation. Often, the lion would be called over to his apartment where Mac would have a venerable feast waiting for him. After several hours of feeding, they would go back to Mac's bedroom where the zebra would strip nude and Evan would put on the sumo loincloth. He'd pretend to be the fattened up Loony Lion, just like from the cartoon, and Mac would jerk himself off. Luckily, that was as much they did sexually. However, the zebra was taking more liberties with touching and caressing Evan's rear, and the lion worried Mac would want to do something much more intimate with his Loony Lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's gut grumbled once more. Another protein bar went down the hatch. He moaned as he did so. Each treat was pushing him closer and closer to 350 pounds, making him nearly triple in size from when he first arrived at Port Zaftig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mac's obsession with the Loony Lion is going to get me fucking huge...\" Evan thought to himself. Suddenly, he was struck with an idea. Opening a private browser, he searched for the episode list of The Loony Lion. If the zebra was really that enamored with the show, Evan might find something to use against Mac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were thousands of episodes. Evan skimmed through the episode titles. He was lucky to find a couple that sounded relevant.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On his way to the Qual-U-Tech break room, Evan adjusted his tight slacks. It had been several weeks since Mac stopped with his plan of fattening the lion up. Unfortunately, Evan's weight hadn't dropped considerably. Despite his best effort to lose weight through a healthy diet and plenty of exercise, the stubborn pounds clung to his gelatinous gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby was alone in the break room. This didn't surprise Evan. The snow leopard had become a fixture of the room in recent weeks. He doubted Toby even bother to do any of his regular duties opting to instead spend the workday stuffing himself in the break room. All of the other furs who worked in the Qual-U-Tech offices were annoyed that one of their own was slacking off so obviously. Yet they all knew he was the son of the boss and it would be better to not cause a fuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey Toby,\" Evan said as he approached the fridge to get his veggie sandwich. The table in front of him was littered with fast food wrappers from any and all the nearby joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow leopard only grunted in response as he bit into a greasy bacon cheeseburger. Drops of oil of fat dripped on to Toby's shirt. Evan couldn't help but notice how incredibly tight it was on him. The tent-like shirt looked ready to explode off of the big cat, sending buttons flying all over the place. The pudgy lion figured that might just happen by the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...still hanging out with Mac?\" Evan asked. He knew the answer. Of course Toby was still hanging out with Mac. Except instead of helping the snow leopard with his weight lifting, the zebra was working on Toby's weight gaining. The lion was unsure exactly how Mac was doing it, but he was doing it well. Toby practically blew up again. In no time, he had regained all the weight he had lost plus nearly a hundred more pounds more. Each morning, Toby would sluggishly waddle into the offices wearing clothes that look painted on his flabby body. It took nearly fifteen minutes for him to haul his huge body upstairs, and when he did Toby would devour an entire box of doughnuts on his own while panting to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Evan had known Toby for a short time, the snow leopard was the fattest, laziest, and most out-of-shape the lion had ever seen him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Go out to eat a lot.\" Toby shoved the last of the burger into his mouth. Ketchup stained his mouth. He wiped it away for going for another burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...feeling hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But my dad wants to take me to dinner. Probably some salad bar bullshit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan gulped. In the weeks after last seeing Mac, he had totally forgotten about the handshake agreement he made with Toby's father Edgar. The elder fur, the lion reasoned, is probably expecting to see his son at least slightly smaller. Unfortunately, Edgar is going to have dinner with his son at his absolute fattest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, have fun...and, uh, tell your dad I said hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Evan wouldn't hear about Toby's dinner with his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the lion awake to an email on his phone. <b>NOTICE OF TERMINATION</b> the subject line said. In a panic, Evan quickly skimmed through the email. From what he could make out from all the legalese, he was being fired from Qual-U-Tech for some sort of insubordination, yet it never laid out any specific details. At the end of the email was a signature from a fur he recognized; Edgar had personally signed off on the firing.</span></div></div>",

Stretch those spots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fork scrapped against the plastic cake tray as Toby shoveled the last slice of the rich, chocolately cake into his mouth. The snow leopard groaned as he worked his jaws. Reaching for the nearly empty jug of milk on Evan's coffee table, he took a sip before he resumed chewing. Toby swallowed, then let out a burp before tossing the plastic cake tray onto the pile of empty trays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got room for another?\" asked Evan, gesturing towards the last vanilla cake sitting on his kitchen countertop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow leopard shook his head as he tugged his shirt back down over the vast white-furred expanse of his belly. The shirt rode right back up a few inches. \"Nah. All yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan invited Toby over to his place one night after work, promising him a surprise. When the obese snow leopard waddled into the lion's apartment, he saw half a dozen cakes waiting for him. \"I got kinda bummed out when you said you never got a birthday cake growing up,\" explained Evan. \"Figured I'd help make it up to you! I know it's not eighteen, but the baker only had these many left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rejoined Toby on the couch, cake in one paw and fork in the other. \"God, that was good...\" moaned the snow leopard as a paw lazily rubbed the taunt dome of belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what other things did your dad not want you to eat?\" asked Evan, digging the fork into the moist cake. \"Gotta make up for lost time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, anything that tasted good,\" replied Toby. \"Pizza was might favorite. But I could only get that once or twice a year. That's why I go crazy whenever I have the chance to get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion swallowed down a hunk of cake. \"Well, maybe next time we hang out we'll pick up a lot of pies and you can really go crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really go crazy? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just bring your stretchiest pants,\" Evan said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your thinking!\" Toby said. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything that you go crazy for?\" the snow leopard asked. \"Anything that you just want to really unleash yourself on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shrugged. \"I dunno. My folks were pretty loose about what I could eat.\" He took another large forkful of cake and ate it. Just then, an idea popped into his mind. \"...oh, I remember something. A while back, Burger Depot has those Bacon Apocalypse burgers. It was only around for a summer before they took it off the menu, but I ate so many that when school rolled around I was up a couple pant sizes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby chuckled. His jowels jiggled as he did so. \"I remember those. Only had one but they were pretty good from what I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad they discontinued them.\" Half the cake was resting in Evan's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I might be able to whip something up. I've been know to make a good burger, and there has to be someone online who tried making them from scratch. The recipe has to be out there somewhere.\" Toby gave his jumbo-sized gut another few pats. A long, low belch escaped him. \"I'll make plenty and we can see just how crazy you can get! The snow leopard winked back.</span></div></div>",

He ended up demolishing several of the massive pizzas all by himself. And when it came time to finally leave, the snow leopard need a pull from the lion to get himself out of the already spacious booths. Evan, too, made a pig of himself as well. Though he didn't eat anything close to as much as Toby did, the lion filled himself up too the brim. As he waddled out of the restaurant with Toby, his gut stretched his shirt so much that it rode up nearly to the top of the bloated dome. His pants were unbutton and his belly pushed apart the zipper of his jeans nearly all the way to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both crashed at Toby's place since it was closer. Letting himself into his apartment, Toby immediately stripped off his tight shirt and sweatpants, tossing them to a corner of the living room before waddling to the couch. Evan was taken a little off guard by this, and he couldn't help but watch the two hunk of lards that was Toby's butt, which ware barely contained by white briefs that had seen better days, as the two masses shifted around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's clothes soon joined his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours, the two sat silently watching television. A word wasn't spoken by either of them. Instead, the only noises that could be heard were the churning of their bellies and the occasional loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I think I really over did it...\" moaned Evan, rubbing his still painfully swollen gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you don't look so hot. Do you need to lay down a bit?\" asked Toby. \"You can crash in my bed, if you want. Plenty of room.\" Evan nodded, and the snow leopard directed him to his bedroom where the lion passed out the moment his head hit the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jostling of the mattress as Toby's enormous body crawled into bed was what awoke Evan a few hours later. Rolling over onto his back, he saw the blob of white and grey fur that was the snow leopard despite the bedroom being cast in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Did I wake you up?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but don't worry about it. Besides, it's yo-\" Evan spotted a box in Toby's paw, but he couldn't tell what it was in the dark. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Dessert.\" he replied. \"Ice cream sandwiches. Want one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...I'm so full, but ice cream does sound really good right now...\" Toby shifted his body so that he was laying on his right side. The mattress groaned underneath his weight. He ripped open the box and with his left paw danged a sandwich over his mouth. Evan hesitated for a moment, but opened his mouth anyways. He took a bite, then another bite, then another bite, and soon it was gone. By the time Evan swallowed down the last of the sandwich, Toby had another waiting for him. And Evan ate that one up just the same way, and he did so for the third and fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no more!\" groaned Evan as Toby held another sandwich up for him to eat. \"I'm too full...I'll pop if I have another...\" The snow leopard smiled before shoving the sandwich into his own mouth whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evan faded off to sleep due to a second food coma, he felt a paw slowly glide along his stuffed belly. The lion purred. And the last thing he thought before drifting off to sleep was that he hoped the snow leopard did see his throbbing erection in the darkness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Toby and Evan developed a bit of a pattern. At first, they would go out to eat then head back to one of their places where the snow leopard would find an excuse to pop a cookie or slice of cake into the lion's mouth. Evan certainly enjoyed it, being feed felt like he was being pampered by Toby. Then their meals stopped happening less at restaurants and more at their apartments. And then it became less about them eating and more about Toby shoveling food down the lion's throat. Now, the two had an established a firm pattern though the two never spoke about it out loud. Toby would invite Evan over for dinner. Evan would agree. A mountain of take-out and an eager snow leopard would be waiting for the lion. He would take his place at the couch where Toby would proceed to feed forkful after forkful to the lion until Evan complained about being too full. They would head to Toby's bedroom where the duo would disrobe and Evan would be treated to belly rubs by the snow leopard. This was always the awkward part. There was no doubt that Toby would tell how \"excited\" the belly rubs made Evan; the low grunts from Toby told the lion he felt the same. Though nothing ever happened between them. Evan would usually fall asleep before anything could happen, and the lion would slink away in the morning before Toby woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, Evan finally worked up the courage to dust off his scale and see the damage he was doing to his body. The scale read 302.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...\" he groaned, grabbing his sizable gut with both paws and giving it a firm shake. The ball of lard jiggled violently around. Evan didn't have the hard kind of gut he's seen on some beer-loving furs but rather doughy, buttery fat that sunk easily under his paws. He pinched the roll of fat growing atop his gut. Some more pounds and it'll blow out into a distinct roll, dividing his belly from his moobs. His moobs. He cupped them with this paws. His ex-girlfriend was kinda busty, but the tits Evan were sprouting might be just as big as her's. Waddling his naked body over to his full-length mirror, he turned and glanced over his shoulder. Lifting his tail to properly see his rear, he was shocked to see two basketball-sized blobs of fat dimpled with cellulite and with two saddles of lard resting on top, his lovehandles, and thighs coated in pillowly fat. Slapping a cheek, the dual masses wobbled around like jelly. Turning around to face the mirror, Evan lifted up his gut slightly to check out his manhood. A pad of fat was being to swallow up his cock. It was hard to tell in its deflated state, but he judged that it might have lost an inch and a half of length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued checking his enlarged body out in the mirror slightly. The silence was only broken when he finally uttered...</span></div></div>",

This panda wasn't even the bigger he saw today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everything looks good here,\" Mr. Tafts, the panda and supervisor at ManufactCo said as he eyes Evan's resume one more time. The lion felt like he absolutely nailed the interviewed. \"And once again, thanks for coming down on such short notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no problem!\" Evan replied.

Tafts replied. \"Our speciality is that we don't specialize in anything. It gives us to flexibility to work for a whole host of industries. Now, all those line need help.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a week since Evan landed the job at Episteme. He absolutely nailed the interview and was pretty much offered the job on the spot. And the lion was enjoying the gig. It was pretty low-key. He sat at the front desk of the Episteme Labs building in downtown Port Zaftig where he received and transfered calls, directed guests and research participates where they needed to go, and did some basic paperwork. At first, Evan didn't look forward to the idea of a desk job. But the comfy extra-wide chair they provided certainly helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only downside of the job that Evan saw were the dress requirements. Business causal, he had been told. Luckily, the lion brought with him a nice button-up shirt that did the job though now it was starting to strain against his nearly permanently bloated stomach. Evan had gone out to eat for almost every meal. Not only did he want to try out the city's many, many restaurants, but also eating out was dirt cheap. Besides, Evan reasoned, he can cut loose a little. This is a new city and he landed a posh new job, so he deserved to treat himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon, a fur came into Episteme Labs. Starting around 5'10\", the mouse had grey fur from head to toe. He wore pretty non-descript clothes: A black t-shirt and blue jeans. What stood out to Evan about the mouse was that he was thin, exceptionally thin. Evan was starting to notice that the general population of Port Zaftig was fairly fat, but the mouse was even thinner than Evan. His cheeks were sunken, his chest and abdomen flat as a board, and he had boney arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse nervously approached the counter. \"Uh, hi,\" he said timidly. \"I'm here to see...umm...\" He searched his pockets for a piece of paper and pulled out a folded up page with printed texted on it. \"Doctor... Kirkpatrick? Emil Kirkpatrick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmil Kirkpatrick was, from what Evan heard in the breakroom, one of the top researchers for Episteme Labs. However, the lion had no clue what sorts of things he researched. Even searching online brought up nothing substantial. All Evan knew was that he had a PhD in molecular biology and that was pretty much it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was strange about this was that Dr. Kirkpatrick never actually dealt with other furs. He had dozens and dozens of furs working under him. So he never handled any small business that a lab assistant could handle. The mouse saying he had an appointment with specifically with the doctor was certainly an anomaly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a greater anomaly was Dr. Kirkpatrick coming down in person collect his visitor. \"You're late,\" he said impatiently to the mouse. Dr. Kirkpatrick was a older brown bear nearly six and a half feet tall. He had arms and legs thick with muscle that were visible through his tight shirt and slacks. An impressive gut stuck out far in front on him, pressuring the buttons on his shirts and forcing him to always leave his lab coat open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" the mouse stammered. \"But the airport lost my luggage and taxi driver got l-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough. Come. The procedure room has been prepped for some time.\" The mouse followed the doctor into the elevator, and the two disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when evening arrived that Evan saw the mouse again. As the elevator doors opened, he quickly walked through the lobby desperately trying not to make eye contact with anyone. His cheeks blushed bright red. The lion immediately noticed the incredible mass that was now the mouse's belly. Looking nearly nine months pregnant, his belly stuck out nearly a foot and a half in front of him and shook with every hurried step. The mouse tried pulling his shirt down, but it wouldn't even cover a third of his grey-furred gut. His jeans were now unbuttoned and being held up by his other paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was dumbfounded at what he saw, at what had changed so drastically about the mouse who was now exiting the building. The lion was extremely curious about what procedure Dr. Kirkpatrick had done and wanted to know more about what the doctor was up to. Being a reception, Evan had little access to files from any of the researchers. However, he did have access to some basic files about any of the lab's clientele. There may be some clues about the mouse there. If he was willing to be more risky, he could \"borrow\" a terminal access card. Researchers used these cards to get past all of the security measures used to protect their research, and Dr. Kirkpatrick must have something behind the firewalls, though if he got caught Evan would most certainly be fired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr if he acted quick, he could tail the mouse before he got too far away. His shift was up and the lion was ready to leave anyway. Following the mouse might reveal something about what procedure he just went through.</span></div></div>",

KIRKPATRICK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking the reception desk, Evan had access to some patient information. It wasn't a whole lot, just enough to answer some basic questions if incoming patients to the lab had any minor issues. The lion pulled up the day's scheduled appointments and easily found the entry for the mouse. There were two things that stuck out to him. First, that his file specifically stated that he needed to report to and only to Dr. Kirkpatrick. It was strange that the Doctor himself would come down to collect a patient. But it was even stranger that the mouse was only seeing Dr Kirkpatrick. This, Evan reasoned, meant that the Doctor was working solo on this patient which at Episteme Labs was pretty much unheard of. And second, whatever the mouse came in for, it was for a cosmetic procedure. The Lab sometimes did kinds of cosmetic projects, so that isn't too out of the ordinary. But the mouse spent all day there and left looking absolutely massive. So what kind of cosmetic procedure makes someone has an incredibly engorged belly afterwards?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up Ethan's patient profile raised more questions than it answered. It wasn't too late in the evening, so if Evan felt adventurous, he could sneak into some of the more protected files if he managed to find an access cards. But then again, he might not want to push his luck. It looks like the mouse will be in tomorrow too. So he could find out a bit more then.</span></div></div>",

Keeping a distance of at least a block between the two furs, the lion pursed the mouse as his swiftly walked back to his motel room, the mass that was his belly wobbling and jiggling with each frantic step his took. Night was approaching now. He watched from afar as the mouse quickly bolted up the stairs and opened the door to his room with a keycard, slamming the door shut behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan went up the stairs and sneaked up to the window of the mouse's room. The curtains were slightly ajar. The lion peaked into the room. There, he saw the mouse yanking off his shirt, exposing his grey-furred inflated belly which jostled about as the fur pulled off his pants and underwear in one swift motion denuding not only his petite bottom but also a throbbing erection. The mouse stroked his member with gusto as he waddled into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever was happening to the mouse, the fur seemed to enjoy it. The lion thought about what to do next. He could stick around, continuing to spy on the mouse, though Evan might get caught. Alternatively, he could simply go home and see if the mouse will come into Episteme Labs again soon. </span></div></div>",

As he made his way over to the motel room bed, his doughy and spherical belly happily bounced along with each step. Siting on the edge of the bed which faced the window and door, the mouse took a minute to examine the belly which was now taking up much of his lap. Slipping two paws underneath, he lifted it up a few inches before letting it drop. The mass shook and quaked. The mouse did this again a few more time. He grabbed the sides his belly and started shaking it. As his gut jiggled wildly, a look of pure excitement across his face. That is, until it was replaced by a look of shock. He spotted the lion spying on him through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\" Evan muttered to himself. He thought about running but before he could escape the mouse already had his head sticking out of the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? Were you spying on me?\" The mouse asked, his voice a mix of anger and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I saw you leave the labs and you looked sorts off so I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're from the labs?\" The mouse said, cutting Evan off. \"Uh, come on in...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe beckoned Evan into the motel room. Soon, the two were sat on the bed as Evan explained everything. Everything except for seeing the mouse pleasure himself. He wanted to spare the fur the embarrassment of that. He tried not staring at the blob of a belly resting in the mouse's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, yeah, that why I followed you here. I'm sorry, but I really did have the best intentions,\" the lion apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's okay,\" the mouse said. \"I just I was just kinda freaked out that Dr. Kirkpatrick sent a spy after me or something. He seems really adamant about keep this all a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what all is he keeping as a secret?\" the lion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I really can't tell, but it involves...this.\" He gave his belly a light pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shrugged his shoulders. \"Alright if you say so...uh, I don't think I got your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse stuck out a paw. \"It's Jamie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sat at his desk in the reception area of Episteme Labs when Jamie came in as he done for the past two weeks. Like usual, he left the night before looking like his belly was going to pop, and like usual he arrived looking skinny as a stick. But rather than going straight to the elevator as he has always done, Jamie walked right up to Evan's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Jamie, how are y-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" he said sternly with a worried expression on his face as he lended his whole body over the desk. \"Can you tell me if the elevator is working?\" From his paw, a crumpled up piece of paper fell onto Evan's desk. The mouse's eyes briefly darted towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah, it is. Go right in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie quickly walked over to the elevator, mashed a button, and disappeared inside. Evan snatched up the piece of crumpled paper of his desk and smoothed it out.

Evan immediately noticed that the fur's formerly flabby belly was now back to its originally flat state. The lion tried not to blush thinking about how he accidentally spied on the mouse pleasuring himself the previous night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I know where to go,\" the mouse said meekly. He hurried he way to the elevator and mashed the buttons, disappearing inside once the doors opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Evan's day was remarkably dull. He answered phones, set up appointments, responded to emails, and overate during lunch. There was a special at the nearby Burger Barn and the lion just couldn't pass it up. That afternoon his overstuffed belly pressed hard against the buttons on his white button-up shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until nearly the end of his shift that Evan thought about that mouse again. He hadn't seen him leave the building. Perhaps the mouse left during his lunch break, or perhaps he exited through some other door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes before Evan was slated to leave, the elevator dinged once more. Out walked the mouse. Just like the night before, his flat abdomen had ballooned out massively into jiggling, wobbling mass. The lion stared as the mouse as he made his way to the door. Evan swore that he was even bigger than the day before. The mouse's steps were awkward and disjointed. Clearly, he wasn't used to waddling around with the new weight, and it also didn't help that his gut was sloshing around uncontrollably. Before he could reach the door, the mouse took a tumble. He hit the ground hard and his belly jiggled violently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan quickly rushed over to him. \"Oh my God, are you only?\" The mouse was struggling to get up, and seeing this the lion helped him back onto his feet. The fur stumbled a bit, knocking into Evan, who instinctively held out his paws to catch the mouse. One paw caught his belly and easily sunk into the flesh. It was incredibly soft and supple and warm. It reminded Evan of marshmallow fluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm-I'm fine...,\" the mouse said. He started pulling away from Evan but the lion dragged him back closer to him. The mouse's grey-furred gut smacked into Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this is the second time I've seen you walk out of here big as a house!\" Evan said in a hushed whisper. \"What the hell is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse stammered. \"I...I can't tell you...Mister...Dr. Kirkpatrick told me not to tell anyone! He said if I talk then the military will cancel the co-\" He suddenly brought a paw up to his mouth and gasped. \"I shouldn't have said that! Forget I said anything!\" He broke away from Evan and rushed out the door and down the street, his huge gut bouncing up and down as he moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse didn't come in the next morning, and Evan's morning was just as lackluster as it was the day before. That is, until a chunky ferret taped him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan? I'm supposed to fill in for you,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why? For what?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. HR just called me down. I'm just as-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the phone rang. Evan picked it up ready to deliver the standard greeting. \"Thank you for callin-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan.

His white lab coat was ill-fitting; his biceps threatened to explode out of the sleeves. \"And that's it? That's all that he told you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, sir\" Evan said nervously. \"Where, uh, where is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie? I asked him to come in late today.\" He glanced at the thick watch around his wrist. \"Actually, he should be...\" A couple of quick knocks were heard in the office. \"Come in,\" the bear barked. In walked the grey mouse. Once again he was skinny as a rail, deflated back to his former state. As Jamie took a seat next to Evan, he tried not making eye contact with the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any change?\" the doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, then.\" The mouse gave a quick glance over to Evan. \"Now.\" Jamie quickly stripped down to his boxers, showing off his incredibly skinny body. There wasn't an ounce of fat on him. Dr. Kirkpatrick examined Jamie's body from behind the desk. The mouse turned around when ordered to. Evan could see his cheeks blush bright red with embarrassment. \"Okay, sit down.\" Jamie quickly dressed himself and sat back down in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I...can I get back to work now?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Because you're now in on this,\" the bear replied. \"If you know a little bit of the secret, you know a lot of the secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secret? What secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kirkpatrick cleared his throat. \"I managed to secure a rather lucrative contract with the military. Unfortunately, it was a contract the shareholders and the ethics boards disapproved of. So I'm keeping this a secret between me, you, and Jamie. Nobody else is going to know. Nobody else will know. Now, Evan, did you know how strategically important the Artic and Antarctic are? Very. However, those are both incredibly inhospitable environments. But animals still live there, don't they, Evan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like, walruses do, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kirkpatrick smiled. \"Yes, Evan. Walruses do live there. And how do you think they keep warm in such cold weather?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...blubber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Evan. Now, imagine we took a solider and coated him with blubber. He surely ought to be able to survive the cold, yes? But how do actually do that? Feeding him cookies and cakes and such is slow and unhealthy. But were there a way to fill a fur with blubber temporarily or semi-permanently, that would be so much better. And that's what Jamie and I have been working on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jamie's being pumped with a load of blubber?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A synthetic kind, but yet. Unfortunately, the formula isn't quite right. The effects disappear too soon, hence when he's in the state he's in now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan turned to the mouse. \"But why are you doing this? What do you get out of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh,\" stuttered Jamie. \"I get a bit of money and, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" cut in Dr. Kirkpatrick, \"once I figured out a permanent formula of my synthetic blubber, Jamie will be pumped full of it. As much as his heart desires! Isn't that we agree on, hmm?\" The mouse shyly nodded.  The bear turned to Evan. \"The poor boy has, um, huge ambitions. If he didn't have the metabolism of a hummingbird, I reason he'd be twice the size of even the biggest fur this city has to offer!\" Jamie sunk down in his chair with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but why tell me all this? What does this have to do with me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I just acquired a new test subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh, no! I'm not doing this! Are you crazy? Pumping me full of some weird stuff? Hell no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor chuckled. \"Calm down, son. The effects will be temporary. And I assure you you will be rewarded handsomely for your participation. I don't want to give everything away, but you'll be able to retire very young afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? I don't care! You can't force me to be a lab rat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The procedure isn't harmful, quite pleasant actually. Isn't that right, Jamie?\" The mouse nodded. \"I don't see why you're so adamantly against this. I'd take this agreement in a heartbeat if I were you! But then again, I'm not giving you much of a choice, Evan. I hate sounding so cliche, but I'm making you an offer you can't refuse.\"</span></div></div>",

The mouse pressed the button, the doors shut, and the elevator was on its way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the two had warmed up to each other a bit over the two weeks they were having the procedure done to them, things were still pretty awkward given the surreal situation they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan glanced at Jamie's body, looking for any noticable changes, to see if anything \"stuck\". Nothing. The guy was as skinny as the first day he entered the labs. \"So, uh, notice anything new this time?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Nothing,\" replied the mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...uh, you've been getting any side effects at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Get kinda gassy, but that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night before, both boys waddled out of the Episteme Labs build with massive, wobbling bellies filled with gallons of Dr. Kirkpatrick's synthetic blubber. Both boys had cartoonishly oversized bellies that, in any other city, would have made them stick out like a sore thumb. In Port Zaftig, however, they fit right in. At first, Evan felt strange leaving the labs each night with a belly that made him look overdue with triplets. Yet the lion eventually warmed up to it. He certainly enjoyed the feeling of his warm and soft belly pressing against his body as he laid down to sleep at night. And, just as the doctor promised, each night Evan woke up as skinny as he was before. Dr. Kirkpatrick was still figuring out how to make the stuff last way longer, but each new batch lastest as long as the rest did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator rose, Evan adjusted his loose pants. Knowing he'd end the day with a massive belly, the lion started dressing more appropriately. The baggy clothes he wore in wouldn't be as baggy when he leaves. Oddly enough, Jamie always came in with his tight shirts and pants, even though at night he's ready to explode out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, like the feeling,\" Jamie explained to Evan on night on their way out of the lab. \"It makes me feel...big...huge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo arrived at the makeshift lab Dr. Kirkpatrick secured for his research. The three were the only furs that knew where it was and what went on inside. The doctor wasn't there yet. Inside, there was only two medium-sized steel tanks, some medical equipment, two rather comfy chairs, and a television mounted on one of the wall for them to watch while they grew. They knew what to do already. Both stripped down to their underwear and waited in one of the chairs. Soon, the bear would entered, ask some questions, then hook end fur up to their respective tank of synthetic blubber. This was administered via a thick needle plunged into the bellybutton and connected to one of the tanks. Getting pricked was Evan's least favorite part of the procedure. But once the blubber starting flowing, the pain went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours into the procedure and both boys were steadily being pumped full of Dr. Kirkpatrick's synthetic blubber. Both Jamie and Evan sported guts the size of basketball and they were only going to get bigger. On the television was a program that Jamie picked (Evan always let Jamie pick the channels they watched). But Evan was feeling bored. Watching television most of the day sounds amazing at first. Yet it was going on two weeks now and the lion was getting uninterested fast. He decided to strike up a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, Jamie. You never told me how you met Dr. Kirkpatrick,\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie blushed a bit. \"Eh, uh, he found me from a website for, uh, furs into bigger furs. We chatted a bit and he seemed nice. When I told him about my fantasies, that was when he told me about this super secret...experiment he was working on. It sounded like a joke but he kept assuring me it was real. I didn't believe him until he showed me some of his research and the next thing I know he's booking flights and hotels for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantasizies? Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I want to be really big! Huge!\" Jamie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how? I don't know what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse reached over and grabbed his jeans that were carefully folded and sitting on the floor. From them, he pulled out his phone. A few flicks later and he held it up for Evan to see. It was a picture of an insanely enormous Golden Retriever. His body was so big that rolls of fat spilled off of the sides of his bed. Limbs were encased in layers and layers of lard. His belly was like a boulder of blubber. This was easily the biggest, fattest fur Evan ever saw in his life, easily way past a half ton.\"Jesus...\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! Huge! That's what I want to be! So big! So fat! So-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was cut off by a sound at the door. Dr. Kirkpatrick let himself in. \"Doing well, gentlemen?\" he said, patting both of their slowly inflating bellies. The masses wobbled. They both nodded. \"That's good. Very good. I want to hold one of you here for overnight observations. The key to making this synthetic blubber last must lie in understanding how and why it decomposes so quickly. It'll be nothing major, I promise. Just a few sensors and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can stay,\" Jamie said. \"Anything to make this research go somewhere. Unless you really want to, Evan.\"</span></div></div>",

Goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Evan remembered before blacking out was leaving the office only to feel a clubbing blow strike the side of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air of the room he found himself in was cold and sterile. It took Evan a moment for his vision to adjust. He laid nude, strapped down to a table. Lights and all sorts of medical equipment he didn't recognize were all around him. He screamed. A few minutes later, an old white-haired mouse walked into to the room. Immediately, he shined a penlight in the lion's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject has regained consciousness...all signs are good...\" he muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? Where am I?\" barked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dr. Cioran and you are in my lab,\" the mouse said. \"Emil said you knew some naughty naughty things and needed my help making sure you don't remember them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...what? You can't do this! I-\" Dr. Cioran took this as an opportunity to secure a gag in Evan's mouth. The lion struggled and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit...\" Dr. Cioran assured him. \"...when I get around to it. I'm not throwing a perfectly good test subject away! I am a man of <b>science</b> and a man of science needs to do his <b> research</b>!\" He disappeared for a second only to return with something that looked like a taser. Dr. Cioran sparked it a few times and Evan groaned in protest. \"Now, let's begin!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You'll be doing a lot of the prep work. It sounds easy, but because of how many pies we serve each day, we need a fur dedicated to making sure our pizza makers aren't having to stop what they're doing just to grate cheese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done plenty of this kind of stuff at the last pizza joint I worked at,\" said Evan as he looked around at his new workplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, that's why I hired you on the spot,\" replied the hog. \"Now, uniform is simply. We all got to sport the Purgatory Pizza shirts. Uh, this was the smallest one I could find in the back...\" He held up a black shirt with the restaurant's logo on the front. \"Why wait an eternity for a pizza?\" the slogan underneath said. It was several times larger than Evan's shirt size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, uh, alright. I'll make it work,\" the lion said, noting the 2XL label inside the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, follow me. I'll introduce you to Lucas. You'll be seeing an awful lot of him.\" Mr. Prosciutto lead Evan around the corner where a rotund red fox was working on making a pizza. The shirt he was wearing was riding up an inch, exposing a strip of red-furred flab. The fox's sweatpants clung tightly around his plump thighs and bulbous butt. As the two furs walked in, the red fox was shoving a small stack of salami into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas! Wait 'til your lunch break!\" barked Mr. Prosciutto. The red fox let out a harrumph. \"Anyways, stop what you're doing. I want to introduce you our new Dough Boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our new what?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dough Boy. It's just a nickname our guys have for whoever's working prep,\" the hog answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red fox turned around, his vast gut wobbling has he moved. The fur eyed Evan up and down. \"You know, Boss, customers are going to wonder what's wrong with our pizzas if we're hiring furs that clearly look like they don't eat here...or anything at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion looked displeased and was about to say something before Mr. Prosciutto stepped in. \"Ignore him, Evan. He's just irked because he was supposed to have the day off before someone called in sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was supposed to go to the beach today!\" said Lucas as he turned his obese body back to the pizza he was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Prosciutto turned back to Evan. \"Better get your uniform on. The dinner rush will hit us like a ton of bricks pretty soon.\"</span></div></div>",

Using his elbow, the lion opened the latch and stepped inside the chilly room. Purgatory Pizza was closed for the day, and before Evan could leave he needed to store away all of the unused ingredients for the next day. Once he put away the tray of cheese, he'd be off for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Evan saw Lucas in front of a pan full of pepperoni slices sitting on one of the racks. The red fox was taking stacks of slices and greedily gobbling them up.  He stopped when the lion walked in. Reaching a paw in the tray, Lucas pulled out a massive pawful of pepperoni and waddle in the direction of the fridge door. Passing by Evan, the obese red fox hip checked the lion, knocking him to the cold floor and causing him to drop the container he was holding. Tons of shredded cheese fell to the floor as Lucas snickered to himself, slamming the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion grumbled to himself as he cleaned up the mess. Lucas had been giving him crap all day. Snide comments, sneers, being an all-around pain in the butt. This was just the lastest in a long list of things that made working with Lucas insufferable. Were he in any other situation, Evan would simply quit. But he enjoyed the job in general. And he didn't want to quit. That would mean that Lucas won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion picked up the tray and went to exit the fridge and throw out the now wasted cheese. Before he left, Evan saw that the plastic film on the pepperoni bin Lucas was eating from was still left off. Sighing, Evan went over to replaced the film. But then he was struck with an idea. The fat fox seemed to always be sneaking food. Several times during the day Evan saw Lucas shoving cheese and meat into his fat face. And Mr. Prosciutto knew this was something the fox did. Perhaps, the situation could be exasperated. If more food, and a lot more food, went missing, then surely Lucas would get the blame. Evan pretty much worked by himself, so there would be nobody to catch him sneaking bites here and there. Then again, maybe the lion should smooth things over with Lucas. It's be better to work with a friend than an enemy.</span></div></div>",

I didn't!\" said the red fox. \"I don't even like sausage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullcrap! I saw you eating it an hour ago!\" the hog spouted. \"I may not be able to fire the owner's kid, but I sure as hell can make his life miserable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan snickered himself as he chopped away at an onion he was slicing. The sausage was quite delicious, though it had taken the lion some time to devour the entire pan. Yet he was getting used to it. Over the course of a couple of weeks, the lion managed to stealthily consume entire huge containers of shredded cheese, ungodly amounts of pepperoni and sausage, hundreds of mushrooms, thousands of olives, and loads of more pizza toppings. And as more and more ingredients went missing, Lucas was getting all the blame. And judging by the tone of Mr. Prosciutto, he was getting in some real hot water <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion burped a bit, feeling a bit of stomach acid climb up his throat. Patting his stomach, he made a mental note to pick up some antacids on the way home. His stomach, thanks to all the food he was sneaking away, had ballooned up into a small belly, soft and doughy as pizza dough. The lion didn't mind putting on a few pounds, especially if it meant sticking it to Lucas. Besides, the lion reasoned, it wasn't like anyone was going to notice the new ball of fun under his extremely baggy work shirt though his pants were getting a little tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing time was upon Purgatory Pizza again. Once more, Evan was making the rounds between his workstation and the walk-in refrigerator putting away ingredients that were unused that day. As he dropped off pan after pan of ingredients into the chilled room, he scoped out what delicious things to devour tonight. Many of the other employees had left, so Evan left like he could go hog wild here and not get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacked in the corner were boxes of cookie dough. Purgatory Pizza sold enormous cookies, each easily the size of Evan's paw. Each box had layers and layers of chilled cubes of dough waiting to be popped into the oven. The lion had loved cookie dough and could use the evening to see how much of a dent he could put into one of those big boxes of frozen cookie dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso sitting in the refrigerator were trays loaded with massive balls of pizza dough, ready to be rolled out and turned into a mouthwatering pizza. But Purgatory Pizza was offering a new dough for their pizza, one covered in cheese and garlic and spices and they smelled delicious. Just one doughball was the size of a football, but enough of these went missing, then Mr. Prosciutto would absolutely freak out considering how much it costs to make them.</span></div></div>",

The huge hog sat across from the lion at his desk with a stoic look on his face. He had caught Evan red-handed with have a box of cookie dough half devoured and in the middle of popping even more into this eager mouth. The hog hauled him into his office where he confessed everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Prosciutto took a deep breath. \"No, no. I don't think it's grounds for termination. Actually, I think we can work something out here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me be frank: I really don't like Lucas. And I've been looking for an excuse to fire him since the moment he started working here. He's lazily, he's a jerk, and of course, he won't stop stuffing his face. But I can't fire him for that stuff. His father owns the place and a lot of other restaurants in town. Mr. Daniels is a powerful man, and so long as Lucas shows up to work on time and does the job, I can't fire him. However...however, if i can prove to Mr. Daniels that his son's eating habits are having a serious effect on his bottom line, I think I'll be able to get rid of that fat fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to keep doing what you're doing,\" Mr. Prosciutto replied. \"Actually, scratch that. I want to you to really crank it up. Eat to your heart's content, stuff yourself as much as you want. Eat anything and everything you can. Eventually, all the missing stock will get the attention of Mr. Daniels' accountants and I can pin it all on Lucas. I've already written him up more than enough times to prove he has a problem. All you need to do is not get caught sneaking food, especially by Lucas. So, do we have a deal?\" The hog stretched out a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion smirked. \"Mr. Prosciutto, I think we have a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan laid naked in his bed that night eating chunk after chunk of cookie dough. As a sign of appreciation, Mr. Prosciutto let the lion take an entire box home with him. He purred as he popped another sugary chunk into his mouth, a paw lazily rubbing this belly which was now so full and swollen that the fury sphere was starting to block the view of his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Prosciutto said that he'd have to do some serious eating if he wanted to take a bite out of the restaurant's finances. As Evan ate his treat, he began planning on how he could do that. If the lion could convince the hog to give him the key and security code to the building, he'd be able to sneak in at night and have the whole place to himself. But Mr. Prosciutto might not trust him enough for that. Or maybe he could be smarter about it. If Evan could figure out what some of the more expensive ingredients are, he could just stuff his belly with those instead of filling up on the cheap stuff.</span></div></div>",

The lion had managed to devour half of one of the massive balls of dough before the refrigerator door swung open. Standing there was Lucas with an unimpressed look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion swallowed hard, his throat stretched painfully as it accommodated the mass of dough making its way to his gut. \"It's not what it looks like!\" Evan said again, this time able to actually talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat red fox said nothing as he waddled up towards Evan, a greedy paw reached for one of the huge dough balls. Lucas shoved this thing in his face, managing to gobble it up in record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna finish that?\" he asked, gesturing to the dough in the lion's paws. Evan shook his head, offering it to Lucas who snatched it up and wolfed it down just as quickly as the first. \"Not bad,\" he said, wiping butter from his mouth with the sleeve on his shirt. \"But there's so much better food around. Here.\" The fat fox reached over to one of the racks, pulling down a metal tub. In it were giant globs of moist mozzarella cheese, each bigger than the size of Evan's fist. \"Mozzarella, the good stuff. Not the grated crap from the bag.\" Lucas reached in a grabbed one of the balls of cheese before offering one to Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, the lion grabbed one and took a hearty bite. Creamy, soft, delicious, the mozzarella tasted amazing. He purred in delighted as he scarfed down the rest of the ball of cheese in only a few more bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another?\" Lucas asked after grabbing a second one for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" said Evan, reaching into the bin. \"Wait, won't Mr. Prosciutto get upset if he sees us eating the inventory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red fox rolled his eyes. \"Mr. Prosciutto can bite me. That hog's been giving me a hard time since the day I walked in here,\" said Lucas. \"He just hates me because my dad owns this place and pretty much every restaurant in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'd love it if that hog hit the bricks. I've been working here for years and could run the place way better.\" The fox glanced over to see Evan bite a ball of mozzarella in half. \"Huh, I just had an idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An idea? About what?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About how we can get rid of Mr. Prosciutto,\" replied Lucas. \"Look, the hog is in charge of everything around here. Everything. Including inventory. Part of the reason he rides my ass is because I'll have a snack here and there, and any problems with the stock comes down on his head. So, if suddenly tons of the stock went missing, and that kept happening often enough, my dad will come down hard on him and boot him to the curb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what does that have to do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're around the stock all the time prepping everything. And haven't you seen your workstation? Nobody ever bothers you there! You'll be prefect at making ingredients disappear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how'd I make them 'disappear'?\" Evan asked. The fox gestured to the nearly eaten mozzarella in his paw. \"Oh. Well, why can't you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Mr. Prosciutto is watching me all the time. And he's written me up for eating ingredients. I'll have to be on my best behavior if this is going to work because I can't let him pin it all on me! But if it's you making everything disappear, then he can't blame me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I get caught instead?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't if you're careful! Now what do you say, pal? Will you help me?\" The ones fox took out another wad of mozzarella and held it up to the lion's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I think I will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red fox smiled wide. \"Good! Now, eat up. I want all this cheese gone by the morning. Mr. Prosciutto is gonna freak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Lucas? All the premium mozzarella? I had to place an emergency order for it this morning because of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you looking at me? I had nothing to do with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right! Whenever food goes missing, it's because of you stuffing yourself all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't prove I had anything to do with that mozzarella! Besides, I'm trimming down for swimsuit season!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullcrap! I know it was you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeaking his head around a corner, Evan watched the exchange between the two furs until Mr. Prosciutto stormed off in anger. Lucas spotted Evan and gave him a thumbs up. The lion gave the red fox a thumbs up back before returning to his workstation, not before reaching his paws under his apron to undo the button of his tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lion diced up some onions, he thought about the deal with Lucas. While he was doing it to get on his good side, the lion figured that he should be able to get something reasonable in return. Then again, it might be better not to rock the boat. It seemed like Evan was making a friend out of Lucas. And considering how few furs he knew in the city, it would be better if the lion tried hanging out with him outside of work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So...what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas was leaning his massive body against one of the metal racks in the walk-in refrigerator. The shop had been closed for half an hour, and both furs were busy doing their closing duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't really thought about it that deeply,\" Evan said, placing a pan full of sausage on a rack. He grabbed a pawful of them and tossed them into his mouth. \"Lemme think...\" he said which chewing. The lion went to swallow, but some went down the wrong tube causing him to start coughing. A few chunks of sausage flew out of his mouth and on to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, don't forget to chew there, big cat!\" Lucas said while laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evan bent down to pick up the sausage from the floor, he hear a loud rip and suddenly felt the cool air of the refrigerator on his rump. Looking over his shoulder, he saw that his butt, no doubt swollen up thanks to everything he's been gobbling up for Lucas, had exploded through the seat of his jeans exposing his equally tight white briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat fox laughed at out, and Evan blushed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I can do for you,\" Lucas said after his laughing fit. \"I'll send you over some clothes. I know a good store for fat asses like us. Now, text me your address...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat asses like us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion stood naked in his bathroom mirror examining his pudgy body. Because of everything he was devouring at work, Evan had put on a significant amount of weight. A belly that stuck out and drooped, looking like the balls of dough he works with, arms and thighs that lost all definition and now jiggled at the slightest movement, growing tits, a second chin forming, and yes, a fat ass with sprouting lovehandles to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was certainly the fattest Evan had ever been in his life. Usually a slim lion, his weight never changed that much. The most he ever put on was twenty pounds back in his junior year of high school. Back then, Burger Depot had unveiled their new Bacon Apocalypse Burger. Evan loved them so much that he easily had two every day for a month and a half. The end result was a pudgy belly that his friends teased him mercilessly about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys! Evan's getting F-A-T!\" his friend Dean once said before pulling up the lion's shirt exposing the chub to his friends who laughed at him. It was shortly after that Evan stopped going to Burger Depot altogether. The pounds melted away and soon enough everyone forgot about his burger belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan's getting F-A-T...\" the lion whispered to himself as he played with guy, much bigger than it was when it blew up all those years ago. Peer pressure and teasing kept the lion from getting too chunky back in Bastion. But Port Zaftig was filled with lardy furs who didn't see fat as taboo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes, remembering the pokes and prods his belly got way back then. Rubbing a paw sensuously along his stomach, the lion imagined what they'd all say now, his thin bodycovered in a thick layer of day. His heart raced and pulsed quickened as he fantasize about Dean and what he would say and do to the lion having put on far more that just twenty pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Evan realized he was shaking in excitement, his member swollen due to arousal. He didn't know what had gotten into him, but he knew what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDashing back to his bedroom, the lion searched through his drawers for the smallest tightest clothes he had. The plan was to snap some photos, innocent ones, and upload them to his Pawbook profile. They'll \"inadvertently\" show off his gains, and the teasing comments would pour in. Evan's paws quakes in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he was struck with another idea. Evan hadn't talked with Dean in a while, not since leaving Bastion. Maybe he could video chat with him. One glance of Evan's new belly and Dean would no doubt give him hell.</span></div></div>",

Get your as back on the treadmill<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwtf hapened to you, Evan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice gut, bro</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrolling through the comments posted by his friends to the photos he recently uploaded to Pawbook, Evan felt a pulse of erotic excitement surge through his body. Donning the smallest clothes in his wardrobe, the lion hit the town, taking dozen of photos of himself with some of the local sights. Yet in his each photo, Evan made that that some part of his blown up body was \"inadvertently\" on display, be it his gut, his ass, or his tits. In one such photo, he snapped a picture of a display of a boutique store which sold various curiosities. Anyone could see the lion's reflection in the shop's window and see the prominent curves of his belly and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>lay off the cupcakes fat ass!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA notification popped up on Pawbook letting Evan know what Jamie had just commented on one of the photos. One of the top members of the track team in high school, and someone the lion always had a little bit of a crush on, Evan's heart starting to pound thinking about that svelte cheetah making fun of his flabby body. He imagined having his rear smacked while being called a fat ass, being called tubby while having a roll pinched, his moods bei-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you done with your break yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan snapped back to reality. He was sitting in the backroom of Purgatory Pizza taking his break when Lucas came in. The lion quickly moved to hide the growing tent in his sweatpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah! I'm done! Totally done! I'll be back in a minute!\" Evan carefully tugged his huge shirt down to hide his swollen manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat fox noticed the lion's strange behavior and saw his phone sitting on the table in front of him. \"Uh huh. And what have you been up to?\" Lucas snatched the phone before Evan could grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give it back in a second!\" Lucas said as he scrolled through Evan's Pawbook page, seeing the photos and comments the lion was previously gawking over. \"Huh, you grow a few pant sizes and people are giving you hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion blushed hard. \"Yeah, um, there aren't too many...bigger furs back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I guess they'll all have to get used to you being the fat friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's stiff member twitched upon hearing that. \"Uh yeah, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox scrolled through the photos again. \"Wow! I guess you are really plumping up!\" He turned the phone towards Evan, where on the screen was a selfie he took while licking a huge ice cream cone. His expanded gut stretched his shirt tight and was impossible to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...I am...\" A little bit of fluid dripped from the tip of his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas handed Evan his phone back. \"Alright, well, get back to work! I need someone to refill the pepperoni!\" With that, the fat fox turned around and waddled back to his station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Evan a few minutes before his erection deflated. In that time, he thought about what Lucas had said about the lion's growth and how that was getting him revved up. Maybe there could be a way to get the fox to talk about Evan's gains. Though if Lucas saw what all that teasing was doing to him, that might make things awkward between them.</span></div></div>",

They're playing Knives of Justice IV on Channel 77!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least a few boxes were unpacked before Evan got distracted by the television. Now, he was laying down on the vast couch watching movies. But he didn't feel guilty about it. The lion needed a proper day of rest after his long trip, and he was in no hurry to unpack all of his belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around 1:30pm when the lion's stomach rumbled. He had been nibbling on various snacks that were leftovers from his road trip. Now, Evan needed an actual meal, and he was craving pizza. On his phone he pulled up the number of a nearby pizza joint: Purgatory Pizza. He dailed them up and put in an order for a medium pepperoni. About 25 minutes later, someone came knocking on his apartment door. The lion's tail wagged as he could smell the wonderful amour of the pizza on the other side of the door. When Evan opened it, he saw a young otter standing there holding an massive pizza box. An inch or two shorter than Evan, the otter was clearly at more than twice his size. A spherical doughy gut stretched tight his uniform shirt and his hips were wide enough to be somewhat problematic even with the generous width of all the doorframe Evan had already seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I have a delivery?\" the otter asked nervously. Evan eyed the box. It was far too big for a medium pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a medium?\" the lion asked as he gestured towards the box the pudgy otter was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did-did you not order a medium?\" he sputtered as he glanced at the receipt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no I did. I just didn't know this was a medium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is sir! And that'll be $19.99, please.\" Evan handed the otter cash enough to cover the pizza and give him a sizable tip. The delivery boy gave Evan the pizza, thanked him, and turned to leave. The lion watched as the otter's enormous rump wobbled as he walked away. There hadn't been too many furs on the fatter side back in his hometown, very few as hefty as that otter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must really like pizza,\" Evan reasoned as he placed the large box on the coffee table in the living room. He opened it up and inside was a pizza three feet in diameter covered in loads of meat and cheese. This surprised Evan. Back in Bastion, this may have been an extra extra large. But this is a medium here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like the lion was complaining. The pizza was good, really good. He devoured nearly half of it in just under an hour. Feeling sated, Evan closed up the box, thinking he should save the rest for tomorrow. Yet as he continued to laze about and watch television, he had a slice here and another slice there. And by the time evening rolled around, the rest of the pizza was in the lion's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan moaned as he rubbed his bloated and stuffed belly. \"Ugh, that was amazing, but I really shouldn't have eaten that much! I feel like I'm ready to pop or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion needed something to relieve his indigestion. Another nap might help him, though it might really throw off his sleep schedule. A walk around the neighborhood might help. Evan always enjoyed the feeling of the cool evening air after a hot, sunny day. Or maybe Evan ought to dig around his boxes. He thought he packed away some medicine that may help. If not, he remembered see a corner store not to far away. They may sell something that'll help.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The only light in the living room when Evan woke up from his impromptu nap came from the glow of the television. It was pitch black outside; dusk had came many hours before. The lion groggily searched for his phone and found it under the empty pizza box. It read 1:04am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion yawned and stretched. His stomach, which still quite full, was no longer get filled to the point of discomfort. He lazily rubbed a paw along the still distended midsection. Evan sat up and tried working a kink out in his back. Although the couch was comfortable to sit on, it clearly wasn't designed for naps. The rest of the night should be spent in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion dug out the remote control from between the cushions of the couch. Playing on television was an infomercial for some kitchen gadget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It slices! It dices! It chops! It rocks!\" the rotund pachyderm on TV said holding up what looked to be a standard kitchen knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shrugged and pointed the remote at the screen. Before he could turn the set off, the screen turned bright white, blinding the lion momentarily. When his eyes adjusted, he saw three words in a black simple font fill the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second Evan read the words they disappeared off the screen, and the television shut off on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion was spooked. He wasn't sure what he had seen, if it was even real. Was he the victim of an elaborate prank? Evan took a moment to collect himself before pushing this out of his mind. He had been pretty sleep deprived from the long road trip to Port Zaftig and what he saw was surely a figment of an overactive imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat illusion, however, was shattered the next morning. He had gotten ready for the day and was about to leave his apartment to find a local coffee place when he saw that someone had slipped a bright yellow envelope under the crack of his front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNIGHTINGALE PARK<br>\r\nFAR SIDE OF THE LAKE BETWEEN THE BOULDERS<br>\r\n10:35PM TONIGHT<br>\r\nTELL NO ONE<br>\r\nBRING NO ONE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what the card, the only contents of the envelope, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was now legitimately worried. Who was reaching out to him? What could they possibly want with him? The lion just got to town. How could someone be after him now? The lion thought about calling the police. Maybe they've dealt with something like this before. Or he could just ignore this altogether, pretend nothing. But deep down, Evan was curious. What did they want?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We told you not to tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was sitting in the back of a police car parked in a lot across from Z\u00e3f, a gourmet restaurant in the tourism district of Port Zaftig. As soon as Evan saw the note, he called the police. Moments later, a hulking gorilla knocked on the door. The beast was close to seven feet tall and his body was a mass of muscle. Pecs and biceps strained his uniform, quads threatened to burst out of his pants. The lion explained the note and the weird message from last night to the gorilla who looked indifferent. \"We should take you downtown to the station,\" the gorilla suggested. \"If someone is stalking you, it's not safe to stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion sat quietly in the back of the cop car as the gorilla silently drove through town. His massive body nearly took up the entire front end of the car. Although Evan didn't know where the police department was, he got the feeling it wasn't located in the city's tourism district. But the menacing demeanor of the gorilla kept Evan from saying anything until they reached that parking lot and the gorilla spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what are you talking about? And I thought we were going to the station!\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We told you not to tell anyone,\" the gorilla repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We? Who are you? What's your name and badge number, Officer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast chuckled, looking down at his uniform as if he forgot what he was wearing. \"Name's Wrath,\" he spoke. \"And I'm not a cop. The opposite, actually.\" The gorilla wasn't even looking at Evan as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion reached for the door handle and pulled. It was locked. \"What the hell do you want?\" yelled Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been chosen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chosen for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorilla looked over his right shoulder slightly. \"The Seven Sins Society.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" Evan was baffled. He had never heard of such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorilla resumed looking straight ahead. \"This city is evil. Full of evil. You might not be able to tell, but it is. Crooks, cowards, drunkards and gamblers. Port Zaftig is home to no saint.\" The gorilla paused; Evan said nothing. \"The Society takes advantage of this. If a fur is evil deep down, why not cash in on it? Why not make a profit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want from me?\" The lion asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been chosen. We need an Accolade. Each Sin has its Accolade, and that Accolade serves as an exemplar for that Sin, sees that Sin in others, corrurpts others and haresses their Sin to acquire power and money. I'm the Accolade of Wrath. I bring furs into the underground fighting circuits, run protection rackets, whip up a riot when need be, and the like. And there are others who are equally skilled at exploiting a fur's darker nature. Lust has every prostitute in her pocket, Pride has every politician in his own. And we Accolades reap the rewards of the Sins others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I still don't see what this has to do with me,\" the lion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorilla let out a heavy sigh. \"We need a new Accolade of Greed. The previous Accolade met with an...explosive end. And you've been chosen. This city hasn't corrupted you yet. You're going to be the new Accolade of Greed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I am!\" Evan shot back. \"I don't want to be a part of your cult gang thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorilla in the front of the police car let you a loud holw of laughter. \"You have much less choice in that matter than you think! Now, enough talk. We need to see how greedy our new Greed can get.\" He extended a thick finger in the direction of the restaurant. \"Z\u00e3f. Ever been? Heard it's good.\" The lion heard a loud click; the car's door were unlocked. \"Why don't you check it out? I think you habe a reservation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan quickly opened his door and got out. The moment he slammed it shut, the police car sped away and disappeared amongst the rest of traffic.</span></div></div>",

He knew that it was him they wanted to pull over; his was the only car on the road. The lion pulled over and parked his car. Bashing his head against the steering wheel a few times, Evan chewed himself out for speeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he knew he was speeding. The lion was trying to get out of town as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Wrath let him out in that parking lot earlier in the day, Evan flagged down a taxi. The moment he got home, the lion began packing a bag. He wasn't sure if he was going to be gone a few days or few weeks, so he just threw into a duffle bag what he felt were essentials. In less than an hour, the lion was back on the road. Destination? No place in particular. Anywhere where he couldn't be found by <i>them</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion pulled out his license and registration. The officer was taking his sweet time getting out of the cop car. Evan was getting impatient. Each second parked was one less second spent getting as far away from Port Zaftig as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood in the lion's body froze when an impossibly muscular gorilla hauled itself out of the car. It was Wrath. Panicked, Evan ignited the engine. The gorilla was mere inches away from the car when the lion slammed on the gas pedal. Rubber burned as the car peeled out back onto the road. He checked the rearview mirror again. The gorillas was standing there, watching as Evan sped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe his vacation from Port Zaftig would be a bit more permanent.</span></div></div>",

He didn't know who could be knocking at this hour. Glancing through the peephole, Evan couldn't make out anything. Something was blocking his view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curiousity killed the cat,\" Evan muttered as he opened the door. A fur holding a tall stack of white boxes came charging through the open door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delivery!\" the fur yelled as they passed  Evan. The lion was caught off guard as the stranger rushed to set the stack on his kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? I didn't order anyth-\" The lion watched as the fur, a rabbit an inch taller than him, take off his white cap and shake loose his lush, golden shoulder length hair. Evan was taken aback by the sheer beauty of this fur. Easily, this was one of the prettiest rabbits he had ever seen, with a handsome face and silky smooth off-white fur. It took the lion a moment before he tore his eyes away from the gorgeous bunny who was now fixing his hair using his cellphone camera. \"Like I was saying, I didn't order anything! You've got the wrong address or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, this is the right place.\" The rabbit wasn't even looking at Evan while he talked as he was far too focused on getting his wavy hair just right. \"After all, you've been chosen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been...wait, who are you? And what the hell do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit walked passed Evan who caught a whiff of the fur's flowery perfume. He shut the door and then started unbuttoning his white shirt. \"Don't want to give anyone a free show!\" In a matter of seconds, the rabbit was clad only in white y-front briefs, his uniform tossed onto the ground. The bunny looked like he was carved out of marble. Cut six-pack abs, rippling muscles, defined quads, and a round yet firm rear. He didn't have an ounce of fat on him. Once more, Evan was entranced by the beauty of the creature as he casually strolled over to the boxes and unstacked them. Each was stamped with a logo from Heavenly Bakery. It was the same logo that was on shirt that now laid on the floor. \"Ah, much better. I hate having to put on a costume. Anyways, as I was saying, you've been chosen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chosen for what?\" asked Evan as he watched the hunky fur open up the boxes. Cakes, cookies, and numerous other kinds of baked goods filled each box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the Seven Sins Society.\" The lion was silent. \"Never heard of us, have you? That's good. We like to be secretive. The Society believes that deep down, every fur is a bit evil. That every fur has a sin. And that sin, we believe, can be exploited. In the Society, every sin has an Accolade, and that Accolade's responsibility is to kind of serve as an ideal for that sin. This draws in furs who are naturally attracted to that kind of sin. The Accolade then manipulates them to their will and uses them and their sin for the benefit of the Society as a whole. I am Pride. And I've got pretty much every political leaders in this city in my pocket. Little do they know they they're all in some way, shape, or form working for the Society's ends. All I need to do with stroke their ego, in a way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what do you want with me?\" Evan asked quietly. The rabbit approached the lion and wrapped a muscled arm around his shoulder as they walked towards the living room couch. He was enamored by the rabbit and hoped that what was stirring to life in his shorts wouldn't be noticable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sloth recently met with a tragic end,\" Pride said as the bunny sat Evan down on the couch. \"What a shame, too. Nice enough guy if you could stand the smell. And he got plenty of work done. You wouldn't have guessed it knowing he rarely left his bed. But when he went, so did all of his Acolytes. They worked for him and only through him. Now we need to rebuild that network, and to do that, we need a new Sloth. And you'd be perfect. You haven't been corrupted by this city yet. We've been watching. The Society has eyes and ears in places you'd never expect eye and ears to be. So you can be crafted into the new Accolade for Sloth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I don't want to work for your group! You're evil! You exploit furs! And what do you mean you want me to be Sloth?\" Evan asked pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit stiffled a laugh. \"You don't really have much of a choice in the matter. You've been chosen, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chosen by who? By what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pretty bunny hushed Evan. \"That's enough questions for now. We've got to get you ready to fill in you're new role as the Accolade of Sloth.\" The rabbit grabbed a box from the kitchen counter and sat on the coffee table across from the lion. He grabbed a sugar-covered doughnut from the box and held it up to Evan's mouth. \"Open up, Sloth,\" Pride said with a smirk on his face.</span></div></div>",

The lion groaned as he gently rubbed a paw against the mass that was now his stomach. It was heavily distended and made him look as if he was several months pregnant. Taking in his surroundings, he saw empty white boxes stern about his living room; the contents of them all were now resting in the lion's gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan found his grey shorts laying on one of the arms of couch. On top of them were the y-fronts the bunny wore the night before who was nowhere to be found. Glancing towards the door, the lion saw that the bunny's clothes were gone; the fur must have left some time ago. The lion picked up the briefs and raised them to his nose, taking a deep breath in. The lingering musk of the beautiful rabbit instantly aroused the lion who began pleasuring himself as he inhaled more and more of the rabbit's scent. Evan couldn't be bothered to get up and grab a tissue, so he erupted all over himself adding more to his messy fur. The lion began reaching for his shorts to wipe himself off, but he felt lazy and worn out from getting himself off. Instead, he grabbed for the remote and turned on the television. \"It'll dry out anyways,\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, he stomach had deflated considerable. The lion hadn't left the couch all day; the feeding last night left him too lethargic to do anything. But Evan was feeling like he needed a real meal in him. Grabbing his phone, he found a cheap Mexican place nearby, El Diablito Burrito, and placed an order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pudgy raccoon delivering Evan his meal had to hide his look of disgust as he watched the lion sign the credit card receipt. The lion finally managed to put on a pair of shorts, but hadn't bothered to do much else. Glaze icing from the night before was still stuck to one of his cheeks. Taking the bags from the raccoon, Evan lazily walked back to the couch and set his meal on the table brushing aside the white boxes. He had ordered two very large burritos as well as plenty of rice and beans. The lion pulled off his shorts once more, sat himself down again, and began devouring his meal. Soon enough, his belly was just as bloated as it was before if not more so. Globs of cheese and rice now stuck to the lion's yellow and cream colored fur. It was getting dark outside, and the lion drifted off to sleep in front of the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an entire week, that was just how Evan spent his day. He'd wake up, order food, stuff himself full, fall, asleep, and wake up only to devour more food. The lion rarely left his couch each to go to the bathroom or answer the door for his delivery. He couldn't even be bothered to get himself cleaned up. The apartment reeked of his musk and flatulence, his fur was matted down and greasy. And the most exercise he got was getting himself off several times a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on his butt and stuffing himself full was having an impact on his waistline. His flat abdomen had ballooned out into a sizable gut that rested on his lap. Though soft and jiggly, it typically was so full and took on the appearance of a basketball. His chest was puffing up into two mounds of fat, Evan's nipples widened a bit. And the lion's rear was getting pudgier and rounder (not like get noticed, though).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, the lion woke up on the couch. Scratching his belly, he reached for his phone to look up some photos of hot furs to pleasure himself to. Evan saw the date and realized that it was well past a week since he came to Port Zaftig. But in that time, all he did was eat and sit on the couch. The lion justified it to himself as a kind of stay-cation, and that he deserved a break from the multi-day road trip it took him to get into town. Yet he felt like he need to get off his butt and get out of the apartment, if he could be bothered to.</span></div></div>",

Shoving him out into the hallway of his apartment building, Evan didn't even give Pride the opportunity to grab the clothes he came in with. The bunny tried to overpower the lion, but he was ultimately able to oust the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll regret this!\" Pride shouted from the hall as Evan slammed the door closed. \"I know powerful people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, a squad of beefy police officers stormed Evan's apartment. The lion was in a state of confusion as they cuffed him, saying something about bank fraud and conspiracies and obstruction. He was whisked away as officers tore apart him apartment. The lion passed by a couple officers carrying up boxes of documents in the direction of his apartment on his way out. In less than an hour, Evan was processed booked into the city jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was promised a speedy trail, and he got one. The jury came back with a guilty verdict in less than twenty minutes. His lawyer expected as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This case is airtight!\" the lawyer had told Evan. \"It's a paper case against you!

The clock just turned over to 10:35pm when he heard the silky, sultry voice from the shadows. The lion looked around to find the source of voice amongst the trees and rocks that lined the lake of Nightingale Park. From around a boulder appeared a mink. She was around the same height as Evan and had an incredible hourglass shape to her body that even the lion could make out in the dark. The light of the moon shined off her light brown fur as she slowly approached Evan. She was wearing a tight leather bodysuit that softly creaked as her chest and butt bounced up and down with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chosen for what?\" asked Evan while trying not to obviously check her generous proportions out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the Seven Sin Society,\" she said. She leaned against a tree, sticking out her wide hips. \"Our people have been watching you for some time now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? And what's this Seven Sin Society?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got eyes everywhere. The Society has a basic principle at its core: Every fur has a bit of sin in them. We cash in on that idea. We find what lies within a fur and exploit it. Well, maybe exploit isn't the right word. We 'cultivate' that sin, let them bring it out. Let them live with it. And the Society is there is skim a little off the top. I'm Lust, and I use a fur's darker sexual desires for our benefit. Every pimp and prostitute in this town pays a little out to me, for example. Hell, I practically recruited every single one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want with me?\" asked Evan nervously. \"I don't want to be a hooker or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink laughed out loud. \"Oh no, we have different plans for you. You see, for every sin we have an Accolade. That Accolade functions both as embodiment of that sin as well as a means to attract and recruit furs to do our bidding.\" She starting walking towards Evan, her hips swaying left and right as she walked. The lion took a couple of steps back but found himself with his back against a tree. Lust pressed her body against his, her busty chest flattening against him. \"We lost our Accolade of Gluttony. The poor boy, so young. When we he went, we lost all of the Acolytes that served him. They only worked for him and through him, so we need that network rebuilt. And now we want you to fill his big, big role.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but I don't want to join some sort of criminal gang!\" Evan stammered. The mink laughed, taking one of his paws and placing it on her plump backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please, baby?\" she pouted. \"We can have so, so much fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...this is...I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink smirked as she produced a vial from a pocket in her suit. It contained a luminescent red substance. \"Here, sweetie,\" she said unscrewing the cap. \"I've got a little something that should make you feel more the part of the Accolade of Gluttony you were meant to be.\" She raised the vial up to Evan's mouth. \"Drink up!\"</span></div></div>",

The lion took a second to take in his surroundings. He was lying on the ground, a green grassy field. Looking around, the lion recognized that he was in Nightingale Park. Two chunky cubs were standing over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I'm okay...\" Evan said, picking himself off the ground. The lion brushed himself off. While he was still wearing the clothes he had on last night, they were all disheveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! Told ya he was alive!\" one cub said to the other. \"Race you to the swings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evan wandered out of the park, he tried to recollect what happened the night before. He remembered walking to the park, but he couldn't remember why he was there or what had happened. The only thing that stuck in his mind was the image of a vial of luminescent red fluid and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way back to his apartment, the lion passed by El Burrito Diablito. Though he was in a state, Evan realized that he didn't eat much the day before. His stomach growled in protest. Shrugging, he stepped inside to pick up a taco or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I'll have six bean burritos, five tacos, two Mexican pizzas, four sides of rice and three quesadillas.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was shocked. Standing at the front counter of the restaurant, the lion planned on only getting a snack. Yet when he went to make his order, those words just blurted out of him with no way of stopping himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"And a large Coke.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour was a blur for the lion. He wanted to cancel the order, but Evan just couldn't will himself to do it. It was as if he was being compelled to sit, wait for his food, and when it got to him, ravenously devour it. The lion felt like he was watching himself suck down burrito after burrito, pour bowls of rice down his throat, and chugging loads of soda. Other furs in the restaurant looked on in repulsion as the lion feasted, beans and cheese starting to cling to the fur around his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when all of the food was gone did Evan feel like himself again. The lion didn't know what came over him. But he felt embarrasses about making a scene. Quickly bussing his table, he rushed out of the restaurant, his belly feeling ready to explode at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Evan was still resting on the couch of his apartment. While his stomach was no longer in such pain, he did feel very full. A rumble sounded from his stomach, and moments later pressure was relieved from his rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, why did I have some many bean burritos...\" he said fanning a paw by his nose. The lion got up to get himself a glass of water from the kitchen. Sitting by the garbage can was the empty Purgatory Pizza box from the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Pizza sounds good! I should totally get a pizza!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion was startled by the intrusive thought. He didn't want pizza! He was still full from all that Mexican food! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Pepperoni and triple cheese! That's hit the spot!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! Evan felt that he had to restrain himself. But a voice deep inside of him was compelling him. The lion was so full! But...pizza did sound good...</span></div></div>",

The mink sauntered in, chuckling to herself when she saw Evan in a crumpled heap on top of the wide bed, naked sans a thick metal collar chained to a nearby bolt in the concrete wall, his body frail and weak. Silk and satin bedsheets were lying on the floor. The lion's eyes were glazed over as he slowly panted. The lion was still feeling sore; the previous Client had been pretty rough with his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lust approached Evan, the lion felt vitriol and hatred boil up inside him. He wanted to take a swing at her but knew that any harm to her would be dealt tenfold to him. That was a lesson he learned quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion remembered first meeting the mink in the park those months ago. He remembered the offer. He remembered the refusal. He remembered the struggle, then the fight, then the hulking gorilla appearing seemingly out of thin air to manhandle Evan. He remembered first waking up in the room that he hasn't left since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the edge of the bed, cupping Evan's cheek and cooing. \"Aww, poor baby. Tuckered out?\" He said nothing. \"Don't worry. You have just one more Client today, and then you can rest up!\" The lion remained silent. \"And I think you'll like him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLust excitedly got up and went to the door. She peaked her head into the hallway and shouted \"He's ready, Derrick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan glanced up as he saw an enormous German Shepard waddle into his room. The dog was so massive that he needed to turn sideways to get through the door frame. Well on his way to a half ton, the dog's t-shirt and sweatpants look panted on to his blubbery frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well, you two have fun!\" Lust said, patting the dog on his pudgy arm. \"And feel free to be less than gentle. I heard he likes a little pain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shut the door behind her, leaving Evan and the big dog alone who was licking his chops as he eyed the lion's thin body. The dog reached a paw down the front of his sweatpants and the other began pulling them down from the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute butt,\" he said, smirking while approaching the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chains clinked against themselves as Evan dutifully presented himself to the Client. He felt the dog's huge belly rest on his lower back as the Client pulled Evan's hips back towards his pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lion's butt cheeks were parted like they were many times before, Evan reflected on that fateful night. Was the offer really that bad?</span></div></div>",

Stabbing pains pierced Evan's stomach as it ached and groaned while struggling to digest his oversized meal. He hadn't made it that far into the park itself; his apartment building could still be seen in the distance. Placing a paw on his swollen and distended belly that was pressing tight against his shirt, Evan took a few slow, deep breathe to alleviate the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short break, the lion felt ready to continue. He then heard an unusual noise of in the distance. It sounded both rhythmic and distraught, and it was coming closer. Moments later, Evan recognized the noise as heavy panting. And when he saw the fur slowly jogging around the bend of the park's concrete path, the lion understood why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah huffed and puffed as his flabby belly bounced up and down. Each heavy step sent shockwaves through the fur's immense and soft body. The grey sweatshirt and sweatpants he wore clung to his obese frame, the former of which was starting to rise up, exposing distorted black and orange spots of the cheetah's fur. His stride was quite small as his blubbery thighs fought to pass by one another. Loud swishing sounds made it evident how tight his legs were rubbing against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah didn't notice Evan watch as he jogged along the path at a snail's pace. Sweat poured down the cheetah's plump cheeks and rolled down his chins. He didn't acknowledge Evan as he slowly jogged by the lion who was now mesmerised by this spectcle. The cheetah seemed focused on his mission. Evan saw the big cat's big backside after he waddled by, the sweatpants straining to contain the masses of cellulite. A long orange and black spotted tail hung lazily over the cheetahs ballooned up butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah was nearly out of sight when Evan saw him suddenly tumble to the ground with a loud \"OH SHI-\". The lion got up and quickly walked over to the big cat trying not to jostle around his stomach too much. Lying on the ground clutching his ankle, the cheetah moaned in pain. The left leg of his sweatpants had spit open due to the fall and the cat's pillowy thigh swelled up out of it. The area was particularly dark and not lit very well due to the many tall and shady trees nearby. Evan surmised that the cheetah had tripped over one of the several roots that had started to overtake the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, man! Are you okay?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah once again groaned in pain. \"No, my ankle is killing me!\" He rubbed a meaty paw along the joint as best as he could. The cat's colossal belly made reaching it a bit difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you break your ankle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe? I don't know. It just hurts really bad! I might have just strained it, but I'm not sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan wasn't sure what to do. If the cheetah indeed broke his ankle, then he definitely needed to call an ambulance. But the big cat's ankle didn't look broken. It might just be a bad strain. If that was the case, then Evan could try and take him the cat back to his apartment and ice his ankle.</span></div></div>",

While they still each had sizeable guts, both were heavily muscled no doubt thanks to lifting the gargantuan furs of Port Zaftig. They helped the cheetah get on to the reinforced stretcher which still groaned under his weight. The paramedics loaded the cheetah into the back and collected some contact information from Evan. Lights and sirens blaring, the ambulance drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough excitement for the day, so the lion headed back home, his walked have been substantially shortened. Nevertheless, it had done its job. Although bloated, the lion was no longer as painfully full as he was some time ago. Back at his apartment, the lion yanked off all his clothes and hopped into bed drifting off to sleep minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's phone buzzed on the nightstand as a digital tune rang out. The lion picked up the phone. It was from a number he didn't recognize. Checking the time, he saw that it was early in the afternoon. The massive pizza and the long road trip into town must have really done a number on him; he needed the rest. Curious, the lion swiped across the phone's screen to accept the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, hello!

Palm trees and exotic plants decorated the front of the property making it appear like a venerable jungle. The car stopped in front of a pair of wide mahogany doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are, sir,\" the driver mumbled. The lion thanked him and stepped out of the car. Evan approached the front door and, before he could knock, both doors swung open revealing a spacious and warm entryway decorated with ornate paintings and thick, lush carpet. Sitting inside on an electric wheelchair was the cheetah who was wearing a silky red robe that mostly hung open exposing roll after roll of plump fat and distorted spots on his fur. His injured ankle was propped up and wrapped in bandages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan! I'm glad you made it!\" Alexander said as he pushed a stick forward on the chair's arm.

Besides, I wanted to get out and see the town a bit. It's boring being up here all day. That, and I didn't want the neighbors seeing me sweating my butt off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, but why were you out joggin-\" Evan was cut off by a soft chiming noise off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Dinner's ready! Follow me!\" The lion followed behind the cheetah in his wheelchair as the poor machine whined while it pulled the fat cat through the house. Alexander lead Evan to the patio where a large spread had been laid out. Roast, potatoes, carrots, corn, buttery roll and the works were stemming away waiting to be eaten. Evan's mouth watered as he got closer to the food. The cheetah drove his wheelchair up to one of the edge of the table, gesturing for Evan to take a seat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour and a half, the two furs quietly devoured the food laid out for them as the sun disappeared below the horizon. While the cheetah was swallowing down food at a much faster rate than Evan, the lion was keeping up a decent pace. At one point, Evan had to stealthily unbutton his pants to let his swollen belly free. But nevertheless, he was enjoying himself. The food was extremely tasty, easily one of the tastiest meals he ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah was dabbing up the last of some sauce with a bread roll as Evan sat panting in his chair. Everything was now in their bellies, though Alexander kept happily munching away on the remains. If Evan was stuffed last night, he now felt like he was ready to explode. The taunt curve that was now his belly forced his shirt to ride up, exposing a couple of inches of off-white fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah popped the last of the roll I to his mouth. \"Ready for dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan groaned in response. \"Ugh... I'll have to pass...I feel like I'm ready to pop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you don't look so hot,\" Alexander said as Evan rubbing his gut. \"Hey, if you'd like, you can sleep all that off here! I've got a guest bedroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh that's too kind...\" moaned Evan. \"But I probably should be heading home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come! You're in no state to be heading home! Please, stay! It won't be any trouble on my part!\"</span></div></div>",

I don't he has too many friends these days. So it's nice he's socializing. Too bad he had to take a trip to the hospital for that to happen. But still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan walked behind Miss Maple, one of Alexander's servants, down the hall as she showed the lion to the bedroom he'd be staying in. Following the portly panda through the halls, Evan clutched his overstuffed belly trying not to jostle it around too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are!\" Miss Maple said as she opened a pair of double doors. The two stepped inside and she turned on the lights. The bedroom was enormous, easily the size of Evan's entire apartment. The whole eastern wall was made of glass and faced out over the ocean. Opposite to it was a wall with many large dressers against it, and bookcases lined the rest of the walls. In the center of the room was an equally enormous bed. Judging just by looks, Evan guesses that he could more than easily spread out his arms and legs and still would have plenty of room in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you didn't bring any nightwear with you?\" asked Miss Maple. Evan shook his head. \"No problem. I'm sure one of Mister Alexander's pajamas are around here somewhere...\" While Evan took in the bedroom, the panda servant searched through the drawers. After a minute of searching, she pulled out from an open drawer two vast swaths of red silky  garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! Found them!\" she said. Miss Maple unfolded one of them, the shirt, and held it up. It was obviously several times too large for Evan. \"Oh dear, I think this is a little big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I think it'll work,\" replied Evan. Miss Maple left him and the lion changed into the silk pajamas. They looked like a tent on the lion, the shirt went down to his knees and he needed to hold up the pants with a paw as he shuffled over to the light switch. As he collapsed in bed, the rich silk rubbed against his fur. The lion purred in delight. The sensation of the smooth silk against the tight skin of his belly was amazing, and within minutes Evan was fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, the lion woke up. It was still very dark in the bedroom, but he couldn't help but notice that sitting on the nightstand was a large chocolate cake. It was, no doubt, the dessert he skipped out on, and one of the servants must have dropped it off while he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan picked off a bit of the icing with his paw and tasted it. It was smooth and rich and very, very chocolatey. Next to the cake was a knife, fork, and plate. Though the lion was still somewhat full, his stomach had deflated enough to the point that he felt he could eat a slice or two. Or three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet right when he was about to cut into the cake, Evan heard a loud crashing sound from down the hallway. It noise startled the lion. At first, he thought about checking it out. After all, someone might be in trouble. But the house was pretty big and Evan didn't want to get lost or go somewhere where he shouldn't be.</span></div></div>",

The big cat's ripped sweatpants laid on the floor leaving his chunky thighs exposed, though his pudgy rump was still covered by a pair of incredibly large black breifs. The two masses, looking like a couple of cottage cheese filled pillow cases, spread out as the cheetah sat down. The fat fur huffed and puffed, still exhausted from his run and his journey to the Evan's apartment. He heaved his huge body over to lay down and rested his injured ankle ont the arm of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting a paw on his still full gut, the lion made his way to the fridge to create a makeshift ice pack for the cheetah. \"Do you think it's broken?\" he asked, placing the ice pack on the cheetah's thick ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I think I just sprained it,\" he replied. \"God, what a bad way to start a diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say. It'll be at least a week before you can go out jogging again,\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Just another week for me to sit on my fat butt and keep ballooning up...\" the cheetah moaned. \"Maybe I should just get my jaw wired shut. Then I won't be able to stuff my face all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so down! You'll heal up soon and be ready to shed some pounds again!\" Evan gave the cheetah's plump thigh a pat, sending ripples through the fat. \"Name's Evan, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexander. Thanks for helping me out,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no problem! Least I could!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah glanced over to the coffee table where the empty pizza box sat. \"Oh...I haven't had pizza in days. I don't have my phone on me. Do you think you could, um, order me one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shot the cheetah a confused look. \"Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But come on!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lion closed the apartment door behind him and he set a bag down on the kitchen counter. While the store on his street corner mostly sold junk food and the like, he did find a box of antacid tablet that ought to soothe his aching stomach. And, since Evan was quite parched from the pizza, purchased a bottle of lemon-lime flavored soda. However, the only bottles they had massive 3L bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, do you have anything smaller?\" Evan asked the obese rhino behind the counter. He only grunted in response, his eyes not leaving the small television next to the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the lion realized that while the apartment came with a lot of furniture, it didn't come with anything in the way of cups or glasses. Nor did Evan pack any with him. This left him in a bit of a pickle since the antacid tablets needed to be dissolved in liquid to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, he had a substitute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the large soda bottle his coffee table, Evan unscrewed the top. He then broke up a few of the tablets to fit past the bottles neck. Dropping the tablet fragments in, they started to bubble and fizz, added even more bubbles to the already bubbly soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sat down on the couch and grabbed the bottle with both paws. He raised it to his mouth and started drinking. Almost immediately the dissolved tablets has a positive effect on the lion's belly. Gone were the stabbing pains of being excessively full. As he continued drinking, all the pain simply vanished. On top of that, the soda was exceptional delicious, easily the most delicious soda he ever drank. The lion felt compelled to take drink after drink, wanting to taste even more of that tasty liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until the bottle was empty that Evan realized that he somehow sucked down the whole bottle. He originally planned only to drink some of it. Now, all three liters of soda we're churning away in his belly which was now a cream furred sphere nearly the size of a small beach ball. Evan was shocked at how big his gut was. Sure, he had been full before, but he looked enormous. The lion pulled off his shirt and rubbed a paw along the taught skin of his belly that was taking up a considerable amount of his lap. It didn't hurt touching the bloated sphere. It was just bizarre to Evan that it was all him. Groans and creaks sounded from the lion's belly as he continued to gently rub the mass. Thinking that he ought to lay down, Evan tried picking himself up off from the couch. Yet the sheer weigh in his belly pulled him right back down as his gut wobbled and the contents inside slushed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'm stuck here for a while,\" Evan said while chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion was finally able to get off the couch hours later after an evening and burping and deflating. By the next morning, his stomach had resumed its typically flat state. Evan was still amazed how big his stomach got. It looked like someone pumped him up like a balloon. The lion then became curious if he could do it again, to see if he could swell up his belly just as big. But then again, he didn't want to end up with a painfully bloated belly either.</span></div></div>",

But the lion figured that it wouldn't hurt to see if any were around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the sheer enormity of the apartments, the seventh floor didn't have as many units as most buildings would have. Only five other apartments existed in the floor. 702 and 704 were directly to his left and right respectively and it would make sense for Evan to introduce himself to furs he'd be sharing walls with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan peaked into the hallway. Unit 701 was at one far end of the hall. The lion spotted a few small boxes that had been delivered to that apartment and left outside. The resident might not be in, but he could see for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n705 was two unit away from him on the right.

Evan didn't recalled seeing them this morning when he was moving in; they must have been delivered recent. All three of the boxes were small, and each looked beaten and battered: Corners crushed in, address labels torn, cardboard flaps hanging loosely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them were addressed from the same location:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEPISTEME LABS - ZAFTIG CITY DIVISION<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4597 FOOL'S GOLD AVE.<br>\r\nZAFTIG CITY 97212<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all three were addressed to the same fur: Daniel Taffington. At least now Evan knew the name of who lived here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion was about to head back to his apartment when he thought about those boxes again. They looked to be rough shape, and they were just sitting there in plain sight. Perhaps Evan should be a good neighbor and take them home.

It was well into the evening when everything was in its proper place. Everything, that is, except for the three small packages sitting on his kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how beaten up and battered the packages were, Evan thought he'd be doing whoever lived in 701 a favor by holding on to them until they got home to make sure they didn't get damaged even more. Periodically throughout the day, Evan peeked his head out into the hallway to see if the resident of 701 had made it home yet. Not once did Evan hear any fur make their way down that part of the long hallway or interact with the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne final time for the night, Evan looked out into the hallway in the direction of 701. This time, however, the door was ajar. The lion grabbed the three boxes and made his way to the unit. Knocking on the door, it swung open slightly. No lights were on inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Uh, Daniel? I've got some packages for you!\" Evan hollered into the apartment. No response came. He felt around for a switch by the door and found one. He flicked it, illuminating the apartment. The unit was mostly empty. Evan slowly stepped inside to investigate. Nothing was there. No furniture, no dishes, nothing left in the cupboards. The only things that were left were some trash scattered on the floor and a few sheet of notebook paper with illegible writing scrawled on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced that the apartment had been abandoned, Evan returned to his own. Setting the packages back into the counter, he looked at them and pondered what to do next. They all came from Episteme Labs, specifically the Zaftig City branch. They might have a division here in Port Zaftig. If so, Evan could drop them off there and they'd certainly be in safe hands. But the lion was also curious what the packages held. The boxes looked pretty rough and it wouldn't take much to open them up and peek inside. And why not? If whoever lived in 701 didn't bother to stick around for them, what would be the problem with Evan checking what's inside?</span></div></div>",

Rushing to the toilet, the lion tried making himself throw up to get rid of what was poisoning him, but he soon blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion had no idea how long he had been lying on the floor. However, he did feel much more better now. Grabbing the vial, he threw it against one of the wall while quietly swearing. As Evan picked himself off the ground, he noticed that his fur, typically a golden hue, was now a shade of blue. He panicked as he got up and looked at himself in the bathroom mirror. All of his fur now was some shade of blue. His arms, legs, face, chest, even his belly was a hue of blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the other major change to Evan's body. Typically flat as a board, his stomach had swollen up massively. His gut now stuck out over a foot and a half in front of him, blocking his view of his own feet. The lion's shirt was too small to cover it all up and was now ridding up around his chest. Were the lion able to see, he could find that at some point the button of his pants exploded off, allowing his belly to sink down a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starred in astonishment. Evan picked up the mass with both paws, lifting it up before letting it go. It wobbled and bounced around. The lion swore he heard the distinct sound of sloshing. Evan didn't feel full or anything, so he wasn't sure what exactly was making that noise. The lion continues to jostle and prod his belly, as if testing to see if it was real. It was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was spooked. That liquid had done something to him, and he needed to reverse that, if it could be reversed. Worst of all, the lion wasn't sure this was the end. He hoped nothing else would happen to him, but Evan couldn't take that chance. Maybe now was the right time to reach out to Episteme Labs. They might know what he drank and they could have something to change him back. Or, he could break into Unit 701 again. Sure, it was empty the last time Evan went in.

The bedroom was empty sans an old discarded sock in a corner of the room. The bathroom, too, held nothing useful. The kitchen didn't have anything for him to work with. And the living room held nothing either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was distraught. He needed to find something quick, something that could change him back, shrink down his belly, un-blue him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the lion felt a sharp stabbing pain in his gut. He grabbed at his ballooned up belly as Evan doubled over in pain. It felt as if many sharp knives were slicing the skin of his stomach. Dropping to his hands and knees, he roared in pain hoping that maybe one of the other tenets will hear him. The sharp slicing pains were soon accompanied by a suddenly feeling of intense fullness as if the lion just got done devouring a large feast. Tears formed in the lion's eyes as he felt his belly expand even bigger, drooping lower and lower until the nearly reached the floor. Evan shook in agony and he could hear more sloshing from inside him. He felt his furry belly brush against the cold hardwood floor of the living room. Then, just as rapidly as it had arrived, the pain left Evan and his belly stopped expanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollapsing onto the floor, the lion panted and groaned as he gently rubbed a paw against his expanded middle. His blue gut had the consistency of a water balloon, bouncing and wobbling as he pressed his paw into it. This wasn't fat, he reasoned. It was something...else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan tried to get back onto his feet. But the new weight in his midsection along with the sheer exhaustion from that painful episode made it impossible for him to move. Instead, the lion found himself fading in and out of consciousness lying on the floor until his eyes finally shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's eyes slowly opened as they adjusted to the sunlight that was now pouring in from the living room windows. Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, he saw standing over him was a fur. An otter, young looking with dark brown fur. The fur was extremely skinny, however, the clothes he was wearing looked like a tent on him. His white shirt went down nearly to his knees and he was holding up his baggy pants with one of his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you alive?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah I am,\" Evan said groggily. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I? That's what should be asking you! And what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Evan. And, uh, I found some packages outside of this place and...\" Evan bashfully patted a paw on his blue furred belly. A small shockwave rippled through it. \"The next thing I know I'm blue all over! And growing! I didn't have this belly yesterday! And it's only getting bigger! And I'm blue! My fur isn't supposed to be blue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh no...\" the otter said. \"Please don't tell me you... those needed to be...I knew I should have...Did you drink all of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just the blue one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter sighed a little bit. \"Okay, okay, so it's not that bad. Still bad, but not as bad as it could have been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad? What the hell did I drink?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know,\" the otter replied. \"A colleague of mine, a botanist, wanted me to run tests on some samples. They were all specimens she and her expedition discovered deep in some jungles half a world away. She sent them here through the regular mail so they wouldn't raise any suspicions. But there was an...incident...at my workplace. At Episteme Labs.\" He sheepishly tugged on his oversized shirt. \"I had to leave here in a hurry. But I forgot about the specimens so I came back here to collect them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your apartment?\" asked Evan. \"I take it you're Daniel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's me.\" The otter knelt down and placed a paw on Evan's belly. \"And you said you've been getting...bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I passed out some time ago. My gut got bigger and it hurt like hell. I just ended up passing out afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing here anyways?\" The otter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know what was happening! I figured that there might be something here to tell me what's happening to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter sighed again. \"Well, there isn't. Look, we've got to get you out of here. I've got a set-up across town in a studio apartment that nobody should bother me or you in. I can try and run some tests there, figure out what you drank and if there's a way to change you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Evan was desperate for help, he wasn't going to get it from just anyone. Daniel said something about an \"incident\" at a lab. If he was a bad researcher, the otter could do more harm than good to the lion. However, getting answers from him might take too much time. And Evan wasn't sure how long he had left before he got too big, or worse.</span></div></div>",

His swollen, blue-furred belly rested on his lap sloshing around at the slightest movement. The otter had done a number of tests on the lion, but he wasn't finding anything that could tell them exactly what was happening to Evan and how they could possibly stop it, let alone reverse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion watched as Daniel sat at a microscope examining a blood sample taken from Evan. The otter, too, was only dressed in his underwear, a pair of loose boxers that looked a couple of sizes too big for him yet still were small enough to cling to his narrow hips. His comically oversized outfit laid crumpled on the floor by the front door. Evan didn't mind or care. The studio apartment was pretty stuffy and hot, its many windows let in lots of the sunlight and heat, and the building wasn't designed for air conditioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal,\" the otter while shaking his head. \"I mean, that's good in a way. But there's not much for me to go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Evan. \"You can't find anything out about what's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion sighed. \"I guess I'll be like this forever then,\" he said slapping his globe-like. It wobbled and shook for a few seconds before returning to its resting state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...Question: When was the last time you, uh, 'grew'?\" asked Daniel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I think it must have been a few hours before you found me. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just an idea. If I were to do some observations during one of those 'episodes', I might be able to find a clue about your condition. At the very least, it'll be a fascinating scientific phenomenon to observe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, if it'll help. I was hoping that you'd be able to do something before I got any bigger,\" complained Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but some things can't be rushed,\" replied the otter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do? Sit around and wait until I start blowing up again?\" the lion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, unfortunately. That is, unless I can find a way to stimulate the event to occur. Jump start it, you see. The possible problem with that idea is that if we trigger your...uh, inflation, then we might not be able to stop it. I mean, we have no evidence to conclude that you won't stop getting bigger, but that's just a risk we have to take into consideration.\"</span></div></div>",

His body was covered in electrodes, wires, and other devices meant to detect all sorts of biological information about him. Nearly the entire day had gone by as both furs waited to see if Evan's expansion would continue. The sun was setting in the sky, and nothing of interest had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think we should call it a day?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel check the measurements his equipment was collecting on Evan. \"Yeah, yeah. Nothing is popping up. We might want to give this a go tomorrow. Maybe something exciting will happen then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Now get this crap off me,\" the lion said, tugging on an electrode adhered to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel got up to take off all the equipment hooked up to Evan. Suddenly, a familiar pain was inflicting itself on the lion's body. The blue lion hissed in agony as skin around his thighs, butt, and chest erupted in slicing, cutting pains. \"Daniel! It's... happening again!\" Evan said through gritted teeth. The otter rushed back to his station, checking on his measurements. As Evan tried to endure the pain, he felt his thighs and rear swell up, filling out the metal chair he was sitting in, overflowing the sides. His hips were widening out and squeezing against the arms of the chair, which was now creaking under the lion's weight. From behind eyes squinting in agony, Evan saw his chest balloon up, two engorged breasts puffed up with dark blue nipples the size of silver dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than two minutes, the ordeal was over. Evan sat panting, trying to recompose himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Evan, are you okay?\" asked Daniel as he rushed over to the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I think so. Help me out of this thing...\" He raised an arm and the otter grabbed on. He pulled while Evan held the chair down. A few hearty tugs, and the lion was free. Examining himself, the lion saw that his thighs had billowed out into thick, pillowy masses that pressed against each other. Looking over his shoulder, he saw that he was now sporting a considerable bubble butt that was now stretching his underwear to its absolute limit. Even his tail looked thicker. Poking a paw into his expanded body, Evan heard the distinct sound of sloshing as he jiggled his thighs, smacked his rump, and shook his moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel careful began removing all of the wires and electrodes hooked up to Evan. \"Let's get these off. You've been through enough. Hopefully I collected all the information I need to draw some conclusions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce freed from the equipment, Evan waddled over to a couch on the far side of the studio apartment to rest. His entire body now wobbled and sloshed around, bouncing around as if he was now a lion-shaped water balloon. The couch groaned under the weight of his blown up rear as he sat his enlarged body down. Evan yawned loudly. The sheer amount of energy it took him to more his bigger body around combined with the expansion he just experienced left him extremely tired. So the lion closed his eyes and nodded off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the middle of the night when Evan woke up. The only light sources were the glowing from Daniel's monitors. The rest of the studio apartment was cast in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find anything, Daniel?\" the lion asked out loud. There was no response. \"Hey Daniel! You around?\" Still nothing.</span></div></div>",

His hips, much wider than they used to be, bumped into small device lying on a table he shuffled by, knocking to the ground as a loud clattering sounded throughout the room. From behind a dim monitor popped up Daniel, pulling headphones from his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Evan. Feeling any better now?\" the otter asked, getting up from his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I guess I am. As best as I can be even though I feel like a living water bed.\" He shook his gut for emphasis. Loud splashes could be heard inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...well, I haven't been able to pin down anything yet. But I...Evan...your chest...\" The lion look down as his plump moobs. His nipples had puffed up significantly, turning a shade of dark violet as well. Dribbling out of each nipple was a small stream of fluid, dark blue and somewhat watery. The stream dripped down off of his chest and rolled down over his globular gut. \"How long has...<i>that</i> been happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not sure. I just woke up not too long ago,\" replied Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter brought a paw up to one of Evan's leaking nipples. The lion hissed in pain as Daniel pressed against his sore and engorged nipple. The stream of blue liquid flowed slightly faster, some spilling on to Daniel's paw. He retracted it, bringing it up to his face to examine the specimen more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...smells fruity...\" Daniel said. He then stuck out his tongue and lapped the fluid off his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Are you sure tha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This...it tastes amazing!\" Daniel exclaimed. Once again, he pressed a paw against Evan's chest. Blue fluid squirted out of his nipple as the lion groan as he felt like a pressure was being taken off his chest. His paw now soaked in the blue fluid, Daniel licked it all up again, happily moaning as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan, I...uh, think I know how to, um, help you...\" the otter said, nervously eying the lion's puffed up nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I don't know if that's a good idea...\" said Evan, backing from the otter who was slowly pacing towards him, staring at his moobs.</span></div></div>",

Daniel didn't offer to help. Instead, the brown otter pounced, knocking Evan onto his back as he resumed sucking, his skinny body straddling the lion's belly and he did so. Evan simply let Daniel suck the juice from him as he squirmed in delight. The feeling of the otter working his nipple was practically orgasmic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what felt like hours, the two furs laid there intertwined. The only sounds in the lab were soft sucking sounds and deep moans. Daniel only stopped to switch nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the otter stopped.

But luckily for the red panda, all of the yardwork was done for the day. The hedges were trimmed, the flowerbeds were free of weeds, and the lawn was mowed. He was never a fan of yard work. Yet in a small town like Peevington, jobs were hard to come by and he had to pay rent somehow. And he certainly got paid well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling the lawn mower into the backyard, he pushed it back into the gardening shed, locking it away. More sweat was forming, and the thin fur pulled up the bottom of his tank top to dry his forehead, exposing his flat stomach to the warm air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lawn's looking good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the back deck of the house was Daniel. Jessie had been working for him for nearly a year now. The otter was nice enough, even if he was a bit of a recluse. Most of the time, he stayed in his home. The red panda didn't blame him. He moved here from Port Zaftig, and small town folk can be pretty mean to city dwellers. And the fact that Daniel was comically overweight gave them extra ammunition. Jessie guesses he must be three quarters of a ton. His gigantic belly stuck out several feet and drooped down past his knees. The otter's chest sported moobs as big as Jessie's head. And the poor guy was barely able to waddle around with his barrel-like thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel stood on the deck, clad only in shorts. His huge gut wobbled at even the slightest movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mr. Daniel!\" replied Jessie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter looked up to the clear blue sky. \"Getting hot, isn't it? Why don't you come inside for some ice water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessie sipped the cold water, he examined the inside of Daniel's home. It was the first time he was ever actually inside. It was spacious, obviously it had to be for such a fat fur to move around. It was also clean and well furnished and, most importantly, cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter waddled around the corner and joined the red panda in the kitchen. He handed the fur a wad of bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mr. Daniel!\" Jessie said. \"This is a very nice home you have here! Much better than my apartment. We don't even have AC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we liked to stay cool in this house,\" Daniel said as he drank from a large glass of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...we? I thought you lived alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. My, uh, friend Evan lives here. Come, I'll introduce you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two stood outside of a shut bedroom door. Daniel knocked twice and opened the door slightly, peaking inside. \"Evan, are you decent? I have someone to introduce you to!\" The otter pushed the door open. He gestured for Jessie to walk in, and the red panda nervously did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the Jessie you've been talking so much about?\" asked the blue lion, lounging on his side on a huge bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie was too stunned to speak. He had seen many lions before, but never one so blue, or so bulky. The lion's belly was tremendous, almost completely spherical, and nearly five feet wide. But to Jessie, it didn't look like fat. To him, it looked like a waterbed, almost. The lion adjusted his position a little bit and ripples went throughout his belly. Jessie knew it definitely wasn't fat. His moobs, as big as cantaloupes, sagged off his chest, each had a plump purple nipple on it. As Jessie slowly approached the lion, he could swear he saw a little bit of fluid leak from them. The lion's bottom half was covered by a sheet, but a quick glance and the red panda could tell his legs were just as bulbous. While not nearly as big as Daniel, this lion was still pretty massive, and something about him was jus-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know that staring is rude?\" the lion asked, a sly smile creeping across his face. His plump cheeks grew plumper <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry...it's just...\" Jessie stuck out a paw. \"Eh, I'm Jessie. Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan. Nice to meet you too.\" He shook the young red panda's paw. The lion's whole body jostled and jiggled about, his chest wobbling particularly violently. Jessie could now see a decent dribble of dark blue fluid drip from Evan's nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue lion saw what Jessie was looking at. \"Oops. Sorry. I guess I'm feeling extra juicy today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling extra...\" began Jessie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion grabbed one of his moobs and gave it a squeeze. A jet of liquid shot out, nearly hitting Jessie. \"Want to try some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should try some,\" Daniel said, leaning his massive body against the doorframe. \"It's quite tasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Jessie stuck a paw out and dabbed up someone the liquid. He brought his paw towards his mouth and licked a little. \"God...this...it's so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some more, handsome?\" asked Evan. The red panda nodded. He patted the bed next to him and soon Jessie was latched onto a nipple, sucking away, juice occasionally spilling down the side of his mouth. Evan leaned back and groaned. It had been too long since his last juicing. Through eyes half squinting in pleasure, he saw Daniel licking his lips. \"Jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little,\" muttered the otter. Jessie wasn't paying attention to either of them, instead just nuzzling himself closer to Evan's juice-filled body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you drop a pant size or two, I'll let you have some more,\" Evan said while caressing the back of Jessie's head. \"Remember: I need you to stay mobile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter whimpered. \"But I found someone to help out with juicing you! Just like I said I would! Don't I deserve a little something for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sighed, and then rolled into his black. Jessie adjusted himself and resumed sucking. \"Okay, fine, just a little. But you better get it quick. At the rate this guy is drinking, I'll be empty in a few hours if he don't pop first!\"</span></div></div>",

He readjusted the grip his paw had on the absurdly baggy pants he was holding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you're going to tell me!\" shouted Evan. \"I'm not going along with you until you fess up! I may be in a sorry state right now, but your story sounds really fishy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel sighed deeply. \"Okay, okay. Um, where to start? Well, I haven't always been this skinny. Only about a week, in fact. These clothes fit me last month. I mean, kinda. The pants were getting pretty tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan stared in awe at Daniel. The tent-like shirt he was wearing easily could have fit him and another fur inside. \"No way. There's no chance you have been so big just a week ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true! Lemme show...\" He reached into the pocket of his enormous pants. His paw slipped, and the garment fell to the floor. Daniel began to hoist them back up, but seeing that his shirt hung down nearly to his knees, he didn't bother. Everything that needed to be covered up was being covered by his shirt. Tapping his paw on his phone, the otter pulled up a photo and tilted the screen towards Evan. The photo was of a naked incredibly fat otter, easily over 800 pounds, with a mountainous belly hanging down to his knees and a flabby chest that would put some of this girls back in Bastion to shame. In one of his lard-larden paw was a newspaper. Had Evan zoomed in, he would have seen it was from the previous years. \"MAYOR CUTS RIBBON ON NEW SUBWAY LINE\" the headline read. The lion examined the face of the very fat fur in the picture. It certainly was Daniel, though it was hard to make out the face of the skinny otter in front of him from the otter in the photo on account of chubby cheeks and a thick second chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took this last year when I started dieting. It, uh, only lasted a day and a half...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. But how am I supposed to believe that you shurnk down so fast?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really incredible, I know,\" began Daniel. \"But a few months ago, I started tinkering around in the Episteme labs, trying to figure out something that would help me slim down. My weight was really starting to tick up. When the scale told me I was a few pounds past 900, that gave me a shock. If I didn't do something I'd be shipped off to St Elmo's Home for the Mobility Challenged before I turned thirty. But I tired diet and exercise and everything. I couldn't lose a pound! I'll save you all the boring science stuff, but last week I stumbled upon something that would help me lose weight; it helped me lose <i>all</i> the weight! My boss found out about what I was working on, though. I mean, how could he not when one of his lab techs becomes an eighth his size? He seized my work, confiscated my lab equipment, and even had the secruity guards jail me in my office!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why? If you found something that could make a fur lose a ton of weight fast, that'd be great! You should be a millionaire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why Dr. Kirkpatrick did what he did. I didn't have to ask because I slipped out of the building at my first opportunity. I quickly packed up my stuff and got out town before his goons could get a hold of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's story gave Evan an idea. \"Do you still know the formula. Do you think you can make it again? The stuff that made you slim down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" the otter asked. \"What are you pl-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could use it to get rid of this!\" Evan grabbed his blown up belly and gave it a hardy shake. The two furs heard sloshing from inside the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a novel idea...but I don't know...\" said Daniel. \"Dr. Kirkpatrick took my notes, and I don't know if I could make it from memory. It's been a really jarring week for me. Like, I can't remember if it's benzofuran I need or beta-Naphthoflavone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyway you can maybe sneak into the labs and grab your notes from Dr. Kirkpatrick?\" Evan inquired?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it. And it would be incredibly dangerous to do so. We'd have to be really clever to get past secruity...\"</span></div></div>",

He figured as much, knocking more out of curiosity than necessity. From his jacket, the burly bear pulled out a thin yet sturdy metal bar which he shoved in between the door and its frame. Giving the metal piece a hard yank, he heard a pop. The front door slowly opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting himself into the apartment, he shut the door behind him and latched the deadbolt. Nobody was in the living room. He was unsurprised. Glancing down the hallway he saw the door what he presumed was the bedroom was shut. The bear confidently walked down the hallway as if it was his own home. He didn't even bother to knock as he let himself into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...I reasoned as much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nearly perfect sphere of blue fur sat in the bedroom. With a circumference of almost seven feet, the doctor could tell that the sphere wasn't solid but filled with some sort of liquid. Two paws up near the middle of the mass kicked about. Dr. Kirkpatrick walked around the sphere and found the head of a lion poking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Evan, I presume?\" The lion said nothing. His bulbous cheeks were too massive for him to speak. His only response was the flailing of his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear began to examine the fur. He jabbed Evan with a paw and heard a loud <i>glosh glosh-glosh</i>. It sounded as if someone smacked a waterbed. He rubbed a paw along the curve of his body. The skin underneath felt tight but pliable. Dr. Kirkpatrick sunk a paw in. It sank nearly a foot into the sphere of Evan's body without much resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor smiled. Spying a chair in a corner of the bedroom, he dragged it over towards Evan's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel told me I'd find you like this,\" the bear said as he causally crossed his legs. \"He talked, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan furrowed his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give him credit. He held out for a few days before breaking. And now that he spilled the beans, he gets to enjoy a nice... retirement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's bloated face showed an expression of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He certainly was smart. But quite stupid to think he could sneak back in through the employee entrance. He was caught within ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan furrowed his eyebrows again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess you're wondering what will happen with you now, hmm?\" said the doctor. \"Truth be told, I'm not sure yet. You certainly are an anomaly! A scientific phenomenon! A...property of Episteme Labs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan let out a whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kirkpatrick got up from his chair. \"It will take me a bit to figure out the logistics. Definitely have to knock down a wall to get you out. And a truck big enough to hide you in. But soon you'll be the subject of some of the finest scientific minds of this generation!\" He gave Evan's body a pat. Ripples ran throughout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sauntered over to the bedroom door to let himself out. \"Goodbye, Evan! Oops...I mean, see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan whimpered again at the door shut.</span></div></div>",

Daniel had relocated his lab into a studio apartment on the edge of town where he was sure nobody from Episteme Labs would find him. After Evan asked the otter to remark the formula, he brought the lion back to the lab to test each attempt on him. Unfortunately, none of Daniel's attempts worked. While he remembered a good chunk of the formula, he just couldn't recall the last necessary components. The otter was glad that nothing he gave Evan so far had resulted in any terrible side effects aside from an occasional stomach ache, but Daniel knew time wasn't on his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's growth episodes were less frequent, but they kept occuring nevertheless. And by the time he spent just a week at Daniel's lab, he had grown several times larger. The lion, whose fur now took on a darker hue of blue, sat on a mattress in one corner of the apartment. Though nobody would have known he was on a mattress since his body covered up the entire thing. His butt alone, each cheek as round as a beachball, dominated half the mattress. His tail was squished into the canyon of his butt crack. Evan's legs, with thighs as big as barrels and calves the size of his thighs before he started inflating, were forced apart by his humongous, spherical belly which stretch out far enough in front of him to spill out over the front edge of the mattress. Two moobs as big as watermelons rested on his vast gut, each with enlarged dark purple nipples. Evan's arms looked like pillows, and his neck was incredibly swollen as well. The lion's slim handsome face now sported seriously plump cheeks as if Evan was a chipmunk sorting several winter's worth of nuts in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, Daniel was working diligently in his lab when Evan called the otter over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to alarm you,\" Evan began. \"But I don't think I have much time left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean?\" Daniel asked with a note of concern in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...I feel ready to...pop. It's hard to describe. But I think the next attack I'll get, I'll have blown up too big,\" explained Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter took in a deep sigh. \"O-okay. I guess it's really down to the wire now...\" He turned around and started walking back to his vials and burners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Daniel stopped and turned back to Evan. \"If this doesn't work out, I just want to say thanks for trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter smiled back at Evan. He knew he had a long night of work ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel shook Evan awake in the early morning hours. The blubbery lion's entire body sloshed back and forth for a few seconds. \"Hey...\" he said groggily, struggling to bring up a heavy arm to wipe the sleep from his eyes. \"Any progress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, yes and no,\" Daniel replied. Evan saw that he was holding two beakers, each filled with identical silvery liquid. \"While you were sleeping, I wiped up two different versions of the formula. I think one of them must work, but without my notes I can't be sure. We got to pick one and fast before you're hit with another attack and you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, can I have both?\" the blue lion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter shook his head. \"Not unless you want to have mercury poisoning.\" Daniel held up both beakers towards Evan. \"Well, since it's your fate, I guess you ought to be the one to decide which.\"</span></div></div>",

The twin-sized bed he laid on felt like he was sleeping on a pile of dry hay. He missed the bed he had back in Port Zaftig. It was big and soft and warm. The old bed was probably the only thing he missed about that city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, he switched on the lamp sitting on his nightstand and examined his fur in the light. Blue, like it was yesterday and probably how it'll be tomorrow. He let out a sigh and counted his blessings. Daniel's formula couldn't reverse the color of his fur. But it did reverse his inflation and shrunk him back down to his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking off the blankets, he pulled on a pair of boxer shorts and wandered into this living room. Soon, he was channel surfing, hoping to find something interesting to watch. He landed on the Peevington City Local Access Channel. While he absolutely hated the small town of Peevington, it's small town population certainly was an interesting bunch. And it didn't matter what he thought anyways. Daniel was convinced nobody from Episteme Labs would find them there. To his delight, the channel was airing a rerun of a show done by one of the town's conspiracy theorists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEY'RE TURNING THE FROGS GAY!\" barked the ape who was hosting the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan didn't have time to relax and watch the show. A loud boom followed by a sudden crack came from Daniel's room. Leaping into action, he rushed over there, flinging open the door, and turning on the bedroom light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel! Is everything al...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on the broken remains of a flimsy twin bed was an otter nearly a half ton. He flailed his arms as best he could, but being covered in hundreds of pounds of extra weight all they did was slowly wave about. The otter's whole body jiggled and wobbled as he tried to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan rushed over. \"D-daniel! Is that you?\" Sure enough, it was, though Daniel looked somewhat different with such comically bulbous cheeks. The lion laid a paw on the boulder of fat that was his belly to see if it was real. \"What the hell happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know!\" Daniel struggled to speak due to his chins and cheeks getting in the way of his ability to form words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Evan nearly an hour to help Daniel get up and move his massive body to the living room couch, which groaned as the otter rested his obscenely large bottom onto it. \"The...the formula...\" Daniel was winded from the small walk between rooms. \"Temp...temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, you might be right!\" Evan exclaimed. \"We need to make another batch now! Then you can figure out how to make it last longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter nodded his head as best he could. The thick collar of pudge around his neck made it nearly impossible to fully nod.  \"Need...stuff...pen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan rushed back to his bedroom and grabbed a pen and paper. He stuck the pen between Daniel's fat digits and placed the paper in front of the otter's paw. Slowly, Daniel scribbled out a list. \"There...done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue lion quickly read through the list. \"Okay, okay...it might take me a bit but I think I can get everything...\" After throwing on pants and a shirt, Evan grabbed his car keys and ran for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back as soon as I can!\" Daniel only groaned in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaws shaking, he stuck the keys into the ignition and revved up the engine. Checking the list again, he developed a plan on how to get everything Daniel needed for more batches of the formula. \"I think...yeah, I can definitely get some of these from Wall-Mort. They're open all night, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evan sped off into the night, his mind began to race. Even if he found everything Daniel needed, how would he prepare it? The otter was barely able to move. Maybe he just wasn't used to being that fat again. Maybe after a bit he'll be able to move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Evan not been so worked up about how to save Daniel, he would have noticed a sharp, familiar pain beginning to pop up in his stomach.</span></div></div>",

After a few failed attempts at falling back asleep, he resigned himself to starting the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up on his twin-sized bed, the lion inspected his fur. Blue, and just as dark was it was the day before. He sighed. Evan figured that he might spend the rest of his days a blue lion. It wasn't a terrible prospect; he would just need to deal with the occasional stares and comments from other furs. Evan didn't really blame them. Lions aren't usually blue. When he and Daniel arrived in the small town of Peevington some months ago, he was bothered a bit by the things some of the townfolks said. As time went by, though, they stopped commenting about his color and learned to accept the blue lion as one of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping on a pair of boxer shorts, Evan made his way to the living room. It didn't bother him if the otter saw him in his underwear. After all, Daniel has seen pretty much everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found the otter sitting on the couch, watching some Saturday morning cartoon show, and eating breakfast. This time, it was a plate stacked high with greasy bacon and sausage, and scrambled eggs coated in cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sunshine.\" The blue lion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guff marngig!\" Daniel said through a mouthful of eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any left over for me?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter swallowed. \"Didn't know if you'd be awake for breakfast.\" Daniel shoved another forkful of eggs into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion shrugged and wandered into the kitchen to pour himself a coffee. Taking a sip, he peaked out the window and took in the quite suburban neighbor they were in. Peevington was not Evan's first choice when it came to places to lie low for a awhile. But Daniel was sure that nobody from Episteme Labs would find them there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan walked back into the kitchen and leaned against the back of the couch Daniel was sitting on. \"Ever hear back from that guy about the patent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded enthusiastically. \"Yep! They're drafting up the papers now and we're negotiating a price. I think you and I won't have to work another day in our lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I knew something like that would get you a boat load of money, but that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, when I was getting to be a half ton, I would have paid anything to shed the pounds.\" Daniel then shoveled a bunch of sausages into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While were on the topic...\" Evan gesture towards the prominent gut the otter was sporting. Daniel had been eating like crazy since they arrived in town, and he guess the otter had gained back close to 75 pounds in a couple of months. All of which rested in the ball of dough slowly taking over his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"I like food! So what? If I get fat again, I know how to slim back down\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, that's true.\" Evan took another sip of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you could stand to put on a pound or two!\" Daniel used his elbow to point towards Evan's flat-as-a-board midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might just with your fat ass around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel then turned to face Evan. The otter had a mischievous smirk on his face. \"Oh yeah? Let's make it a challenge. Race you to 500!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan laughed at the idea. \"You already got a head start, tubby!\" He reached a paw to poke Daniel in the belly, but the otter batted it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you go for 500, but I have to get to 600!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what does the winner get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter thought for a moment.\"Winner gets...to shrink back down. But the loser had to stay at their weight for at least a year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan laughed again. \"You know, you've seen me big, but I think it'd be funny to see your big butt waddle around for a year.\" The lion snatched a pawful of sausages from Daniel's plate and shoved them into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\"</span></div></div>",

But when the liquid got in contact with the air, the lion noticed it was steadily thickening up and starting to fill to the rim of the vial. Evan panicked. He didn't want the stuff to overflow. Carefully holding the vial as the substance continued to solidify and rise to the top of its container, Evan searched through the kitchen cabinets and found a cup that had been left behind by the previous tenet. The lion was grateful as he hadn't packed much in the way of kitchen items for his trip to Port Zaftig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poured the substance into the cup just before it was going to spill over. It trickled out slowly and in thick globs much like pouring cold maple syrup. Once the vial was empty, Evan saw that it had filled about a third of the cup. No, a bit more than a third, closer to half. No, now it was well past half. The lion panicked again as he watched the thick fluid fill up more and more of the cup. He went back to the cupboards to find any other container that the lion could put the expanding liquid in. But the rest of the cabinets were completely empty. The lion glanced over his shoulder and saw that the golden liquid had reached the rim of the cup and would start spilling out onto the counter any second now. He began searching the rest of his apartment for any sort of container at a much faster pace. But after a few minutes of digging around, he couldn't find anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the kitchen counter, the lion expected to see it over-following with the mysterious liquid. But it wasn't. Instead, the fluid had stopped expanding and filled the cup right at its top. The lion picked up the cup being careful not to spill its contents. Raising it to his nose, he sniffed it. It had a sickly sweet aroma to it. Evan purred in delight as he brought the cup to his lips and took a few healthy sips of the substance. It was delicious! It reminded greatly of honey, yet it had a more fruity, flowery flavor to it, a flavor with a much greater depth than any kind of honey he had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This stuff tastes amazing!\" Evan muttered to himself as he drank more of the thick fluid. He drank down until half the cup was gone. Pulling the cup away from his mouth, he noticed that lots of the the gooey golden substance was stuck to the fur around his mouth. Evan set the cup back down on the counter and went to the bathroom to wash himself clean. When he came back, the lion saw that the cup was filled right back up to the rim of the cup. This greatly confused the lion, as he took a few more sips of the tasty syrup. This time, he watched as the fluid slowly filled back to the tip of the cup. Time and time again, the lion drank more and watched in amazement as the cup refilled itself. The lion was feeling full, but still he experimented with it. Drinking down until almost all of the fluid was gone, the lion was surprised to find that still the liquid was redoubling itself and filled the cup once more in a matter of minutes. He tried this a few more times, and the exact same result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion placed a paw on his incredibly full stomach which was now sporting a distinct curve thanks to all of that honey-like substance he consumed. It was getting late, and the fullness of his belly was making the lion sleepy. So Evan placed the cup, just as full as ever, on the counter in a place where he was sure it wouldn't get knocked over and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, the lion laid in bed wondering what to do with his second day in Port Zaftig as he mindless caressed his midsection with a paw. It was no longer bloated, but a very minute layer of pudge had formed on it overnight, though Evan didn't notice. The lion was too busy thinking about how to spend the day. Yesterday was spent all day in his apartment; he hadn't really gotten to see the city yet. So he could go out any explore. Yet he was obsessed about that liquid he found. The lion just couldn't wrap his head around how it was possible that the stuff kept refilling itself over and over again. While it might be the waste of a perfectly good day, Evan thought about experimenting with the substance some more. You know, for science.</span></div></div>",

The jeans he wore were now cutting into his bloated belly, so Evan skillfully reached down and unbuttoned them allowing his gut so sink down a inch or two more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bench next to him sat the culprit: A water bottle that was filled once more with the honey-like substance. Before leaving for the day, the lion had an idea. He got a water bottle from a nearby convenience store and emptied it. Pouring the yellow liquid from the cup to the bottle, Evan watched as the substance, which only filled half the bottle, reconstituted itself and in a matter of minutes, expanded to fill the rest of the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the day as Evan wandered the streets and roads of Port Zaftig, he drank from the bottle, filling his belly constantly with the golden fluid as it refilled its container as he walked. The lion was unaware how much he drank until after many hours of sipping from the bottle that Evan realized how painfully full his belly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving wandered all the way to Port Zaftig's infamous beaches, the lion found a place to sit down and rest for a while to allow his stomach to empty a bit. The sky was filled with shades of purple and orange and red. The sun was just about to disappear behind the horizon, and the lion watched the first of what he hoped to be many sunsets in Port Zaftig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Evan came to. The lion rubbed his eyes as he yawned. The sun had definitely gone down. He reasoned that with the fullness of his gut and the warm air made him feel sleepy and the lion must have dozed off. But it couldn't have been too long for he could see the last rays of the sun had just vanished under the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late. The lion got up and stretched, inches of his bloated stomach peaked out from underneath his shirt as he raised his arms. He pulled out his phone to call up a taxi as he reached for his bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't there! Evan panicked as he frantically searched for the bottle. It wasn't on or under the bench, nor was it anywhere on the ground nearby. The lion started to worry, not just because he loved that sweet liquid, but he didn't know what another fur might do with it or what it might do to them. Then again, he could just write it off as a loss. Sure, he'll miss that amazingly flavor substance, but it might be long gone by now.</span></div></div>",

The lion swallowed the mouthful, a stream of the fluid trickled down the side of his face before opening up again. As the pitcher emptied, the lion filled up. His belly creaked and groaned as it creaked and groaned many times earlier in the day as it protested against being so full again. Feeling ready to burst (a constant feeling that day), Evan saw that the pitcher was almost entirely empty. He stopped, ensuring that a thin layer still coated the bottom of the container. Catching his breath, the lion watched as the fluid expanded and swelled and in a matter of minutes filled the pitcher to the brim as it has done so many times already throughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion smiled as he placed the heavy pitcher back onto the coffee table.

Earlier in the morning, Evan purchased a large plastic pitcher from a nearby grocery store. He pour half of the cup into it, hoping both containers would fill. They did not. It was only when Evan poured all of the mysterious substance into the pitcher that it began to replenish itself until reaching the rim of the container. And just like with the cup, it continued replenishing itself no matter how many times he drank most of it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had set hours ago and the lion was feeling tired. But Evan figured that he should hop in the shower before going to bed. Beads of the dried up substance dotted his mouth and cheeks. Moaning and holding a paw gently against his bloated abdomen, he slowly walked into his bathroom, cranked up the hot water, and tossed off his clothes and underwear. Yet before he stepped into the shower, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. What caught him off guard was the sight of his fur. Usually cream-colored, the fur on his chest and abdomen was now a distinct shade of bright, shiney yellow. The fur on the rest of his body was now a like of dark golden hue as opossed to the typical pale yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Evan examined himself in the mirror making sure that what he was seeing wasn't a trick of the light. Sure enough, his fur had changed color though the lion wasn't too put off by it. He actually liked the new shade. Posing in front of the mirror, Evan was pleased to see the light of the bathroom shine off his newly golden fur. He turned around, looking over his shoulder to his reflection as light played off the fur of his rump. Evan didn't just like the chance, he loved it! The lion felt prettier, sexier even. Arousal was boiling up inside of him just watching himself gently caress his full stomach with his paw. The lion began stroking himself to his own image, loving the bloated golden lion in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt, this change was brought about by the loads of that special liquid Evan was chugging down. And while the chance was welcome, he was slightly concerned about what else it might do to him. Perhaps he should stop himself now before anything bad happens. But then again, nothing bad had happen yet.</span></div></div>",

But getting them buttoned was a completely different story. The lion sucked in his gut as best as he could before pulling the flaps of his jeans together. He would struggled for a few minutes only to give up, letting out his stomach as it plopped out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past week for Evan had been a week of unabashed hedonism. From dawn to dusk, he had lay about filling his belly with more and more of that never-ending golden substance. This was only broken up when the lion felt frisky and needed to get himself off. Typically, Evan would need to fire up a video of two attractive furs going at it to get him to the point of climax. But now the lion was finding that just gazing at his own reflection in the mirror was enough. Light dancing off his now-golden fur, a tweak of his nipples, a slap of his rump, all of this was what Evan needed now to bring him to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that time admiring himself made it obvious to him the other effects of the delightful liquid he spent all day consuming. The lion had thickened up all over. His flat stomach now sported a sizable roll of pudge, his chest now hosting the beginning of a pair of moobs. Arms were now coated in pillowly fat, and Evan's face had a second chin sprouting. The most dramatic change, though, was below his waist. His hips had widened and flared out. The lion's thighs now touched and rubbed against each other as the cat waddled around his apartment. Evan always had a fairly small butt. But now the cat's ass had inflated into two chunky globes that swallowed up his underwear (whenever he could be bothered to put any on). It would not surprise the lion if was he mistaken for a girl from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like that had happened recently. Evan hardly left his apartment. Hell, he hadn't left it since he grabbed those mysterious packages off his neighbors doorstop all those days ago. One afternoon, the lion was feeling cooped up in his place as he lied naked in bed. It had been his dream to go to Port Zaftig, but Evan barely saw any of the luxurious city. So he decided to head out and explore..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until he found all of his pants were now too small for his fattened form. Evan stood panting, unable to get even his largest jeans to button fully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's...guess it's time to go...shopping,\" the lion said to himself. He had a pair of sweatpants that should work for now. As Evan struggled to now get his pants off, he felt himself getting all hot and bothered again. Seeing his body wobble and shimmy and shake as he tried to get dressed only made the cat want to stay in and pleasure himself once more. Then again, it had been a lot time since Evan shared a bed with another fur. He could try looking up a local escort agency to find a fur to play with. But, Evan reasoned, he really needed some new clothes, and there's always the chance he could stumble upon a cute fur to screw with while out and about.</span></div></div>",

The door to Unit 701 was open, he noticed, and he heard some commotion from inside. Thunderous footsteps came from the apartment. The lion could almost feel the shockwave from down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion quietly walked towards the apartment and gently pushed the door open. Inside was easily the fattest fur Evan had ever seen in his life. The otter looked as if he was a cheeseburger away from immobility. His body was covered in hundreds of pounds of excess blubber. His tent-like white button-up shirt looked ready to burst off of him, and his pants strained to contain his massive rump. The otter looked frantic, his enormous frame quivering as he slowly waddled around the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...hello?\" the golden lion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter turned around and was caught off guard no doubt by glimmer and shine of the cat's golden coat. \"...who are you? And what do you want?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Evan, and I live down the hall,\" he said. \"Is...this is your apartment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is. Well, it was,\" the otter explained. \"I used to live here but, uh, moved out not too long ago.\" The fur slowly looked up and down Evan's curvy body, and the lion felt flattered. \"I'm Daniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was the name on the boxes that Evan picked up earlier in the week. The cat tried playing it cool. \"Uh, nice to meet you, Daniel. So, if you moved out, what brings you back here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I,uh, forgot something,\" Daniel said. \"Some samples. I work at a lab, well, used to work at a lab. A colleague of mine had sent me some botanical samples she collected and wanted me to analyze. But I, umm, had to leave before they got shipped here. I was hoping that they would be in here or waiting for me outside.\" The otter waddled towards Evan, his hyper-obese body dwarfing the lion's own chunky one. \"Say, you wouldn't have seen any packages sitting outside my apartment, have you?\"</span></div></div>",

These boxes had remained unopened. And the otter looked relieved to see them, though there was a look of suspicion on his bloated face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" Daniel said. \"I was expecting a third specimen from my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, really?\" Evan said. \"Well, these were the only ones I saw sitting out there. Maybe someone swiped it? Or maybe it'll come in later. You know, lost in the mail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope for the latter,\" the otter said. \"Would you please keep an eye out just in case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" the lion exclaimed, knowing that the third package would never show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me give you my...\" The otter reached a pudgy paw into his pocket and fished out his wallet. From it, he pulled out a business card, handing to Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n<b>DANIEL TAFFINGTON</b><br>\r\nEpisteme Labs - Bioengineering Research Division<br>\r\n(901) 277-888</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, wait a second...\" Daniel snatched the card back from Evan. Pulling a pen from his shirt pocket, he scribbled out the number on the card and wrote in a new one. \"That's, uh, an old work phone number,\" he said handing the card back to Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well, I'll call you if anything shows up,\" said Evan exiting the apartment ahead of Daniel. The incredibly obese otter shut the door behind them, locking it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do,\" he said, tucking the two boxes under his flabby arm. \"And thanks again. Hopefully that third package will show up one day.\" Daniel began slowly waddling towards the elevator, his body oscillating with each step, pressed a button, stepped into it, and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk from Evan's apartment building to the mall was quite enjoyable not just because of the bright and sunny weather but because of all the looks the lion got. He frequently caught furs, both male and female, checking him out. This pleased Evan, making his sway his hips just a bit more as he waddled down the sidewalk, his plump butt bouncing up and down with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the mall directory, the lion found two clothing stores. One was Razz, a discount clothing store that carried all of the apparel staples at a low cost. Then there was Zaffora, a luxury clothing store. While Evan might not have the money to buy a lot from them, it might be fun to check out what they've got for sale.</span></div></div>",

While the tuxedo he was wearing was a few sizes too big (being the smallest size Zaffora carried), it did look good on the lion. His shinning golden fur complimented the tux well, and Evan couldn't help but feel incredibly sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you don't need to tell me that twice...\" he said, smirking to himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat purred, taking in the aesthetic feat that was the golden lion in front on her. \"Now, I'll give you the number of an excellent tailor. She should be able trim it down to fit your frame. Seriously, this woman works wonders. And for payment, will you be paying with cash or card?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion blushed slightly. \"Well, I wasn't actually planning on buying anything today,\" Evan said \"Money's a bit tight for me right now. I was just going to look around at what all was being sold here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...what a pity,\" the saleswoman said, fiddling her diamond necklace with her paw. She glanced over to a nearby wall where hung a photo of a rather portly zebra modeling items from a line of luxury casualwear.

But it did nothing, the knife easily sliding in and out of the substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Evan took one more stab at the green stuff. The knife nicked the edge of the glass vial, slipped, and pierced the lion's paw. He yelped, dropping the vial onto the sink. It shattered as it hit the metal basin. The green stuff retained the shape of the vial as rolled around in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan swore under his breath as he turned the faucet turn, running the small, bleeding cut under warm water. It splashed off his cut finger onto the green material which started to quiver. Upon seeing this, the curious lion brought the head of the faucet directly over it, dousing the green matter. The quivering became more pronounced and violent, and soon the matter began losing its tube shape. As it took on a more anomalous shape, Evan was surprised to see it swell up and expand, taking up half the sink in mere minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shut off the water and stared in amazement at the green goo. Carefully poking the substance with a paw, it jiggled around slightly as would a thick jelly. Evan tried stick a paw in only to find the green goo much more solid than it seemed. He then tried sticking a paw between the basin and the goo to pull it out only to find that it was stuck too firmly to remove the green material.</span></div></div>",

He didn't know what to do with the material that had suddenly taken residence in his kitchen sink. The container it came in had some addresses on in. That might be a clue as to who he might be able to talk to about this. Sure, they might be upset, but still th-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goo lurched forward, spilling out of the sink and onto the kitchen floor. This surprised the lion, who lept backwards, bumping into his fridge. He watched as the slime poured and poured until it was all in a gelatinous pile on the floor. Stunned, Evan knelt down and prodded the motionless goo. However, no doubt due to the extraordinary situation he was in, the lion poked it using the paw he had cut just minutes ago. Touching the goo, Evan pulled back in his paw, hissing in pain as he rubbed the still-fresh wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of drops of the lion's blood sat on the surface of the goo. The red dots disappeared into the green slime. It because quivering again, this time agitating more than it did before. After a few moments, the goo calmed and flattened out into a puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion watched in horror at what unfolded in front of him. From the goo arose a head, then neck, shoulders, a torso and arms, one legs, the other, and a tail. The puddle shrinked and disappeared as it formed the feet of the creature standing in Evan's apartment. What terrorized Evan more than the sudden appearance of this monster was identical to him, every feature the lion had was mimicked by the goo creature. The only distinguishing feature between the two was that the creature was entirely translucent, composed of what looked like green jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stepped forward towards Evan who screamed in terror.

The lion was caught off guard, choking as the green tendril tried making its way further and further into his body. Evan bit down as hard as he could.

Evan was glad and picked himself off of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright green color of his furry arms startled him.

The creature padded its paws along one of the otter's arms. \"Touch must be the only way for it to sense anything. That's probably why it was grabbing after you and following you. It wanted to 'see' what you were; it followed the pounding of your footsteps on the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, it sounds reasonable,\" Evan said. \"But I was still caught off guard. Like, I've never seen anything like this before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing, isn't it? Here, here,\" Daniel gestured for the lion to come over. Cautiously, Evan walked over to the pair. The otter led one of the slime creature's paws over to the lion's body. It made contact, and the goo lion began examining Evan head to toe. At first, the lion was on edge. But when it was clear it meant no harm, he found himself enjoying the sensation of the creature's paws against his fur, its slimy limbs slipping under Evan's clothes and rubbing him all over. They felt soft, cool, and lightly moist, a pleasant feeling in contrast to the warm, muggy air of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do with...this?\" asked Evan while the creature slid its paws down towards Evan's hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think for a moment...\" began Daniel. \"Oh, I think I got it! There are some colleagues of mine a few cities over with a private lab. I could call them up and see if they'd be interested in housing our new friend here. I'm sure they would love a chance to run some tests on an anomaly like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but when do you think that th- AH!\" The creature had maneuvered a slimy paw down the back of the lion's pants and deep between the cheeks of have slender butt. Evan slapped its tendril away. \"When do you think we can get this out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few days. A week, maybe. I'll have to call them up and arrange transportation and whatnot. Until then, you'll just have to keep it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Me? By myself?\" Evan said. \"There's no way that you're leaving me along with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've told you! It's harmless!\" explained Daniel. \"It'll be fine! I'm sure of it!\"</span></div></div>",

Daniel, who had spent much of the day trying to coordinate some form of transportation for the gooey creature, was sleeping on the couch in the living room. The creature, having followed the otter around all day, had stayed out in the living room with Daniel, standing motionless as he otter fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion peaked around the corner to see what was making that noise. On the couch, Daniel was pinned down with the creature straddling the otter's hips. Moonlight coming in from the apartment windows shined off the creature's smooth body as it shoved its arm down Daniel's throat. Its elbow was now entering the otter when Evan had found them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fur struggled to get the creature off, but it was to no avail. Daniel moaned as the gooey lion shoved its arm deeper down the throat of the otter. Evan could see his belly, previously flat as a board, now swollen as if several months pregnant. The creature thrusted its arm deeper into Daniel, nearly up to the shoulder, and the otter's belly grew out a little more, audibly creaking in distress.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The goo lion stood motionlessly as Evan sat on the couch of his living room trying to watch television and distract himself from the bizarre entity in his apartment. Daniel had left a few hours ago, and the gooey creature hadn't done all that much. It would slowly follow Evan from room to room, drawn by the sounds of his footsteps, but nothing much else. The lion, the real lion, was still a little put off by it. The green lion was standing fully upright, facing a wall though probably completely unaware of anything around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you okay? Need anything?\" Evan asked, not sure what else to do with the creature in his apartment. The goo doppelganger turned its head to face Evan, but it did not respond at all. He figured as much. In fact, he would have been more weirded out had the creature actually talked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParched, Evan pulled himself from the couch and made his way to the kitchen for a some water. Still lacking any sort of kitchen utensils, the lion turned on the tap and lapped up some water. The goo lion snapped its neck towards the direction of the rushing water and moved its body as fast as it could towards the noise. Well, as fast as it could go, which was still a glacial pace. Evan saw the creature spring to life out of the corner of his eye while drinking, and watched as the creature made its way towards the sink. The lion stepped aside, not wanting to get in its way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stuck a green tendril into the stream of water, and the gooey lion's entire body shivered for a moment. Evan thought he spotted a smile creep across the thing's face. The water did not flow over the tendril but rather was being absorbed into the creature; not a drop spilled into the sink proper. Evan's eyes bugged out as he noticed the creature's midsection slowly inflate. The green hue of the goo lion's belly turned lighter as its flat abdomen curved out. Dozens of gallons of water blew up the lion's gut as its new belly pressed against the counter and started dipping into the sink as it grew and grew. Loud sloshing could be hear from the creature's beachball sized belly as the thing soaked in the water by the gallons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, okay, I think that's enough...\" Evan said after a few minutes as he reached out and shut off the water. The stream stopped, and the smile disappeared off of the creature's face. It pulled itself away from the sink. Its engorged belly, no longer held up by the sink, plopped off the counter, dragged down by gravity. The creature's new mass was so large it hung halfway down its thighs. The gooey lion began making its way back to the living room. Evan couldn't help but notice that its movement was greatly slowed and hindered by the enormous gut filled with a few bathtubs worth of water.  <br>\r\nThe goo creature took akward steps, its belly jiggling wildly, slapping against its thighs, and throwing off the green lion's inertia. Heavier, the goo lion's pace was even more glacial, taking it nearly ten minutes to walk the small distance from the kitchen to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the creature stood motionlessly in an odd corner of the living room. Unsure of what happened or what to do next, Evan resumed channel surfing as the goo lion, a likeness of himself but sporting a massive belly, stared off into the distance only occasionally twisting its head in the direction of the television when an odd noise came from one of the programs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, and it was getting late. Evan yawned, pointed the remote at the television, and shut it off. He glanced over at his gooey doppelganger who was standing statue still. The engorged belly it had been sporting had deflated noticably. Its arms, legs, and chest, however, had thickened up. It looked less like skinny Evan, more akin to a fatter cat. \"Heh, I guess that's what I'd look like if I had to eat my way out of a grocery store,\" Evan joked to himself as he walked past the portly goo lion and towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing his pre-bed routine, Evan spat the last of the toothpaste into the sink. He turned on the water and watched the bluish green foam wash away. Shutting off the faucet, he turned to leave when he was startled by the goo lion standing in the doorway. Evan yelped at the surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you nearly gave me a heart attack,\" he said, a paw resting on his chest. The gooey doppelganger simply walked by him, clearly searching the room. \"Looking for something, big guy?\" The creature said nothing. Its head tinted about, hunting for a sound. Evan's eyes wandered toward the sink. \"Oh, I think I know what you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the bathroom sink faucet was on full blast as the creature, clearly delighted, greedily sucked up the water with a tendril. Its belly began swelling up again as Evan watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature did seem fairly harmless. But this was his first night alone with it. He had no idea what it might get up to when he wasn't awake. And locking his bedroom door might not keep him completely safe. Just then, watching the goo lion's belly inflate, an idea came to the lion. If his gooey friend loved water so much, Evan figured he'd be able to fill him up to the point that it'd be too heavy and water-laden to move all night. After all, sucking up all that water earlier in the day slowed it down a fair bit. A long shower might blow the creature up enough to make it impossible to waddle around all night <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, that's a dumb idea...\" Evan muttered to himself. The last thing he wanted was a supersize blob of goo in his apartment, even if it was immobile. Perhaps he was overthinking things and it would be safe with the green lion overnight.</span></div></div>",

He could try waiting it out, see if the thing would just leave, or maybe he could catch it off guard. Evan glanced over to see the enormous glass shower stall in his bathroom.

The lion heard the creature make its way down the hallway, its slimy feet smacking against the hardwood floor. A green translucent arm pushed the door open, and in came the creature sluggishly making its way towards Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion cranked the shower knobs to full. A jet of water erupted from the showerhead, and Evan pointed it directly at the goo creature. It stunned the creature, as it held up its arms, blocking the water from blasting it in its face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, something curious happened. As Evan sprayed the creature, he noticed that it started expand. The creature's stomach, flat like Evan's, started to inflate outwards, first as a slight cure, then as a slight belly, then into a full blown gut which kept on swelling up larger and larger. The goo lion's thighs ballooned up into two massive tree trunks, its chest turning into a pair of enormous moobs, arms thickening up, face filling out, petit ass transforming into two beach balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked at what he saw, Evan shut off the water. The creature no longer resembled him. Though they still were identically facially, the creature looked like what Evan if he blew up to a quarter ton fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature, however, remained unfazed as it continued to progress towards Evan, its gooey body now jostling about as it moved. It reached for the stall door. Evan tried slammed it closed, but the creatures now thickened arm got in the way as the door bounced off of it and swung open. The lion backed into a corner as the goo creature squeezed its way into the stall, now just a few mere feet away from Evan.</span></div></div>",

He struggled against it, but the might of the thing was far too strong. Evan opened his mouth to scream, but the creature shoved its entire jelly-like arm into the lion's mouth. He wanted to cough and gag, but Evan could feel that his throat was filled completely with the creature's arm. It stared blankly at Evan as he fought to breath for several minutes before the lion's eyes rolled to the back of his head and all his movement stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter knocked on the door to Unit 703, his oversized clothes hanging off of his extremely thin frame. No answer came. With his free paw (as the other was holding up his pants), he knocked again, this time much hard. From the other side of the door, he heard a fur slowly approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion who answered the door had fur which was a bright green. This surprised the otter as he had never seen a lion with such a odd color of fur. Usually some shade of yellow or white, this lion almost glowed. What he noticed next was that the lion appeared to be entirely nude. At least, it looked it like. The lion, much like most furs in Port Zaftig, were extremely overweight. This lion was no exception. A huge belly hung low, obscuring the view of his privates. His belly, much like the rest of his body, appeared to be covered in a thick coat of lard that jiggled uncontrollably with even the slightest movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion only stared at the otter, saying nothing, with a blank stare and half-smile on his chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi. I'm Daniel. I live...er, used to live down the hall,\" the otter began. The lion stared stoically, his expression unchanged. \"I think I had some packages sent to my old unit. Have you...uh, seen them?\" Again, the lion stood there just looking at the otter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel peaked around the lion to see two battered packages on the kitchen counter. \"Oh, I think those might be them,\" he said, pointing them out. The lion turned his head in the direction of the packages. \"Can I, uh, please have them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green lion turned around, giving the otter a clear view of his blobby butt, looking like large sacks filled with pudding. The lion's body jiggled and wobbled as he mechanically waddled over to the boxes, picked them up, and handed them to the otter standing at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you,\" Daniel said. The lion said nothing back, instead still presenting the same half-smile on his face. \"Uh, I think I had a third box coming in. Have you seen that one? Maybe?\" The lion said nothing, only staring with a dead look in his eyes. \"Well, thanks again! I guess, uh, I'll be going now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's expression didn't change as he shut the door, still not saying a word to the otter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan wanted to scream. Evan wanted the otter to hear him. Evan wanted the otter to know he was still there, somewhere, but still there. Something else had control of his body, a body he hardly recognized anymore. But he was still there.</span></div></div>",

Can I help you?\" She was a couple inches shorter than Evan, had a pretty face, and was covered in silky smooth black fur. She was wearing a white tank top and cream colored khakis. A pair of heavy breasts and a perky potbelly strained her top, and her wide hips and thick thighs made her pants look panted on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, hi!\" Evans said bashfully. He wasn't expecting a cute fur to answer the door, cute even though she was a bit chunkier than more girls he was attracted to. \"I just moved in this morning. I'm next door in Unit 703. I'm Evan!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuck out his paw. She smiled and shook it. \"I'm Katie! Nice to meet you! I'm pretty new here too. I moved in a few months ago! Hey, I'd love to talk but I'm actually running late for work. Hopefully we can talk again soon! Or, I work at a bakery nearby. Heavenly Bakery, it's called. You should stop by sometime! I'm pretty much there anytime it's open. Well, except today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, definitely I will!\" Evan replied. \"But yeah, I'll let you finish getting ready then! It was nice meeting you!\" The lion flashed a smile. She smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it was nice meeting you too! See you soon!\" As she closed the door, Evan caught her quickly eying him top to bottom. He blushed and returned back to his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Katie girl is certainly someone he needed to get to know better. He could drop by the Heavenly Bakery later today. There wasn't much food had brought with him, so there definitely was an excuse. Or perhaps he'll pop in tomorrow so Evan doesn't seem too eager to see her again.</span></div></div>",

Many of the display cases were depleted sans the occasional cake here or there. It was late in the day, so Evan reasoned that many of the baked goods had been purchased already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Katie stepped out from the back. She was wearing the same thing as she was that morning except with a light flannel shirt over it. The buttons around her stomach strained and her white tank top peaked out between the gaps left by the buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Evan! Hi!\" she said as she stepped out behind the counter. \"I didn't think you'd stop by!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got a little carried away unpacking all my stuff,\" the lion said. \"I didn't realize how late it had gotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is pretty late. I actually just closed shop half an hour ago. Did I forget to lock the front door again? I need to stop doing that before someone ransacks the place.\" The panther walked over to the door, pulled out a set of keys, and locked it. Evan checked out her plump rear as she did and purred quietly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess it's too late to buy anything?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I did all of the cash register paperwork not long ago,\" Katie said. \"But it's not like I'd make you pay for anything, anyways. Here, follow me. I got plenty of treats in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sat at one of the prep tables waiting for Katie to come back. A few minutes later, the panther sauntered in holding a platter piled high with cookies. Chocolate chip, snickerdoodles, molasses, all sorts of kinds. She set them down in front of the lion who wagged his tail happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All for me?\" asked Evan as he bit into a sugar cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, consider it a welcoming present!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion happily devoured the cookies as the panther watched him who was in such a state that he didn't realize she had take off her flannel shirt, relieving her tight tank top that was stretched tight against her pudgy belly and large breasts. Evan went to reach for another cookie when he felt the panther's soft body press against his back and neck. Her boobs pressed into him as Katie reached over him and grabbed a cookie, holding it up to his mouth. Confused, the lion paused for a second, but then ate it out of her paw. Then another, then another, then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last one, Evan.\" The lion groaned. He lost track of how many cookies he had eaten. He lazily opened his mouth as Katie shoved the final cookie in. As he slowly chewed, he felt the panther reach around and place a paw on his incredibly bloated stomach. Evan moaned as she began slowly rubbing the mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels good?\" she whispered in his ear. Evan nodded. The panther's belly rubs reached more and more of his belly, her paw going lower and lower. The lion wondered if Katie saw the growing bludge in his pants. He knew the answer when he felt a paw undo the buttons of the tight jeans.</span></div></div>",

His incredibly overstuffed belly felt ready to burst, and the small movements it took to redress himself sent pangs of pain through his abdomen. After successfully getting them on, the lion rubbed a paw along the taunt curve of his belly in an attempt to sooth it. Evan heard the sound of paws against the tile floor of the bakery. Katie's nude, heavy chest and belly pressed against the lion's back. Before he could get a word out, the plastic tip of a pastry bag was stuck into his mouth. The panther gave it a hard squeeze; a large dollop of strawberry jam sprayed into Evan's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion pushed away the pipping bag. He instinctively swallowed down the the sweet jam to keep himself from choking on it despite the incredible pressure in his belly. \"Uh, please...no more. I think I just might pop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the bag on a nearby counter. Reaching her paws around him, Katie began gently massaging the distinct, formerly flat dome that was the lion's midsection. \"Oops, sorry. I can't help it. I like my boys jelly-filled.\" The panther then gave Evan's shoulder a playful nip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, is that so?\" groaned Evan as she rubbed away on his stomach. \"God, never would have guessed that my first night in Port Zaftig I'd be hooking up with a girl in the back of a bakery...Think whoever owns this place would be upset about all this?\" He gestured to the mess their night of passion caused in the bakery. Crumbs, chunks of muffins, bits of cookies, and the residue of all sorts of treats that were digesting away in Evan's gut laid about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she'll be alright with this,\" Katie said. \"I own the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof. Guess I lucked out then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did,\" Katie said. She then slapped a paw hard against Evan's rear. The lion yelped in response. \"Now get your pants on. It's getting late and I want to lock up soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, Evan laid in bed, screwing around on his phone and munching from a box of day-old sweets that Katie had packed away for the lion. Even though his belly was quite stuffed, the treats were so delicious that he simply couldn't help himself, even as his stomach audibly groaned in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I've had a hell of a first day in town,\" Evan mumbled to himself before biting a chunk out of a chocolate chip cookie the size of his paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasily, the Heavenly Bakery was the best bakery he'd been to for more reasons than one. He got the idea that search around online to see what everyone else said about it, see if everyone in town liked it as much as he did. But then again, Evan figured he didn't need to know that. Katie offered to give the lion a proper tour of the bakery tomorrow night if he was interested.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Heavenly Bakery's score on Yarp! was astounding. From well over four hundred reviews, it had a total score of 4.97 stars. This definitely impressed Evan. Flipping through the comments, he found nothing but rave reviews about the store and about how tasty and wonderful everything was. Curious to see if anyone said anything bad about the bakery, Evan filtered the comments to go from least stars to most stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, there was one (and only one) single star reviewer. The post was somewhat old; it was written over a year ago by someone with the username simonismyothername. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>for the love of all that is holy do NOT eat here do NOT work here stay AWAY. I worked at the heavenly bakery a couples years back and saw some MESSED UP stuff. Katie is a PSYCHO and I'm glad I left while I still could! Stay away! Stay far away!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was jarred by the message. He expected to read some compliant about waiting in line too long or their doughnut not having enough sprinkles. Instead, what he read sounded like an incredibly dire warning. The guy might be a total crackpot, but the lion was interested in hearing the specifics of what he saw there. Then again, the post is so old that the guy might not rely. He reasoned he should show that to Katie. She'd get a real laugh out of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had taken a few days for simonismyothername is respond back to Evan. Considering that the lion wasn't expecting any reply whatsoever, he was quite surprised. The user was willing to talk, but only in private. Evan was willing to listen, but not in some completely secluded area. They agreed on a small coffeeshop not to far away from Evan's apartment for the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you know about the Heavenly Bakery?\" Evan asked the fur sitting across from him at a table in the corner of the Majestic Bean. Simon, which happened to be simonismyothername's real name, was a young Golden Retriever a few years younger than Evan. But the pup was pretty obese. The lion guess he was nearing a quarter ton, most of it in his hindquarters. Many chairs in Port Zaftig were much wider that normal to accommodate the wider populace, but Simon's backside was so heavy and vast it was testing the limit of the chair he sat in. Much of his weight was in his rump, so much so that the dog was a strange sight. His face was quite sharp and angular. Had you only seen him from the neck up one would think he was fit and trim. Were one to see the sizable gut and flabby chest he sported, they still wouldn't expect to see a monstrous butt he was hauling around behind him. Though Evan had seen much bigger furs in his short time in Port Zaftig, Simon deserved honorable mentions for his ass alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you talk first,\" Simon insisted as he bit into one of the several pastries in from of him. \"What do you know about Heavenly Bakery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" Evan admted. \"I actually moved in next to Katie's apartment. And then, uh, her and I hung out in the bakery. She seems like a cool lady, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young pup gave Evan a suspicious glare. \"That's all? You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, that's all you're getting know! I don't know anything about who you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssh!\" Simon hushed, glancing around the semi-full coffee shop. \"Keep it down! You don't know who you might be listening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" he said in a lower tone. \"So what's your deal then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I moved here to Port Zaftig a few years ago. I needed a job and found that the Heavenly Bakery was hiring. Katie called me in for an interview and practically hired me on the spot. She said she needed someone quick and light on their feet, and Katie saw on my resume that I was the captain of my high school track team.\" Evan eyes' gave Simon's super obese body a look over. \"Yeah, yeah, I don't look the part, but I'm getting there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, things are going well...at first. It was kinda weird because I was her only employee. Nobody else worked there. Somehow just the two of us were able to get everything all made up for the day without much hassle. Katie paid well and even let me take home some of the day-olds for free. Then things changed. I'd be working on some dough and Katie would come by and pop a cookie in my mouth or maybe a muffin. At first, I thought she just wanted me to test something she was working on. Then it was more. Soon, it felt like I spent more time eating than working. Like, I'd make a few trays of brownies, then Katie would come along and, boom, they were all in my stomach. I piled on weight fast. I must have doubled in size in just six months! I complained to Katie about it. She doubled my pay, saying something about wardrobe costs or something but that was it. That shut me up for a while because I was making cash hand over fist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then Katie started getting more...bold. Taking liberties. She had no problem grabbing me as she walked past, slapping my butt or pinching my belly. I don't even like girls but I put up with it. Again, money. But one night something happened and I had enough. We were supposed to be shutting down for the evening. We're in the back and she pulls me off to the side and says something about loving her boys 'cream-filled' and-\" Simon's gaze shifted in the direction of the front door of the coffeeshop. The color drained from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan turned to see what he was looking at. Katie was standing there at the counter ordering a coffee. She immediately spotted him and Simon sitting there. Taking her house brew from the barista, she walked over to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan! Glad to bump into you!\" Katie said, giving his shoulder a squeeze. She turned to the obese pup opposite to him. \"And who is...Simon? Is that you? Oh, it's been ages! You're looking...healthy!\" The panther walked over to the Golden Retriever and rubbed a paw along his back. \"How do you know Evan here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...uh...went to school together...\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Different years, but same school!\" Evan joined in on the lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, small world!\" Katie said. \"Did you know that little Simon here used to work for me? What do you do these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...p-photography.\" Simon avoided eye contact with Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely! You should stop by the shop someday and show me your photos! The place hasn't change! We still sell those bonbons you love so much! Evan, this is hilarious. One day while we were prepping, I left a half dozen trays of bonbons resting in the kitchen. I should have known better than to not keep a close eye on them because I come back not ten minutes later and Simon here had eaten them all!\" The pup's cheeks burned bright with embarrassment. The panther checked the time on her phone. \"Oh, gotta run! I'm meeting with a vendor in a few minutes. Hopefully I'll see you in one day, Simon! Bye boys!\" Katie then sped walked out the door and down the block out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I knew it was a stupid idea to come out.\" Simon muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan crossed his arms and raised a skeptical eyebrow. \"Bonbons, huh? It sounds more like someone got a bit tubby and needs to blame someone for his waistline.\" The lion stood up and grabbed his coffee. \"Thanks for wasting my time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please! Yes, that was true and I lost my self-control sometimes working around all those treats! But please listen! I can show you proof that Katie is up to no good!\"</span></div></div>",

As he chewed, Katie leaned in, a paw on Evan's blossoming belly, and gave him a peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike many nights before, Evan had stopped by the Heavenly Bakery after hours to hang out with Katie. And like many nights before she'd make sure that he left with a stomach full of sweets. It was certainly having an impact on Evan's waistline, the lion having put on a significant paunch. But  it didn't bother him all. Katie certainly didn't mind the weight. In fact, she incorporated belly rubs into their love-making sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another?\" She held up another bonbon to the lion's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you like your boys cream-filled after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile disappeared from Katie's face. \"Who...who told you that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan chuckled. \"Simon did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what else did he tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much beyond that. He pretty much whined about getting fat. When you walked in was when he brought that thing up. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked away from Evan, thinking for a moment. \"Evan, I like you. But I need to know if you can keep a secret. Can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward and kissed the panther on her forehead. \"Of course, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed him by the paw and led Evan to the far back of the bakery where there was a padlocked door. Katie unlocked it from the large ring of keys she carried around with her. There were stairs that lead to the basement which, upon arrival, was vast but largely empty aside from a steel door along one wall. Katie approached and unlocked it, opening it and flipping a light switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here,\" she said, waving for the lion to join her. It was a walk-in refrigerator. This was particularly strange to Evan. The panther already had one on the main floor. What use was there for a second? Wire racks lined the wall but most were empty. Only one rack had anything on it. Several plastic jars sat on a shelf filled with a thick whitish substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie grabbed one of the large jars and spun the cap off. She pointed the opening towards Evan. \"What does this look like to you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...vegetable shortening? My mom used to bake with that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close. Lard. Everything I bake here has just a little bit of lard in it. Just enough to make everything buttery and tasty and smooth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shrugged his shoulders. \"That's the big secret? That people with heart conditions shouldn't eat here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black panther shook her head. \"No, it's...fresher than most other bakeries can get. The fresher, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what? You know a dealer or something?\" asked Evan. \"Someone who gets it right from the factory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie closed her eyes and took a deep breath. \"No, Evan. I get it from furs. Living furs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what?\" Evan gasped. \"You <i>kill</i> other furs just f-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no. There's a total safe and harmless way to extract the fat needed. If, that is, you have someone to harvest it from. And it can't just be anyone. A fat fur who eats cheeseburgers all day will produce a product that's bitter and grainy. But, a fur living off of things like butter and sugar and milk will make a kind of lard that will make even the dullest tasting desserts amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sugar, butter, milk...you mean cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! That's what I was hoping for with Simon: To turn him into my cream-filled boy so I'd never be out of my special ingredient. Like I'm starting to now...\" She gestured at the nearly empty storeroom with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you start with all this?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say it's a family secret. And that's important: It's a secret.\" Katie sauntered over to Evan and wrapped an arm around his neck. \"And it's out secret now. And we need to make sure that nosey little fat ass doesn't let anyone know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can bring him here, I'll make sure he never leaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to ki h-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie hushed Evan, placing a paw over his mouth. \"No, dear. Something...else.\" Her eyes darted over to the few plastic jugs next to them. \"Can I count on you to help keep <i>our</i> secret?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an hour after the Heavenly Bakery closed when Simon waddled up. His shirt and sweatpants clung tightly to his enormous body, showing off every roll and bludge of his pudge. Over his shoulder was a backpack with everything Evan told him to bring. In particular, a camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion was waiting for the pup outside of the bakery. He waved as Simon approached. \"Are you ready to do this?\" Evan asked in a hushed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon nodded. \"Let's take Katie down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You distract her. I sneak into the basement and collect any evidence I can find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what you're looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golden Retriever shook his head. \"No, but I'm certain the proof we need is in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's do this.\" Katie had left the front door unlocked and Evan held it open for Simon. As he waddled by, the lion checked out the pup's rear. The guy looked like he was smuggling beanbag chairs in his pants. A twinge of arousal sparked through Evan, and the lion quietly growled to himself, already making plans for the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie? You back there?\" hollered Evan as he locked the door behind them. A few seconds later, Katie came into the storefront of the bakery. She was carrying an enormous tray with a pile of freshly baked cookies on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon! So glad you made it!\" The panther said, placing the platter in front of the very obese pup. \"Just in time! These have finished cooling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in time? I've been outside waiting for forever! I need to pee!\" Evan shuffled off to the bathroom in the back leaving the two other furs alone up front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie gestured to the bag Simon was carrying. \"Is that your photography work? Let's see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...let's wait until Evan gets back.\" Simon said before biting a cookie in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...so, how things been for y-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KATIE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and yelled back. \"Yeah, Evan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS THERE SUPPOSED TO BE FOUR INCHES OF WATER COVERING THE BATHROOM FLOOR?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's not!\" The thick panther rushed to the back to join Evan. Simon waited a second before speed walking his way towards the basement door. Or, at least, as fast as he could go. Even in a hurry, the half-ton pup's waddle was just a notch above glacial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving made it to the door, he grabbed the key ring from his pocket, keys he held on to after having quit working for the bakery. Paws trembling, he hunted for the right key. It took a couple of tries, but Simon finally found it. He removed the padlock flung open the door. His paw reached out and flipped the light switch on, illuminating the staircase, and began making his way to the basement proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was only able to make it a few steps before feeling a hard shove on his back. The Golden Retriever stumbled, loosing his footing, and spilling down the stairs. The layers and layers of fat didn't do much to protect his body as it smashed hard against each step. The pup's body came to a rest at the bottom of the stairs, motionless when the last rippled shook through his flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan stood looking at the knocked-out pup at the bottom of the stairs. Seeing Simon's chest move up and down, the lion was assured that he was alive, hurt but alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie joined Evan at the top of the stairs and wrapped her arms around his waist. \"Is he out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a lightbulb. Now come on, I'll need you help moving him.\"</span></div></div>",

But the lastest issue of <i>Cuisine</i> magazine had a front-page expos\u00e9 on the bakery. Today, it felt like everyone in town wanted a taste. Though tired, Evan was glad for the surge in business. Katie had purchased a couple of new ovens and the extra revenue would help pay for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion joined Katie in the back where they clean and prepped for the next morning. This was Evan's favorite part of the workday. Katie had a habit of treating him to an extra cookie or two or half dozen while then worked. This time, Katie approached the lion with a pipping bag still filled three quarters of the way full with strawberry frosting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waste not want not!\" she said, holding the tip to Evan's open mouth and eventually depositing all the surgery frosting. As Evan swallowed the last bit, the panther gave his belly a pat. Ripples waved through the sphere of his doughy belly. \"Shirts getting tight, baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scale would agree with you on that one,\" Evan said, wiping frosting from the corner of his out. \"427 this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie purred as she gave Evan a side hug, her own plump body sinking into his fleshy side. \"Can't wait for you to show me tonight...\" She gave one of his basketball-size buttcheeks a slap. This made Evan moan a bit. She knew how much he loved having his butt played with, and Katie was planning on introducing a few new toys in the bedroom to exploit this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe, let's finish cleaning first. Then we'll head home and you can tell me if it feels like I'm 427 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a couple of hours, all of their closing chores were finished and Evan was ready to leave. \"Wait, where are you going?\" Katie asked him when he went to exit with her. \"It's Thursday which means that it's <i>your</i> turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan rubbed his paw against the side of his head. \"Ugh, we were so busy today that I forgot what day it was. Alright, this shouldn't be too long. I see you when I get home.\" They hugged, and kissed, and Evan gave Katie's butt a squeeze. The panther turned and walked in the direction of their apartment nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking the door once more, Evan headed to the back of the bakery. Taking out his keys, he found the right one and took off the padlock. Flipping on the lights, he made his way downstairs. His nose was hit with a musky odor as he made his way to the vast basement underneath the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion hit a lion switch at the bottom of the staircase which lit up the rest of the basement, and his eyes focuses on the venerable flabby boulder of yellow fur sitting on the basement floor. Evan walked over and jabbed the mass hard. It wobbled like a waterbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey-wakey eggs and bacey,\" said Evan. \"Feeling hungry, Simon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob stirred to life. Or, at least tried to. Simon's limbs were surrounded by so much fat that the dog could hardly even bring his paw up to scratch his nose, let along shift his legs trapped under his blimped-up belly. Though the leg that he broke on the trip down the stairs that had healed so poorly that Simon would only be able to barely move it if it wasn't covered by his own lard. The only Evan knew the pup was awake was by seeing if his eyes were open. And this was getting more difficult to tell these days. Simon's cantaloupe-sized cheeks forced the pup to be permanently squinting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for breakfast?\" Evan knew it wasn't morning but he enjoyed screwing with Simon's perception of time. And it worked. The pup had no idea what day it was or what time it was or even the season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon only responded with a groan. The sheer enormity of his cheeks and double chin made it impossible for him to form words anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the ceiling of the basement hung a thick rubber tube with a nozzle at the end. Upstairs were tanks of cream specially prepared for Simon. It was all he consumed these days. Evan grabbed end of the hose by the nozzle. He walked over to a panel on one of the basement walls where as a red handle. The lion slowly turned the handle. A thick off-white liquid creeped its way down the tube and towards the nozzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little quality control check...\" Evan muttered to himself. Sticking nozzle into his own mouth, he turned the handle further. More of the cream rushed down the tube, and Evan sucked it up with gusto. He groaned as gallon after gallon swelled up his flabby belly into a tight dome, forcing his shirt to stretch and rise upward along his gut. As his belly filled, his eyes winced in pain. Feeling ready to explode, Evan shut off the flow and removed the nozzle from his mouth. It took a few minutes for panting before the heavy lion caught his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me, that's good stuff...\" he groaned. Evan frequently treated himself to some of Simon's cream. Needless to say, more than a few dozens of the pounds he recently put on could be blamed on the cream. One day, he'd have to convince Katie to set something like that in their bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Simon, time for dinner!\" Evan wiped his saliva off of the nozzle as he waddled around towards Simon's mouth. The pup weakly opened his maw and Evan shoved the nozzle in. He wandered over to the handle and crank the flow on to just the right setting: Fast enough to ensure Simon drinks gallons by the minute, but not too fast to where he'll choke on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan paced around the basement while he waited for Simon to eat his fill. Spotting the door to the downstairs walk-in refrigerator, he unlocked it and checked inside. Nearly half the racks were full of jars of Katie's Special Ingredient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should harvest some lard from Simon soon. Pup'll enjoy that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting the door the fridge, Evan heard a metallic clank as the nozzle hit the floor. Simon must have his fill, the lion reasoned. The Golden Retriever learned earlier that it was not to trick Evan into eating less than he absolutely could. He pulled that stunt during one of the first weeks of his captivity. As punishment, Evan kept Simon full to point of exploding for several days. It was an extremely painful experience he did not want to repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan waddled as fast as he could over to the handle, paw holding his filled belly to keep it from jostling around too much. Shutting off the flow, the lion wrapped the hose up and hung it from a hook screwed into the wall. Along another wall of the basement was a garden hose. Evan grabbed that and cranked on the hot water. A pool of cream laid on the floor of the basement, and Evan blasted it with water. The liquid rushed down a drain in the center of the floor. Evan turned the hose on Simon, washing away any cream left on his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, pup. No time for a full bath today. Katie and I have some adult activities to do tonight. But I'll give you an extra special bath next time.\" Simon groaned. All of the baths by Evan always included butt stuff. Despite the fact that the pup's ass was wider than a sofa, Evan always found a way to penetrate him. Though Simon was ultimately grateful for have some sexual interaction in his present state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting the water, Evan wrapped up the garden hose. He examined the basement making sure everything was in order. \"Alright, I think my work here is done!\" Evan said. Walking up to Simon, he gave the enormous dog's belly a few pats. \"Goodnight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion turned off the light as he exited the basement. As he shut the door, he could hear whimpering echoing up the staircase.</span></div></div>",

He had to suddenly pull back to prevent himself from accidentally hitting the orange kangaroo that was stepping into the hallway. The 'roo was startled seeing the lion outside his door without notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oops! Sorry!\" Evan said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'roo had a paw of his chest as he calmed down. \"No worries! You really surprised me there!\" He was just about the same height as Evan and wore a white t-shirt and black sweatpants. The 'roo looked fairly proportional from the waist up with a little but of chub around his stomach and on his chest. However, his hindquarters were absurdly large. His butt looked like the 'roo stuffed two beachballs full of jelly into the back of his pants. His tail was engorged with lard and hung lazily over his rear. The 'roo's thighs looked just as chunky though one might surmise that there was some muscle in those legs to haul that enormous ass around. \"Can I help you with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was actually just here to introduce myself,\" the lion said. \"I just moved in next door this morning in unit 703. I'm Evan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, cool. Good to meet you neighbor. I'm Ollie!\" The two shook paws. \"Hey, I was just head out to lunch. I never miss the lunch special at El Burrito Diablito! Care to join me, neighbor? My treat!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The metal chairs made a loud creaking noise as the 'roo pushed himself away from the table. Though Ollie wasn't as fat as some of the furs that Evan had seen in his limited time at Port Zaftig, the kangaroo was easily one of the widest with hips so large he needed to plant a chair under each of his bulbous legs. Ollie let out a sigh of satisfaction as he patted his full belly. A small mountain of paper wrappers laid on the plastic tray in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough?\" joked Evan. The lion had ordered a much smaller lunch of a couple of tacos with a side of rice. Ollie, on the other hand, had order two dozen burritos. Sure, they weren't massive by any far stretch of the imagination, but it was still easily the most burritos the lion ever saw any one fur devour in a single sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'roo pondered for a second, his paws lightly drumming on his belly. \"Umm... nope! I've got room for more!\" Ollie said. \"Actually, I've got a hankering for ice cream! Come on! There's a great ice cream shop a couple of blocks away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" said Evan as both furs got up and walked out of El Burrito Diablito. \"But I don't know if I'll get anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? On a diet or something?\" chuckled Ollie as he shuffled along the sidewalk, his ponderous posterior wobbling as he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Gotta get some meat on them bones!\" The 'roo playfully poked at the lion's thin chest. Evan slapped his paw away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, cut it out! Besides, it doesn't look like you've got 'meat' on your bones!\" Evan jabbed Ollie's thigh, his paw sinking in an inch into the pliable flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax!\" said Ollie. \"I'm just joking around with you! But there's no doubt you'll fill out soon enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have noticed?\" asked Ollie. The 'roo gestured with his paw at the many portly furs around them. \"What do they all have in common?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...um, they're all...\" stammered Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say it: Fat!\" Ollie said. \"Practically every fur in this town is big. And can you blame us? The food is cheap and delicious, and nobody bothers anyone else for being fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, furs are fat here. So what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it's only a matter of time before you're sporting a baby belly yourself!\" The 'roo grabbed at Evan's shirt, pulling it up to expose his flat abdomen. Once again, the lion smacked Ollie's paw away and yanked down his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right. Maybe a pound or two. But I'm not going to get super fat or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'roo tisked. \"It's always the stubborn ones that end up the biggest. An inevitable few pounds here, another dozen and a half pounds there, then they  finally give in. Then they go nuts, eating like mad to make up for lost time.\" Evan did not look amused. \"Oh, calm down! Perhaps you'll be the exception!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two furs were just outside the ice cream shop: Jen &amp; Berry's. The 'roo stopped in front of the lion. \"Hey, I have a few days off work. Why do I show you around? My treat! I'll take you around to all the best restaurants! You'll see why furs around here are so large!\"</span></div></div>",

He had just picked up the latest new fighting game: Mega Mash Matrons. It was a game that the lion was looking forward to playing for a while now, so he was thrilled to find out that Ollie had it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I can I say? Just chalk it up to practice!\" the 'roo said, leaning forward and reaching for one of the several pizza boxes on the coffee table. \"DR. MARIA WINS\" the television screen flashed. Ollie was dressed very comfortably in a loose tank top that showed off his chunky arms and stretchy grey shorts that fit around his wide waist. He grabbed two slices of pizza and stacked them on top of each other before taking a big bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? This game <i>just</i> came out!\" said Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been playing it nonstop,\" the 'roo said between bites of pizza. \"Butt's barely left the couch since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, I bet that explains why it's so big!\" joked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always the best seat in this house!\" the 'roo said, wiggling in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. It's like you're always carrying about two beanbag chairs behind you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Jealous? Grow your own!\" Ollie slid a pizza box over in the direction of the lion. Evan chuckled as he took out a slice and chomped on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you ordered so much pizza!\" Evan said, finishing his slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I didn't know how much you could eat,\" the 'roo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm not a fat ass like you!\" joked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie chuckled. \"You talk a lot about my butt, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just so big!\" Evan said, poking the 'roo's thick thigh. \"I've never seen a guy with that much junk in his trunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'roo smirked. \"Well, then I have an idea. Let's make the next round interesting with a bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie thought for a second. \"You know, I've been parked on this couch for so long. A butt massage would feel so great right about now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion laughed nervously. Evan had been somewhat fixated on the 'roo's backside, the two gelatinous mounds of pudge, since he first laid eyes on them earlier that day. The lion had always been a bit of an ass man, but here he was with a 'roo who had a butt bigger and nicer than any girl he had been with. The lion's loins stirred to life at the prospects of sinking his paws into that fur's rump. \"O-okay, and if I win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win...if you win...ah, all this pizza is yours!\" said Ollie, gesturing to the remaining pizzas in front of them. \"It looks like you need it anyways, skinny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" said Evan. Ollie then started up another round. The screen flashed to the character selection screen and the 'roo began figuring out who to play as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Evan lost, he'd easily have an excuse to lay his paws on that vast butt. But if he purposefully tried losing, it might seem to obvious. Besides, Ollie was good enough of a player that he could easily beat the lion anyways.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The lion's eyes were bugged out. Evan was doing all the wrong things during the game. He was dropping weapons and missing strikes. But when Ollie's character, the Glacier Ascenders, fell off the stage, the lion ending up winning instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, oh...\" stammered Evan. \"I wasn't expecting that. Heh, I thought I was toast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and a bet's a bet after all. So...\" Ollie shuffled his heavy body over towards Evan and in a single fluid motion positioned his massive self so that the 'roo was facing the lion, his enormous thighs straddling Evan and pinning him down into the couch. Surprised by the obese fur suddenly in his lap, Evan needed a second to collect himself. In that moment, Ollie twisted around and grabbed a pizza box from the table and tossed it on the couch beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...what are you..doing?\" asked Evan as he tired to wiggle himself out from underneath Ollie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'roo grabbed Evan's right arm and pinned it under his leg, then doing the same with the lion's left arm. Evan struggled but he was firmly stuck up the 'roo's weight. Ollie then opened up the pizza box, grabbed a greasy slice, and held it up to the lion's face. \"You won the bet! So you're getting your reward!\" the 'roo said with a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I-\" The second Evan's mouth opened, Ollie shoved the entire slice in. The lion had no choice but to chew it all down and swallow it. He refused to open his mouth again, so the 'roo placed a pudgy paw over his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna have to breath sometime!\" Ollie said. After a few moments, the lion gasped for air which gave the 'roo a chance to shove another entire slice into the lion's mouth. \"You know, this'll be a lot easier if you were so stubborn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no other option, the lion opened his mouth for the next slice. Then the slice. Then the next pizza. Slice after slice entered the lion's belly, and Evan moaned in pain as his stomach filled to the brim with carbs and meat. A few times he tried resisting, but Ollie had ways of making the lion eat more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, big cat. Last slice!\" Ollie said nearly an hour after he started, holding a final piece up to Evan's grease and sauce stained mouth. The lion's mouth hung open, and the 'roo fed it to him. When he swallowed the last bit, the 'roo got off the lion, who groaned now that all the weight of the fur was off of him. Ollie admired his work: Evan looked as if he swallowed a basketball, his gut stretching his shirt tight and straining the button on his jeans. The lion's eyes were glazed over and he panted quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, poor baby. Need a nap?\" jested Ollie as he rubbed a paw against the lion's gut. He said nothing in response, only closing his eyes. The last time he heard before drifting off to sleep was Ollie saying, \"Heh, didn't think I noticed you trying to lose?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Evan awoke later that night, the only light on in the entire apartment came from one of the rooms down the hallway. Nursing his still bloated stomach, the lion slowly crept his way towards the room. The door was ajar and he peaked in. Inside of what appeared to be a kind of office room, Ollie was sat at what to Evan was an incredibly elaborate and presumably expensive gaming setup. A hi-tech computer with dual monitors, the latest generations of consoles lined up in a row, shelves upon shelves of games, and even a camera pointed in his direction. The 'roo sat shirtless on the extra-wide and comfy looking chair, his rolls and doughy moobs exposed to the cool conditioned air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround Ollie's head was a pair of impressive looking headphones. As Evan walked up to him, he saw that he was playing Skyram, some kind of fantasy/adventure RPG game that the lion just never could really get into. He could see the character Ollie created. It appeared to be some sort of lion paladin, but it looked like the 'roo cranked up the sliders all the way since the character looked absolutely gigantic, and not in terms in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion tapped Ollie on the shoulder. Startled, he turned around to see Evan behind him. \"Oh, hey! Though you'd pass out all night or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I just woke up. Figured I'd head home to my own bed but wanted to say goodbye first,\" he said. \"Wow, this is a pretty impressive gaming thing you got set up here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's part of my job,\" Ollie explained. \"I stream on Twatch all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I never knew anyone who could make a living doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can if you're entertaining enough. Then you can rake in some serious cash. Check out my channel sometime! I stream under the name RooTube.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, uh, hey! And today I'll...oops, sorry...I'll be playing Advanced Warz! Growing up, this was one of my favorite games ever! And I hope you'll love it too! Now, let's start a new campaign...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn bed, Evan was checking out Ollie's Twatch channel on his phone and skimming through some of the archived streams. One of the earliest streams was from several years ago and features Ollie playing a game that he, too, loved playing as a kid. The 'roo was shy and awkward, but Evan chalked that up to being a new streamer at the time. He couldn't help but notice how much skinnier Ollie used to be. If he had to guess, Evan figured it couldn't be more than 130 soaking wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing that video, Evan looked for something more recent. Ollie had streamed the night before and the lion clicked on that video. In it, the 'roo was playing Mega Mash Matrons. \"Ah, been practicing then. So that's how he got so good so quick...\" Evan watched for a little bit. Clearly, Ollie grew into being a more entertaining streaming since he sounded way more confident and assured of himself than in his very early video. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late and Evan didn't intent to watch the entire two hour long video. Skipping ahead a fair bit, he caught Ollie in the middle of reading comments from his viewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and thanks to icaraskid and hunkyacademia for the subs! And hey, boscobob just put up of Snack Challenge! Let's see...he wants to see if I can beat two level ten Dark Pats but while playing as PiggilyWuff. If I win, he's gonna send a case of Jen &amp; Berry's my way! Well, I can never say no to a Snack Challenge, so here we go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan watched at Ollie easily defeat the challenge. \"Can't wait for that ice cream to be dropped off! You know I love my ice cream!\" Feeling very tire, the lion turned off the video and tossed his phone onto his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion loved video games, and if he could be a stream on Twatch just like Ollie was, he could make bank while doing something he does anyways. But Evan figured there was a pretty high entry cost to being a Twatch streamer. Ollie's battlestation alone probably cost over ten thousand dollars. Still, he might want to ask about joining in on one of his streams. It might be fun to be front of the camera for one of those.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, everyone! Goodnight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking on his mouse, the lion brought an end for that day's Twatch stream. Only twenty or so people were watching him play games, but it wasn't too bad of a start for just his first week. The lion had to thank Ollie for some of those viewers. The 'roo promoted Evan's channel on his own stream. Not only that, but he helped the lion with a computer set of his own as well as a webcam. It wasn't like the hi-tech setup that Ollie had. Rather, it was older stuff that the 'roo had stored in his closet that, quite frankly, he was more than willing to get rid off. While it wasn't the best equipment on the market, it certainly worked for Evan. And he was happy to accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrolling through his new submissions, a message popped up in his inbox. The lion was delighted. So far, nobody had messaged him, and he was glad to finally hear from a fan. He clicked the mail icon and saw a message that was sent by a user named whiteassnow777. Evan recognized that username; it was one he always saw in his audience for all of his streams since day one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>have you tried this game? you should try this game</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the short message was a link. THE LION'S DEN, the link read. Cautiously, Evan clicked it. It brought up a separate window on his internet browser. The screen was black until the words ENTER YOUR FULL NAME popped up. Evan typed out his full name and pressed enter. Suddenly, the screen lit up with shades of vibrant blues and greens. There was a lion prowling through the Savannah. The game dimmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\"><br>\r\nEAT THE MEAT<br>\r\nAVOID THE HYENAS<br>\r\nCOLLECT 100 MEAT TO WIN</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Evan was in control of the lion. Using the WSAD keys and mouse, he navigated the lion as it gracefully and swiftly ran through the bushes and grass of the game's environment. It wasn't long until he found the icon of a red floating steak. Evan moved the lion over to the steak and it disappeared with a loud gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Evan to get used to the game. The idea behind it was simple. The more the lion ate, the bigger and slower it got. This meant that the harder it was to evade the hyenas by simply running away. As the lion in the game got fuller, the more the player had to rely on stealth to escape the vicious pack, or use the lion's roar ability which scared away the hyenas for a while (though the cooldown time on the ability was very, very long).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was only able to get 18 pieces of meat before getting got by one of the hyenas. \"Not bad for a first try,\" said Evan as he favorites the tab. He scratched the underside of his full belly, the bottom of it now sticking out from underneath his shirt. \"Ugh, still so bloated. Probably from all those ice cream sandwiches...\" he reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game he was sent seemed fun and might be worthy of playing on his stream. Evan thought about showing it to Ollie and seeing if he thought it might make good streaming material.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was only an hour into his streaming session when Evan started to feel ill. His stomach felt swollen and bloated. \"God, what did I eat today?\" he muttered to himself while he played another round of The Lion's Den. While this was only the fourth time ever playing, Evan was getting better at it. His high score so far was 32 meat pieces before the lion avatar got attacked by hyenas. Around 30 pieces and the lion got noticably fatter and slower, and required a much different set of skills to continue on. And Evan hadn't mastered that part of the game yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe burped. A little bit of stomach acid burned his throat. His sour stomach was starting to get extremely distracting. On his next round of The Lion's Den he was only able to get a few pieces before losing on account of his stomach being such a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, everyone, I'm sorry,\" Evan apologized. \"I'm going to have to call it quits early today. I'm starting to feel really ill.\" A few members of the audience typed in get well messages. Yet most of the furs watching (which, to Evan's surprise, was hovering around 50) said nothing in the chat just as they had done for the entire session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting down the stream, Evan got up from his chair and saw just how swollen and round his belly was. \"God, seriously, what did I eat that's making me so bloated?\" His belly, so round and big that it made it difficult to see his toes, stretched out his red shirt and forced it to ride up several inches, exposing a fair amount of creamy fur. Had he been able to see past his belly, Evan would have seen that sometime during the stream the top button of his shorts exploded off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping down to his underwear, he carefully laid down in bed to rest, hoping a nap would ease his sour stomach. And with a paw gently rubbing his blimped up belly, he shut his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan wandered around the warm fields, searching for a pool of water to drink from. It was a hot day and the lion was feeling parched. Walking around the Savannah on not his two hind legs but on all fours, he searched for something to sooth his dry throat. That is, until he saw something red and shiny off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, the lion swiftly made its way to what had been shimmering in the distance. Floating a couple feet off the ground was a steak, glistening in the sunlight. Evan's stomach growled; it no longer wanted water but the hunk of meat hanging in front of him. He licked his chops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">EAT THE MEAT</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetters appeared above the steak. But Evan didn't need the invitation. Leaning forward with his mouth agap, the lion inched closer to the meat. However, it disappeared moments before he could chomp down on it. Confused, Evan looked around. But he felt his stomach feel sated and the taste of meat was on his tongue. He purred in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother red shimmer was off in the distance, and the lion hurried its way over. Again, another shiny hunk of meat hung mysteriously in the air. Again, it disappeared seconds before Evan could take a bite. And again, the lion felt as if he had a delicious snack. Two more shimmering red object were on the horizon, and Evan made his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo dozen pieces of meat later, and Evan felt bloated and lethargic. His svelte body had ballooned out with meat. A few dozen more and the lion's belly would surely drag along the ground. Yet there was an insatiable desire in him for more and more of this mysterious meat. Lazily dragging his rounding body over to yet another steak, Evan slowly opened his maw ready for another bit of meat to somehow fill his already full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan heard the cackling of many hyenas as the meat vanished into his belly. One or two wouldn't be a problem. But they sounded like they were coming from the left, right, and behind him. He spotted rustling in nearby grass, and Evan ran. Or, at least, he ran as well as he could in his inflated state which was more like a speedy trot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned, seeing another hunk of meat floating in his path. Groaning, he marched past, it vanishing into his belly and ballooning it out another inch. Another steak hung before his path, but all other directions were swarmed with hyena, and he had no choice but to eat that stake, and the one lined up right behind that, and the several more behind that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Evan's walk dropped to an awkward shuffle. His meat-filled gut dragged along the ground, drawing a thick line in the dirt for the hyenas to following. Clawing his paws into the earth, he tried dragging himself another inch. But it was useless; the hyenas were close, and soon he felt one of them sink its teeth into his fleshy rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan woke up in a cold sweat. It was dark in his bedroom. Checking his phone, he discovered it was close to midnight. Lying back down in bed, he felt his belly, still quite full, jostle about as he plopped back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only a nightmare...\" Evan mutter to himself. \"A nightmare about...that game...Maybe I should give it a rest? But damn, it is a fun game...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knocking again on Evan's front door, Ollie waited patiently to see if the lion was home. The 'roo hadn't heard from him in nearly two weeks. Evan hadn't been streaming either. So Ollie decided to waddle over next door and do a welfare check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Ollie jiggled the handle of the door to find it was unlocked. He let himself in. \"Evan? You here?\" The living room was empty. Peaking down the hall, he spotted a bit of light coming from the bedroom door as it was open just slightly. Cautiously making his way down the hall, the 'roo's nose was assaulted with a heavy musk that only stronger as he got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan?\" aske Ollie as he gently nudged the door open. \"Are you...here...\" He saw the lion sat in front of his computer. But in the two weeks since he last saw Evan, the already chunky lion had nearly doubled in size. His office chair struggled to hold his girth; rolls of fat spilled over the armrests as his naked rear poured out from the sides. A tail thick as a sausage laid out lazily. His gut, being so massive and taking up so much of his lap, made it difficult for him to reach his mouse and keyboard. Evan had positioned his body awkwardly so as to be able to reach both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion didn't notice Ollie had entered. As the heavy 'roo approached, he saw Evan was playing some sort of computer game. On the screen, a rotund lion waddled through grasslands as it approached the icon of a large slab of meat. It escaped with a cartoonish gulping noise. Ollie could hear Evan groan softly as the number in the corner flashed 71.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan! You there?\" Ollie said, shaking the lion by his shoulder. His fur was greasy and matted. He guessed Evan hadn't bathed in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion shook his head as if being snapped out of a trance. \"Oh, hey Ollie!\" he said. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? I haven't seen you in forever! What's been going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I've just been playing this new game I found! It's pretty fun! I've just beaten my high score!\" A pudgy paw scratched his enormous gut. Evan then let out a burp as if having eaten a feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...what the hell happened to you? You got...big in a hurry!\" Ollie had seen plenty of fat furs in Port Zaftig. Even he himself piled on quite a bit of weight in a short period of time. Yet Evan's growth was astounding. \"What the hell have you been eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much. I've mostly just been playing my game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right! Look at you! What did you do to yourself?\" Ollie sunk a paw into Evan's gut. It sank easily under the layers of lard. Though it was stopped by an overstuffed belly. Evan must have just finished gorging himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I just...\" He trailed off upon seeing his body. It was only as if right then he actually saw what he looked like. Panicked, Evan pawed at his flabby gut, poked his moobs, seeing if they were in fact real. \"Oh my God...how did this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, what have you been eating?\" Ollie demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! Really! Just some snacks here and there! But I don't think I've made a meal in a while! Haven't needed to! I just, uh, have been feeling kinda full! Like, right now I feel stuffed to the brim!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I really have eaten an-\" The cackling of hyenas came from the computer before it flashed GAME OVER. Evan whirled his obese body around to see that he had left his game unattended. \"Damn it! I lost!\" The game invited Evan to put his initials in to the 2nd place slot. In first place was someone with the initials OTT. Their high score was 100.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we've got figure out what's going on...after you take a shower. You kinda reek, dude..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan lifted a heavy arm and sniffed. \"Woah, yeah...I don't remember when I took a shower last. But could you...help me out of this chair? I think I'm stuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ollie came back an hour later, he found Evan napping in his bed. The enormous naked feline laid on his side, his sheets bunched up showing off his blubbery backside. The 'roo blushed, and tucked the sheet back over to cover Evan's rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at Evan's computer, the 'roo fired up the machine. He had taken off the armrests to free the lion, so Ollie was able to sit even with his incredibly wide behind. Once it had booted up, the 'roo hunted around for the game. THE LION'S DEN said an icon on the desktop. And soon, Ollie was playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken a very short games to get the hang of it. But when he did, he certainly saw why Evan thought it was so fun. Soon, he was navigating a chunky lion around, hunting for a 35th piece of meat while nimbly dodging hyenas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'roo's concentration was broken by the sounds of groaning coming from Evan. He turned to see the lion on his back, his belly full and round sticking out in the air. The lion slowly dragged a paw along the dome to sooth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan! Are you okay?\" asked Ollie as he rushed over to his bedside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...full...\" moaned Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you eat?\" the roo asked. Evan just shook his head. \"Then how did...\" He glanced over to the computer and saw the avatar of the engorged lion. Something clicked in his mind. \"God, I think that game is doing something to you! Somehow, that virtual meat the lion eats is making its way into you! That would explain how you got so...\" Ollie eyed Evan's nude, fat body, grateful the lion's belly was large enough to cover his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...think?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Got any idea about how to stop...this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned again, thinking for a moment. \"Hey, maybe we could...</span></div></div>",

Flat on his back, Evan began massaging his stuffed gut to help it digest all the meat inside him. Or, at least, as much of his gut as he could reach. Any part past his deep bellybutton was too far for him to reach. His stomach churned away. On the screen of Evan's computer flashed 2ND - 82 ----- EVA<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past few weeks, Evan (determined to beat the high score and break whatever curse was on the game) had been locked in a cycle. He'd play a session of the game until his stomach grew too full to which then Evan would waddle to his bed, nap off the food coma, then go right back to playing and getting that 101st piece of meat. And again, Evan played until he was filled to the brim only to nap it off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion knew that he was getting comically overweight, fat even by Port Zaftig standard. Barely mobile, his belly hung around his knees and usually rested on his barrel-like thighs when he sat. Hiding his lower half from him, Evan's view down was nothing but a sea of lard and cream-colored fur. Two moobs the size of hams sat stop his gut. Evan's ass was wide enough to the point of needed a second chair to support him at his computer desk. Massive saddlebags of fat hung over his haunches, and his tail was frequently caught in the huge crack of his rear. Taking a break from The Lion's Den and feeling a little aroused one night, Evan was dismayed to find that his manhood was nearly encase in fat. It took him some creative engineering that night to get himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his weight didn't concern him. He'd burn off all that lard in due time. He needed to break that curse first. Who know how many other furs are suffering the same thing he was dealing with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evan was drifting off to sleep, he heard the front door of his apartment open. Ollie had left himself in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...any luck?\" He asked the nude, blubbery lion. The 'roo wanted to rest his enormous behind on the edge of Evan's bed, but he wasn't sure it could handle his weight too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shook his head as best he could. The thick collar of fat around his neck made that somewhat difficult. \"Close. But not close enough.\" As he spoke, his bulbous cheeks jiggled about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie sighed. \"Look, I feel really bad. If I didn't help you get into streaming, then you wouldn't be...in the state you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ollie, it's f-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Send me the link. To the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan cocked his head. \"What? Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I want to help you beat this thing!\" Ollie said. \"Besides, if two of use are working on beating that game, the better the odds, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" groaned Evan. \"It's not as easy of a game as it looks. And look what it did to me.\" Evan gave his gigantic belly a wobble with his paws. His entire body jiggled in response. \"Imagine what I'd do t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! Please, let me help!\"</span></div></div>",

The lion's enormous body lurched towards the nightstand as he grabbed for his phone. It was 5:54pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the sheet off of him, he swung one lard-larden leg off the edge of the bed, then the other. Shuffling and shimming, Evan was able to position himself upright. And after a few failed attempts, he was able to get up on his feet. Evan took a step forward and immediately felt exhausted by carrying the hundreds and hundreds of extra pounds of fat on him. Luckily, it was only a few steps to get himself at his computer desk. Carefully lowering his immense body onto the pair of chairs which supported one chunky buttcheek each, he sighed in relief, panting slightly at the minor task he just performed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooting up his computer, he prepared himself for another session of The Lion's Den. He was so close last time, getting 96 pieces of meat before failing the game. The lion was sure to beat it soon. He had to. A few more stomach-stretching sessions and Evan might finally get too big to lift himself off of his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was going well. In less than fifteen minutes, he had already gotten 25 meat pieces. But Evan noticed something strange. The avatar of the lion didn't look any different. Normally, a sizable paunch would have grown on him. Yet for some reason the lion never got any fatter. The same was true when the meat count went up to 37 pieces, then 45, then 52. The lion stayed skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it...what is...\" Evan muttered to himself while playing. Something else he noticed was that he didn't feel full. Normally, the lion would feel somewhat stuffed by the time the in-game lion got to 53 meat pieces. But for some reason, Evan's belly, large as it was, didn't feel full. In fact, it was totally em-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...did he...\" Evan quickly ended the game by letting one of the hyenas devour the lion. GAME OVER read the screen. Evan impatiently tapped his paw on his desk as he wait for the high scores to appear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n1ST - OLE ---- 104<br>\r\n2ND - OTT ---- 100<br>\r\n3RD - EVA ---- 96<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...he did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly twenty minutes for Evan to make his way next door to Ollie's apartment. Having no clothes that fit anymore, the lion wrapped a bed sheet around his massive body and waddled over hoping that none of the furs that lived with him on the floor were out and about. It was empty. He shuffled, jiggling along the way, and eventually made it to Ollie's door which he found open. Waddling inside, the lion felt his flabby flank brush up against the sides of the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ollie?\" shouted Evan. The 'roo wasn't in the living room. He heard a grunt from down the hall. The lion rushed as best as he could, but his pace was glacial. \"Ol-...Ollie! You...you...did it!\" he huffed as he struggled to make his way down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan bursted through the bedroom door. \"Ollie! You...you...\" He panted as he took in the gigantic fur in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been some time since Evan saw Ollie. He knew that the day since being sent the link for the game that the 'roo would be working diligently at beating the game. Evan, too, was dedicated to the same goal, and both lost contact with each other as they did so. And the game's curse certain did a number on Ollie's waistline in the meanwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'roo was lying on this stomach, parts of which spilled out over the edges of his mattress which itself sat atop a broken bedframe. Two orange moons of adipose rose into the air, dimpled with cellulite. The two fleshy boulders squished together making a canyon of a crack that Evan could have lost himself in during his skinny days. Evan could hardly make out the 'roo's tree trunk like thighs underneath. Ollie's tail, like a sleeping bag full of jelly, hung off to the side. Lovehandles as large as pillows adorned Ollie's astronomical ass. And roll after roll after roll of back fat piled atop them. The lion had no idea how fat Ollie had gotten, but he ventured that it would take several heavy-duty scales to learn that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan waddled around the collosal fur to see Ollie facedown in a pillow, his chubby cheeks looking much more pronounced. The lion spotted a laptop and mouse resting on the ground in front him. He figured that Ollie knew he wouldn't be able to play the game for long without being bedbound, so he simply played from his bed itself. On the screen of the computer was the menu for The Lion's Den.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast asleep, Evan decided to let Ollie sleep. He deserved it.</span></div></div>",

First, it allowed him to earn some cash doing something that he always loved doing. Second, being a Twatch streamer didn't require much beside a camera and a decent gaming set-up. But now the 'roo had another reason to enjoy streaming: It was a profession he could literally do from his bed. This was particularly helpful being that the gargantuan orange kangaroo rarely left his bed these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everyone! That's it for today! Catch y'all tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLurching towards the laptop set up beside his bed, Ollie shut off the stream for the day. He was grateful for his loyal audience. After practically disappearing from Twatch for a few weeks, they all were excited to see him back to streaming. Though some of the furs watching couldn't help but point out the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\njesus olly what have you been eating<br>\r\n<br>\r\ndamn man! lookin thicc!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlay off the twunkies, roo!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his camera only pointed from his shoulders up, anybody seeing Ollie's orange-sized cheeks and row of chins would immediately guess that they belonged to an exceptionally fat fur. But in all, nobody seemed to much mind that their favorite streamer was now hyper-obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan! Can you help finish up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, the enormous lardy lion waddled into the bedroom. While Evan had gotten used to moving around with hundreds of extra pounds of fat on him, it still took him a considerable amount of time to move from room to room. \"Huff...huff..all done for...today?\" he asked, leaning against the doorframe to Ollie's bedroom. He nodded, and the large lion got to work helping Ollie put everything away for the day. Being bound to his bed by his absurd weight, there wasn't too much the 'roo could do without the help of at least a semi-mobile fur. Luckily, he knew one who owed him a favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie watched as Evan slowly but surely wrapped up cords and put away equipment, doughy body jostling about as he did so. The 'roo got a clear view of the lion's nude obese frame. Even though he had been dieting for the last month, Evan was nowhere near even close to having shrunk down to the point where he could wear any of Ollie's pre-gain clothes. So the lion plodded around the apartment stark naked. Not like Ollie minded at all. The 'roo was just as naked. Layers of lard usually covered up what needed covering up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D..done...\" Evan said, slamming a drawer shut. He wiped his forehead with a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie sat nervously shuffling in place on his mattress which sat on the floor his bedroom. \"Hey, uh, Evan? Remember that thing we talked about the other day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. You've already had a cheat day,\" the lion replied. \"And we've got to slim you d-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I mean...uh, the <i>other</i> thing...\" said Ollie, anxiously playing with his paws. \"It's...uh, been a long time since, uh, the last time...and I'm getting kinda...you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan stared at the 'roo as he lean his hefty body against a desk, catching his breath. \"...f-fine...I guess I do owe you,\" the lion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he was helping Ollie spread his legs as far apart as they could. Squealing in excitement, the 'roo laid his back on the mattress, heaving his big gut out of the way for Evan. Moments later, the lion's mouth was exploring the cavern of rolls and folds that made up the 'roo's crotch. Eventually, he found what he was looking for and his mouth began going to work on Ollie's shaft. At least, as best as Evan could. The thousand-pound-plus kangaroo's cock was so engulfed in fat that without help pushing the imposing fat pad out of the way, Evan could do nothing besides lick the sensitive tip. He tried doing that, occasionally coming up for air before diving back down. Ollie moaned in pleasure but knew it wasn't going to be enough. \"Evan...do you think you could...reach more?\" he grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion removed his face from Ollie's cock. \"S-sorry...there's just so much...in the way,\" he panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie threw his head back and sighed. \"Damn it...I don't want to have to wait for my fat ass to shrink down before I can get off again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan, who was resting his head on one of Ollie's pillowy thigh, suddenly had an idea. \"Stomach...get on your stomach...\" It took the both of them nearly fifteen minutes, but eventually Ollie was now resting on his belly, his broad butt presenting itself to the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what are you...\" began Ollie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion stared at the blubbery globes in front of him, a paw sinking into each meaty buttcheek. Evan calculated that his cock, also greatly shortened due to his massive weight gain, wouldn't be able to penetrate the 'roo's rear. But he had another idea. Parting the tremendous cheek, Evan's nose was hit with the smell of musk and sweat. He was glad that he had given Ollie such a thorough sponge bath earlier that day. Spotting his target, Evan's face dove in the great canyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie couldn't help but let out a lust-filled moan as he felt the lion's tongue on his hole. Grinding his face into his pillow, the 'roo found his hips bucking, his vast ass jostling and wobbling around Evan's head. His cock sprung back to life, and soon he could feel a small trickle of liquid drip onto one of the rolls of his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing back up for air, Evan took the time as an opportunity to kiss, nibble, and bite the 'roo gelatinous ass. Each brought out little squeaks of pleasure from Ollie. Pulling himself away for a moment, the lion slapped a paw against the 'roo's butt making the mass jiggle about wildly. Ollie groaned again, and Evan gave his rear another few slaps. Shifting his rear, the fat of Ollie's butt shook around almost hypnotically, beckoning Evan to come again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, the lion dove his face between the mammoth cheek and started licking up the 'roo's hole. Ollie panted heavily, knowing that he was nearing the end. He had only let a few furs in his life play with his ponderous rear, but none had given his butt the tongue-lashing that Evan was giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan..I think...I'm...ohh....\" Ollie groaned again. He felt his cock erupt as jets of hot liquid sprayed his rolls and bedsheets. Intense waves of pleasure ran through his body and his hips buckled around. As his orgasm faded, the 'roo's head collapsed into his pillow. He sighed, feeling Evan continue to lick him with the same gusto. Were Ollie able to see past his massive rear, he would have seen Evan working his own cock with a free paw. He also would have seen streams of hot white fluid shoot out and hit the floor and bed as the lion worked himself up to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Evan removed his face from Ollie's backside and rested it on one of the 'roo's soft buttcheek. For nearly a half hour, the two fattened furs laid panting, catching their breath from what had to be the most exercise either of them got in months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was good...\" moaned Ollie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I did owe you one.\"</span></div></div>",

Evan grabbed a two liter bottle of root beer he had been drinking and chugged the remained third. He gave his gut a pat, a gut which was now slowly taking over his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good show today, huh?\" asked Ollie as he typed away on the laptop. The lion just groaned. \"What? Didn't you see how many Snack Challenges you won?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snacks won't pay the rent,\" Evan moaned. \"I've been in this town for a while now and been playing video games instead of looking for work. Now I have no idea how I'm paying rent next month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie shut the laptop and placed it back onto the coffee table. \"Umm, I got an idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can move in with me! Look, since you've been joining my streams, my views have gone through the roof. More views means more money from advertising. I've been making money hand over fist! So why don't you move in with me? I won't charge you rent! All I need to do is move my bedroom into my office and you can start bringing your stuff over! What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan thought for a moment. He let out a belch before answering. \"...let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the bathroom sink wearing just a pair of pajamas bottoms, Evan couldn't help but notice his pudgy belly wobble as he brushed his teeth. The lion certainly had packed on a bit of weight, easily fifty pounds, though he didn't have a scale to check that. Between the Snack Challenges and hanging out with Ollie all the time, it was only a matter of time before his waistline started thickening up an-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Sorry!\" Evan heard from behind. Ollie, donning only what had to be the biggest pair of white briefs he ever saw, had barged into the bathroom. \"Gotta get used to the fact that I'm not living alone anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan spat out blueish green toothpaste into the sink. \"No worries! I'll be done in a minute!\" Turning back to finish brushing he teeth, he spotted Ollie's enormous ass in the mirror as the 'roo turned to leave, two orange-furred blobs of cottage cheese that stretched the briefs that covered them to the point that they were practically transparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I don't do something about my weight soon, Ollie won't be the only fat ass in this apartment...\" the lion thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, the Snack Challenges posed one of the greater risks to his weight. Having fans ship him palettes of junk food is only bound to worsen his situation. Were he to start purposefully failing the challenges, less snacks would be sent his way. Though Ollie, the avid gamer he was, was certainly bound to catch on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Evan didn't need less snacks sent to him. Ollie seemed happy enough to devour anything sent his way. If Evan could somehow get Ollie to take on more the burden of eating all the snacks sent, the problem would solve itself.</span></div></div>",

Catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'roo, laying on his stomach in bed with his colossal rear sticking up in the air, looked over his shoulder to see a box of ice cream sandwiches flying towards him. He was able to catch it moments before the box smacked him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta get rid of them!\" lied Evan. \"Freezer is getting full! Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting full again?\" moaned Ollie. \"Ugh, I might need to invest in another. Can't you eat these? I'm so full from dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't. Uh, I just had a box myself!\" Evan lied again . \"So...Enjoy!\" The lion shut the bedroom door of Ollie's room satisfied that all the calories where headed towards the 'roos belly and not his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan figured out tricks like that for the past few weeks to get Ollie to devour more of the snacks sent to them by fans. It was fairly easy for the lion to find excuses here and there to empty the fridge of their snacks. Occasionally, Ollie would protest but in the end, the fat 'roo always ate what was put in front of him. And while the lion hadn't really lost any weight, he certainly had not gained any. This was a victory in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, Evan awoke late in the day. Wandering into the living room, he saw Ollie speaking with a burly, bellied gorilla. Sitting at the front door of their apartment was a massive palette of Twunkies. They were Evan's favorite snack cake growing up. He stood staring at the hundreds and hundreds of snack cakes now sitting in their apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Evan! You're awake!\" Ollie said, handing a clipboard back to the gorilla. \"They can go down the hall, last room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A late Snack Challenge win finally came in!\" the 'roo said. \"And just your luck! I've never lied Twunkies. So into your room they go!\" Evan watched as the gorilla off-loaded all of the snack cakes into his bedroom, box after box after box after box. He had a flashback of when he was a cub, one time getting in trouble for eating a whole box of them by himself. Now hundreds of them were on his way to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie reached around and patted Evan on his shoulder. \"I guess it's good karma for getting the fridge and freezer so empty. Where do you find space for everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie had caught on.</span></div></div>",

Ollie groaned in delight as the lion massaged the orange blob, his paws working in deep, penetrating circles. After several minutes, he switched to massaging the other massive cheek. Another groan of ecstasy came from Ollie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you're a natural at this...\" said Ollie before burying his face back into mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I guess I'm just hitting my stride!\" replied Evan. It has taken him a little while to get over the strangeness of the situation. After finishing their game, Ollie waddled into his bedroom and called for Evan several minutes later. The lion walked in to see Ollie enormous rump bare and sticking out in the air. He knew the kangaroo was pretty thick, but seeing the 'roo's rear there really put things into perspective. Ollie easily had one of the bigger butts Evan ever saw on a boy or girl. He climbed onto the back of Ollie's legs, shoved his heavy tail out of the way, and cautiously began rubbing away as promised. The fat butt was very pliable under the lion's paws, and even Evan grew more comfortable with it. Massaging Ollie's rear reminded Evan of kneading dough, as he did when he was a cub helping make bread with his grandmother. Though if he baked dough the size of the kangaroo's ass, he'd have month's worth of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way you're not a professional,\" groaned Ollie. \"Too good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan chuckled. \"First time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to think about selling your services,\" the 'roo suggested. \"There aren't many good masseurs in this city. You could easily make a killing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie nodded. \"If you want, I can spread your name around to some of my friends, gets you some clients.\" He groaned again as Evan's paws sank even deeper into his fat. \"God, if I don't keep you for myself...I'd definitely pay good money to keep you around.\"</span></div></div>",

And a nice chunk of change was what Evan was earning. Ollie always left a small stack of bills lying on his dresser as payment for the lion's service. The 'roo was usually in too much of a state of bliss to bother getting up for some time after their massages. And the whole thing was easy enough. Every other day, Evan would let himself into Ollie's apartment where he'd find the fatty 'roo laying on his stomach in his bed. Evan would immediately get to work rubbing him down; half of their session was devoting to pawing at Ollie's absurdly big butt. Not like Evan was complaining, though. He found playing with the 'roo's enormous rump was quite entertaining. And judging by the groans of pleasure coming from Ollie, he enjoyed it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Friday night, Evan had finished giving the 'roo his rubdown when he noticed snoring. \"You awake, big guy?\" he said, giving Ollie a nudge. The orange kangaroo just continued snoring. The lion chuckled go himself and made his way to the bathroom where he freshened himself up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning to the bedroom, he walked over to the dresser and grabbed his payment. It was even larger than before. Ollie had muttered something about a tip during their session. Evan figured that this was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to leave, he saw that Ollie, still asleep, was now laying on his side. The 'roo's blubbery gut spilled out onto the mattress. Yet Evan couldn't help but notice in the sea of rolls, folds, and flab was the 'roo's manhood, upright and at full attention. At first, the lion blushed upon seeing Ollie's erection. Or, at least, what of it he could see. A substantial fat pad swallowed up most of it. But considering how much Ollie seemed to enjoy his massages, Evan figured that it was only natural for the 'roo to get a little excited. The wet spot on the bedsheets confirmed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA naughty thought came across Evan's mind. This extra bonus might keep coming if he made sure Ollie had a happy ending. Counting the cash again, he did some quick math and realized that with that extra boost, the lion wouldn't need another job to cover rent. Looking forward to not having a day job for some time, Evan approached the naked kangaroo, ready to really him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The doorway must have been widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what Evan concluded when he approached the door to Unit 705. Examining the top of the door frame, he saw a place where it was cut and a newer piece of wood was attached. The lion could even make out saw marks out on parts of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, he knocked a paw against the door. Seconds later, a mechanical whirling noise could be heard coming from the other side of the door. Clicking then came from the door handle. The handle turned and the door slowly swung open. However, nobody was there. Evan stood there confused, looking into an empty but pristine apartment. Suddenly, a deep voice bellowed from the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can bring my order in here!\" someone said. The lion peaked his head in. A door stood ajar ahead. He reckoned that's where the voice came from. \"Are you a new delivery driver or something? Come on, don't be shy!\" Evan entered the apartment and slowly approached the bedroom door and pushed it open. He let out a sharp gasp when he saw what was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom to this apartment was much like his own. It was nearly the same shape and size. And it, too, had a very large bed. But sitting on this bed was an equally large fur. A dog, a German Shepherd, to be specific. He sat upright in bed, a mountain of pillows behind him. The dog had a freakishly huge belly. It spilled out in front of him, pushing his legs wide apart while still covering most of his rotund thighs. Two mounds of lard each the size of Evan's head rested on the impossibly huge gut. The dog's face was adorned with massive chubby cheeks and at least two extra chins. Had the dog not been sitting on his bed, Evan would have seen the two beanbag chair sized globes of fat made up the dog's ass. The fur was naked. There was no need to cover up as his own gut hid his privates. Instead, the dog's black and brown fur was freely exposed. The dog was nearly as wide as the bed. Evan could not tell how tall the dog was. He guessed he was a few years older than the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dog saw Evan, he waved a meaty paw in his direction. This caused the fur's entire body to wobble. The lion cautiously approached, being careful not to knock over any of the stacks of empty pizza boxes that laid piled up in the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you leave my order in the kitchen or something?\" the German Shepard asked. \"I keep telling the guys at Purgatory Pizza that their delivery boys can just drop it off in my bedroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not a delivery boy,\" Evan said timidly. He was still in shock at seeing a fur this morbidly obese. \"I'm Evan. I, uh, just moved in this morning...I live in Unit 703. I was just going around introducing myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay! Well, hello neighbor!\" the dog said cheerfully. \"I'm Derrick! Pleased to make your acquaintance!\" He stuck out a paw. Evan careful made his way closer to the bed to shake paws. Once more, the dog's entire body wobbled due to the movement. \"So, where'd you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastion. Just got in last night.\" The lion was still a bit thrown off. His mind boggled at the idea of any fur getting as big as Derrick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That's a ways away!\" Derrick said. \"I haven't been to Bastion in years! Not since I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derrick! I have your order!\" came a voice from the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Lunch! Yes! Come on in!\" Into the bedroom walked a young otter. He, too, was quite large with a sizeable gut and moobs that stretched his shirt to the limit. He carried with him three absurdly large pizza boxes. The otter looked like he was having trouble with them, so Evan helped him set them on a table next to Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a drawer by his bed, Derrick pulled out a wad of cash. He peeled off a several large bills and gave them to the otter. \"There you go! See you tomorrow, Adam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you too,\" the otter said as he waddled out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. Lunchtime! Say, would you like some? I always order a bit too much, but end up eating it all anyways. It'll help save me from myself!\"</span></div></div>",

The lion passed as his belly was already filled to the brim. The dog shrugged, rolled up the slice like a burrito, and chomped it down in a few bits. A stream of greasy poured out from one end dripping onto his brown-furred belly. He grabbed a fistful of napkins and dabbed his stomach clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the lion had a fair share of one the pizzas, Derrick devoured the other two as well as the final slices of the third entirely on his own. And he ate them up at twice the pace as Evan, as if the dog had been starving for days or even weeks. It took less than half an hour before those pizzas were now thousands of calories churring away in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick let out a low, rumbling belch as he rubbed a paw against his expansive belly. \"Had enough?\" joked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\" said Derrick. \"But that'll have to do for now.\" The dog lurched his body towards the nightstand by his bed and pulled off of it a closed laptop. \"Gotta get back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what is it that you do?\" ask Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer programming work,\" the dog replied. \"It's great! I work from home and I never have to leave my place! Man, I'm still a bit hungry. I'll probably have dinner earlier than usual. Want to come by for dinner later? My treat!

And now the bid dog was trapped, his one free arm not strong enough to pull himself free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan let himself in to the dog's apartment later that evening for dinner. Knocking on the door, a mechanism on the other side whirred to life, pulling open the door handle and slowly swinging it open. The lion's nose was met with the intense aroma of Chinese food, easily a few dozen boxes took up much of the counter space in the kitchen. It was then that Evan saw the predicament the dog was in, unclothed and too fat to get out of his bedroom unassisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured that, since I'm having company over, we should eat out here and not, you know, in my bedroom,\" Derrick explained. \"So, after the food was delivered, I got up to make sure that everything out here was clean and all, and...well, here I am now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion inspected the situation. \"Well, I'm surprised you were able just to get out of bed by yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not THAT heavy,\" said the big dog. \"I can still get to the bathroom and whatnot. It just takes me a lot more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see. So, how do you think I can help you out?\" asked the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...Maybe if you yank hard enough on my arm that'll do. But I can feel my hips just digging into this frame. You might need something to loosen me up first. Uh, there might be something like butter or olive oil in the kitchen. I think that might work.\" </span></div></div>",

To make it up to Evan, Derrick insisted that he help take care of the lion, and that included food. Initially, Evan was grateful towards the German Shepard. But by the time the lion had his fourth pizza of the week, he realized that the dog was just ordering for Evan the same greasy, caloric take-out that the dog typically would get for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaid up in bed with a heavy cast around his right leg, he wore only a loose pair of boxer shorts. His stomach, bloated and swollen from the oil and carbs and fat he had been sucking down since he left the hospital, was ballooned out in a semi-permanently state, a distinct curve that had once been flat as a board. The fact that the lion hardly moved these days didn't help the situation either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from food, though, Derrick had generously set the lion up with all the amenities needed to stay comfortable while healing. A massive television screen hooked up with the lastest video game consoles and with access to all the popular streaming sites, anything like his medication and whatnot available at a table parked right next to his bed, and Derrick even had someone install a device similar to the one his own apartment door that allowed him to answer the door remotely from bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pudgy otter set the huge pizza box next to the lion on his spacious bed. \"Here, let me grab my wallet for a tip and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need! Derrick has got that covered, too!\" Adam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Damn, what does that dog do for a living? He must be loaded or something,\" asked the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Something with stocks or whatever. He told me once but it went completely over my head,\" the otter replied. \"Anyways, enjoy the pie! Get well soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy knock came from the front door of Evan's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, another delivery? I just ate...\" The lion groaned as he activated the door opening mechanism to let whoever it was in. His belly was filled to the brim with beans and meat and cheese from an ungodly amount of Mexican food from El Burrito Diablito Derrick had ordered for him an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy footsteps, the swishing of cotton rubbing against itself, and soon Derrick peaked his head into the lion's bedroom. \"Hey Evan!\" he said. \"How are things holding up for you? Everything working out alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, everything's...*urp*... everything's fine,\" he said, gas occasionally escaping his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good!\" said the German Shepherd. He turned his enormous body sideways and started shuffling through the door. Evan tried to stop him, not wanting a repeat of what had happened. Yet the dog was able to just barely make it through the wide doorframe on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how did you...\" Evan began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I found this thing online!\" The dog lifted up his billowy white shirt to reveal something that looked like an industrial strength corset. Thick plastic and heavy duty straps held back the dog's lard, though it peaked out over and underneath the plastic. Pockets of flab puffed out between the straps. \"I knew these things existed, but I didn't know that they made them in my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that would have helpful the other day,\" the lion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's hard to put on and it's really stiff, but it slims me down enough to get me out of my bedroom!\" Derrick said. \"It's been quite a while since I've been out of it, let alone my apartment. A few months, at least.\" He looked around at the lion's bedroom. Stacks of pizza boxes, piles of Chinese food containers. Evan hadn't been able to properly take care of them and keep the place clean. The most he was able to do was very slowly get to the bathroom and back, and that was usually a painful experience. \"Didn't someone from Manic Maids come by yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manic what?\" the lion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I arranged for someone to stop by every once in a while to help keep things tidy. Hasn't anyone stopped by?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Only the delivery boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe German Shepherd sighed. \"If they couldn't send someone, they should have just told me,\" he muttered under his breath. \"Alright then, I guess I'll have to pick things up a bit. I need the exercise anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will? Thanks! Things had been getting a bit gross in here...\" Evan said. Though at a glacial pace, Derrick slowly but surely emptied the room of all the of junk, his sweatpants straining against his rump as he bent down the best he could with the corset thing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan resumed watching television as the dog clean. He thought that it might be appropriate to discuss all the food Derrick was feeding the lion. While he certainly appreciated the gesture, his diet of exclusively takeaway was leaving the lion bloated, gassy, and lethargic. Maybe some healthier options would be better for the recovering lion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nose itched, and as Evan brought up a paw to scratch it, the lion caught a whiff of himself, a rank odor. He hadn't been able to properly clean himself in the past week or so. The lion's fur was becoming greasy, matted, and oily. Since Derrick was here and offering all the help he could offer, Evan might be able to get the dog to help clean himself up.</span></div></div>",

Evan said nothing in response, only smiling and closing his eyes as the dog continued the sponge bath. Derrick rubbed the cloth in ever widening circles around lion's gut, eliciting groans from Evan. The German Shepherd smirked seeing how much Evan was enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Evan didn't notice was the tent forming in his boxer shorts. Derrick's wide paws, warm and rubbing him down all over, was getting the lion aroused. It was only when the German Shepherd yanked down his shorts and gripped his hardened member with a soapy right paw that the lion noted his erection. He gasped and tried to sit up, only to have Derrick push him back down to the bed with his left paw. Writhing and wiggling, he squirmed and gasped with pleasure as the obese German Shepherd worked the lion's shaft up and down, teasing the tip with one paw while pinning Evan to the bed with the other. His moans deepened and his breathing shortened as the lion approached climax after what seemed like hours of stroking and rubbing. Letting out a roar, Evan's hips bucked as fluid sprayed across his bloated stomach and chest. Wave after orgasmic wave sailed through the lion. Strong spurts from his member grew weaker and weaker until Evan's juices were only dribbling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeak and panting, the lion gazed down at the mess all over himself before silently looking up to the big dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll clean you up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next month for Evan was a cycle of gorging himself on takeaway several times a day, sleeping, and getting cleaned up by Derrick who always ensured that Evan had a happy ending to his baths. The lion rarely left bed except to hobble to the bathroom and back. But it wasn't like he wanted to go anywhere else. He was enjoying being a full and lazy cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the thousands of calories he was consuming daily and the complete and total lack of exercise, Evan's weight ballooned. Easily putting on well over fifty pounds in the single month of being bedbound, the lion's entire body had softened up all over. Yet it was his gut that had soaked up most of the new weight. A ball of pudge that stuck out nearly a foot from his abdomen, the semi-permanently bloated stomach had transformed into a small mountain of lard that was slowly but surely taking over his lap and making it tougher for him to reach his nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis change wasn't lost on Derrick, who made belly rubs a central part of Evan's baths. The big dog would usually tease the lion about the new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder you need me to get you off,\" Derrick said while patting his blimped up belly. \"You must not be used to this being in the way!\" Evan only blushed a deep red in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sat in his bed, as usual, mindlessly watching television. A loud, deep grumble came from his belly. Checking his phone, he noticed that it was getting pretty late in the day. While someone had stopped by to deliver something ordered by Derrick for Evan to eat for breakfast, nobody had come by with anything since and the lion was getting hungry. He could text Derrick. Maybe something distracted him. Or, since Evan's leg was feeling a little better, he might be able to hobble into the kitchen. He remembered Derrick saying something about stocking up the lion's fridge a while back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, I'm going to push on the count of three, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan had found a bottle of olive oil stashed away in a kitchen cupboard. The lion used that to grease both the edges of the doorframe as well as the dog's immensely flabby flanks. The plan now was to push the dog backwards into the bedroom and hopefully he'll pop out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three, got it,\" said Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. One...two..THREE!\" The lion shoved with all of his might, his slim body pressing hard and sinking into the German Shepherd's oiled up belly. At first, the dog didn't seem to budge. Yet after a few minutes of trying, Evan felt the massive dog shift slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's working!\" said Derrick. \"Keep going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving even harder now, the lion could tell the dog was getting loosened from the frame millimeter by millimeter. \"Okay, I think one more hard shove should do it,\" Evan panted. He stepped back and charged at Derrick. Colliding with the mutt's gut, the lion heard a loud slipping noise. Derrick came crashing backwards onto his tremendous rear to a boom. The lion feel onto his belly using it like a giant pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" asked Evan, his legs straddling either side of the dog's gut. \"Did you hit your head or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I'm fine. Just a bruised ego,\" Derrick replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion got off of him and assessed the situation. \"Okay, now how do we get you up?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can handle this...\" Derrick rolled over onto his belly, exposing his naked overgrown rump. The dog slowly got onto all fours, then pushed himself onto his knees, and finally used the wall to get back on his feet, his flabby body wobbling as jostling the entire time. The dog panted and huffed, catching his breath after the Herculean effort it took him to get back onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I think so,\" replied Derrick who was now inspecting his naked and oily body. \"Sorry you had to see my butt. I was going to put something on before I got stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no worries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I've really done a number to myself...\" said Derrick as he patted his olive oil soaked stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, I was the one who thought that olive oil wo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Derrick cut in. \"I mean, <i>this</i>!\" The dog took his paws and lifted up his massive gut, letting it go, falling back down and wobbling like mad. \"I've really, <i>really</i> let myself go. I knew I was getting big, but I didn't realize I was getting so huge that I wouldn't be able to fit through my bedroom door...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah, I guess you're, uh, a bit of a big pup.\" Evan was at a loss of word for what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again. And now look what's happened to me: I'm naked, covered in oil, and so fat that I nearly winded myself getting up off the floor. Ugh, I need to do something about this. And the oil. I need a shower and a think. Hey, Evan. Why don't you take that Chinese food home with you. Hell, take all of it. You'd be saving me from myself.\"</span></div></div>",

I've got loads!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick invited Evan back that evening to watch Knives of Justice VI, the latest in an incredibly popular action movie franchise. Walking into the big dog's bedroom, he saw that one of his bedside tables was covered in cartons of ice cream. He was already halfway through what looked to be a carton of strawberry ice cream when the lion came by. Eager to satisfy his sweet tooth, Evan got a spoon from the kitchen and came back to the bedroom, sitting on a narrow strip of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I think you'll like this one!\" Derrick handed Evan one of the ice cream cartons: Jen &amp; Berry's Chocolate Catastrophy. The lion purred as he opened the box and dug in, devouring the delightful chocolate dessert as the movie played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion mindlessly swallowed up spoonful after spoonful. When one carton emptied, the German Shepherd quickly placed in his paws another flavor he should try, then another and another, all of which Evan downed with equal gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here's one you've got to try: Blueberry Kaboom!\" Derrick said as he handed another carton to Evan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the lion looked sick, he stomach packed full of sugar. The lion held up a paw. \"Sorry, I'll have to pass,\" he said. \"I feel like I'll explode if I have another bite...\" The dog shrugged his shoulders and ripped off the lid of the ice cream to eat for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes heavy with sleep, Evan tried paying attention to the movie. Yet the combination of the sweet treats digesting in his stomach along with the warmth radiating from the obese dog he was sitting next to make the lion feel sleepy. His blinking slowed, his mind drifted. The lion's body slumped over into Derrick vast belly, and Evan was asleep a moment before his head hit the dog's pillowy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light of the television was the only thing illuminating the bedroom when Evan awoke in the middle of the night. An informerical selling a unique kind of kitchen knife was playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second for the lion to regain his bearings. Looking around, he saw that he was cuddled up next to Derrick, the dog's right arm cradling Evan's head and neck. The lion's body sunk into the sea of soft fat that was the German Shepherd's vast belly, and Evan's face had been buried into one of Derrick's massive moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog was fast asleep. Specks of dried up ice cream dotted around his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his second night in Port Zaftig and not only was he sharing a bed with another fur, but with an impossibly fat one. Yet Even was feeling euphoric. The dog's body was warm, soft, like Evan was cuddling a giant toasty marshmallow. Though it might be weird for him to be there. He just met Derrick that day it spending the night with him might make things awkward. But then again, judging by how Derrick was caressing him, it didn't seem the big dog minded.</span></div></div>",

Well, thanks for dropping by! Don't be a stranger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was back in the hallway ready to get into his place when he saw Adam, the obese otter delivery boy, waddling towards the elevator. The svelte lion easily caught up with him. \"Uh, hey, Adam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter turned around, his gut wobbled as he moved. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you, uh, been delivering to Derrick for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Pretty much since the day I started at Purgatory,\" the otter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has he was been that, um, big?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, he used to be a fair bit smaller. When I first started delivering to his place, Derrick was still moving around. I remember dropping off his order the day they were widening out his front door. But he's gotten super big recently. I haven't seen him out of that bed in months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Months? Then how does he, you know, use the bathroom and stuff like that?\" Evan asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derrick can still move. It just takes him a while to get from Point A to Point B. Most of the time, he's just sitting on his butt in bed stuffing himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he work? I mean, he has to do something if he's buying pizza everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, mister, I can't stay here all day talking with you. I'm on the clock. So if you got questions about Derrick, you might just want to ask him yourself.\" The otter then turned back and continued his way back to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his apartment, Evan sat on his couch still fascinated by Derrick's sheer size. Of course, the lion had seen a fat fur or two back in Bastion. But the big dog easily outweighed them all by hundreds of pounds. How could a fur let themselves get that big? And why was Derrick still stuffing himself with so many pizzas everyday? He should be focusing on slimming down! Evan had so many questions. Perhaps Adam was right. If the lion was so obsessed with the dog's obesity, he should just talk to Derrick himself. Yet he felt odd about the prospect of talking about another fur's super heavyweight status. Maybe he could ask around, see if anyone knew anything about Derrick. Or, if Evan spent more time with the big dog, the facts would come out eventually.</span></div></div>",

Evan made small talk, awkwardly dancing around the subject of Derrick's weight until the lion felt brave enough to flatly ask about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! When I was young, I was fascinated by bigger furs. I remember my uncle was a big guy with a huge belly that I would always gawk at. I used to do things like shove balloons under my shirt and pretend it was my belly!\" The dog took a bite of a chicken breast, chewed it for a minute, then swallowed. \"I didn't understand why I was fascinated with bigness. But in high school, I decided to do something about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" the lion asked. \"Hit the fridge hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dog chuckled. \"Nah, the opposite. I hit the gym. Weight training five days a week, made it the wrestling team and was first string all four years. I was big, alright. Muscles everywhere. I even had some abs, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, uh, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realized that it didn't make me happy,\" he said. \"I was big, but something still didn't feel right. It was only after high school where I got my first desk job and quit going to the gym. Snacking all day and sitting on my butt all the time thickened me up a bit. My belly started growing, I learned that I loved it, and the rest is history!\" Derrick gave his vast gut a pat as the fat rippled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're finally a big pup now, eh?\"  joked the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog smirked as he swallow a giant spoonful of mashed potatoes. \"Maybe. I'm not sure. I'm big compared to you, but I'm not that big compared to most of the furs in this town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you're thinking about getting <i>bigger?</i>\" Evan asked in astonishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am. Though I think my weight has plataeued a bit. I'd need some help to get me larger. I mean, I'm not going to be able to do a whole lot when I'm a thousand pounds,\" Derrick jested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's mind swirled. A fur a thousand pounds, nearly ten bigger than he was. He had never heard of a fur getting that fat before. Hell, Evan had never seen a fur as big as Derrick, but here he was standing in front of a massive mutt. The lion's heart started pounding and mouth dried thinking of the prospect of this overfed dog bigger, wider, heavier. The lion adjusted his stance to hide the suddenly growing mound in his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...that's pretty big...\" stammered Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it is,\" Derrick said nonchalantly. \"Unless you believe the rumors of One Ton Terry. But like I said, I'd definitely need help getting any bigger and staying that weight.\"</span></div></div>",

Is there anything I can do to prove to you that I'm in it for the long haul?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick paused and thought for a few moments. \"Well, I feel pretty big right now, especially when I see a skinny fur like you. But I'm sure that once I stop feeling so large, I'll want to balloon up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you mean?\" the lion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about that and use your imagination. Now, could you pass me the gravy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of the obese dog consumed Evan's mind as he tired to sleep that night. The lion had been obsessed with Derrick since he first laid eyes on the enormous mutt, and that obsession only deepened when he learned about the German Shepard's aspirations of getting even larger. Evan closed his eyes and imagined the dog ridiculously fatter, a proverbial mountain of pudge, limbs and neck swallowed up by thick layers of fat, rolls spilling out over the edges of his bed. The lion's mouth dried and heart raced as he dreamt of an impossibly obese German Shepherd and as his loins stirred to life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan didn't just want to see Derrick get fatter; he <i>needed</i> to see Derrick get fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion began conspiring how to go about fattening the dog. Simply offering his help didn't do it. Evan remembered what the German Shepherd said: If he felt small, then he'd want to fatten up even bigger. So, how could he make Derrick, already so huge, feel small?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, Derrick said that he wanted <i>committed</i> help. Evan could understand why. The big dog would be in trouble if he grew to be an immobile blob and the only fur that was there to help him flaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way I can kill two birds with one stone?\" Evan asked himself. \"Show how willing I am to stay and help Derrick grow while at the same size get the dog to feel like he needs to fatten up even more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion pondered that as sleep finally took him. </span></div></div>",

At least, he did so as best he could. The tire of fat that ringed around his neck made it difficult for the dog to turn his head much. Not like he needed to. Most of his day was spent watching the television mounted to the ceiling of his bedroom. It had been a while since the dog's massive belly blocked so much of the screen that he could no longer see beyond it and needed it hooked up directly above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud grumble echoed from the boulder-like belly that pinned the German Shepherd to his bed. Derrick rubbed a plumped up paw, soothing the mass of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog heard the loud thuds he had heard so many times before. His tail, sticking out underneath his barrel-like legs, wagged as best it could. Lunch was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lion squeezed his way through the bedroom doorframe carrying a tray of greasy burgers. The lion's gut swayed and wobbled as he waddled towards the gigantic dog. His tits bounced and the lion's thighs fought to move past each other as he made his way towards Derrick, who hugged the the lion's thick waist when he approached his bedside, giving the cat's gargantuan rump a firm squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry, big dog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always, Evan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan woke up. He immediately noticed his rock hard member and the fluid dripping from the tip. It had been a while since the lion had a wet dream before. He took a minute to think about that dream, about Derrick, so massive, and himself fattened as well though not to the German Shepherd's size. It had certainly been a sexy dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Evan had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick really didn't see other furs than Evan besides the deliver boys. And seeing a frail lion like him must make Derrick feel like a planet by comparison. If Evan plumped up, put on some serious weight, then the dog might start not feeling as big as he does now. On top of that, if Even is willing to blow up just for Derrick, it'll show the obese dog how committed he is to making the German Shepard even more massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan smirked to himself as he rubbed his flat stomach. It certainly was a good plan. He'd sacrifice his skinny body, but in exchange he'll have the chance to turn the German Shepherd into a total blimp.  He'll be a big cat, but Derrick will be a <b>big</b> dog. The only question now is if Evan should let Derrick know about his scheme. On the one hand, Derrick might be able to help the lion fatten up, and the dog would know early on what Evan was doing to himself just to show Derrick how much he was willing to do to show he'll stay by the dog's fattening side. But on the other hand, it might be better to keep Derrick in the shadows about this. If the dog knew that Evan was purposefully making himself big to make the dog feel small, it might not have the desired effect on Derrick.</span></div></div>",

Fast food for every meal, junk food from dawn to dusk, and a carton of ice cream to top his belly off before bed. And the tens of thousands of calories he was consuming daily was having a clear impact on his waistline. While Evan had thickened up all over, his abdomen soaked up most of the calories. The lion's midsection, previously flat as a board, had ballooned up into a small mountain of lard that poked out nearly a foot out in front of him. Gravity pulled down on the mass, making it very difficult for the lion button up his jeans. And the blobby belly jiggled and wobbled about when Evan walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I did!\" Evan plodded over to the button and picked it up off the ground, his shirt ridding up on his belly. The lion pocketed the button before sitting back down next to Derrick's bed to finish their massive feast of burritos and tacos. The German Shepherd, no doubt being appreciative of Evan's company, frequently invited the lion over for meals, all of which helped contribute to his rapidly expanding waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>bah-rink!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Evan's text notification. He pulled out his phone and checked the message which had apparently come from the First Bank of Port Zaftig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOW BALANCE ALERT: Your account ending in 0971 is below the $500 amount you have set. To change your low balance alerts, please visit fbpz.com\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sighed as he shoved his phone back into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" asked Derrick between bites of a huge burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just my bank telling me I'm running out of money.\" Thanks to all of the fast food that Evan was gobbling down, the nest egg that he saved up before moving to Port Zaftig was nearly all gone now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your payday coming soon?\" asked the German Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, actually I'm kinda in between jobs right now,\" he replied. \"I was supposed to find work, but I guess I've been distracted and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...interesting,\" Derrick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as it so happens to be the case, I'm looking for an assistant of sorts. I've told you that I do work with stocks and contracts and the like. I won't bore you with details again. And there's a lot that I can get done just from my bed. However, there are a lot of pesky things that I need done also. Documents delivered, forms signed, all things that I'd need to zip around town to do. What do you think? I'll pay well! And give you a bit of a down payment today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty fortunate that Derrick was looking for an assistant. And the position certainly appealed to Evan. The job didn't sound too terribly difficult and it would meant that he got to spend more time around the big dog and all his hyper-obese glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Evan had other plans in mind. Just the other day, a Burger Depot opened not too far away from the apartment building. Burger Depot had always been the lion's favorite fast food joint growing up. The burgers there was always so delicious and amazing. If Evan were to land a job there, he could find a way to score loads of free greasy, caloric fast food. Sure, he wouldn't be able to spend all day with Derrick, but he'd most certainly blimp up even faster.</span></div></div>",

But the Andersen escrow isn't ready yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting himself into Derrick's apartment as he done so many times before, Evan saw the big dog sitting in his couch in the living room, specially designed and reinforced enough to not buckle under his weight. Thanks to hiring an assistant, the German Shepherd finally had enough time to hire some constructors to widen out the doorway between his bedroom and the living room, giving the dog the freedom to move between either though it still took him a considerable amount of time just to haul himself from his bed to his couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" Derrick said typing away on a laptop resting on the globe that was his gut. \"I mean, about the Fischer account. That escrow should have been done weeks ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion handed a stack of papers to the dog, who caught a glimpse of what Evan was wearing. Luckily for him, the lion was clever enough to pack some business appropriate clothes during his move. The black slacks and white button-up shirt were perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, they used to be perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pants now looked painted on to Evan's thighs and ass, seams threatened to burst apart. Each morning was a struggle to button them up. The buttons on his shirt were barely containing his swelling belly. Tufts of the lion's fur peaked out between buttons ready to explode off. In all, his formerly loose business wear looked more like a second skin. Evan didn't might that much. In fact, he was enjoying the feeling of the tight material hugging tight to every bludge and roll, the creaking of his pants as he stand down, the thought that another cheeseburger and his shirt would burst open, popping button after popping button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to go shopping?\" Derrick asked, gesturing to the lion's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I do. Just been too busy,\" he replied. It was mostly true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want, I think I have an old suit in the back of my closet somewhere,\" said the German Shepard. \"I held on to it but something tells me it won't fit anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it certainly wasn't going to fit him. Digging around in the back of jungle of tent-like shirts and pants, Evan found a box full of old clothes. Sitting right on the top was a carefully folded suit which, while it was quite large for Evan, was far too small for the German Shepherd who must have outgrown it several hundred pounds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Evan dug through the rest of the box to see if there was anything else he might be able to borrow from Derrick. Much of it was mundane shirts and jeans, all of which were much larger than the lion needed. Then, he spotted a shiney red fabric. Yanking on it, he pulled out what appeared to be a wrestling singlet. \"WEST FREMONT HIGH SCHOOL\" say the white letters on the bright red surface. Evan recalled that during his youth, Derrick had actually been on his high school's wrestling team. The dog, for whatever reason, decided to keep the old singlet. Pulling on the lyrca, the lion saw that it had a pretty good amount of stretch to it. Very good, considering how old it must be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Look out the window there. See that really tall, silver building? That's the Episteme Labs building. Heard of them? I don't know too much about them. But then again, not many furs are exactly sure what they do. I read that they're listed as a pharmaceutical company, but I've heard they do loads more, even take contracts with the military and the like. But unless you work for them, nobody is sure exactly what they work on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, the building was finished a little less than fifteen years ago. For the first two years, nothing out of the ordinary happened. Then Terry went missing. Terry McGregor was, I think, 18 or 19 when he vanished. At the time, he was doing an internship with Episteme Labs. Normally, Episteme wants nothing to do with students. But they made an exception for Terry. See, he was a savant when it came to biochemical engineering. The kid almost done with his Bachelor's degree when most furs would be graduating high school! He was an up-and-comer and bound  <br>\r\nto make amazing breakthroughs. So Episteme wanted to snatch him up and they made an exception for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day, Terry didn't come home from his internship. His parents filled a missing persons report, and the police investigated. At first Episteme claimed that Terry didn't show up for his internship that day. But here's the thing: The building across the street to Episteme Labs happyen to have a camera that pointed across the street and it recorded Terry walking in the the Labs that day. And it also didn't catch him coming out. The Labs got in a heap of trouble, and soon detectives were busting down their doors. They fought the warrants as best as they could but eventually Episteme had to let the authorities in. But they found nothing, not a clue where Terry went. Months dragged on into years, and the case went cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where things get wild. A few years after Terry disappeared, some photos came up online. Now, come here, let me show you this. It's Terry missing poster. Handsome lion, huh? Okay, see above his left eyebrow? See how in his fur there's an almost perfectly straight line of four spots? Remember that. Now, here's one of the photos. It was from a while back. Cell phone camera weren't great, so the pictures are pretty dark and grainy. But see right here? Four dots, in a straight line! That's his eye, his left side of his face! And that, his cheeks? Huge! The size of a coconut! You can even make out a few chins from this angle! And here's another photo, taken from a little further away. Yeah, that's his head. His neck is just completely swallowed up with fat! And here's the final one. That's him, that huge pile of lard. At least, people think it is. It's hard to tell how big he might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After those photos came out, rumors started swirling that Terry was being held prisoner in Episteme Labs somewhere. Some think he's being tested on, others think they're keeping him because of an accident in the lab. It got to the point that Episteme Labs had to put out a statement denying this. But after a while, those rumors died down and One Ton Terry is now kind of an urban legend used to scare kids away from the Episteme Labs Building. I personally just think the kid got overwhelmed with being such a genius that he skipped town and to live his own life. But that's j- Oh, that's my phone! Gotta take this! Business call!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan found the story of One Ton Terry wild. He heard his share of urban legends before, but an evil company holding a hyper-obese fur hostage was out there. The Episteme Labs building was downtown, and Evan hadn't been there yet. It might be fun to swing by there one day and see the place for himself. Or it might be fun to do some more research into One Ton Terry, find out what other kinds of theories there are.</span></div></div>",

It was among one of the more popular forums for conspiracy theorists to debate and discuss topics. The lion had in the past spent a few boring evenings on there reading the rantings of insane furs about how the Earth was flat or that the moon landing was a hoax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Evan was on the site since it seemed to be the only place where he could find any more information about One Ton Terry. Buried deep in the site was a subforum devoted entirely to Terry. Unfortunately, though, many of the discussions were from years ago, and none of the posts Evan read added anything substantial to the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was, however, a single post that was somewhat recent. Posted six days prior by a user by the name of otterlymad, the post read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I HAVE NEW LEADS TO OTT. NEED HELP. PLEASE DM ME. INCLUDE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody had responded to the post. But since hardly anyone seemed to occupy that subforum anymore, that didn't surprise the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was about to close the tab and give up on his research when he thought about that post he read from otterlymad. Was this someone with actual information? Or what it just another crackpot? Feeling adventurous, the lion made a profile on ConspiracyFur.Net and messaged otterlymad with a brief description of his physical appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took an hour before otterlymad messaged Evan back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Can you meet me in the parking garage on 3rd and Oak downtown downtown? 4th level, 11:15pm. Please come alone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was shocked that he got a message back, let alone a message back so quickly. It might be dangerous for the lion to meet this stranger. But then again, it might be worthwhile if there was a genuine lead into One To Terry.</span></div></div>",

His flabby flanks spilled over to the point that they rested on the parking break as his side. Thick thighs squeezed against each other as they struggled for space, and the otters neck was surrounded with a thick ring of fat. Two chubby cheeks swelled up from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fur had waved Evan down when he arrived at the parking lot. \"Get in the passenger side!\" the otter said in a hushed whisper as the lion approached the parked car.

So, you have a lead on One Ton Terry? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I work at Episteme Labs, one of the chief researchers,\" Daniel began. \"I've been working there for years and heard about Terry since I got there. I've always thought that the whole thing was a story. But I think there's reason to think there's truth to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think that?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Project Immotus Movens,\" said Daniel, a worried look was on his face. \"Dr. Kirkpatrick, the lead scientist of Episteme, sent a notice that they're starting up a Project by that name and was looking for particular subjects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? So what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did some deep research into Episteme's archives. Immotus Movens was the project Terry was working on before he vanished. I think they're restarting it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? What's the project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I don't know. Dr. Kirkpatrick has beeen extremely secretive about it. Anybody who isn't directly working with him on it knows nothing about the project, so I have no idea what they're even experimenting on. But I know a way to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the plan? And what does it have to do with me?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirkpatrick sent out a call for participates with a set of very specific physical characteristics in mind. Actually, that was the only criteria mentioned. And you fit them well enough. If you participate in the experiment, then Kirkpatrick will certainly have me join the research team. He hinted at something like that in his messages. That'll give me access to absolutely everything they're doing. And, if my plan works, one of us will reach Terry, if he's even there and alive, and we can blow this whole thing apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. This sounds pretty dangerous. You don't even know what they'll do with me,\" said Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. It's risky. Very risky. But if we can get the proof in time that Episteme has, or at least had, Terry and we show everyone what they did, their world would come crashing down on them. And we'd be able to get you out of there before anything too terrible happened to you. What do you say, Evan? We'll both be risking something serious, but think of Terry and what he might be going through.\"</span></div></div>",

A second later and the door popped open. Evan let himself in, shutting the door behind him. \"Derrick? It's Evan!\" he said but heard nothing. As he approached the bedroom, the lion heard the faint noise of running water off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom was empty. In place of a massive German Shepard was a huge indent in the mattress no doubt thanks to the dog's heavy rear crushing the springs for so long. The noise of running water was coming from the bathroom where Evan peaked in to find Derrick showering. His rump, two globes of cellulite-covered pudge, pressed against one of the glass walls of the shower stall as soap and water cascaded down every bludge and roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuitely, Evan backed away from the bathroom and figured he ought to come back another time. Crossing through the bedroom again, the lion spotted a half-closed laptop on the far side of Derrick's bed. Curious, he opened it up and peaked at what the dog was working up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe internet browser was opened up to the dog's email where he had the following draft opened:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>To:</b> modeling@hth.com<br>\r\n<b>Subject:</b> Application<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Message:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hello,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sending in materials in response to your calls for models to apply. If there are</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe email stopped there. Attached to the message we're several photos. Evan glanced at the thumbnails. All of them were of Derrick showing off his bulky body. In one, he's in his bed taking a selfie while devouring a burger, dozens of wrappers covering his lap. Another shows the big dog trying to take a photo over his shoulder of his rump, at least, as best as he can. A third showed Derrick standing in front of a full length mirror, his body too wide for it, his bare guy hanging almost all the way down to his knees. None of the photos were particularly good. They were a bit blurry and out of focus. Judging by the looks of them, Derrick was doing the best he could snapping photos of himself by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could check out the rest of the photos, the lion heard the squeak of the shower knobs turning, then the running water stopped. Evan didn't want to get caught snooping, so he closed the laptop just as he found it and carefully tiptoed out of the front door, gently shutting the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion wasn't sure exactly what the dog was up to, sending off photos of his naked, massive body. He could straight up ask Derrick about it, but Evan would have to admit snooping on his laptop. Then again, the lion knew where he was sending the photos to. Maybe searching online for that email would lead somewhere.</span></div></div>",

Evan clicked the \"I AM OVER 18 YEARS OF AGE\" button and was sent to the main page that was filled with more pictures of extremely obese furs. The lion clicked the \"MODELS\" tab and was taken to a page displaying the profiles of the overfed models.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WANT TO BE A HALF-TON HUNK? SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION NOW!\" read a banner at the top of the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion clicked the banner ad and read through the benefit and requirements to a model. The gig paid well, extremely well, like six-digits well. Apparently, there's a high demand for fat furs, the lion surmised. Some of the requirements were standard stuff for a site like this: Must be over 18, must be willing to do nude photography. There was only one outlier: \"MUST HAVE 65+ BMI\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rats,\" Evan joked to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it looked like Derrick wanted to be a super-sized supermodel. The dog was handsome and probably satisfied the BMI requirements. But the photos Evan saw looked awful. It must be hard for a fur that size to photograph body that big.

Derrick somehow looked even more massive in that picture thanks to the angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me know what they think of them!\" said Evan. \"I hope to sign you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was because of those photos that Derrick ended up getting the spot. The German Shepherd excitedly texted Evan a couple of days afterwards to come over, where he told the lion the good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They absolutely loved them!\" exclaimed the big dog. \"I can't believe I'm going to be a Half-Ton Hunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, congratulations!\" replied Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's not all! I told Joey, he's going to be my agent, all about you! And I said that I want you working on my photo shoots! They're willing to pay good more for your work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I didn't think I was <i>that</i> good at photography,\" the lion said. \"I mean, all I did was point the camera and click.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! Like I said, you're a natural!\" Derrick said. \"Or, if you're wanting to really made some serious money, Joey said something about you getting a more 'involved' position with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More involved? What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Joey only hinted at it. I guess you'll have to find out for yourself, but he made it clear that you'd be very, very well paid.\"</span></div></div>",

I wanted to speak with you about your application!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sat up from his reclined position on the couch clutching his phone. \"My application? Oh, I almost forgot about that. I kinda sent that in on a whim...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're glad you sent it!\" said Joey on the other end of the line. \"Fantastic photos, by the way! Very... provocative!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion blushed. \"Thanks! But I figured I wouldn't make the, uh, weight requirement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, we would. But HTH has been looking to branch out, to meet the demands of a large group of clientele. Furs love looking at our heavy hunks, but there had been an increase in demand for them to work with smaller models. What else could make a half-ton hunk hotter than a hunk a fraction his size to be compared to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion chuckled. \"I guess I could see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. You live in Port Zaftig, correct?\" asked Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Moved here not long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! We actually have a couple of models eager to model alongside a skinnier fur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Would working with someone else affect our pay or anything?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! We at HTH pride ourselves on offering some of the best salaries in the industry to our models!\" Joey said cheerfully. \"So, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've never done moving. But the pay is too good to pass it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! You're a natural, anyways. So, I'll email you some forms and contracts you'll need to fill out. What you'll also need to do is head over to the HTH Models page. Simon and Keith are the two models who expressed interest in working with skinny fur models. Check them out and see if one of them appeals more to you and I'll set up a shoot with you both. Now, let's go over some terms and conditions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours on the phone with Joey, all that was left to do was pick which model he wanted to work with and Evan would be raking in the dough as a member of Half-Ton Hunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion pulled up the models page again on his laptop. Keith was the first of the two local models he found and clicked on his profile. A handsome dolphin, his page featured a photoset called BEACHED \"WHALE\" where the hunk posed on one of Port Zaftig's many beautiful beaches. In one photo, he was looking seductively at the camera, standing in the bright sunshine as light reflected on his smooth, rubbery skin. His abdomen was encases by two enormous tires of blubber that reached nearly all the way around his back and formed sizable love handles. His pecs were two thick slabs of lard with black nipples the size of silver dollars. The skin on his belly and chest was much lighter shade of gray than the darker skin that covered the rest of him. His legs and rear were heavily muscled though covered in a considerable amount of fat as well. His tail peaked out from behind him, hanging lazily as it too was laden with lard. Keith's black swim trunks were tight and left little too the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan then went over to Simon's page. A young Golden Retriever with a boyish face, one of his featured photos showed him on all fours, his expansive rear covered in a pair of extremely tight briefs took up most of the shot. A saucy smile was on his face as he looked over his shoulder at the camera. He recently uploaded a set called WHO'S A GOOD BOY? that featured him begging for treats, wagging his ballooned up rump, and presenting himself for belly rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion thought that he could have equal fun with either fur, so it was really just a matter of personal preference who he wanted to work with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Evan! I'm glad you could make it! Come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith led Evan into to his spacious, luxurious apartment in downtown Port Zaftig. The liom had reached out to the dolphin a couple of days ago to see about modelling together. Enthusiastic, he invited Evan over to his place to they could get to know get other and discuss what kinds of things they could do in terms of modelling together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so I'm really new to this whole 'modelling' thing,\" Evan said before sipping from a glass of wine Keith poured for him. The heavyset dolphin joined him on the couch with a couch with a glass of wine of his own. \"I just submitted some photos one day and they liked them! Joey said I was a natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think you are too!\" Keith replied. \"The agency forwarded me your photos. And they're pretty damn good coming from an amateur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Evan replied. \"So, what did kind of shoots do you think we'll be doing together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about,\" the dolphin began. \"I have an idea of a photoset. 'Beach Toys', I'm calling it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, you and I just look sexy around some pool noodles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dolphin laughed. \"No, not quite. It's a bit wilder than that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Wilder?\" The lion purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith smirked, heaving his heavy body off of the couch. \"Here, follow me. My bedroom is this way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan laid clad only in his white briefs as he waited for Keith in his bed. The dolphin came in a few minutes later. He, too, was stripped down to his underwear, and his rolls of blubber jiggled as he approached the bed. Keith was carrying with him what looked to be an air plump of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, forgot your inner tube?\" joked the lion as the dolphin joined him in bed, Keith's belly pressing into Evan's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I got one right here!\" The dolphin yanked off Evan's briefs so hard he nearly tore them apart. In a few fluid motions, Keith parted Evan's rump and the lion felt the cold plastic of a tube enter him deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the hell are you doing?\" yelled Evan. Keith wrapped one of his meaty arms around the lion and held him tightly against his flabby body which Evan sunk into like a waterbed. The lion struggled as the dolphin starting pressing the pump up and down. With each cycle, Evan felt a gush of air enter him, and after a down pumps, his flat belly began to puff up. Each gush of air inside him pressed his stomach out further and further. His belly cracked and groaned as the lion's stomach now resembled a basketball, his skin tight as a drum and feeling ready to burst. Evan whimpered in pain, and seeing how full he was, Keith stopped pumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, big cat,?\" Keith said as he began rubbing Evan's inflated stomach. \"You're going to be my pool toy. We'll have to get you pumped up much bigger, but we can really drive some furs crazy. You and I, a fat dolphin playing with his ballooned up lion. Doesn't that sound fun, Evan?\"</span></div></div>",

I'll go get the plug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith deftly parted the lion's rear, replacing the rubber tube with a lubricated butt plug which slip into Evan's behind perfectly, well enough to ensure that none of the air inside him escaped just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning, the lion rolled into his back in Keith's bed, gently rubbing the tight, basketball sized belly filled with air. The obese dolphin crawled into bed and took over rubbing duties. He didn't look too pleased with the situation. \"I'm sorry, Keith. But I just couldn't fit any more air into me,\" Evan apologize. \"I'm trying my best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are, Big Cat. I just thought we'd be able to bloat you up at least a <i>little</i> bit bigger after weeks of pumping you up,\" replied Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't get it either. I figured I'd be your handsome beach toy by now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith smiled and gave the lion's air-filled belly a light slap. An hollowed echo sounded from inside his belly. \"Maybe we just need outside of the box...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we need to think of something really creative if I'm going to balloon up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dolphin's face lit up. \"Balloon... balloon...maybe, maybe if we filled you with helium instead of just air, that might bloat you up bigger. It's definitely worth a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Keith. I'm not sure about filling up my butt with helium,\" Evan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a thought. Hey, it's safe enough for kid's balloons! Or maybe we can fill you with something more...substantial? Water or soda or something a bit more than air. That's probably why you're stomach isn't stretching. You aren't being filled up with something that'll really push your limits.\"</span></div></div>",

Now, we at HTH have been trying to break into the market for a while now on this. But heavyweight furs eating loads doesn't get a lot of viewers.

So, 'night everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore shutting off the webcam, Evan watched the chat box as the several dozen furs watching all wished the lion goodnight. Checking the donations, it appeared that the lion raked in a few hundred dollars. He switched off the webcam and exited the browser as HTH's web developer explained to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion turned to his bed where he had put on his \"show\". Sitting on the covers were two massive pizza boxes from Purgatory Pizza, the contents of which now sat in Evan's incredibly bloated belly. He brushed them to the floor before leaping into his bed to nap off everything he gobbled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nap ending up lasting the entire night. It was late in the morning when Evan woke up. His stomach had pretty much deflated, though the lion still felt a bit bloated from the night before. Evan's phone flashed with a text and a voicemail. The voicemail was from Joey, congratulating him for an excellent first mukbang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The higher-ups thought it was a bad idea, but you showed them!\" Joey had said. \"Call me when you get a chance we'll set up your next show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe text had been from Derrick inviting the lion over. It had been a few days since Evan visited the German Shepard. So it'd be nice to pop by and say hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long, hot shower and a change of clothes, Evan was walking into the big dog's apartment. \"It's Evan!\" he announced as he walked it. The strong smell of Chinese food permeated the whole place. Derrick was in bed, as usual, manically devour a container of broccoli beef. A dozen and a half contains laid empty all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Evan,\" the hyper-obese dog said between bites. \"Long time, no see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've, uh, been a bit busy.\" The lion sat down on a corner of the dog's bed. \"What have you been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The usual. Work and stuff.\" Derrick let out a burp before tossing the now empty broccoli beef box to the side and opening up a container of fried rice. \"So, Evan Eats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's cheeks instantly turned crimson. \"Evan, uh, whats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan Eats. I saw your performance last night. I didn't know you were involved with Half-Ton Hunks,\" said Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I, uh, have connections,\" Evan said nervously, rubbing a law against the back of his neck. He felt that Derrick didn't need to know how he first found out about the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice,\" Derrick said nonchalantly as he took a massive bite of fried rice. \"So, I've got a proposition for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Private shows. For me, personally. I'll pay good money too. Here,\" the German Shepherd struggled to reached over to one of his nightstands where a bank envelope sat on it. He handed the envelope to Evan. Inside was a small stack of bills. A quick count revealed that it was more than double what the lion made last night. \"Nothing too crazy. Just a private show me to enjoy. I pick the food, though, but it won't be anything you can't handle. What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

The lion flicked through them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>click</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a photo of the two, their backs to the camera showing off their rears, Simon with a paw on the lion's petit butt and Evan with a paw resting on one of the dog's beanbag sized butt cheeks. Both furs looked seductively at the camera, their tails intertwined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>click</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother photo. In this one, Simon laid on his stomach on the ground as Evan used his enormous ass  and thighs as a pillow. In it, the lion is giving one cheek a playful nibble. The photographer definitely loved that little addition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>click</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that photo, Evan was reaching around Simon, holding his sizable moobs in each paw. Fat still poured out the side they were that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>click</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shot of Simon from behind. This time, Evan is reaching around from the front, tugging up the back of the pup's underwear and exposing much more of his rump. The Golden Retriever's backside resembled two huge cottage cheese filled balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a heavy fur walking up behind him, Evan turned around to see that Simon was approaching. The young pup had covered his flabby body up with a robe as well. \"Awful lot of...uh, 'butt-centric' photos, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon laughed. \"Yep, but that's what the people want! Ever since I started with Half-Ton Hunks, furs have been clamoring for pics of my ass. I probably have the most valuable butt in this city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan flicked over to another photo. In that one, Simon was on all fours with the lion grinding against the pup's rump. Shot from behind the furs, the photo accentuated how wide and vast the dog's hips and ass were in comparison to Evan, his trim body barely blocking a third of the massive ass from the shot. \"For some reason, I believe you!\" Evan said. \"I guess you really lucked out when it came to the genetic lottery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I wouldn't chalk it up to genes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup leaned in and whispered, \"Can you keep a secret?\" The lion nodded. \"Hormones. You can put on weight but you can't tell it where to go. But if you've got the right hormones flowing through your blood, that'll change everything. I got some Femeritol from a doc I know. My ass practically blew up overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, really?\" Evan questioned quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. If you're looking to, uh, thicken up a bit down there, I can hook you up. A quick call to Doctor K is all I need.\"</span></div></div>",

The lion came over and the pup administers the shot since he knew exactly what he was doing having injected himself so many times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion rubbed his butt, soothing the ache. \"And there's no side effects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None that I know of,\" replied Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your doctor friend didn't warn you about any? Seems kinda shady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup shrugged. \"Eh, I've been using it for a while now and nothing's been wrong with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have to take your word for it.

His earliest memory was in grade school, staring in fascination at Jeremy, a coyote who was easily the fattest fur in the entire school. Growing up, the lion always imagined what it would be like to be obese, to have a large gut and big butt, to eat and eat and eat only to grow bigger and fatter and sexier. But never did he actually try to get fat. The closest he got was during the junior year of high school when one summer Burger Depot debuted the Bacon Apocalypse Burger. In only a couple of months, the lion's belly blew up into a decent sized gut, which Evan played with any chance he got. But due to the peer pressure and teasing from all his friends, he quickly slimmed back down, never gaining more than a pound or two again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar of ecstasy, Evan blew his load again over his flat stomach and chest. When the waves of pleasured died down, he laid in his bed panting, ready to turn fantasy into reality. The question now for him was if he wanted Stephanie involved or not.</span></div></div>",

Probably much bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been an awkward conversation with Stephanie, but he finally got it out there there. He told all about his fat fantasies, about how he want to he big and large and flabby and doughy. At first, Stephanie seemed ambivalent. This was good. It was much better than the outright disgust he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want me to help you with this?\" she asked. \"Like, how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm not sure...\" said Evan. \"I guess I've only thought about the end result and not how to actually get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness leaned back on her couch and thought for a moment. \"You know what? Sure. I'll help. On one condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Of course! Anything!\" he said, practically bouncing up and down with exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get to do something that I'm into too. Something that really gets me going,\" Stephanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see. Come by tomorrow night and I'll show you. I have some shopping to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following evening, Evan let himself into Stephanie's apartment, just as she told him. And he undressed himself, just as she told him. And he waited, naked, on her couch, just as she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Stephanie sauntered out of her bedroom. Evan's eyes bugged out when he saw what she was wearing. A black leather bodysuit, covering her from ankles to neck, clung tight to her thick frame, showing off the curves of her hips and her busty chest. She was wearing matching heels that laces up to their calves. The leather squeaked as she slowly walked towards Evan, her hips swaying and a stern look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got closer, the lion saw what she was holding. In one paw was a leather riding crop. In the other was a thick leather strap with a heavy chain attached to it. Stephanie stood in front of Evan, who looked at her in awe and silence. She then took the business end of the crop and rubbed it along his cheek, bringing it under his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to be a big boy, huh?\" she asked in a firm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we talked about it last n- <b>OUCH</b>!\" The crop lashed against Evan's cheek, leaving a painful sting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, or no?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" She brought the crop down on his bare thigh, making the lion yelp in pain. \"Ow! Uh...yes... ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta boy,\" Steph cooed. \"You want to be a big kitty, a plump and fat and huge kitty, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Covered in layers and layers of lard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want to double your size? And then triple it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" The lion felt himself starting to get hard. Stephanie saw that. She walked around the back of the couch were she hooked the leather strap around his neck. Taking the other end of the chain, she began leading Evan in the direction of the kitchen. He got up off the couch, walking behind her. Seeing this, she slapped him across his naked butt with the crop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On all fours, boy,\" she commanded. Evan obediently got down on his paws and knees, following the leather clad lioness into the kitchen as she pulled on the leash hooked up to his collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the kitchen, Evan saw a massive sheet cake lying on the ground. \"Go on, eat,\" Steph demanded. Evan glanced in the direction of the drawer where she kept her forks and spoons. He reached out towards it, only to have his hand slapped away. \"Eat. Now.\" The lion scurried towards the cake, leaned his face forward, and starting devouring with his mouth alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour, Stephine watched in silence as the lion ate up the cake. Whenever he showed signs of slowing down, she brought the riding crop down hard against his nude ass. This always stirred the lion into eating more, even when he looked nauseated. Eventually, the cake was gone. Thousands of calories, loads of carbs and sugar, we're digesting in his painfully swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a good boy,\" said Stephanie, bending down to pet the lion. \"Now, let's get you to the bedroom. You deserve a treat now...\"</span></div></div>",

His pudgy tummy and rear bounced up and down with each step. The lioness, donning black leather pants and a dark tank top, watched with anticipation. Her riding crop was held in her right paw ready to discipline the chunky lion for any misstep he might make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe number on the scale read 203. For the first time in his life, Evan was over two hundred pounds! He could feel his manhood stir to life due to the realization. With Stephanie's help, he was certainly fattening up. In a matter of weeks, Evan had put on a decent belly, his thighs thickened up, and his ass was beginning to balloon. His entire wardrobe, despite being typically loose on the lion, was now excruciatingly tight. Evan fantasized about what his pants size was sitting at now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly each night for the past several weeks, Evan obediently went over to Stephanie's apartment. There, he'd usually be forced by her to devour an ungodly amount of food. Just last night she found out how many donuts she could make Evan choke down. The answer was two and a half dozen. After Evan's (typically forced) feedings, Stephanie would drag the lion by the collar to the bedroom where she rode the lion hard though always being mindful of his painfully stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie jabbed the handle of the riding crop into Evan's belly, causing the mass to jiggle. While the lion was overall thrilled with his growth, the lioness had a more apathetic expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Thought you'd be more of a piggy by now,\" she said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I think I'm making good pr-OUCH!\" She brought the crop down hard on Evan's naked rear, which jiggle for a moment due to the strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here cub: <i>I</i> determine if you're making good progress. Hear me?\" The lion meekly nodded in response. His member was throbbing at this point. She started pacing around Evan, inspecting his fattened body, poking and prodding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to introduce you to some of my friends,\" she said after a few minutes. \"I've told others about you and they seem really, <i>really</i> eager to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you told others...\" Evan stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie giggled. \"What? You think that I wouldn't tell some of my friends what a loyal, obedient little cub I have?\" She scratched Evan behind his ear. \"Especially one that's so handsome and getting so, <i>so</i> fat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan remained silent, a concerned look remained on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness laughed again, ruffling Evan's mane. \"Oh, I think you'll have fun with them! Trust me! Emily told me all the stuff he wants to do with you! And Jeff wants to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff?\" asked Evan. \"But I'm not really into guys th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie ran the riding crop gently along Evan's stiffened manhood. Her eyes stared at him threateningly. \"As I was saying, Jeff wants to do all sorts of things that'll turn you into a really fat cat,\" she said. \"Now, both of them have the evening free tomorrow and I think it's be good for you to spend some...quality time them. Alone. Just the two of you. To see if you mesh. Now, does my growing cub have a preference? Or does he want me to chose for him?\"</span></div></div>",

Found something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan walked out of Stephanie's kitchen with a half-empty box of Twunkies. The lion shoved a whole one of the cream-filled confectioneries into his mouth as he plopped down onto the couch next to the lioness, both of whom were relaxing in just their underwear. Chub spilled out of over Stephanie's tight bra and panties. A small belly peaked over the waistband of Evan's boxer shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want one?\" Evan asked, holding the box out towards Steph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass,\" she said. Shrugging his shoulders, Evan popped another entire Twunkie into his mouth, chewing only for a few moments before swallowing it down. \"Geeze, Evan. I think you ate every single snack cake in my kitchen. Had I known you when I got to this town, I probably wouldn't have put on a hundred pounds. You'd have sucked down any junk food before I got a chance to eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? I'm a hungry boy!\" Evan said before popping yet another treat into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie reached over and patted his blossoming belly. \"That you are,\" she said. \"Told you this town will plump you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's heart raced. It was the first time she had touched the layer of fat building up on his midsection, let alone touch it. \"Uh, I'm not plumping up...\" he feigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, then what's this?\" Steph jabbed a paw into his belly. The lion squealed. He felt his cheeks burn red as he felt his cock stir to life under his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a little b-\" She didn't let him finish as the lioness had pinched a roll of flab on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this where all my snacks cakes are going?\" Steph shook the flab and watched Evan's small belly jiggle. The lion struggled for words. His body was electric with arousal and he could feel blood rush below his waist as his boxers tented up. Seeing Evan's excitement, she reached a paw down his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to burn some of that off then, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's phone binged as he was practically poured a takeout box full of pork fried rice down his throat and into his already overfed belly. It was a picture that Stephanie sent. In it, she was posing in the mirror at a local gym, her black and pink workout outfit clung tightly to her thick frame as she posed. Stephanie, no doubt thanks to Evan constantly relieving her of any and all junk food she kept in her apartment, got started going to the gym and was committed to shedding some of her extra pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll finally work this weight off now that I've got my own personal garbage disposal making sure I don't eat anything unhealthy,\" she had said to Evan one night cuddling in bed while giving his belly a pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had suggested that he come along with her to the gym. And while Evan certainly wanted to absolutely blow up like a blimp, some gym sessions might not be too unreasonable. If he wants going to become a super fat lion, doing some leg exercises now would build up enough muscle for him to carry his large body around when he crosses the quarter ton mark. Additionally, doing cardio might be a smart idea since he imagined it'll help things like going up and down stairs not be such an issue. But then again, going to the gym might just be too much to ask for from a lion who's far more interested in porking up than beefing up.</span></div></div>",

It was enough to ensure the lion's cardiovascular system got a decent work out but not enough to burn off any precious calories. He was more cautious, though. Tinting his head back, his drank the last few drops of the bottled protein shake he had been nursing before gently tossing it to the ground where two other empty bottles laid. He burped and gave his filled belly a pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treadmill were all on the second floor, and from the end Evan was at, he could look down to the weightlifting area where he saw Steph finishing up her squats. The lion purred as he watched her bend down, her curvy rear stretching the material of her workout pants as she did so. Evan had noticed her butt was less flabby and more firm, all without losing its roundness. The squats were clearly during their job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan watched as she cleared the area after finishing her set. While she did, he spotted another lion approach her. He stood out. Grey fur with dark spots, even from a distance he could tell the other lion didn't have an ounce of fat on him, making him the thinnest and fit furs Evan ever saw in Port Zaftig. Continuing to plod along on the treadmill, he spied as the grey lion flirted with the lioness, and she flirted right back. A twinge of jealousy shot through his stomach. He and Stephanie weren't technically an item, more like friends with benefits. But it didn't help him feel slightly envious as she tucked a scrap of paper he scribbled his phone number on into the waistband of her workout pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Evan's time on the treadmill was up, he headed off to the lockers to take a quick shower. With a towel wrapped around his widening waist, he headed back to the changing area where he spotted the same svelte handsome grey lion Stephanie had been flirting with. Even from afar, Evan could see his well-defined abs and chest muscles. The grey lion, a towel wrapped around his own waist, closed a locker door shut, slipping the padlock on but not bothering to lock it completely. And off he went in the direction of the gym's saunas.</span></div></div>",

He imagine bellies rubbing against each other, beds creaking under them, moobs mashing against tits, butts wobbling while they screwed each other. The lion reached climax quickly, his body flailing around as he bucked his hips and moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did Evan have a thing for growing girls, he also always fantasized about being in a relationship where both he and a girl were fattening up. The lion dreamed of sharing his life with a woman whose waistline was expanding just as fast as his, where they grew as their love grew. Unfortunately, this all remained a fantasy for the lion. The only girl he dated who was somewhat okay about putting on weight broke up with him not too long in the relationship. She had only put on a measly twenty pounds while he struggled to break through his hyper metabolism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now things were different. Not only was he in a city where getting fatter was all but certain, he had also found a sexy lioness who didn't seem to mind growing. This was finally for Evan an opportunity to realize his sexual desires. However, the slim lion did have some catching up to do. Stephanie easily had a hundred pounds on him. And Evan would like to get around roughly her size before figuring out how to blow up together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion wanted to get big. And fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other day, he saw that they were putting the finishing touches on a new Burger Depot not too far away. They would, of course, need employees and the lion was sure he'd be able to land a position there and be able to suck down greasy fast food all day long. Yet the lion wasn't too keen on working in a fast food place again. If he could get something like an office job, he could snack all day, maybe find some shakes that'll thicken him up, and he wouldn't burn a single calorie. He'd just sit at his desk and grow.</span></div></div>",

All of them were from El Burrito Diablito, and all of them were wrapping up burritos loaded with tons of meat, cheese, beans, and grease. Evan, working on the final one, carefully bit into it, being careful not to let anything spill out on his white button up shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion was alone in the break room. This is, until Stephanie sauntered in. \"Hey, big boy,\" she said, leaning down to give Evan a peck on the cheek. He felt her heavy breath press against her shoulder. \"Having a good lunch break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmrph umph!\" Evan tried saying with a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie giggled and eyed the wrappers in front of him. \"Wow, did you eat <i>all</i> of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan swallowed. \"I, uh, missed breakfast this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed again, this time gently patting the lion's full belly which was now straining the button of his shirt. \"Well, you might be sleeping alone tonight. I don't want you stinking up the place.\" Walking over to the break room fridge, she grabbed an iced coffee drink from it and went back to her desk, Being sure to give Evan another quick kiss before exiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night several weeks ago, cuddling in bed after a passionate love-making session, Evan dropped a hint that he was looking for work, particularly something that wasn't manual labor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd like something where I'm, you know, not on my feet all day or anything,\" he had said to Steph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, maybe I pull some strings for you.\" While Stephanie wasn't the top brass at Qual-U-Tech, she did have some stroke. Apparently, one of their analyst quit and they were scrambling to fill the position quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can learn how to read a spreadsheet, I'll get you hired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he applied and got the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past month, Evan took advantage of his new sedentary life. The lion made sure his desk was filled with candy and junk food which he would snack on all day. For lunch, he'd usually visit one of the many fast food restaurants nearby. With the tens of thousands of calories he was consuming daily, along with the fact that he sat on his butt all day, the lion's belly ballooned up into a decent sized gut, a mass of pudge stuck out nearly a foot in front of him and rested on his lap when he sat down. His body all over felt a bit softer, but most of the calories clearly went to his belly, which he was surprised to discover that Steph enjoy pawing at and rubbing when the two made love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Evan waddled back to his computer, he found that Mr. Burkeshire, one of his direct supervisors, sent him an email asking him to stay late. Apparently, they're had been some errors in a recently submitted report and he wanted the lion to review it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be <b>heavily</b> rewarded for doing this, Evan,\" the email said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aside from the occasional emergency light, the computer monitor was the only other light source on the entire floor. Evan sat at his workstation, reviewing the report that Mr. Burkshire asked him to look over again as he munched on a small pile of candy bars. The last of his coworkers left a couple of hours ago, leaving the lion by himself on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I don't see why I needed to edit this,\" Evan muttered to himself as he bit into his fourth candy bar. \"Thing already looks fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone on his desk started ringing, startling Evan for a moment. \"Yes, hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan? Mr. Burkshire here. Are you still working on that report?\" the voice on the other end of the line said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. Almost done though. I should be finished in half an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, wonderful,\" Mr. Berkshire replied. \"Say, you've been working so hard. Why don't you take a break and come up to my office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, if you don't mind, sir, I'd rather try and power through this,\" said Evan. \"Heh, don't want to be stuck here all night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was silent for a moment. \"Why don't you take a break and come up to my office?\" Mr. Burkshire repeated more sternly than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias Burkshire was one of the more reclusive executives in the company. Evan recalled only having seeing the hefty reindeer once in passing, his bulky frame and ponderous belly stretching his already vast business suit. It was that elusive plump reindeer that sat at an ornate desk in one of the executive suites on the top floor of the Qual-U-Tech Building as the lion nervously pushed the heavy wood door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Evan, please, come in and sit down,\" the reindeer said, gesturing towards a chair opposite to him. \"How's things down in the offices?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright, I suppose.\" Evan lowered himself into the plush chair, feeling his belly once again spill out onto his lap and buttons struggled to contain his gut. Tobias' eyes briefly darted down towards the lion's midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are you liking your job so far?\" he asked. \"You've been here...a month or so, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! It's a pretty decent job, I think,\" Evan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you seem to be growing into the position.\" Once more, the reindeer's eyes glanced at Evan's belly. This time, the lion caught him and started blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir, Mr. Burkshire...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toby. Please, call me Toby.\" The reindeer got up and hauled his heavy body towards Evan, waddling around to the back of his chair, placing his hooves on the lion's shoulder. \"My, someone's been plumping up, haven't they? That shirt looks absolutely ready to burst off of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan blushed even harder, feeling the fur's belly press into the back of his head. \"Y-yeah, I've been packing it on a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I've been noticing...\" Toby reached down and started unbuttoning Evan's shirt. The lion thought about stopping him, but the reindeer had so much girth on him that he would hardly be able to put up much of a fight. \"My, such a handsome belly on such a handsome lion...\" He began rubbing  Evan's bare stomach, letting out the occasional grunt. The lion simply sat there, letting the reindeer caress his gut, unsure of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly ten minutes of rubbing the lion's blubbery belly, Toby waddled back towards his desk. Evan couldn't help but notice the significant bludge in the executive's pants. He reached into a drawer and pulled out a small stack of bills, tossing it to Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what...this for?\" Evan asked, flipping through the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta make sure you're well-fed,\" Toby said, leaning his obese body against his desk. \"And there's plenty more for you. All I ask is that I get a....peak at what is I'm contributing to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\" the lion nervously replied, getting up from the chair and turned towards the door. \"I've, uh, got to get back to work, sir...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, Evan,\" Toby said, the lion stopped in his tracks. \"Aren't those pants looking a bit tight too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was well into the night when Evan left the Qual-U-Tech Building. He adjusted his shirt and pants as he left, having quickly redressed not long ago. For what seemed like hours, the lion stood in Toby's office as the reindeer poked and prodded and rubbed Evan's nearly naked chubby body. It was an uncomfortable experience, needless to say. But for what it's worth, the lion did walk out with a small stack of cash, almost a month's pay for him, along with a promise of more to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure it all goes here,\" Toby said, giving Evan's gut a slap. \"And keep this between you and I. Nobody else needs to know about it.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>My office. Tonight. -T</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what the sticky note sitting on the box of Andromeda Bars said. Evan, hungry for a pre-post-breakfast snack, reached into the drawer in his desk where he usually stashed all of his goodies to find a large box of his favorite candy bars sitting inside. He knew it was from Toby. Toby was one of the few furs who knew what Evan's favorite candy was. The lion smiled as he cracked open the box. He grabbed a couple of bars before shutting the drawer again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the help of Toby's \"financial assistance\", Evan's weight skyrocketed. The lion sailed past 200 pounds a couple of weeks ago and showed no signs of slowing down. Not only was he now able to afford massive meals of greasy fast food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Evan was able to keep snacking throughout the day nonstop. Rarely was there a moment that the lion wasn't stuffing his face with something extremely caloric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tens of thousands of calories the lion was now sucking down mostly made their way to his belly which literally and figuratively ballooned out. A huge ball of pudge, Evan's gut stuck out well over a foot in front of him, sagging down a bit thanks to gravity, and wobbling around whenever he moved. It was now well on its way to taking up the entirety of his lap. His belly was getting so large that the view of his toes was beginning to get obstructed by it as well. Evan had to go up a few shirt sizes, his belly having exploded apart the buttons of his button-up shirts many times. To the lion's delight, his rump was filling out, too. No longer small and boney, his rear was beginning to resemble two balloons filled with soft cottage cheese which bounced around just as much as his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, Evan,\" Stephanie said mid-coitus one evening, bouncing up and down on Evan's nude pelvis as she ran her paws along the sphere of his gut. \"I told you this town would blow you up, but I didn't think you'd get this fat this quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climaxed shortly after she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby pulled back the band on Evan's y-front briefs, slipping in a small stack of bills in before releasing it, causing the band to snap back and sending a ripple throughout the lion's flabby body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Evan was uncomfortable with the situation. Toby would ask Evan and only Evan to stay late, usually a couple of times a week, when upon which he'd undoubtedly call the lion to his office where the reindeer would then undress him down to his underwear and caress his growing body. But he eventually warmed up to it, even lavishing the fact that he not only had someone admiring his fatter body but also helping pay to grow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his pants back up, Evan's belly wobbled and shook. Toby sat back at his desk, watching the pudgy lion as he dressed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to do things a little differently...\" began Toby <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Differently? How?\" asked Evan as he struggled to button up his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspect people are getting suspicious. I already had a couple of folks from HR ask about why you're staying late so often,\" he said. \"We'll have to have of a change in venue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...what did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reindeer waddled over to the window overlooking the nearby street. He spotted a hotel across the road. VACANCY flashed the signed welcoming visitors to the Double Fern hotel. \"There,\" he said, pointing a hoof. \"We can meet up there. Don't worry, I'll cover the cost of the room. And you can spend the night, too, if you're feeling sleepy,\" Toby said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pit started to form in Evan's stomach. Not only were people from work starting to catch on, but Stephanie was beginning to get suspicious too. She had been working at Qual-U-Tech for a few years and never got called in to work late. The lion was struggling to come up with explanations as to why he was being called to stay late so often. On top of that, Evan was feeling a bit off about things. Technically what he was doing wasn't cheating, he reasoned. Nothing sexual was happening between him and Toby. Still though, Evan felt like he was being dishonest with her. Perhaps calling things off with Toby might be for the best even if it meant he was no longer getting money from the reindeer</span></div></div>",

Come hungry. -T</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion inserted the card into the reader installed above the doorknob. A second later and the light of it turned from red to green. Evan walked inside, shutting the door behind him. The room itself was pretty much what he expected. A bed, television, dressers, and the like. What was unusual was the smorgasbord of fast food laid out foot of the bed. Burgers, chicken nuggets, burritos, all his favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the bathroom was shut. Light peaked out from under the door. Toby must be in there, Evan reasoned. He decided to go ahead and take off his clothes. It would save Toby the time after all. Though the lion elected to keep his excruciatingly tight white briefs on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion stood awkwardly in the room as he waited for Toby, his overweight body exposed to the cool air of the room. A minute later and Toby walked out of the bathroom. Gone was his usual business suit. Rather, the reindeer was clad only in a pair of red briefs that strained to contain his thick thighs and bulbous butt. His dark brown furred belly surged out and over the top of his underwear, hanging halfway down to his knees. A pair of heavy moobs sagged on top of the mound of lard that was his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...h-hi, Toby...\" Evan said nervously. He didn't except the reindeer to be nearly nude as well. The lion speculated what he was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan, glad you made it!\" the supersized reindeer said. \"Oh, I hope you don't mind my lack of apparel. I'm just...taking advantage of our new privacy...\" Evan saw the greedy fur's eyes scan the lion's fattened form. \"Come! Come! I hope you're hungry! I didn't know what you wanted, so I just got lots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby gestured for Evan to come over. His gut gently bounced around as he joined the reindeer in front of the bed, who placed an arm around his shoulder. \"My, doesn't that look good? The lion nodded. \"Then have some! It's all yours!\" Evan leaned down to grab a burger. He felt the reindeer's heavy arm force his entire upper body down towards the bed. Feeling awkward and uncomfortable, Evan went ahead and started devouring one of the burgers bent of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby moved around towards the back of Evan, shoving him down deeper towards the fast food fest. The lion was now standing yet face first in the food. He continued eating as that was the only thing he felt he could do in a situation like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reindeer tugged down Evan's underwear, exposing his blimped up butt. The lion inhaled sharply in surprise. \"Oh, don't mind me, Big Cat. Just you keep eating your heart's content!\" Still worried, Evan finished off the burger and grabbed for a pawful of nuggets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he felt Toby's immense gut plop down on the small of his back, pinning down Evan's tail. Nervously, Evan turned around, seeing the reindeer right behind him. A pair of red briefs laid on the floor nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat, cub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan turned back to the food, anxiously popping a nugget into his mouth. As he shoved a handful of fries into his mouth, he felt something warm, hard, and slick slip between his doughy butt cheeks and penetrate his virgin hole. The lion gasped, only to have the reindeer lean forward and pressed his head back down into the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth flabby bodies wobbled as Toby thrusted his hips. Wave after wave rippled throughout their soft bodies with each slow yet powerful thrust. Tears formed in Evan's eyes as his hole got stretched to accommodate the reindeer's girth. He simply continued eating knowing that was really the only thing he could do. Evan grabbed two burritos as stuffed them into his face as Toby let out a deep moan before thrusting again. The lion hoped the reindeer would be finished soon.</span></div></div>",

The lioness purred, and wiggled her hips a bit. She felt the lion's member swelling up in arousal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you might not be disappointed then,\" she teased. \"Now, are you ready for Round 2?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, fuck yeah...you're going to be a big kitty...a fucking huge kitty...\" The lion's hips bucked as his manhood erupted, spraying all over his chest, waves of euphoria reverberating throughout his body as imagines of Stephanie, bigger and fatter, flashed in Evan's imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up in the small town of Bastion, there wasn't much for the fur who preferred bigger furs. Many of the girls in his high school, for example, were quite thin. However, Evan had a lifelong attraction towards big girls, the fatter the better. Since there were no fat girls for him to fawn over, the lion reasoned that he'd have to grow one himself. Unfortunately, there was only one girlfriend he had who was willing to fulfill his fantasizes. But the relationship overall didn't last long enough for him to really plump her up beyond the twenty or so pounds she already gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was a woman in Evan's life who not only was getting fatter, but also who didn't mind putting on the weight. The only question now was how he was going to push Stephanie further into obesity. He could do it subtly, thicken her up pound by pound, slowly by surely blowing her up. Or perhaps she might be willing to grow bigger. It would be risky, but if she's into it, then Evan would be able to blow her up like a blimp in no time. </span></div></div>",

Now, come on, I got cake! Just for you\"!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie and Evan had been seeing each other with some frequency. And their dates followed a similar format. She would bring Evan to one of the many, many restaurants in town where he would eat his fill, usually more than the lion could handle at the behest of the lioness tempting him to have a taste of this or that. Dessert at her place always followed. Even if Evan protested, Stephanie would somehow entice him to have another bite and another bite until he was ready to burst. Sex would always follow dessert. Being so incredibly full, Evan had to be the passive partner resigned to lying in bed while she did most of the work. Stephanie didn't seem to mind as she bounced up and down on his pelvis, her paws gently caressing his swollen gut until both of them climaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening after a night of eating (mostly by Evan) and lovemaking, the lion got up from his girlfriend's bed to get dressed. The naked, chubby lioness watched as Evan struggled to button up his jeans. She purred in delight as his midsection, now sporting a sprouting belly, jiggled and wobble while strained to get his jeans closed. \"Screw it. I can leave them unbuttoned. I'm just down the hallway...\" Evan muttered as he gave up and started putting his shirt back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes, time to lay off the sweets, huh?\" Stephanie teased Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a couple of pounds. Nothing that a little dieting can't take care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a couple?\" Her eyes glanced downwards towards Evan's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe a bit more than a couple,\" he said. \"But I'm sure I can burn it off.

He groaned again. \"But I don't want to do another fast food job...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need work, don't you?\" his girlfriend asked. \"Besides, think of the damage this place could do to your waistline...\" Her eyes wandered towards the front counter where a particularly plump lynx in an ill-fitting polo shirt with the restaurant's logo on the lapel was ringing up a customer at the cash register. His paw tapped on the electronic screen. The register drawer shot open, only to bounce on the spotted cat's belly and shot right back into the register. The lynx looked slightly embarrassed. He stepped off to the side before hitting the button again. The drawer shot open without issue this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie faced betrayed the arousal she felt witnessing such a fat cat. Under the table, her thick thighs squirmed together. A ping of jealousy rippled through Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Got a pen?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evan found Stephanie's car waiting for him in the parking lot of the Burger Barn. Even though he lived not too far away from the restaurant, the lioness insisted on giving him a ride home in order to keep him from burning even one unnecessary calorie. Opening the passenger door, Evan sat down, tossing the bag filled with greasy treats in the backseat. Fries, burgers, nobody had any issue with him taking the leftovers and mistake orders home with him. The lion certainly took advantage of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe,\" Stephanie said, leaning over to plant a kiss on the lion. As she did so, she snuck a paw under Evan's loose work shirt (the smallest size they carried looked like a tent on him) and gave the growing mound of fat that was his belly a gentle rub. While they kiss, Evan reached his own paws downward, and after a few moments of struggling, unbuttoned his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, getting tight...\" he groaned and he soothed the area around his waist where the material had been constricted him all day with a rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor baby. We ought to get you sweatpants,\" cooed Steph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably. Need something that'll hold my ballooning butt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness growled. Over the past few weeks, Evan had been learning all the small things about getting bigger that really got the lioness excited. Describing himself as ballooning was one of those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled and went in for another kiss. The back door of the Burger Barn screeched open. Out walked Trent, the flabby lynx, easily Evan's fattest coworker. Steph stopped to watch Trent waddle across the parking lot, his slack straining to contain his blubbery lower half. Though Evan was into girls, he could help sneaking peaks at Trent rear during his shift all day to see the miracle of how the seat of his pants didn't burst apart under the intense pressure his gelatinous butt put upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of ballooning...\" the lioness growled again, eyeing the plump lynx as he waddled out of sight. \"I swear, that boy's bigger every time I see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nuts. I've never see him eat anything at work. But Trent looks a little bigger every single day it seems,\" Evan stated. \"I wonder what his secret is? Maybe I should find out! I need more fat friends who's eating habits will rub off on me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie excited turned back to Evan. \"Yeah! In fact, you should invite him over to my place! I'll cook you both a huge meal and you and Trent can pig out like the handsome fatties you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan gave a half-smile. He wasn't too thrilled about bringing Trent over to Stephanie's. The lioness seemed to get worked up at the sight of Trent's expansive belly, he felt jealous. Perhaps it would be better to hang out with Trent alone.</span></div></div>",

Besides, you're way bigger than I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie sank a paw into his pudgy rump. \"Their called curves, Evan. Girls are supposed you have them. And you don't seem to mind a thick lioness. Boys are supposed to be skinny. Or muscular. But not fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shook his head as he tied his shoes. \"Whatever. Like I said, just a few pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's keep it that way. I don't want you turning into a blob like most furs in this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so 27 pounds. That's not too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan stood naked in his bathroom on his scale. The number on it read 169, a number much higher than it was when he arrives in town a few weeks ago. He checked himself out in the mirror and didn't hate what he saw. A little belly, a softer chest, slightly thicker thighs. The lion turned as saw a noticeably plumper butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm definitely not a fat ass,\" he said, poking a butt cheek with his paw. It jiggled only mildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about what Stephanie said irritated him. He only put on a few pounds. Why should she judge him for that? After all, the lioness easily had a hundred pounds of fat on her. Evan could double in size and still weigh less than her. Hell, the new pounds looked good on his formerly sickly frame. Why not put on a few more to spite Steph?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The young money stood there panting in the hallway when Evan opened up the door to his apartment. Sweat was glistening off of his fur, the exact same shade of brown as milk chocolate. Beads of sweat dripped from his forehead down his cherubic face. His mop of hair flopped down and stuck to his forehead. Pools of sweat had formed in the underarms of his green polo shirt; perspiration made the material stick to his doughy belly and rolls and chest. Over his left moob was the logo of Full Foods. Over the right moob was the name TYLER is bold, clear lettering. On the floor next to his sat several paper bags packed full with the various flavors of Jen &amp; Barry's ice cream he had order online earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order...order for...\" The struggled to lean down and grab the paper sitting on top of one of the bags on account of his ponderous gut. He was eventually able to snatch it, and he read from the order for. \"Uh, a Mr. Evan? I've got five cartons of...of the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't look good. Exhausted, probably. \"Yeah, that's probably mine. Umm..you want to come in a sit down for a moment? I can take care of the rest from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha-thanks, Mister,\" the chunky monkey panted as he waddled by Evan, a long thick tail dragging on the floor behind him. Evan couldn't help but notice hearing the creaking of his pants as he shuffled by. \"Elevator... maintenance. Had to take...the stairs...\" The monkey collapsed on Evan's couch, his soft body jiggled about violently as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, Evan brought the bags filled with cartons of ice cream into his kitchen while Tyler sat, trying to catch his breath. Once all the bags were in, he stared filling his freezer. The sheer magnitude of ice cream he bought was probably too much for the fairly big freezer in his fridge. The lion figured he'd probably have to take care of several cartons sooner rather than later. Reaching into a bag, he grabbed for a carton. BOMBASTIC BANANA, the box read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some?\" Evan said, holding the opened carton of banana ice cream towards Tyler. A large silver spoon was stuck in the frozen treat like the sword in the Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" The monkey eagerly reached for the carton and instantly went about devouring its contents while Evan finished packing away container after container into the freezer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, that hit the spot...\" Tyler said, pulling himself off of the couch. The monkey waddled over to the kitchen and handed the empty container and spoon back to Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion was slamming his shoulder into the door of the freezer trying to get the door to shut. \"No...problem!\" he grunted, charging him shoulder on more time. Once again, the door bounced open. Huffing in frustration, he pulled out a few containers of ice cream and set them down on the counter. This did the trick as the freezer door was finally able to shut. \"Jeez, about time...\" Evan muttered, as he glanced at the cartons he removed and would need to devour that day. Grabbing one of them, another Bombastic Banana, he tossed it towards Tyler who nearly dropped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One for the road?\" Evan said. \"Consider it a tip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young money chuckled, tossing the empty container in the trash and cracking open the new one in his paws. \"Thanks, sir!\" Tyler said, digging the spoon in. \"Well, have a good day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" Evan said, waving as the monkey waddled out of the apartment happily eating a spoonful of ice cream. As he left, the lion spotted a few tiny tears in the backside of the monkey's pants. A few more cartons of ice cream and he'd bee needing to size up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone again, Evan immediately starting stripping down to his boxers. \"Don't need this...don't need this...\" he said, tossing his pants and shirt on the white linoleum floor. \"Need this...and this...and this...\" Evan mutter as he grabbed the remaining two cartons of ice cream and a spoon before heading over to his couch.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Many years ago on this site, there was a story called Zaftig City. Its focus was on weight gain and fat furs. I contributed many chapters to that story and was sadden to see the whole thing get deleted some years ago. And while there are a number of other stories that center on fat furs, none of them capture the magic Zaftig City had. Revivals and attempts to recreate the original have been met with some success. This is my attempt at trying to capture lighting in a bottle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPort Zaftig is known for three things: Sun, Surf, and Sand. A premier vacation destination, furs from all over flock to the Port's beautiful beaches and blue oceans. With warm and sunny days nearly all year long, the city thrives on tourism and devotes an entire section of the beachside property to luxury restaurants and hotels for visitors practically sectioning them off from the towns residents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, though, is everything that Evan knows about Port Zaftig. Having grown up in a rural town in a landlocked state, the lion dreamed of residing in a sunny beautiful seaside city. Now, as a 20-something, he's ready to make his dream a reality. For years, he worked long hours and picked up on sidegigs to save up enough money to leave his small hometown. With enough cash to survive a few months in Zaftig, he packed up what few worldly possession he had into his car and made the multi-day drive to his new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Evan does not know, however, is the easy way to spot the locals from the tourists. Many furs visiting are like him, fit and trim. All of the locals, though, are ridiculously obese. Thanks to the dirt cheap cost of food at Port Zaftig, a skinny fur there is either just visiting or won't be skinny much longer. Will Evan buck that trend? Or will Port Zaftig grow on him in more ways than one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules &amp; Guidelines<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Please put some effort into your chapters. Avoid things like single sentence chapters, horrendous grammar, unreadable formatting, and the like. Short chapters are fine if they are trying to drive the story in a particular direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) The focus of this story should be on weight gain, and it should focus on Evan in particular. Other characters can get big alongside Evan, however he is the main character and needs to be growing. But feel free in include things that are weight gain adjacent e.g. bloating, slob, or button popping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Weight gain ought to be the main focus. However, feel free to include adjacent topics like blueberry transformation, inflation, muscle growth, height growth, etc. But please try and avoid things like instant weight gain or stuff like magic. If in doubt, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Sex and graphic content is allowed, both gay and straight. But keep the focus on the overall story on weight gain and not on sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Characters who are minors and their weight gain is permissible. However, they should not be involved in any sort of sexual acts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) This is a kind of \"choose your own adventure\" story, so please make your chapters options as kinds of choices for Evan to make. For example, try to make your options in the form of \"Evan chose X or Evan chose Y\" rather than \"X happened to Evan or Y happened to Evan\". Ignore this suggestion if you need to move the story's timeline along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) Characters cannot be killed off. And please don't write about anything gross like scat or vomit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, have fun.<br>\r\n</td>",
