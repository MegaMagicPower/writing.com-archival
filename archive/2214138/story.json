The bovines seem blissfully unaware of your presence as they wander about and feast on the plentiful bounty around them. Beyond the farm, you can see a bustling town, but your gnawing hunger draws your attention back to the farm below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour long tongue laps at the air, bringing tastes that only further stoke your appetite.

Fear grips your mind; were you noticed, is someone going to come after you for intruding?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdging back up so you can see, you spot a woman looking at one of the cows that wanders closer to her. Relief floods into you as you realize that she must have been calling the cow over. Proof comes as the woman leads the cow to a barn attached to the pasture. You watch her go, your eyes fixated on the woman even though you can\u2019t make out much detail at this distance. Something about her seems off, but your stomach grumbles again, realizing food is even closer yet you continue to waste time.

It feels so good, so right, but also so new... you don't remember the last time you kissed her... or anyone... but your mouth seems to know how to do it and even your tongue knows its way to dance with hers in the space between your lips. Urges grows as your male parts stiffens. Your right hand finds its way to her butt cheeks and you grab it firmly to lift her from the ground. Her arm hugs your neck and she uses her legs to secure her grip on your body. Your left hand start caress her back and play with her hairs when your right hand fondle her butt. Slowly little finger and annular find their way to a wet place and slip in it with ease. Filirel softly moan between two kisses when you explore her love's place. You play like this for a while, making her moan louder and faster, before you bring her back to the bed and put a knee on it to lay her down on the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... so gentle today... my light...\" She says, breathless and smiling. Her eyes looks at you with so much love, your heart melt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like it ?\" You asks, wondering how she could take it rough. She seems so small and fragile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you a moment, scrutinizing your face, like she tries to remember that moment.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it's nice to have a change sometimes.\" She finaly tells you. She then grab your hard member and stroke it gently with a kinky look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay down on her and push your wood in her fireplace and lit the fire by pushing it all in. She immediately let out a loud moan as she grab a cushion above her head and squeeze it in her hand, She's really tight and you can feel her muscles pulsating around your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the sensation is so new but so normal at the same time. It's like you never did it before, but at the same time you knew exactly what to do. It's so confusing, but you're so horny and you're so falling for that woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling almost out and then putting it back in, you start making love to her. You don't know how but you manage to not burst of pleasure immediately and as your hips moves faster and faster, her moanings turns into cries out of pleasure. She wrap her legs around your pelvis and wave her lower body, bringing you pleasure you never felt before. You can see her face, just below you, her ears down, her eyebrows frown, her eyes closed and your mouth half open letting out screams of pleasure. And suddenly, her whole body braces, her arm release the cushion to jab her fingers in the bed next to her, her eyes finaly open as they roll and she let a long loud moan of pleasure. You can feel around your hard member her muscles contracting in shockwaves, squeezing it to make it burst as you release everything in a mindblowing tidal wave of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to recover from what just happened and pull out to roll over on your back as she still seems unconscious with her body shacking from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the afterglow of the orgasm you just had, few memories comes to you, adventures, fights, peoples you met, but it seems so distant like it was from someone else. But then, you remember a face more clearly, a girl, looking a lot like Filirel, but human. She says something with a joyful face... but then you see another moment, she's sad, crying and even if you don't hear anything, you understand she's apologising... but for what ? Is she the cause of your situation ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your partner in the bed moving again and take a look. She rolled on the side and looks at you her ear up again, with a big smile.<br>\r\n\"You ruined the sheets again... So, it's up to you to bring the sheets to the laundry room.\" She says on a playful tone before kissing you on the sheeks. \"I'll clean myself and prepare the breakfast when you do that.\" She then get out of the bed and leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuined the sheets ? The laundry room ? You take a look where Filirel was and notice the big wet spot... ok, you understand now... You get out of the bed and grab the sheets to make a big messy ball with it. Now the laundry room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the room, you find yourself in a big corridor with stairs at one end and four doors. Trying to collect your memories on where is what in this unknown house, Filirel comes out from the door in front of the bedroom. She's wearing a simple white dress going down bellow her knees, with no sleeves and a nice neckline not revealing anything with her... small... stature. But the most noticeable thing now is a kind of mecanical arm with the cogs visibles on some parts and seemingly made of silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you as she put her hairs in a ponytail.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, looking like a lost puppy ? Don't go downstairs butt naked ! The servants doesn't want to see your male parts hanging in front of their face. Put something on ! Hop ! Hop ! Hop !\" She tells you, moving her mecanical arms to show you to speed up a little bit, before moving to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat way of speaking, it sound so familiar and comforting. It makes you feel better. You go back to the bedroom, look into the furnitures and find pants and shirts that you immediately put on after leaving the pile of sheets on the floor. You then take them back and go downstairs to find a big room with a basic kitchen, a sink, a stove, a counter and a big pantry open. A big table is in the middle of the room and six chairs are all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take this, master.\" Says a voice below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and see a woman goblin with a black and white dress, her arms open. She's note quite beautiful, with green skin, a big nose and the canines of her lower jaw coming out of her mouth, but she's clean and her long black hairs are well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hum, thanks...\" You says, as you give her the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walks uneasy with her big pile of fabrics to a door on the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice filirel cooking some potatoes and meat on the stove and join her. In a move that came to you naturaly, you kiss her on the neck and she slightly shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmh... you're still up ? You made quite a mess between my legs...\" She says on a slightly accusing tone before continuing with a more playful one. \"I wouldn't mind doing it again... after the breakfast...\"</span></div></div>",

Shortly after, you eat a really basic breakfast with bread, potato and meat cube, probably pig. You can't stop looking at her, even when she eats, she looks so beautiful and she's starting to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going with you today ?

You made it official... how much time passed after that last fight ? Few years, at least, by the look of the scars... Memories comes back, but so few and so foggy. Unlike the one of that strange past in another world, another life.<br>\r\nYou notice that Filirel looks intensively her plate as she eats the lasts bits of her breakfast, her face is still red on the cheeks. You're about to say something when the goblin surprise you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your clothes are prepared for the meeting with the mayor, master.\" She states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilirel immediately sit up straight.<br>\r\n\"Shit, I forgot about Joel !\" She says. \"I have to prepare myself, I'll be right back !\"<br>\r\nShe then runs upstairs in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay a moment, not understanding what just happened, but you know the mayor Joel. He was the one who hired you for that last mission. You turn to the goblin maid and ask her where your clothes are, and she tells you, in your bedroom.<br>\r\nYou go back upstairs and find the clothes on the bed... with new sheets... that goblin is really good at her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dahl, can you come a moment ?\" You hear from the bathroom <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go see what she needs and enter the room across the coridor. Its a large room with tiles, a sink, a mirror, few furnitures and a big bath in the corner. Filirel is in the bath, her metal arm on a chair next to her, and she looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it ?\" You asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something missing in my bath...\" She answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just wait for her answer and she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... a big strong man. Come here light of my days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off your shirt and pants and join her in the bath, making the water rise and overflow the bathtub. She makes a childish smile as you come in with her, and you can feel her feet on each side of your body as you try to not take too much space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant it, earlier. I feel like the luckiest woman in the country, you're the best person I've ever met and you make me happy.\" She says all serious of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back at her.<br>\r\n\"Well, we are the happiest married couple in the country then...\" You say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe start rubbing her feet between your legs with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"Wanna get kinky in the bath ?\" She asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Joel ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joel can wait. I want you now...\"<br>\r\nWith thoses words, she leans to you and grab your manhood.<br>\r\n\"See what you're making me do ? I'm too shy to take the lead, but I don't care right now. I want that, in me, now !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, take it, then... what's stopping you ?\" You tell her teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes an exagerated shocked face, before looking at you angry.<br>\r\n\"You, ass...\" she whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then, goes on her knees and sit on your lap, leading the way for your erected shaft the way to her love place. Partially out of the water, you have a good look of her small breasts pointing in your direction. You decide then, to take care of her erected nipples with your fingers while you fondle the two small mounts. Quickly she moans loudly as she moves up and down on your hips, pushing water on the floor each time.<br>\r\nGetting slower, she murmur in your ear \"Take me Dahl, take me now, please !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up, your wife still empaled on your hard member, and you push her against the wall. There you have all the room to gives her hard pushes of your hips, trusting your manhood deep in her. And that makes her cry out of pleasure each time. You can keep it longer than earlier and she collapse on you before you're close to anything, so you continue. And as she claw your back with her first orgasms, she barely have time to calm down that she's hit by a second one. At the third one, you finaly burst in her and feel the excess running down your shaft to fall in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSill impaled, Filirel is half asleep on your torso. you can hear her murmur. \"You really have a bad influence on me... making me take the lead... that was so wanton...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back in the bath with her and wait for her to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, shit, we're so late !\" Fulminate Filirel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're already dressed up, but, she still have to put on some make up and make her hairs. Which she does after half an hour or so. She comes out of the bathroom with a very fancy green dress, long, with a lot of laces that gives it volumes. She wears elvians make up and a complex hairstyle. All together is a perfect fusion between elf and human high society look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go...\" She orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you push the front door where a carriage is waiting for you. You feel stuck in your fancy clothes, but avoid to say any complains. Outside is a paved street with a lot of people walking on the sidewalk in fancy clothes. On each side of the street, grey houses like yours, stands tall and oppressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the carriage, Filirel sit next to you and grab your hand with her mechanical arm, clearly trying to be as delicate as possible with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you approach of the destination, you notice the smell of fire. Filirel and you look by the window to find a crowd of people standing in front of a large house burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife goes out in panic.<br>\r\n\"Shit ! Joel !\" She shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her to a guard trying to maintain a safe distance to the house.<br>\r\n\"What happened ?\" She asks him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man look at her and instantly stiffen.<br>\r\n\"Lady Garrael ! Hum... there was an explosion at the mayor house half an hour ago ! We don't know much, the firemen are trying to find the mayor, but with no success for now, the fire is too hot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour ago ? You should have been in there at that moment !

You sit on the edge of the bed, with slow movements and feel their weight, you don't remember such a sensation, you're pretty sure you never were so endowed. At first glance, you're probably around E-cup... but enough of that, you need to know more about yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the rising light of the morning, you look around and see a big room with strong stone walls. The huge bed is in a solid frame of wood with golden illumination and satin sheets. There are two dressers and a wardrobe with a big mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk there, your feet feeling the wooden floor, and you can finally fully see yourself. You can see the nice curves of your body, even under the nightie. You're a little bit chubby with large hips and a thick ass. Your face is round with great feminine features impossible to miss, a small nose, big eyelashes and full lips. On each side of your face falls dark blond hairs, a little messy from the night of sleep, ending in the middle of your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped you could recognise any detail of yourself, but nothing, you just see a stranger looking back. Who the hell are you ? A name comes to your mind. Danny. Is it yours ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, the sun have almost fully risen from the horison.

Are you ready to be my wife ?\" She says as she push your ribs to gently force you to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you see her eyes, shining like a golden ring on a sea of milk and pierced by a black spot who seems to pierce through your soul. She smiles so naturaly, you could melt just at the sight of her face. She's so small, her head is at the same height of your breasts, you want to protect her from any threats that could come.</span></div></div>",
