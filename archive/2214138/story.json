Where they that big ? You grab them with your hands, they're quite heavy too. That's when you notice your hands with long and thin fingers, really feminine, with sharp nails, almost like claws.

You're pretty sure they've never been that long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most importantly, what the fuck is wrong with your legs ?!? You push your breasts out of your view with your hands and understand why your balance were so off... you don't have legs !

The feeling is great ! You hear the birds, the wind in the leafs, see the majestic trees all around, the flowers and bushes, and smell the humidity in the air and the musk of preys... wait ? Preys ? Shit... you're hungry... like really hungry right now... You could eat a horse... litteraly...

Relief floods into you as you realize that she must have been calling the cow over. Proof comes as the woman leads the cow to a barn attached to the pasture. You watch her go, your eyes fixated on the woman even though you can\u2019t make out much detail at this distance. Something about her seems off, but your stomach grumbles again, realizing food is even closer yet you continue to waste time.
