I say little brother, but i really mean younger brother as he towers over me at 6'2\". My mother left us after Chase was born. Anyway, I'm a pretty average student. Contrary to popular belief i am not a tomboy. I love all things feminine and if you saw my room you would think that an issue of \"Seventeen Magazine\". I thats enough background for what I need to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 17 weighing in at a wopping 128 pounds standing at 5'6\" tall Alpha of the Arm Bar, the Bane of the bullies, the Controller of Control, the Duke of Double,... ( I can do this for every letter of the alphabet) the Master of the Mat... Flexy Henry Carter. (ahhhhhhhhhh the crowd is going nuts). In case you hadn't guessed, I'm a bit of a badassImeanwrestler. Ok not really a badass but nobody seems to hate me. I live with my mom Jessica, and my little sister Kristina (or as she likes to call herself, \"the beautiful and fabulous -faw-boo-los Miss KristyAna Elizabeth Madeline c<br>\r\nCarteright) we just call her Kristy or kris for short. She doesn't seem to care. Anyway with a 14 year old sister and my mother people would assume i turned out to be a little effeminate. Nope. Not me. I make sure of that on a daily basis. I have been known to sweep the ladies off their feet. Not that i ever have being a virgin and all. Anyway, I guess people like me cause I'm a good person.</span></div></div>",

Like i had a frog in my throat. Thing is my dad didn't seem to think i sounded any different. Maybe its because of the layers of blankets and the closed door. Yeah that had to be it. Anyway i made my way to my bathroom and something felt off. I didnt feel my hair brush my shoulders, I started to worry that maybe Chase had cut my hair. Then, other things seemed to come into focus. I noticed my fingernails were shorter and looked like they were kept trim as they were bit to the nailplate. I looked farther down to see that i was sporting a healthy 4\" In my panties. At that moment, I froze where were my breasts? I almost freaked out thinking to myself, Please let this be a dream, why am i a man? My center of gravity also seemed to shift as i walked in and looked at myself in the mirror. To say i was weirded out would be the understatement of the year. In the mirror, was my reflection. I saw the 17 year old Girl I grew up to be but on the surface when i touched my face, my hair, my empty c cups, i shuttered when i felt down and pinched. Then i proceeded to shout in a very unladylike fashion. Needless to say i won't be doing that again. Like ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden my father, with every ounce of modesty opened the door and found me on the floor of the bathroom holding my hands over my groin. \"What happened princess?\"</span></div></div>",

I have to get to work early and I know its going to take forever to get that man to register in his brain that hes going to be late for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Momma\" and with that mom left the house. It was five minutes later that i heard a knock on my door. I didn't get up of course as i was still \"sleeping\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry, hurry up, we're gonna be late for school!\" She said with such a whine that i thought it was five oclock in the evening and people were getting ready to drink about screwing up and getting in trouble with their wives. Anyway i get out of bed and immediately am met with hair all over my face. Not my beared, which was weird because usually i would have a five o'clock shadow. No this came from the top of my head. I could feel it brushing my shoulders too. I had to get to a mirror. That could wait i had to take care of some much needed irrigating. As i continued to walk i could feel my center of gravity shift. I look down for the first time today to see... nothing. My breasts are in the way... ... ... WHERE DID THESE COME FROM? No time to think, i had to water the plants before i marinated my sirloins. At this point im too confused to do anything so I sit down and kill two birds with one stone. When i finished, i still hadn't seen what i looked like. I washed my hands and looked in the mirror. I see nothing different. Here I am in my boxers and i am looking down at my very heavy breasts. I look in the mirror and nothing is wrong. At this point, Kristy is at the door knocking like a mad woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry are you going to live in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit asking me and i might finish faster\" my voice was sooo strange to hear, I wonder if Kristy noticed. I don't  think she was paying attention because she said back, \"Ok, well hurry up. There's a teenage girl here who would like to get the day started.\" I put on my shirt from the hamper and got out of the bathroom. When Kristina saw me she just had a look of -oh wow you stink. I just looked at her. \"What?\" She asked, to which I answered, do I seem different today?\"</span></div></div>",

So you will never believe what happened to me today, i woke up in the wrong body. I know it sounds crazy but hear me out. Yesterday i went to sleep in my bed and this morning, i woke up as a completely different person. Her (yes her) name is Lisa Michaels. Apparently she is this insanely girly chick. Seriously, its like an issue of \"Teen Vogue\" exploded in her closet. Or is it my closet now. Anyway, since this is now my body and I assume that I'll be stuck like this for the rest of my life, i think it's time to make some changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa\" my new mom called, \"can yOH MY GOD! Lisa! What did you do to your beautiful hair? And what are you wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm transgender\" i say this hoping beyond all hope that my new parents are as open as my old parents. I was wearing a baggy black shirt without a bra, some boxers that were way too big and pants that were nearly falling off. All held up by one of Lisa's (my) least feminine black belt. All of this clothes came from my new brother's closet. Apparently, Joe had gone to college and visits every other month. Well, Joe's belt wouldn't fit so i had to bite the bullet somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo fastforward six months to my eighteenth birthday. The day is finally here when i can relive my life as Lewis. To my surprise, everyone in my new life were so supportive. Six agonizing months of hormones and avoiding the advances of unwanted company. I finally get to have my top and bottom surgery. Of course i will never look like the guy i was before the swap but i am willing to get past that to finally have my little friend back between my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so happy that it took a little longer than usual for the anesthesiologist to put me under but when i went to sleep it was as if i had all the world lifted from my shoulders. I had a short dream. I dreamed i met the old Lisa. We bonded over waking up in eachothers bodies and before i knew it, i woke up in my hospital room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good Lisa you're finally awake.\" My eyes shot open. My member is still missing and i have a bandage on my chest that seems to be lifted by flesh underneath. Once i get over that shock, i realize that the woman in the room is none other than my original mom. The only thing i can think of is that I'm back. That, and if Lisa ever finds me, she will probably kill me...</span></div></div>",

Or as it will be shortly, Agatha Yasmina Carpenter, Aggie for short. Aggie and her family found out about the swap after she learned from her doctor that she can't have children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to dwell on the things out of her control, the Carpenters did alot of research. Eventually found my birth certificate. They hopped on a plane and are just hours from meeting their \"new daughter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wouldn't really bother me as a good majority of my friends are swapped. My friend Jack/Erika (never met the real Erika) got the swaps when they were about 14 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat complicates things is learning that your new body has selective short term memory loss. That is added to the laundry list of things that are wrong with my swapmate but I'll get into that later. The primary (non hidden) reason is that with swaps comes an adverse effect to the short term memory loss. Full blown amnesia for everything leading to the initial swap. That means that the Rutherfords and the Carpenters will be living under one roof until they know the duration of the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis means that \"Nick\" will be teaching me who she use to be until i can remember who i really am as Nick. As a result, i have to teach her how to pass as me. I don't know if you know this but have you ever tried explaining something to a person who has a short attention span... i am practically yelling at myself. My only saving grace is that for the first swap i will be blissfully unaware, but i digress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Aggie and the family show up on my front porch. I cant believe how time flies. She's so different from me i think it will be obvious the next swap people will be able to tell who is who from a mile away. I try to formally introduce myself but was cut off when her dad says he has yet another reason for the premature visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward and it's the first day of the swap. And what do you know, I'm on Aggie's period. I know i said that she cant get pregnant. Well, that was the other bombshell from her then father and mine for the forseable future. \"New Nick\" comes in to the bathroom and i am freaking out. He tells me that i am on my period because though she cant have kids, i can in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, we found out how long the swap is. Its one whole week. Yep the duration of my period. At least i only have to worry about it until the next two swaps. Man I've sure got some explaining when my girlfriend Jennifer/David comes back from their vacations.</span></div></div>",

They were about as normal as any set of fraternal twins could be. Their mom, Beatrice, worked a small business from their garage while their dad, Rodney, spent his days working for a prestigious university specializing in Philosophy and ancient myths. One myth in particular was the arcane mythos of The Encantor. This really took a lot of his time but he always had time for his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning of their 16th birthday Hannah woke up with quite a shock. She had an abnormal desire to go to the bathroom. She emediately gets up and lifts the seat to pee. Only to find that for some reason her urine is going everywhere. When she notices this, she immediately turns to sit down and finish her business. When she is done she lifts her panties and heads back to her room without washing her hands, as she only went pee she didn't feel like waking everyone in the house with the water running. She went to bed confused as she stripped off her nightgown and went to sleep in only her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile. Hannah's stirring had awakened her brother by an ungodly smell. What didn't make much sense was that he felt naked as he didn't have anything to cover his chest. Taking his sheet to cover himself, he went to the hall to see what had caused his nose to suddenly lose all its function. As he stepped out he found his favorite nightgown in the doorway of his sisters room. Taking it off the floor it seemed a little small but his mom probably put it in the drier instead of hanging it to air dry like he always does after hand washing it. That could wait as he now had it he put it on to recover at least a semblence of modesty as he went back to his room and went back to sleep. Almost immediately, they simultaneously shot out of bed with so much confusion, their heads spun as they each realized they accidentally went to eachothers rooms.</span></div></div>",

I think i am getting ahead of myself, so lets start from the very beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Henry Leighton. I am 18 years old fresh out of high school. I was an all-American athlete. I played football and cheer, i was captain of the wrestling team, i ran short distance and long distance track and field, and i did gymnastics and ballet in the summer. I was also one of if not the best Shakespearean actor to grace the theatre of that school since the program opened. (Ask my drama teacher Mrs. Hayes, told the whole class i was her favorite). I graduated top of my class with honors as Valedictorian. I hope to one day become a doctor and cure every known disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know what you are thinking, \"Henry, that's a bit ambitious dont you think?\" I'll be the first one to tell you you are right but also wrong. You see, normal medicine cannot begin to come close to what i have in mind. Of course this goes against every rule They have ever taught me. Never reveal the true extent of miraculous events. In air quotes. They say it all the time but have no real power to actually stop me. Actually, that is how i was able to breeze through all those thirteen years of school. Did i forget to mention that magic is real. Yeah I'm a mage. Or at least i will be some day. It takes years of honing your skills and ability to become a mage. What i actually am is a demimage. This means that i have some control over my power and can use it sparingly without hurting myself. I am only one spell from being granted the title of mage. After that only one other person has ever become the strongest magic mage to exist, The Encantor. He died over three thousand years ago. Legend says he found a way to reincarnate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, as it is, i know from my many studies through my lifetime that a person is formed by their environment. This means that even if it were true, the Encantor would have no memories of his former self. You see, in the event of a reincarnation, as the person gets older, they will have bouts of D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. Over time they will start to remember but will pass it off as nothing but a dream. You may be asking yourself, \"How are you so knowledgeable about this?\" Well i can answer that, i have been studying the work of The Encantor since i was eight years old. It has been what has allowed me to stay so focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, back to the true focus of our narrative. You see, i was always a bit of a prankster growing up. Now i know what you have in mind, let me be the one to burst your bubble. I am not going to become a doctor to terrorize people, you sick bastard... sorry. I want to be a doctor so that i can unite the worlds of science and magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dont think it will go very far into the discovery but i have gotten pretty good at being subtle. My plan is to create potions that will alow small amounts of magic to permiate the body. I guess its good that im not that strong otherwise, or i might end up wiping out half of life as we know it... wow, am i lucky. Where was i, oh yeah, after i finish medical school, i am going to open a clinic with my best friend Helen. She is a nom, thats a non magical human for all of you noms out there. I told her about my magic about a year into our friendship. She was freaked out at first but then she warmed up to the idea of the mystic properties that surround us. It was actually her idea to fuse the magical with the scientific. Brilliant girl but she had to work hard to understand a lot of things.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It really helps to have support when you are going through school. Even more when you learn you're all on your own. When i graduated high school, my father thought it would be a good idea to set me up as a mail-order bride. He said to me, \"Hellhound,\" cause he thinks I'm... well, \"no daughter of mine's gonna go college!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe repeatedly told me, \"ya momma nev' wenna no college, my momma nev' wenna no college, yo granny wenta college and her pa almose kill her fo it. I re-peat college ain't no good fer no girls. You goin' git marred an git me an ya momma some granbabbies an ya cain' do dat fyou goin' git ejimicaded. Y'Auntie Lou Anne wen en got a de-gree an she ain give me no other kin folk. No Hel. You wanna got college, you git the 'el ouda here. Don let the door kiss yo ass ona way out. Befo ya go one mo thin. I ev' seeya gen, i' kiya\" Boy am i lucky my best friend is a mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was out of there and for a good six years, went couch surfing until i finally told Henry about my home situation. Man he was so P.O.ed that he nearly thought about killing him. (my dad, not himself) I proposed a small revenge. We would finish our MDs and open our clinic, then we would get our revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward and we finally did it. I am now proudly Dr. Helen Della Arlin, OBGYN. And my partner (nonsexual, seriously completely platonic come on guys he's like my brother) in crime (but not literally we are very ethical) Dr. Henry Alexander Leighton, GP. ( i swear your minds go straight to the gutters) Yup, I specialize in the Grand Canyon while he deals with Mount Everest. (or more often, Mount Wycheproof) *no offense to the Aussies out there. P.S. Steve Irwine is basically a god and will live on forever on my vhs oknowbacktothestorysorry* Anyway, the trap is almost set to finally get revenge on that POS of a father of mine. We thought it would be poetic justice to make my father see the error of his ways. I know, \"Come on Doc, what's the big plan?\" Right? Dont worry, I'm getting to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe synthesized a drug/potion to cure the common cold. Almost won the nobel for it... almost. Turns out while we were doing this, my dad's gender bender potion was mixed into the batch that was approved for mass production and emediate manditory distribution. Everyone on earth, everyone. Got swapped with the person they shared the strongest bond with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there you have it. Thus my life as Henry Leighton MD, the worlds worst mage. I lost his liscense and am now serving a three hundred year sentance for leaking magic to the world, while the new Helen is trying to find a way to fix the world. Seriously it was all an accident I swear!</span></div></div>",

Right now though it seems that i got thrusted into the body of my swap partner. Seeing this rope around our neck... thank the goddesses that she's safe in my body. Time to get rid of this and find out what's wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n24 hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up in my original bed with what looks like a letter from Titus. It reads<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Macie Danaher<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am writing this letter to you because of the situation i found us in shortly after the swap. Let me be the first to tell you that you are an important person. Man or woman, you can change the world. Though i do not share your need to be the opposite gender, i give you full rein of my body to be the man you were destine to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what i wanted to talk to you about. I saw the cuts. When i asked Mom about them she was in tears. Your old man is the single most evil thing to have ever walked the earth and i am glad we never have to see or hear from it ever again. Oh yeah, when we testify to the courts on Mom's behalf, tell them everything. I will keep you in the know in this same way but i want to get a diary so it doesn't look suspicious. Lets keep in contact because i know with the phones out of the question, we still have a way to keep eachother safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Partner,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitus</span></div></div>",

Thought of in the past as a disturbance in the flow of nature, or a scientific experiment gone wrong on the genetic level, it is in fact a magical curse inflicted on one member of each family. Each of the opposite gender. In the future SBSS has become something of a regular event. So regular in fact that it is found to be linked to birth. Scientists and Mages have found that when two people are born at the same exact time, their bodies are linked together. When either person reaches a certain event in their life, the cycle begins. The duration of the event depends on the strength (or weakness) of the connection.</td>",
