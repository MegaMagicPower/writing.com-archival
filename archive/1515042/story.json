Haruhi Suzumiya, the school eccentric, leader of the SOS Brigade, and the cause of all my problems since we started up at this school. <br>\r\nIt was the first day back after break, and now that we were sophomores, Haruhi thought it was time we got a little more freedom, regardless of the fact we have our own clubroom. Although, I was curious to see if they would have changed anything while we were gone. I didn't have long to think on that, as Haruhi kicked down the door and threw me in. <br>\r\n\"Ow! watch it!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh relax. wow, they didn\u2019t touch this place at all! :)\"<br>\r\n\"ya, I can tell...\" I said, running my fingers over the table, pulling up a fine layer of dust. There was one thing missing though:<br>\r\n\"Hang on...where\u2019s Nagato?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm?...oh, she's not here?\" typical Haruhi. I'm sometimes unsure whether she actually knows that Nagato is one of the club members. <br>\r\nYuki Nagato, a complete stoic, usually reading some book or another. She rarely speaks around Haruhi, and its almost always in a monotone. When Haruhi isn't around however, she talks at length, usually to me, about how important sticking around is to her mission. <br>\r\nSee...Nagato's an...alien? Robot? I don\u2019t know anymore. The point is, she isn\u2019t human. She's here to study Haruhi, make sure there\u2019s no change to \"the flow of data.\" More on that later....<br>\r\nHaruhi herself was sitting at her computer, typing away. I assumed she was on our website, updating it or something. That\u2019s all she ever does on that thing, as far as I know.<br>\r\nAs I was sitting at my seat, the door opened, and...</span></div></div>",

I want tea!!\"<br>\r\nMikuru Asahina. She\u2019s very beautiful, but don\u2019t let Haruhi hear you say that. She has a lovely figure, beautiful long red hair, and a smile that would make anyone who saw it fall in love. I have a bit of a thing for Miss Asahina, but several people said I should give up on that. That would be: Her, Koizumi, Nagato, Member\u2019s of Koizumi's group, and Mrs. Asahina. *Sigh*, I cant catch a break. <br>\r\nMiss Asahina looked at me and blushed, my cue to leave the room so she could change. Haruhi had bought several different outfits for her to cosplay in. These included a maid, a nurse, a bunny suit...you get the idea. <br>\r\nMiss Asahina is also watching Haruhi, but for slightly different reasons. Dont worry, she's human, she\u2019s just not from this time plane. She is from the future, and her people constantly traveled back in time to observe events as they took place, for history reasons. However, Haruhi put a stop to that, completely on accident. <br>\r\nAs i was sitting in the hall reflecting on my talks with Nagato and Miss Asahina, the last official member of our club arrived.<br>\r\n\"Morning Kyon.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey Koizumi. what\u2019s up?\"<br>\r\n\"a few things, but they can wait. Mikuru changing again huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep...first day back, and Haruhi's running the show yet again.\"<br>\r\n\"well what do you expect?\" he said, that damn smile on his face again. Unlike Miss Asahina and Nagato, I don\u2019t particularly like Koizumi, although he has told me more than anyone else. I closed my eyes and sighed, and looked back to see a serious look on his face.<br>\r\n\"we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n\"now?\"<br>\r\n\"sooner the better. either we should talk now, or later after Ms. Suzumiya leaves.\"</span></div></div>",

This shouldn\u2019t take long.\"<br>\r\nI followed him outside, to the table we normally sit at to talk. The day was nice and sunny, but the air fell strangely heavy. <br>\r\n\"you can feel it, cant you?\"<br>\r\n\"that air?\"<br>\r\n\"yes. That\u2019s because we are literally on the edge of a closed space.\"<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me!\" Closed spaces were little pocket dimensions that house very large destructive monsters. The more destruction, the large the closed space gets. Koizumi fights these things along with other members of his organization. This is because he's an Esper. Esper's are basically normal humans with psychic abilities, although Koizumi can only use his power inside a closed space. <br>\r\n\"I'm not. normally, we would fight it off before it enveloped the school, but there\u2019s a rather large problem in the way...Miss Suzumiya.\"<br>\r\n\"what\u2019s going on?\"<br>\r\n\"The limit to the closed space is right next to the building our club room is in. The problem is, the space is just small enough that fighting off what\u2019s in there will allow the closed space to shatter. When that happens, Miss Suzumiya will notice us, or at least the space shattering. <br>\r\nThen there\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s right next to it. if the closed space gets big enough to absorb her...well, we don\u2019t want that to happen at any rate.\"<br>\r\n\"Why tell me?! What can I do?\" I regretted asking the question the second it was out of my mouth. <br>\r\n\"You have two options really. Either distract her so we can take the thing out and she wont notice, or drag her away somewhere. Either way, we need to act fast.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Head up there, we'll do what we can to close the space as quickly as possible.\"<br>\r\n\"Damn it Koizumi!\" I said, taking off at a run. With speed I havent had since I had to catch a baseball last year, i raced up to the club room, making it there within a vouple minutes.

I ran up to her computer, and spun it around, grabbing the keyboard. Then I saw what site she was on.<br>\r\n\"Haruhi...what\u2019s this?\" she blushed horribly, then she got pissed.<br>\r\n\"WHAT ARE YOU THINKING!?\" her voice was loud and shrill, like a banshee about to eat my soul. Not surprising...I was looking at a website that I was not expecting in the least. <br>\r\nBBW PARADISE was shining in big letters. There were pictures of large fat women everywhere. <br>\r\n\"why are you here?\"<br>\r\n\"just...homework!\" the lie wasn\u2019t convincing.<br>\r\n\"Haruhi...you like fat people?\"<br>\r\nbusted, her face flushed a deep crimson. she looked towards the cowering bunny, then over to Nagato, who I had missed running in. \"not people...just women...\"<br>\r\nI was stunned. Behind her head, the clouds shifted, and Koizumi landed on the school roof. My job was done; But now, I had a bigger problem. </span></div></div>",

I had to stay late with a teacher. Hmm? Did I miss somthing?\"<br>\r\nHaruhi stood up, grabbed her bag, and walked out. Koizumi looked at me, but didn't say anything. I left then, so Miss Asahina could change. When she finished and left, I went back to grab my bag. <br>\r\n\"Kyon. Don\u2019t delve to deeply into this. The Data Integration Thought Entity wishes to make sure nothing is changed.\"<br>\r\n\"How long has she been looking at those sites for?\"<br>\r\n\"Approximately 278 earth days.\"<br>\r\nthat would have put it right after we grabbed Koizumi for the club. \"That\u2019s a long time.

I had originally only wanted to check it out to see what the draw was. After an hour or so of looking, I was stunned. Not at how much material there was...but more so how I seemed to like it.

Her already larger then average breasts were overflowing out of her suit, her stockings ripped to shreds buy her now massive thighs. Her belly was protruding almost a foot in front of her, and her ass had expanded to astronomical proportions. <br>\r\nI took it all in, but had to blink again.

You can't find out your lord and master secretly dreams of bllimping up larger than your typical zeppelin and not feel a tad awkward about it. Still, to say it was my biggest concern would also be a lie. I have a life, and I had other concerns. Though, that being said, I did notice a few odd trends in Haruhi's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrend number one, her long walks seemed to be growing shorter and shorter. Usually she'd parade across the entire school at lunch, but now she seemed to be spending more time eating, and less time wandering. Whether the restriction of movement was caused by her taking up more time to eat or she didn't walk as much to have time to eat remained to be seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrend number two, a bag of candy every day. I'd have to clean out the trash, and every time I did, I'd always happen to spill a wrapper or two on the ground. I'd always pick it up, and notice how shockingly clean it was. The thing was wrapped up alongside dark, crumbling chocolate, but you couldn't tell that at all judging by how white and pristine it looked. Haruhi clearly wanted to nibble on every last crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrend number three, every day after the club was adjorned, she'd stay behind. For awhile, I choose to ignore this fact, but eventually I grew curious. I didn't want to look to see what she did, per say. I was not--am not--a stalker. Still, i did know someone who did know. So, when I finally mustered up the courage to ask Yuki, her response lacked the same effect that catching Haruhi red-handed would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She masturbates to images of fat women,\" Yuki said, simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...that's charming...\" Kyon replied, frowning, \"I guess I kinda saw it coming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing serious. Sexual arousal brings her pleasure, so it's logical she'd pursue her joy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's also kind of disturbing, considering the fact we go in that room every day. I mean, seriously, it's a little strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you seemed to encourage her behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That was just to--were you watching that, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few weeks, though, this behavior started to have an impact on my fearless leader.</span></div></div>",

Yuki was playing on her laptop, Koizumi was playing a board game with Kyon, and Mikuru was busy making tea.  Haruhi was on her computer, as she usually was nowadays.  The only thing that was noticeably different about her was a slightly bigger body - she had gained about 15 pounds or so in the short timeframe she'd been doing this.  She wasn't as large as she was hoping to get, but progress was progress, no matter how small.  Her thighs and arms were slightly chubbier, and her belly was beginning to push against her uniform.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru had noticed their leader's slight increase in size; however, she remained silent about it. Knowing Haruhi, if Mikuru did mention it to her, she might decide to begin forcing her to gain too.  Far better, she reasoned, to keep safe by keeping quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was pleased with what little progress she had made, she couldnt help but feel a little disappointed.  She knew that things like this took time, but she couldn't help getting a little impatient about it.  Thats why, instead of her usual routine of masturbating or looking on BBW sites, she was looking for tips on gaining weight online.  With the great wealth of information online, she reasoned, there would surely be a useful recipe she could use, or an eating or some type of technique she could do to help her gain a little quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as she had found out, that wasn't the case.

Kyon glanced over at the other members, Koizumi smiling a broad, stupid grin as he always did. Yuki seemed apathetic, but Mikuru was filled with fear for Kyon. The parting glance she gave him resembled that of a wife watching her husband walking off to the gallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow bad could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyon, listen, we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got that from the first thing you said. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know any way to get fat fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon couldn't help but crack up at this. His laughter ran throughout his entire body as he nearly doubled over. Haruhi's face turned a slight shade of red, but not the bashful embarrassed red so much as the pissed off, murderous red that Kyon commonly associated with pain. Indeed, his laughter died in his throat as Haruhi bashed her still hard as rock knuckles against the crown of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, have you considered just eating a lot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow. I want it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, look, Haruhi, there's no healthy way to get fat that quickly. You can try implant surgery, but that's unhealthy, or maybe weight gain powder that muscle builders use, but who knows how that actually works. Look, the fact is that it isn't very healthy to get so big in the first place, so why--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about health! I just want it now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'll do some research on it if you want, but I think you might need to reconsider. You might end up with heart disease or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to say 'I don't care' before it sinks in? Geez, and you're supposed to be smart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why didn't you just ask Yuki? She'd give you an answer like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi twirled a lock of her hair around her finger, in a lazy sort of way. \"Because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because!

If he wasnt able to find a way to help Haruhi gain some weight, then there's no telling what she'd do to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nkyon looked online for a method, but the same lack of information that plagued Haruhi met Kyon.  After half an hour of searching, Kyon gave up on the Internet.  <br>\r\nIt was impossible, he thought.  Suzumiya was wanting results which were highly improbable for her, in her current situation.  She wanted to gain weight fast - she was probably hoping to see noticeable visual changes within a month.  That wasn't possible to do on her own!  ...well, sure she could alter reality, but that was only subconsiously; she couldn't just wish for something.<br>\r\n<i>If only there was some sort of loophole, </i>Kyon wondered. <i> We need something like a miracle pill, or maybe a-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was then that Kyon got a wonderfully subtle idea.  An idea so amazingly simple, so hilariously obvious, so mind-bogglingly ridiculous to believe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...that it was perfect.<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nKyon casually walked into the clubroom early that day.  Haruhi was there waiting for him; he noticed that she was still wearing her old school uniform, even though it was fitting a bit snugly on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your late!\" Haruhi said, turning towards Kyon threateningly.  \"What do you have to say for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon walked over, and handed her a small, round container.  She looked at it, and saw a label that read \"Appetite-pill\".  \"What the heck is this?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A weight gain pill,\" Kyon said.  \"The whole idea is that it increases your appetite, so you want to eat more and not feel full for much longer.  If you take this once a day, and still do the normal things you were doing to gain weight, then you'll easily gain about 40 pounds a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi stared in disbelief at the bottle.  \"...you're serious?\"  she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Kyon answered.  \"Just keep snacking like you have been, and it'll work fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi gave Kyon...a hug.  It was so unexpected, it caught him completely off-guard.  \"At last, you finally came through!\"  she said happily.<br>\r\n<i>Oh, sure, like I've been no help when you locked us in that closed space? </i> he thought to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two left for classes, Kyon allowed himself a sneaky little smile.  <i>Let's see if my little idea works...</i></span></div></div>",

He could see her eyes working out the proper course of action before she said, at long last, \"Fine, but you're paying for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival at the food establishment, in reality a buffet, Kyon's sister holding her big brother's hand with a laugh on her lips, Haruhi decided to exploit Kyon and Mikuru further by forcing them to pay for HER food. Kyon's teeth were grinding by the time they reached their booth, Kyon tucked between his sister and the voluptuous Mikuru. Yuki was reading a book, almost bored looking, while Koizumi and Haruhi exchanged rather energetic words on the nature of the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, of course, before Haruhi grabbed her first plate of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon noticed her pop a pill in her mouth before eating. She was expressionless for a moment or two, before her stomach began to growl. She clutched her pudgy belly before her eyes watered. \"No, this worked better than expected,\" Haruhi moaned, eyes twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Mikuru asked as Haruhi began to dig into her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikuru, gimme another plate when you get up for more food,\" Haruhi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bunny suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a subtle threat lead Mikuru out of her seat to grab herself and Haruhi a plate of food...again...and again...and again...By the end of it, the two were stuffed to the point of bloating, and, while Mikuru gingerly rubbed her bloated belly in pain, Haruhi looked somehow elated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strangely erotic...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month passed since Kyon had given Haruhi the pills.  Kyon entered the club room for another day of absurdity.  He looked around, observing the changes he had seen over the weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato still sat in her corner, but now she was on her laptop.  When asked, she said that she was curious about certain strategy games she had heard about; this time, she was playing the first of the Starcraft games, having finished with the human missions yesterday.  Today she began playing the Zerg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi was trying to sort out why these changes were happening.  Kyon thought to himself, perhaps I'll have to tell koizumi about this, so that he won't get the wrong ideas.  He was lost in thought, sitting at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru was in her maid outfit, as usual.  However, having to serve Haruhi's hunger was beginning to affect her, as well.  Now, she had a slight pot-belly to her, which was straining against her maid outfit.  This, oddly enough, had a strange appeal to Kyon; whether it was the sight of her fat held up in such a tight outfit or if it was simply because it was Mikuru was unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi had seen the biggest changes, no pun intended.  She had swelled up, in the short month she had been gaining.  She now had an extra forty pounds of fat on her - a total of 55 pounds since she first began.  Her potbelly was now more fleshed out, and beneath her shirt, she had an actual fat roll on her hips.  Her love handles had grown outwards, too, as well as her tummy, all of which were now beginning to overflow her skirt.  Her thighs  had fattened up, as well; they jiggled with each step, along with her stomach.  Her arms had plumped up, too, and little stretch marks were visible on them, as well as on her tummy.  She was slightly embarrassed of these stretch marks, so she had begun to wear bigger shirts to cover them up.  <br>\r\nHer habits had also changed.  She had now limited her walks around school to once every three days, and even then, she had to take regular rests when she was.  She was easily eating twice as much food during lunch, and had often taken to having the brigade order out meals for her to snack on, like pizza or buckets of chicken.  At the moment, she was stuffing herself with some chicken and pizza, and drinking a large glass of soda.  Her level of activity had dropped, and she spent more time sitting down, whether it was on CPU or brigade meetings.<br>\r\nAnd of course, she had been taking Kyons \"pills\".  She was very pleased with them - whenever she swallowed one, she felt hungry, and seemed to be able to fit just a little more food inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon sat down, and got out a textbook to study.  He'd been using this time to not only study for school, but also about psychology.  He was now convinced that he could make Haruhi convinced of the pills' \"powers\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while... </span></div></div>",

On an instinctual level, what do all human beings crave and desire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, food? Shelter? A mate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Now, I am aware many men look at inner beauty as opposed to outer beauty, but, for the most part, Haruhi's body is unattractive to the masses now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say that. a lot of guys still think she's hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about when she's too big for a size 30 dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, I don't think it'll get that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe not, but regardless, Haruhi knows that there are people who like chubbier women.

Which means that every single woman in this world will try to become obese. Imagine the health crisis that'll trigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon was silent for a moment before saying, shaking his head, \"That's a possibility, but I doubt it'd get that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not, but we need to be prepared for any circumstance.

Nothing major occurred anywhere during school hours, no major outbursts of spontaneity by Haruhi, no kinds of cataclysmic threats, nothing at all. All that filled the time was the odd clack of feet on the floor and the rhythmic munching of treats between teeth by the club's leader. At the clubroom, everything seemed rather bland....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a different story was told during the later hours of the day. Every time after school, Kyon found himself in the path of Miss Suzumiya. This led to the inevitable conversation which would soon lead to an outing of sorts for the two. Everytime, Haruhi would spy her eagle eyes to an establishment that served food, which prompted the girl to drag Kyon along to check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day it was something different. One time she'd go to a Chinese place, the next would be an Italian. The rambunctious girl seemed intent on trying foods from all different nations, which always made her tastebuds tingle. While most of the time these outings were just Haruhi gorging herself while Kyon watched then paid for the feast, the young man did feel that things between him and Haruhi were getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one day though, things took a slightly different turn. As per usual, Haruhi bounded up to Kyon after the school bells rang, her flabby body jiggling all the while. They walked and talked, but this was followed by a rather strange comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....usually I've found some place to eat at this point....\" The schoolgirl put her hand to her chin as she thought. \"Maybe I've tried all the places in this district or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon spoke up. \"It's possible; you've been eating a lot around here lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If so, we'll need to find somewhere new to find food.\" This was followed by a huge grin appearing on Haruhi's face. \"Kyon, you think of somewhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken a bit of guard by this suggestion, Kyon searched his brainwaves for an easy solution. \"Well...um...a...I think...\" A spark zapped in his mind. \"American! You've tried fried chicken before, so maybe there's some more you'll enjoy.\" Internally, Kyon gasped in relief of getting an answer out as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi processed this for a moment, then beamed again. \"Oh yeah, good idea Kyon! You're always good at suggesting stuff! Now what kind of American place....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Kyon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could go somewhere super cheap like the local WcDonalds....or we could go to a proper American restaurant.

Those were the thoughts that swam around the head of Kyon, high school student and eternal straight man for the SOS Brigade. Trudging his way into the school grounds, he thought about what kind of zany scheme or problem that would end up occurring today. Whether it was the smallest plan or the largest \"End of the world as we know it\" catastrophe, the (Mostly) cynical teenager knew he would need to put his brave face on and sort it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes he wished that the brigade's leader, one Miss Haruhi Suzumiya, had never taken interest in him and forced him along into her mind boggling trains of thought or anything that involved her reality warping abilities she always subconsciously activated at the worst possible moments for the worst possible reasons. Then again, Kyon thought to the many times he (Along with the help of some other brigade members) managed to stop Haruhi's accidental universal antics before she ended up destroying or warping something at a cataclysmic scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high school student had been thinking so intently about his regrets and realisations that he almost passed the SOS brigade's clubroom door, which he was now standing in front of.

While he was unable to recognize who this mystery person was, due to the blinding morning sunrise shining into his eyes, he soon realised who the person was. The figure in the room jumped in surprise as the door opened, causing a clatter of what Kyon assumed to be plates and utensils. After finding out the person's true identity, a warm smile appeared on his face and a sense of relief washed across him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the female variant of the school's resident uniform, stood Mikuru Asahina, a fellow SOS brigade member and official mascot for the strange group. While Kyon was just a regular teenager, Mikuru was far more than regular. An certified time traveller from an unspecified time in the future, Mikuru had came to the present day to investigate a strange occurrence regarding the very fabric of time, having the suspicion that the brigade's feisty leader, Haruhi, had something to do with it. Quickly turning around to see who had entered the door, the redhead's reaction was similar to Kyon's, after finding out who had joined her in the cold meeting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...hello Kyon! It's nice to....see you this morning.\" Mikuru, despite knowing she was in good hands with Kyon, was still a little shaky from the startle he had given her recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mikuru, good to see you too.\" Kyon replied, simply and smartly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a quick glance across the club room, Kyon noticed that everything was in order at his present location. Only one thing struck him as odd after he examination of his surroundings, something extremely odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato wasn't here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki Nagato, the former Literature club member and artificial robot alien sent to examine the exploits of Haruhi, was not present in the club room. Almost every time she was the first to arrive, usually reading a book which she would have taken interest in. Instead, the chair in the corner of the room which normally housed the alien being was alone and empty for a change. Seeing no sense in passing it up, Kyon asked his fellow brigade member about the absence of their monotone friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you don't happen to know where Nagato is, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Kyon, I haven't seen her this morning at all. The club room was empty when I got here.\" Mikuru had recovered from her shock earlier in the morning and was now speak clearer and more fluently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kyon could reply back with a standard \"Oh, okay then\", the time traveller jerked forward and interjecting another response for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I almost forgot! Nagato came up to me yesterday and asked me to make her some pastries for her to eat. In fact, that's the whole reason I came here early today. Maybe her absence has something to do with that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsorbing the information, Kyon thought carefully about what Mikuru had just told him. \"Nagato asking for food? Not something she would do normally, but something she would still do none the less. But still, asking Mikuru personally for some and then not showing up first in the club room is quite strange for her. Maybe the two instances have a connection...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to question the thoughts in his mind, the train of thought he had going was abruptly ended by the sound of an opening door, no doubt meaning the arrival of another SOS member.

The main cause of any and all problems the SOS members had to endure, the girl possessed a multitude of powers right under her nose. To date, the cunning and crafty brigade leader still had no idea what kind of powers she had inside her. With a large grin and a bag in her hand, the leader stomped into the club room and slammed her hand onto the table nearest to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!

I'll have you know, I was busy with an errand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brainwave flowed through the mind of Kyon, prompting him to ask Haruhi a question. \"What kind of errand did you have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much. Yuki wanted me to get her some snacks for her. She gave me the Yen to buy it all, so I didn't see any reason not to help her.\" Haruhi replied, shaking the bag she held for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon thought about the errand Haruhi had been bestowed with.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The face of the next person to enter the SOS club room belonged to the other male SOS member, Itsuki Koizumi. Just like Mikuru and Nagato, Koizumi was also involved with strange out of this world activity that had something to do involving the colourful SOS leader Haruhi. He was an Esper, a powerful being that was specifically tasked with the job of taking care of closed space, a strange pocket dimension that was usually created due to intense emotions stirred up with Miss Suzumiya. A smart, cool headed fellow, he entered the club room with his familiar smile and calm tone. He appeared to be holding a plastic container, which seemed to hold some kind of meal. Kyon didn't even bother wondering who it could be for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why good morning everyone, it is a pleasure to see you all.\" Koizumi took a brief look around before speaking again. \"It would seem that Nagato has yet to arrive here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I noticed that too.\" Haruhi interjected \"It's not like her to be the last one here, she'd usually just be reading some book on that old chair of hers.\" Haruhi gestured towards the chair Nagato commonly sat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd better hurry up, or she'll be late!\" Mikuru added with a slightly worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon took a look at the clock on the wall. 8:25AM. \"She's right, it's getting really close to the start of school. The bell is going to ring any minute now.\" Kyon sat down and took a look at all the different foods each member had presented for the currently absent alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru had whipped up a various assortment of cookies, cakes and donuts for Nagato. Each one she had made was either dashed with sugar or covered in a drizzle of chocolate. Steam was still visible from the food and the sauces on the treats gradually oozed onto the plate they were presented on. While he was a fan of her tea rather than her cooking, Kyon pondered on whether he should ask Mikuru for one before Nagato got to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering into Haruhi's bag, he saw a collection of candy bars, potato chips and many other packaged foods which would never qualify as \"Healthy\" by even the most inept food critic. Kyon soon thought whether this was just an exception due to Nagato's request or if this sort of food was what Haruhi bought herself usually. While he doubted his judgement, he then though of the SOS leader eating all the food but then burning the calories off due to her hyper activity and sports she was fond of doing. Realising he was going nowhere with his speculations, he dropped the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouzumi's container had a rather colourful and rich curry inside, with all the bulls and whistles. Chicken, Tomatoes, Peppers, Onions, Carrots, and Rice were all present inside the meal's boxed sanctuary. It looked home-made, which made Kyon question if Koizumi actually made it or if he just got Mori, a fellow Esper whom he had met before, to make it for him. Kyon stopped himself before he got carried way, but was soon disturbed again by the ringing of a bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rung, Kyon and the rest of the SOS brigade members noticed that....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While everything seemed fine, things seem different about her. That was then it hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurrounded by plastic wrappers and other packaging, Nagato had seemingly devoured every morsel there was inside the clubroom. Even now, she was still working on some of Mikuru's pastries she had made for the alien. A donut was in her hand, with a sizeable bite mark in it as Nagato chewed the bitten parts of the donut. Looking at her more intently, Kyon then noticed she looked very strange right now. Her face had gained a roundness to it, her cheeks puffing out even when she wasn't chewing. A double chin was developing on her face, with her first chin becoming more defined inside her chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts had grown by a noticeable amount, but they did not expand too much. While they had outgrown Haruhi's size, they were still rivalled by Mikuru's massive mammaries. Despite this, they still strained the fabric on her school uniform, pressing hard against the clearly too tight clothing she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato's stomach had swelled by a large amount. Jutting outwards and resting on her lap, the belly just barely overflowed past her lap and over her knees, but just barely. The bottom of her breasts brushed against the top of her expansive stomach, causing them to sometimes bump into each other if Nagato moved too much. Her clothes had given up early on, allowing her belly to push past the shirt so it could ride upwards like a mountian climber tackling a hill. Most of her stomach, including her deep navel, were all on display at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs and butt were also fairly sizeable, but were hard to see in her position. Her thighs had grown to the point where they just barely fit on her chair, very flabby and very jiggly. Her rear end was also noticeable, her skirt failing to keep it under wraps while she sat. The fat on her butt oozed on the chair, spreading further than her thighs were at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last morsel of donut passed her mouth, Nagato had finished every bit of food in the room. Noticing her fellow SOS member inside the clubroom, Nagato turned to the dumbstruck Kyon and simply said \"Hello\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon, still confused at the sight he saw before him, went and......</span></div></div>",

Her breasts had stopped pressing against the fabric but her belly still refused to let the clothing cover it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body has a storage of mem...\" Nagato started before Kyon cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you take your top off, please tell me that first!\" Kyon was calming down, almost back to his regular tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shirt was tight on my chest. It is more comfortable this way.\" Nagato said as she started to stroke her stomach again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, now can you tell me what you are doing?\" Kyon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body had a storage of memory which I have been using to record and hold data regarding Haruhi Suzumiya. As of Sunday last week, every type of memory stored in my body has been nearing their limits. Without any memory, I will be unable to record any data regarding Haruhi Suzumiya. This will mean I will be unable to store any new information on Haruhi Suzumiya or any developments that occur with her. This could prove disastrous if another large scale incident were to happen, as I will be unable to stop Haruhi Suzumiya's powers due to my lack of data about them at the time of the incident. If I am to gain more memory so it can be used to record data on Haruhi Suzumiya, I need to increase my body size in any way possible so that more memory can be available for use in my body so that I may record data on Haruhi Suzumiya. According to my data on expansion of the human body, gaining weight through means of food consumption is the most effective way to increase my body size. I have been aspiring to consume food until I have reached a size that will be able to hold enough memory so that the limits on them will not be at a critical level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to make out everything Nagato just said, Kyon nodded his head and asked \"Well, can't you just call up the data entity and request another robot to help get data?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a possibilty\" Nagato replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why not just do that?\" Kyon seemed a little frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the only spare Humanoid Interface that is current available at this moment in time is Ryoko Asakura\" Nagato stopped stroking again, putting her arms under the belly and on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name brought back a cold reminder that sent a chill down Kyon's spine. The rouge alien that tried to kill Kyon in the past, as well as lay a pretty harsh beating on Nagato, was the last thing he wanted to deal with right now. Kyon nodded quickly. \"Yeah, yeah, I see why you wouldn't. Just let me ask, have you told anyone else your plan?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What plan?\" a voice from the doorway had flown into the room, over hearing Kyon's question.

A split second after seeing the strange sight, Haruhi's mouth crept into a smile, then a grin, until it had reached a full fledged look of pure glee. Her eyes widened and her eyebrows shifted into a devious position, making Haruhi look like she was an evil mastermind ready to hatch her dastardly plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho, I know just what kind of plan you're talking about Kyon.....\" The chief of the brigade put her hands on her hips, tilting her body sideways as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?....I mean, you do!?!\" Kyon was completely lost at this point, having no idea what was happening at the present time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a chubby chaser!\" Haruhi pointed a slender finger at Kyon, making sure it was right in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?\" Kyon tumbled back and fell off his chair in complete confusion at Haruhi's sudden deduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is a chubby chaser?\" Nagato asked in her usual tone, seemingly unaffected by the statement the brigade leader had claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chubby chasers like girls with a nice plump gut!\" Haruhi walked up to Nagato and slapped her sizeable belly for an example. The hand movement caused it to jiggle around widely. \"Kyon, you sly dog you! Tricking poor Yuki into your crazy fetishistic desires! She must have been so embarrassed asking me and the others to make food for her, not to mention buying some herself! You could have at least had the decency to get the food yourself Kyon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from his fall, Kyon got back up and hastily defended himself \"No no no! It's not that way at all! I have nothing to do with this! I don't even like big girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not like large girls?\" Nagato questioned Kyon, her hands back onto her large tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, wait, I mean.....I do like YOU Nagato, it's just I don't.....prefer them, that's all. I mean, like, in the ways of a girl I would date, like that!\" Kyon was practically spluttering his words at this point, trying to find a balance between confirming Haruhi's suspicions and offending Nagato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that how it is? Maybe we should ask Yuki about it then.....\" Haruhi's smile had turned into a sly smirk. Kyon could tell Haruhi was loving every second of this awkward encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to Nagato, she put her hand on her belly again and asked her \"Yuki, is it true that Kyon did not put you up to....this?\" She patted the titanic tummy to show what she was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Kyon did not ask me to eat the food.\" Nagato replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having her suspicion shot down, Haruhi kept her sly look, simply walking out of the room with a casual strut. \"Okay then, if that is what you say. But do keep in mind that I will be keeping a sharp eye on you Kyon. I know at some point you'll admit you want to make Yuki your little stuffed piggy....\" Haruhi said as she closed the clubroom door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure Haruhi was well and truly gone before he moved, Kyon breathed a heavy sigh and said \"Thank god that went smoothly. One wrong move and she would have spread it around the school, or worse....\" Kyon dreaded to think what would have happened if Haruhi were to think he was into this sort of thing. Images of Haruhi and Mikuru both morbidly obese flashed in his mind, but he soon blotted them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well. Haruhi Suzumiya does not see the concept of being overweight as positive at this moment in time.\" Nagato had gotten up and had put her school top back on, making sure it was looser than it was previously, allowing her breasts to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good. Thanks Nagato.\" Hearing Nagato give a compliment felt oddly rewarding for Kyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her books and school bag, Nagato approached Kyon and asked \"I plan to have a second meal today at my apartment. I may require assistance to carry the necessary amount of ingredients for my planned meal. Would you like to assist me in my preparations for the meal? You may have some of the meal if you do so wish to assist me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon gave this some thought \"It would be nice to unwind with someone I can trust after the ordeal with Haruhi. A free meal doesn't sound too bad either. Still, I really should do my homework, and my sister might end up worrying if I'm gone too long.\" Coming to a decision, he replied.....</span></div></div>",

While she had loosened the top, as so to save her breasts from discomfort, her large belly was still hanging out, the shirt being unable to even attempt to cover up the globular stomach. Now that she was standing, Nagato's belly drooped slightly over the waistband on her skirt, causing the navel to point downwards to the floor. While he was on the subject of appearance, it dawned on Kyon's mind that her skirt might also be a problem, as while it was doing fine at the moment, there was no telling if Nagato's butt would swell up later tonight and put itself on display without her realising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nagato doesn't seem to care about her clothing unless it hurts her, but that doesn't mean she can simply let herself open for ridicule or god forbid, perversion.\" Kyon thought, while picturing people pointing and laughing at Nagato's gut, while a creepy man follows behind to get a good view of her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nagato!

Finishing his sentence, Kyon asked \".....go shopping for some clothes first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato looked down at her bare belly, picking up the bottom of her shirt to compare the sizes of it and her stomach. She then replied \"Why should we purchase new clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just not very decent to go around with your body exposed like that.\" Kyon explained, trying to smarten up his wording to avoid accidentally offending Nagato again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another look down at her gut, Nagato looked back up and replied \"Okay then. Let us purchase some clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they departed, Kyon took off his school jacket and (with a little difficulty) managed to cover up Nagato's belly with it. While there was a noticeable bump in the jacket, it was better than just letting her go out with her stomach bare. \"At least it'll make her look more pregnant than fat.\" Kyon thought. \"Wait, would that be better or worse?\" Teen pregnancy wasn't exactly the thing most people saw as good, but after the day he was having, Kyon was too tired to care. He just wanted Nagato dressed properly so he could get his eventual meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so later.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some searching and trying clothes on, Nagato left the store properly dressed, with nothing being exposed. While Kyon and Nagato got a few funny looks due to the bump in the jacket she wore, they got to the nearest clothing store smoothly. Nagato hadn't been too picky either, simply taking clothes, trying them on, and saying whether they fit well on herself. Kyon actually believed that this trip was the fastest clothes shopping trip he had ever been at with a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato was now wearing a dark green turtleneck ,which fit snugly around her body. Her breasts were steady and unstrained, the clothing she had chose making the curve of the breasts quite defined. Her belly had been covered nicely under the turtleneck, no longer bulging as much as it had earlier, no doubt due to the effects of digestion. Nagato had also bought a pair of simple blue jeans as well. Like the turtleneck, they were a close fit on her body, giving her rear a shapely look when she wore them. While not the best choice for not drawing attention to her butt, it was better than having a small skirt like earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her choices, Nagato said \"Now we must purchase our ingredients for the meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon and Nagato headed for the nearest convenience, grabbing a basket each. With no real idea what Nagato had planned, Kyon  had to follow her around the store, taking whatever she gave him and putting it into his basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the baskets started to fill up, mostly with things like cheese, tomatoes, various assortments of meat and peppers, along with some flour and milk. With the vastly increasing ingredients in the baskets, Kyon felt compelled to ask a question. Going up to Nagato, he asked her.....</span></div></div>",

Kyon simply sighed and followed the hungry girl, helping her choose some after meal snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a hefty sum of money to pay and a weighty amount of foods to carry, Kyon and Nagato eventually made it to her humble apartment, a sight which had became common place for Kyon. Going into the elevator (Nagato did not want to take the stairs), they entered her room, where instantly Nagato dropped the plastic bags of food onto her kitchen counter and began to gather the equipment for cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, where can I start?\" Kyon asked, with a tone and look of confusion due to the many different types of food on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato, with a rolling pin in hand, said \"Yes, you can. Start grating the mature cheddar cheese.\" She passed a grater to Kyon and soon busied herself with making the pizza base. Kyon fished around the many cheeses Nagato had bought and soon found the cheddar cheese, which he began to grate over a sizeable bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a feeling this is going to take a long time........\" Kyon groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the sweat from his brow, Kyon brought his attention to the beeping oven, which was now signalling that the pizza he and Nagato had slaved over was finally ready for eating. With a pair of red oven gloves, Nagato lifted the massive pizza out of the oven and placed it on a chopping board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon was surprised the pizza had managed to fit into the oven, as it measured at 30 full inches. The top of pizza was blotted out by the ridiculous amount of toppings that were present, including chicken, beef, pork, gammon, lamb, as well as the yellow and red bell peppers which had been diced and sliced. Cheese oozed from the stuffed crusts, bubbling with the intense heat of the oven still radiating from the gooey filling. Tomato sauces dribbled over the edges, the physical tomatoes being smothered in cheddar and red Leicester cheeses, along with the many toppings on top. Truly, this pizza was a god among foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandishing a pizza cutter, Nagato turned to Kyon and asked \"How much would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon thought about this \"I'll have.....\"</span></div></div>",

While he had certainly worked up an appetite after his efforts on the pizza, he couldn't dream of eating any more than two or three. He had his limits and he was pretty sure even his small portion would be a big enough test for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Nagato got to work on dividing the pizza into equal slices. Putting a few slices aside from Kyon and placing them on a small plate, Nagato grabbed a much larger plate and practically dumped the many remaining pizza slices onto it. With both plates in her hands, Nagato brought them both to the table Kyon was sitting at and they proceeded to start their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyon ate his meal, he intently watched Nagato tackle her monstrous share of the pizza. With the same blank expression Nagato always had on her face, she viciously dug into the pizza, using her hands to grab more than one slice at a time and shovel them into her mouth. The meat and peppers were no match for the hungry alien, every last bite ending up inside her rapidly increasing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to a good coincidence, Kyon and Nagato finished both their meals at the same time, Kyon wiping his hands from the grease with a nearby napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the.....\" As soon as Kyon was about to thank Nagato for the most interesting meal, he had noticed she was already back up and heading over to the kitchen, picking up another bag which they had not stored any pizza ingredients in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing now?\" Kyon asked her, leaning his head over so he could see what she was grabbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After meal snack foods.\" She said, holding up a bag of gummy sweets in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can she still be hungry after her meal? She practically had the entire pizza!\" Kyon thought, baffled by Nagato's decision to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing the gummy sweets towards Kyon, she asked \"Would you like some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon waved his hands in front of his face. \"No, no, that pizza was good enough for me. Thanks for asking though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his response, Nagato simply put her hand into the bag and grabbed a handful of sweets. Eating them as she went, she plopped down onto the couch and just sat, consuming the bag full of confectionery goods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mind if I watch some TV?\" Kyon asked, holding what he assumed was the Television's remote in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing her most recent mouthful of goodies, Nagato replied \"Sure, go ahead.\" before another large helping entered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the TV, Kyon flipped through the channels, looking for anything remotely interesting while Nagato continued her third feast of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon's eyes drifted lower and lower as he stared at the bright glowing box before him. He had been at Nagato's for quite some time now and at this point, he was simply watching TV. Just as he was about to drift off into a slumber, a hand tapped him on his shoulder, no doubt belonging to Nagato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned around, Kyon's sleepy eyes widened. Nagato now held an empty bag in her hand, and it was clear where the inhabitants of the bag had went. Nagato as a whole, was no definable as \"Fat\". Pretty much everything about the girl had changed since she had finished her recent meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was full and round. With large, chubby cheeks that made her mouth and nose look even smaller than they were, it was quite the sight. A clear double chin was visible on her face, making her look surprisingly cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato's breasts had finally topped Mikuru's as queen of bust sizes in the SOS brigade. The massive mammaries pressed hard against her turtleneck, probably undermining the actual size of them due to the lack of space. They rested rather calmly on top of her belly, to the point where they might as well make a home there. Speaking of Bellies.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer monstrous midsection was a beast, speading far and wide across the empty space in front of her. Finding freedom from the turtleneck, the belly surged it's way outwards, hanging over her waistband easily and making a table for her breasts to rest on. Her navel was large and deep, thrusting downwards to the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato's legs and butt had grown fairly large too. Rips and tears were present on her jeans, which were already tight to begin with. The damaged allowed her thighs to ooze out and fit though the gaps as well as they could. They were so big they actually touched even when Nagato was standing still. Her rear was also quite the sight, not suffering any kind of tear damage, but still very close to bursting out her jeans. The slightest movement made the massive behind sway from side to side, a very daunting sight for anyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering downwards at Kyon, her gigantic frame casting a large shadow over him, she asked \"You look like you require rest. Would you like to have some rest here for this night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head slightly to get his brain into gear, Kyon said.....</span></div></div>",

Just let me call my family.\" Kyon said, before getting up to grab his phone off the kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kyon made his call, Nagato busied herself with preparing her secondary guest bed. Heading into the bedroom, she pulled out another futon and set it up. Pulling it next to her already set futon, she pulled the covers and sheets over both futons before fluffing the pillows for both beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....okay, see you tomorrow, bye.\" Finishing his calls, Kyon put the phone into his pocket and went to Nagato's bedroom, knowing where it was due to his prior stays at her apartment. Sliding the door open, Kyon's eyes witnessed quite a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive frame of Nagato, only dressed in bra and panties. With her stretched turtleneck and ripped jeans abandoned onto the floor, Nagato's globular body was almost fully on display. Her breasts were finally free of any kind of containment (Besides the bra she wore), allowing them to freely jiggle and bounce whenever she moved but an inch. Her belly was also fuly exposed, the sheer extent of how much Nagato had eaten on this today very recognisable now. Her gut was so big, it was impossible to tell if she was wearing any panties underneath the titanic tummy, but she soon turned around, which revealed she was in fact wearing some. This also revealed her huge rear, full fledged and full loaded. The slightest movement caused the cheeks to sway side to side like a pendulum, every last inch of fat moving with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the usual Nagato style, she soon noticed a dumbstruck Kyon standing in the door and said \"Your bed is now ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly stepping outside and slamming the door shut, Kyon responded \"But you're not! I'm real sorry Nagato!\" Kyon had gotten used to making fast exits from rooms ever since his first accidental entry while Mikuru was changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the other side of the closed door, Nagato could be heard. \"I am ready for my rest. This form of dress is the most comfortable way for me to sleep. You may enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly opening the door, Kyon stepped in and tried to look more relaxed in the presence of Nagato. \"Why do I feel so uncomfortable around her when she has no clothes on? It's not like it's Mikuru or Haruhi or anyone else.\" Kyon asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned prior to this event that you claimed to not like large women. My deductions came to the conclusion that you would have no problems with seeing me in this way. Should I alter my dress for the night?\" Nagato asked, kneeling onto her futon and going under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. You're fine Nagato. Good night and thanks for letting me stay the night.\" Kyon said, now in his boxer shorts and a thin T-shirt he had worn under his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching over, Nagato turned the lights off and lay on her back under her sheets, closing her eyes and immediately falling into a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting and turning, Kyon tried to get comfy, but found himself unable to. \"At least it's the weekend tomorrow.....\" Kyon thought to himself in the dark room, with only him and a blubbery alien inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rays of glorious morning sunshine shone through the half closed curtains of Nagato's bedroom. Flickering his eyes before rubbing them clear, Kyon nestled his head into the pillow of his futon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuggghh....it's too early.....\" he groaned in a frustrated and sleepy tone. Shifting his head sideways, he glanced at a clock hanging in the wall, realising that it was actually 9:30AM, which was by no means early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I should really sort out my sleep patterns.\" Kyon thought, now trying to will himself out of the futon. Glancing around, Kyon also noticed that Nagato had made her bed and was nowhere to be seen in the bedroom. The bra and panties she had slept in where now hanging on the side of a wardrobe handle, indicating that she had also gotten ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I wonder what she could be up to.....\" He thought in his classic cynical tone \".....wait, why am I being sarcastic? Hell, nothing bad has happened to me lately, I should count myself lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting his brain into gear, Kyon got himself up and dressed back into his school uniform. \"I might look a little goofy wearing a uniform on a Saturday, but whatever.\" He thought. Opening the bedroom door, he wasn't surprised by the sight he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato was sitting at her table, currently enjoying a breakfast that could only be described as overwhelming. She was once again wearing the same turtleneck and jeans she wore yesterday, but both articles of clothing were close to breaking point. Nagato's table was covered in mass amounts of bacon, eggs, pancakes and waffles of all different ways. Poached eggs, fried eggs, scrambled eggs, smoky bacon, crispy bacon, fatty bacon, scotch pancakes, Shrove pancakes, fried waffles, baked waffles, you name it. Every single piece of food was smothered in grease, syrup and fats, dribbling off the edges of the many plates she had used to hold her enormous meals on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato was currently helping herself to a huge stack of pancakes, with five on her fork and shovelling the soaked food into her mouth. It was wide open, almost like a black hole, every piece of food being pulled into her gaping maw. Her face had finally achieved a triple chin, the original chin now buried under vast amounts of blubber. The chubby cheeks she had were vigorously bouncing and jiggling, going in tune with Nagato's intense chewing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long suffering Turtleneck she had only bought yesterday was just barely trying to contain her globular breasts, having given up on trying to cover the belly long ago. The hefty mammaries were now at quite a remarkable size, having outclassed Mikuru's last night and showing no signs of stopping, currently at watermelon size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gigantic gut was spilling over her lap and crushing into the side of the oval table, looking for every inch of space it could find to allow the fat riddled ball to spread and grow. Rolls had developed on the mass of flesh, burying her navel into the center of both rolls, sucked up into the dark abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jeans she had were pretty much falling apart, barely any stitching left to hold to pained fabric together. Her thighs were thick and wide, surging outwards along with her humongous butt. Both lower body areas had worked together to ensure the death of her poor jeans, allowing them to show off their fatty selves to the wide world. They were both so big that the chair she was sitting on had very noticeable cracks on the legs, showing the beginning of the end for the doomed seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurping up her latest helping of pancake, Nagato swallowed the mass of food and licked her lips of any excess syrup. Turing around (With great difficulty), she said \"Good morning. I made breakfast.\" She then gestured to the overflowing table with her fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I kinda noticed....\" Kyon said, scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took the liberty of making some for you.\" Nagato's pudgy hand grabbed a small plate with some bacon and eggs on it, passing it to Kyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thanks Nagato.\" Kyon went to the kitchen counter and took his breakfast there, no room available on the table due to Nagato's meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning continued on. Kyon ate his food slowly, mostly due to his fascination with Nagato. He watched the girl continuously eat her massive meal, barely stopping to breathe as more and more food entered her mouth and ending up in her growing body. The rolls on her stomach continued to swell, her breasts spilled more over the top of her belly, her cheeks grew rounder and her rear flowed further. Even if she was a humanoid interface and not a real person, the amount of food she ate was impossibly large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last piece of bacon passed down her throat, Nagato leaned back on her chair, causing to creek loudly. Putting both hands on her titanic tummy, she said as calm as ever. \"There is a highly likely chance that I have eaten too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to heave her equally large legs, she was unable to get up from her chair, shifting around uncomfortably on her wooden seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyon watched the girl try to get up, a vibration came from inside his trouser pocket. Reaching inside, the source of the vibrations was his phone. Flipping it open and seeing who had sent him the message, it was none other than Haruhi herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he pressed the green telephone button, a loud voice boomed from the device. \"Where have you been?!? I've been trying to call you all morning!\" Haruhi's unmistakable voice had pure venom hissing out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slept in a bit, okay? Had a kinda odd night....\" Kyon said, trailing off at the last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho, busy night feeding Yuki, eh?\" The brigade leader's voice had shifted into her wretched sly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wasn't that! Get off my back about it!\" Kyon was angry at first, but he soon calmed himself down, knowing what might happen if he were to get on the bad side of a schoolgirl with unspeakable destructive powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. That doesn't excuse the fact that you are late for our SOS brigade meeting! Mikuru and Koizumi have been here for an hour now! Get your butt down here now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon was struck with a thought. \"Should I really be going to this meeting?\" He glanced over at Nagato, who was still rubbing her gut and trying to stand up. \"I should probably just stay here and help Nagato out. But then again, I don't want to make Haruhi mad or anything. She sounds pissed off as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon thought carefully and replied.....</span></div></div>",

She was particularly glad she stayed behind, and that nobody was around to see or hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past few weeks, Haruhi's teasing had begun to take it's toll on the poor time-traveller.  It was at least tolerable before, but this...this was too much.  Haruhi had slowly become more forceful and public with her displays, which was causing extreme stress on Mikuru.  Now, she had to wear a maid outfit which barely covered her, which made Mikuru shudder at all the teasing and pervert-istic madness that would be unleashed from this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru hung up her old maid outfit, and got back into her school uniform.  She grabbed her bag, and began to walk down the street.  Along the way, she stopped by the local burger joint she passed every day; usually, this was where she had dinner: from a fast-food place, cheeseburger meal with a side of Dr Pepper.  So it wasn't surprising when she entered, and waved to the cashier.  The cashier here was a good friend of Mikuru's; she was always sympathetic and kind, and always listened to the high schooled whenever she had troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru walked up to the counter, and asked...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though not chubby, Izumi was a tad pudgier than the average girl in town. This was probably due to being surrounded by fast food constantly and  being unable to resist an occasional nibble or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mikuru? Hi, uh, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much.

By the time Izumi stood beside Mikuru, a smile on her lips, the poor girl's bloated belly was pushing against the interior of her uniform. She rested her greasy fingers gingerly on her distended stomach as she rose to her feet, her skin pale and clammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had a little too much to eat?\" Izumi asked, comfortingly placing a hand on Mikuru's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them got into Izumi's car (no way in hell was Izumi walking), the black haired girl turned toward her orange haired companion, and asked, softly, \"Listen, Mikuru, you look really stressed out.

Now, she wondered why she'd never done it before.  It was actually pretty tasty, despite the fact that she had to eat twice the regular amount of noodles in one sitting.  She decided to focus mostly on eating the meal in front of her, and then she'd try enjoying the taste later.  The noodles, soaked in tomato sauce, went down quickly; Mikuru was able to slurp down a good amount with each bite. However, the sheer number of them made the noodles the most trouble out of the whole meal.  The meatballs weren't as much trouble as one'd think; she ate them easily, and wrapped them up in noodles to finish sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour, Mikuru had almost finished 3/4 her bowl.

She slinked over and smirked.  \"Aw, is Mikuru-chan getting full?\" she asked with mock sympathy.  <br>\r\nMikuru wanted to say \"no\", but the over-four-pounds of noodles and meatballs inside her belly were hard to ignore, so a soft moan was all that escaped her lips.  <br>\r\nHaruhi smiled more. \"It's ok, now.  I'll help you!\".  With that, she grabbed the fork, sat on Mikuru's lap, and scooped up some spaghetti noodles.  She then held it up and said, \"Open wiii-iiiiide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru did the only thing she could...</span></div></div>",

First off, that meant that Haruhi'd make her stuff herself again at lunch, and possibly right before they left for the day.  <br>\r\nBut worse than that, that meant she wouldn't get a break - she'd have to do her regular duties, serving tea and such, as well, without a break.

Kyon politely refused; he could see that Mikuru was hard-pressed enough, having to serve tea on her still-bloated stomach, and he didn't want to cause her any more trouble than he absolutely had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru was struggling to not give up.

She put a hand on her forehead, as the strenuous truths kept pouring in...<br>\r\nApparently somebody else had noticed.<br>\r\nMikuru jumped slightly, causing her swollen gut and breasts to jiggle slightly as she noticed that a small slip of paper had been put on her lap.  She looked up, and saw Nagato's calm, emotionless face looking at her, then suddenly turning back to return to reading.  Mikuru was the only one who took notice of this, so she grabbed the note and hid it from view.  As she did, she looked at the note.  It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will help you. Come to my place tonight.  Tell no one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru looked at the alien, who was intently reading.

Her mouth began to water as she plopped back down on her pillow, breathing slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rested a hand on her soft belly, which had shrunk after her stuffing.

Her thick, trembling arms would have torn through the fabric of her old uniform, as would her belly, now resembling a scoop of slightly melted ice cream, over her pale, pudgy thighs.

Now, her belly, upper arms, and thighs were covered in stretch marks, which Mikuru was embarassed to show.  Her breasts had surprisingly stayed pretty much the same size over the month of her fattening, which was not that much of a problem - they were still big.  Her upper arms had the characteristic flabbiness that came with the weight.  Her thighs were also chubbier, and now thy were big enough to begin rubbing together.  The biggest change was on her belly;  she now had an actual fat roll on her, which was one of the parts that Haruhi liked to grab and jiggle.  Her tight clothes were causing her tummy to bulge out slightly, and rest on the rim of her skirt.  And the tight shirt was now fitting her so well that she had trouble taking it off - someone had to help her take it off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru hid her face, trying to hide her emotions.

She was such an idiot. Her binge had shown her weakest side, a disgusting gross side to a girl who seemed to  glorify in abusing her. Now what was to happen? Was Haruhi going to take advantage of this in some way, and--?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, well, I can see why. This isn't half bad,\" Haruhi said, taking a nibble off of the food on the tab le.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, look, Mikuru. Listen...\"</span></div></div>",

Shock, because Haruhi had just said the last words the redhead had expected to hear from her, and fear because she wasn't sure whether this wasn't just a hallucination.<br>\r\n\"...wha?\" she finally managed, without looking at Suzumiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi scratched the back of her head.  \"Yeah...I, uh... I know it's a bit strange to hear - I mean, I've been fattening you up this whole time, and haven't really been as thoughtful about you lately...but it's true.  I really am sorry.\"<br>\r\nShe looked down from Mikuru, hiding her face. \"it's just...well, I thought you wanted to get fatter, so I wanted to try and do something nice for you.  I guess I was wrong about that.\"<br>\r\nShe chuckled, but it wasn't a happy-sounding chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru was still in disbelief; Haruhi wasn't looking, but if she was, she'd notice that the chubby girl was starting to cry silently.  \"...y-you...care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I care,\" Haruhi said, Looking away from the redhead, but still facing her.  \"I know I've been a bit...rough on you, but it's not because I hate you.  I just...I realized that I've been a bit selfish with what I want, and I wanted to make it up to you by trying to make you happy.  But...I guess I messed up that...\"<br>\r\nSuzumiya barely caught the tear that came from her eye, but it was enough to make her hide her face.  As a result, she didn't expect to feel two chubby arms wrap around her.<br>\r\nShe looked up to see Mikuru hugging the brunette, burying her face into Suzumiya's chest.  Haruhi for a moment forgot why she was crying, surprised by Mikuru's hug, but it wasn't until a few seconds later, when she felt the fattened girl shudder and felt a wet spot on her shirt, that she realized that Mikuru was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shaky, muffled voice said, in-between sobs, \"...th-thank you...th-thank you s-so much, S-Suzumiya-San...this is the n-nicest thing anybody's d-done for me...\". She then hugged Haruhi tighter, trembling softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi did the only thing she could think to do: she hugged Mikuru back, rubbing her back with a gentle, soothing motion.  \"I'm so happy you enjoyed it, Mikuru-chan.  I'm sorry about being so mean...I really like you.  I just...I've only just realized how selfish I've been.  I hope you're not mad at me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru didn't respond; she just held onto the brunette, letting all the pain and frustration that had plagued her for so long flow out and leave her.  Circumstances didn't matter to her anymore - all that mattered was that Haruhi actually did care about her, and didn't just see her as a slave to force her will over.  <br>\r\nHaruhi simply held the fat girl, rubbing her back and comforting her.  Mikuru didn't tell her, but Haruhi got the feeling that Mikuru had forgiven her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls stayed like that for a while.  Then, once Mikuru's sobs died down, Haruhi relaxed her grip and looked into the other girl's face, flushed with color from crying.  She smiled, and asked...</span></div></div>",

Plopping herself on her bed, which bent under the sudden increase in weight, Mikuru asked, softly, \"So why did you change your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a longish story. Here, lemme just help you out a bit,\" Haruhi said, fluffing up Mikuru's pillow by punching it with her fists. Mikuru stared at Haruhi as she presented the beaten up object with a proud expression on her face, squishing it under her red locks. Mikuru probably could've done that herself, but she didn't say anything. No point spoiling a good moment. \"What happened was, Mikuru, was Yuki and Kyon knocked a bit of sense into me. They pointed something out to me, and, well, I just hope to help you out. Listen, about all the weight you gained, I can help you lose some, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru considered this. Sure, she could accept Haruhi's advice, but that involved trusting Haruhi to make her diet. Even though she felt a warm feeling surging throughout each pore, was she really ready to trust Haruhi with her body again? On the other hand, did she really feel ready to put in the effort to lose weight?

Haruhi chuckled some, and gently began rubbing Mikuru's belly where it was exposed.  Mikuru let out a soft moan, and instantly relaxed as Haruhi massaged her tummy.

Sighing, and adjusting her waist band, she trotted down the stairs to prepare breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had resigned to her body, which was truly an odd thing.  She didn't like it, so why settle for it?  Was there some deeper reason?  Did she in some way like being pudgy and over sized? Perhaps.  Still, there was no point really stressing herself out thinking about it.  She prepared a vat filled with pancakes, the meal sizzling in the grittle, her own belly bubbling in anticipation to devour the treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Haruhi took an average serving of pancakes - about three cakes with syrup.   Mikuru was eating easily three times as much, and had the classic \"pancake pile\" before her, all of them coated in syrup and butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi noticed this, and asked, \"Uh...Mikuru, that looks like a lot of food...are you sure you can eat that much?\"<br>\r\nMikuru nodded.  \"I guess I got used to eating alot when you were stuffing me everyday,\" she said, taking off the first three flapjacks and cutting a big chunk out of all three at once.<br>\r\nHaruhi acceted this fact, as she did always force the now-chubby redhead to go for thirds when eating.  She shrugged, and all of them began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mikuru dug in, she was quickly cutting and eating big chunks.  She wasn't eating only one flapjack at once - she was cutting parts out off all three at once, and was eating those bites quickly.  Truthfully, she was feeling hungry, but at the same time she was also worried that she might not make it to school on time.  As a result of this worry and her hunger, she was aiming to finish the plate as fast as possible.<br>\r\nAfter the first three, she started on four more, carving whole chunks out at a time.  She felt every large mouthful adding up inside her tummy, pushing it out further, stretching her clothes.  The sticky syrup was helping to make the bites go down faster, and helping her eat bigger and bigger bites.  But at the same time, that syrup was also very fatty, and would later add to her weight.<br>\r\nHaruhi was eating her meal more slowly.  Partly because she felt that she could relax and take her time with eating, but mostly because she was too busy watching Mikuru stuffing her face.  She was having mixed feelings about this.  On one side, she was worried that this increased appetite was partly her fault, and she was somewhat concerned that this might end up causing problems for her in the future.  On the other hand, she wasn't sure why...but she was impressed by Mikuru's appetite.  It wasn't an attraction to it, as far as she knew; it was more like a respect and admiration at the redhead's capacity.  It was kinda like she was watching a professional athelete practicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eight minutes, Mikuru had eaten all of her 9 pancakes.  Haruhi looked to her plate, and suddenly realized that she hadn't finished one of her pancakes.  She looked back, and caught Mikuru sneaking a quick glance at her pancake.  Haruhi chuckled, realizing what the bloated girl was thinking, and placed her pancake on Mikuru's plate.  <br>\r\nMikuru looked up, and said, \"No, no, it's ok.  You don't have to give me yours, Haruhi...\"<br>\r\nHaruhi smiled and replied, \"It's ok, Mikuru.  I don't mind; if you're hungry, just let me know, ok?\"<br>\r\nMikuru smiled, blushing from happiness, and devoured her tenth pancake quickly.  Haruhi chuckled, thinking that maybe this would be a good thing...</span></div></div>",

Sure, it was a bit of an annoying hill, but even so, surely she could crest such a feat without being too exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru settled herself down on a bench, wheezing to herself slowly. That huge belly of hers expanded in and out, filling with air, but also it was filled with the ten pancakes from earlier.  Though Haruhi regretted doing it, she couldn't deny she felt aroused by the whole ordeal.  She wanted to fatten up Mikuru more, plumpen up her little belly and cling to her.  She resisted her instincts, however, and chose to extend the pleasure of feeding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here. I just need to grab something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi darted off, leaving Mikuru time to breathe.  With the redhead out of sight, Haruhi darted down the hill, racing toward a man on his bicycle.  The two of them nearly collided, the man on the bike spiraling out of control. To Haruhi's glee, he hit the ground safely, but his bag was strewn away. Haruhi grabbed his back, sneaking the lunch out of it, as she returned his belongings to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch where you're going, girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi grinned as the guy ran off, before looking for someone else to steal from. In the end, she stole four lunches, all of it hiding in her bulging backpack.  She returned to Mikuru, who was still a little sweaty, before going off to school.</span></div></div>",

The fat redhead clapped her hands in excitement, and dug into the platter of chicken before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi sat back at her desk, smiling.  Over the month, Mikuru had continued to eat during the club, continuing the same routine as usual.  She was now 295 lbs, and very close to the 300-lbs-goal Haruhi had envisioned long before.  <br>\r\nMikuru now was definitively fat.  Her breasts were large, but sagged slightly on her now-large stomach.  Her belly was big all around; her belly now spilled out over her pants, albeit not much, and bulged out front when it was stuffed full.  Her love handles were large, and covered in sretch marks.  She had a true roll of fat, which creased her belly and hips.  Her thighs were much larger and thicker - they combined with her belly to make her body jiggle slightly when she walked.  Her arms were chubbier, too, and she now couldn't wear any of her old rings on her fingers.  Her face had rounded out, and she had gotten a double-chin which stuck out when she looked down.  All in all, she looked as if she had eaten her old body for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mikuru swallowed another chicken breast, she turned and noticed Haruhi.  The once-tyrannical brunette had also changed, but it wasn't as pleasant to Mikuru.  Haruhi had lost some weight, and it showed.  She was wearing a few sizes smaller than she usually wore, and she looked more fragile and delicate because of a lighter stature.  Mikuru suddenly felt worried - she imagined Haruhi's ribs showing underneath her clothes, and the thoughts of her starving filled the fatter teen with concern and fear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haruhi,\" she asked, \"are you ok?\"<br>\r\nHaruhi looked to her new friend, and smiled.  \"Of course!\" she replied. \"Why wouldn't I be?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...you're looking much thinner than usual.  Are you getting enough to eat?\"<br>\r\nHaruhi chuckled; \"Don't tell me you want to fatten me up, Mikuru,\" she replied.<br>\r\n\"Haruhi, I'm serious,\" Mikuru said; her tone told Haruhi she was serious.  \"I'm getting worried.  Have you been eating properly?\"<br>\r\nHaruhi looked away, no longer smiling. She didn't reply immediately.<br>\r\nMikuru tried again.  \"Are you skipping meals?!\"<br>\r\nHaruhi looked away, her hair hiding her eyes.  A quiet voice replied, \"...maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru got up (which was becoming rather difficult, due to her increased girth), and waddled over to her friend, giving her a hug.  Haruhi returned the hug, snuggling into the warm embrace.  Mikuru felt herself shudder when she felt her friend's back - she could feel her ribs.<br>\r\n\"Haruhi...\" Mikuru said, fighting back tears, \"...what's wrong?  Why aren't you eating?\"<br>\r\nHaruhi paused, feeling hesitant to tell her.  Then she replied, ...</span></div></div>",

Sure, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them left for the nearest theater, and, upon reaching the register for the tickets, Mikuru brushed Haruhi aside, paying for  both of them. \"Ya know, people don't do that unless they're on a date,\" Haruhi replied, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just you were with me so much and all, helping me, and, well, I just wanted to return the favor. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru's hands in the dark theater didn't speak the same way her mouth did.  By the end of the movie, the two girl's hands were interlocked, Haruhi's bony fingers pressed against each of Mikuru's pudgy digits.</span></div></div>",

She then said, much slower, \"D-Do you w-want to go out with me...is what I said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru blushed deeply at this.  Apparently, Haruhi had beaten her to the punch!  She expressed this fact, by saying, \"You stole my line.\"<br>\r\nHaruhi blushed deeper, if that was even possible for her, and replied, \"Wh-What?\"<br>\r\nMikuru chuckled.  \"I was going to ask you that just now.  But since you asked me, yes.  Yes, I'll go out with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi was trembling with the mixture of emotions she was feeling: happiness, relief, surprise, uncertainty...all in an extreme form.  For a moment, Mikuru was afraid that she'd faint from the madness, and so gently grabbed her small hand in her chubbier one.  Haruhi was staring at her hand, trying to figure out what had just happened, as well as regain control of herself.  Exhausted, she simply fell into Mikuru's arms and rested her head in Mikuru's neck.<br>\r\nHaruhi looked up into Mikuru's rounded face, which was looking back into hers with its loving golden-brown eyes, making both girls blush.  Mikuru, in a surprisingly assertive* action for her, leaned closer in, and pressed her lips against Haruhi's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 45 seconds, the world seemed to enter a state of perfect serenity.  Marriage proposals were made. Couples who had gotten into bitter arguments before then suddenly seemed to make up and get back together.  Sibling rivals suddenly made up and got along.  It was as if the whole planet, for that brief moment, was in absolute bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 45 seconds, Mikuru slowly backed away, and broke the kiss.  But Haruhi wasn't ready for it to end; quickly, she pulled Mikuru closer, and kissed her back.

She had given up on trying to look good when she Had all that stress, but she wanted to at least look nice for Haruhi.  Skipping makeup, she went for a simplistic look, since that's the only thing she had that could work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just recently taken a bath (<i>showers were too hard, y'know, having to stand up...</i>), and just finished brushing her teeth and combing her hair.  Her hair was the same style it usually was, but it looked cleaner and neater.  Her nails weren't painted, and she wasn't wearing makeup; she personally never liked the stuff.  She was clean, was happy, and was a tad nervous.<br>\r\nThe biggest problem (no pun intended) was the dress she had.  Unfortunately, while she had grown much fatter, and she did have bigger clothes for her size, she had never gotten around to buying new dress clothes.  So the only one she had was the biggest one she had gotten, before she had grown into the plump fattened frame she had now.  The dress fit, even when she sat down, but it was tight.  It hugged her body super-tight, so that even with it, every fat roll and curve on her stuck out like a sore thumb.<br>\r\nNow Haruhi had made Mikuru feel more comfortable with her new, round body; however, Mikuru still wasn't that confident out in public.  Outside of school and home, she felt very uncomfortable, like everyone was staring at her fat.  And the last thing she wanted to do wad to embarass Haruhi on her - Mikuru's - very first date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked herself over in the mirror.  Overall, even with the tight dress on her, she looked very beautiful.  She gave a worried smile, and wished to herself that nothing would go wrong.  Then she heard the doorbell ring, and she went to greet her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door opened, both girls were caught off guard by what they saw.  Haruhi, in a fairly common dress, was awestruck at how beautiful Mikuru looked - the tight dress didn't even register with her, and wouldnt until much later.  Mikuru was surprised as well at Haruhi's cute charm.<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Haruhi began, blushing slightly at Mikuru, \"You're...you look beautiful...\"<br>\r\nMikuru blushed, and shuffling her feet slightly, she replied, \"Th-thanks...you do, too.\"<br>\r\nHaruhi smiled, and took Mikuru by the hand.  She then led her fat girlfriend out, and the two went to Haruhi's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Mikuru asked, excited.<br>\r\n\"A surprise place,\" Haruhi replied.  Then the building came into sight, and Mikuru blushed out of surprise that Haruhi had taken her...</span></div></div>",

The two stared at the other's eyes.  Haruhi's angelic face was so lovely, her brown bangs falling over her forehead in that right way, the way that enhanced her cute eyes and cheeks more than before.  She wasn't smiling like a maniac as before, but her lips almost small, her eyes determined as she drew closer for a kiss. Mikuru accepted, welcoming her arms wrapping around Haruhi throat to pull her down on top of her.  The bench creaked under their combined weight, but neither cared to give it any mind. They were too lost in their mouths, their fingers probing up the scale of the other's body.  Mikuru loved the feeling of Haruhi's slender digits plummeting into Mikuru's soft exterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Mikuru wondered what it would be like if...</span></div></div>",

Mikuru relaxed her tensed muscles, and a glazed look came over her - the kind of look that ssomeone only gets when they're in absolute harmony.  Haruhi moved in closer to the blubbery redhead, and gently placed one hand on Mikuru's plushy, soft love handle.  Mikuru moaned softly, and closed her eyes as Haruhi pushed deeper into the kiss.  Haruhi began to grab and squeeze at Mikuru's fat rolls, her belly juggling in response.  Mikuru was in absolute bliss; she felt the brunette's tongue brush against hers, at the same time as Haruhi pushed closer towards her, her small, slender form squishing into the titanic belly she helped make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi finally broke the kiss, allowing them time to breathe.

She responded by grabbing another box of cookies, and shoving it into Mikuru's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thsi is what you went through with me. I don't really mind getting my just deserts here. Besides, you owe me for all the times I overfed you, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the night was done, four boxes had been emptied.</span></div></div>",

She looked to see the overweight teenage girl crouched in the corner, hunched over something she couldn't see.  So, being the inquisitive little girl she was, she snuck over to Mikuru, and asked, \"Mikuru?  Whatcha doin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru turned her head around to see the brunette staring at her with one eyebrow raised, and a smirk on her face.  She innocently replied, \"I'm having trouble finishing this.\"<br>\r\n\"Finishing what?\"<br>\r\nMikuru turned around in the rolling chair, revealing what seemed to be a doll.  It had on their school uniform, and had brown hair with a - ...yellow headband?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to make a stuffed doll version of you,\" Mikuru explained, \"but I'm having trouble fitting my hand into the little hole to put the stuffing inside.  I guess my hands aren't as nimble and small as they used to...\"  She blushed, and let out a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi laughed, and took the doll from Mikuru, putting the stuffing in the back.  \"All you had to do was ask, Mikuru,\" she said.  \"Although, I think it's kinda strange that you'd make a doll of me...\"<br>\r\nMikuru replied, \"I was gonna give it to you, honestly...I figured you'd like to have a stuffed you to snuggle with.  Y'know, for those cold nights?\"  She smiled innocently, shuffling her feet slightly.<br>\r\nHaruhi chuckled, handing the filled up doll to the redhead.  \"That's very sweet of you.  But y'know what I'd like even more?\"<br>\r\nMikuru shot up intently, nodding eagerly.  \"What?\" she asked, wanting to know what to get Haruhi for next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi sidled over, and pushed herself against the fat girl, giving her a peck on the cheek.  She whispered softly in her ear, \"A stuffed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Mikuru a few seconds to get the joke she had made.  The two of them chuckled out loud, and haruhi helped Mikuru sit down again.  Mikuru blushed, and kissed Haruhi back.  Haruhi sat down next to Mikuru, cuddling her chubby form.  Haruhi whispered quietly, \"Ya think we could stuff each other later tonight?\"<br>\r\nMikuru laughed, and whispered back, \"I don't see why not.  Shall we meet up after school?\"<br>\r\nHaruhi nodded, and grabbed a roll of fat on the obese redhead's gut, making her face become red, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them went through the rest of the day not doing too much.  Kyon and Itsuki played chess, like usual, and Nagato was reading a book in her specially marked corner.  Haruhi was online, and Mikuru was working on a stuffed doll version of herself, inbetween her tea shifts.  She knew what Haruhi meant earlier when she said she wanted a \"stuffed\" Mikuru, but she was still going to give her true love a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the schoolbell rang...</span></div></div>",

Still, my hands aren't as nimble as they used to be,\" Mikuru mumbled, flexing each pudgy finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there is one thing off,\" Haruhi replied, poking the doll with her index finger, \"I'm not this round.\" Indeed the roll was rather spherical. It was rolly-polly and adorable. Haruhi could imagine Mikuru cuddling with it at night in her thick forearms, snuggling her cheeks next to it, but she couldn't imagine herself looking like this at the present time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not yet,\" Mikuru replied, withdrawing a box of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was spent shoving foods down the other girl's throats. Bom-boms, cookies, pieces of pie, the whole nine yards. By the time the feast had been  completed, the two girls were spread eagle on the floor, unable to move as their cramped bellied stuck out in front of them. Though Mikuru had eaten far more than Haruhi, the brunette was still stuffed to the point she almost felt the food spreading into each digit of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, how did you do that all the time?\" Haruhi moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, at this rate, you'll need to add more stuffing in that doll for it to look like me in a few months.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days later, rainclouds hung over the school.  It was early morning, so the combined effect of the cloud cover and the low light made the normally sunrise-prone area dark, cold, and damp.<br>\r\nThe lights in the SOS clubroom, however, were on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi and Mikuru had come early together, before the other kids came to school.  The original reason for this was to overhaul Mikuru's clothing inventory, but one thing led to another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and it ended up becoming another large breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru was reclined on the floor, against a comfortable sleeping bag the club usually used when they went out camping.  Haruhi, on the other hand, was knelt close to the redhead's face, and feeding her a platter of eggs, sausage, and syrup, with some ice cream to boot.  The brunette was feeding her at a steady pace, keeping pace with Mikuru's chewing and swallows, and occasionally kissing the fat girl inbeteen mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru was in ecstacy at the feeding.  Her bloated tummy was gurgling, as her monstrous breakfast was being digested, and she did her best to keep food coming in.  She had insisted that her arms be restrained, so that she wouldn't be able to resist the food, so her chubby limbs were held behind her, and her hands were tied together behind her back.  Her chunky thighs - the biggest part of her, after her belly and breasts - were spread apart, unknown to Mikuru.  Her breasts had blown up from her old size; they now were so big that they rested on her swelling gut.  <br>\r\nMikuru's eyes were closed, and a soft moan could occasionally be heard from her, even when her mouth was crammed full of food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi had also grown since their date in the park.  Her body was now what could only be described as \"plump\".  She had gotten a fair pot-belly, which stuck out in front of her.  Her breasts hadn't grown much, but her increased weight had resulted in a slightly larger bust.  Her thighs and arms were chubbier, and the normally slender hips now had a hinting pair of love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi was wearing her bunny outfit, which was feeling tighter on the leader of the brigade.  Mikuru, on the other hand, was wearing a swimsuit, which was the last outfit they had tried on her before they decided to eat breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru swallowed the last bite of sausage, and chewed it with some milk Haruhi had decided to pour into her mouth.  Haruhi watched with a certain fascination as the last morsel of food was swallowed, sliding down her throat into her love's waiting stomach.  She took away the milk, and Mikuru moaned softly.  <br>\r\nHaruhi leaned in close to Mikuru's face, and kissed her cheek.  \"hey, Mikuru?\" Mikuru said, as her love began to rub the bloated girl's belly.  <br>\r\nHaruhi whispered softly into her hear, \"What's up, Mikuru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru, with a shakey voice, asked, \"I-I was wondering if you wouldn't mind going out again sometime?\"<br>\r\nHaruhi nodded, moving close to her.  \"I'd love to,\" she replied.  \"Where do you want me to take you?\"<br>\r\nMikuru sat up some - as much as her swollen gut would allow - and answered, \"W-well, there's this nice restaurant I know about that has an all-you-can-eat buffet.  And since we're both getting fatter, I was wondering...m-maybe we could...y'know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi chuckled, and kissed Mikuru again.  \"Sure thing,\" she answered.  \"I'd love to go.  How about I pick you up, and we'll head over around 7?\"<br>\r\nMikuru blushed, and nodded, pulling the brunette closer to her.  The two of them kissed one last time, then Haruhi helped her girlfriend up to her feet.  Mikuru looked over herself, taking in her slight growth.  \"I think this one'll do great!\" she said, looking at the swimsuit.<br>\r\nHaruhi laughed and replied, \"Well, I dunno.  I think we might have to do something about that pink.\"<br>\r\nMikuru nodded in agreement.  \"I know what you mean.  I mean, I normally like pink, but neon isn't really my favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the day resumed as usual, until the time came...</span></div></div>",

She needed to look perfect for that date later, to look like a beautiful, pretty girl in Mikuru's eyes. Smiling, she rubbed her hair faster and rougher, only to stop when one of her strands of hair drifted off her head. Perhaps she had been pressing down on her head a little too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lathered her arms in fluffy pink soap, only to hesitate as she felt her hands sink into her flabby biceps.  She felt a tinge of embarrassment to have this meat all over her bones, this thick flesh that hadn't been there weeks before. She ran her soapy hands, slowly, up her chest, her collarbone impossible to find under the thick layer of flab.  She caressed her thick belly, her fingers running over every rippling inch of filled skin.  She ran her hands off her hips, determining how hard she had to poke herself before her finger hit bone.  She lathered up her thighs, noticing how her knees had been consumed in the layer of fat that she had developed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure whether to feel uncomfortable in her skin or love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soap ran down her body as she turned off the water, exhaling slowly as she rubbed her towel all over her flesh. She hopped out of the stall as she looked at herself in the mirror.  Wrapping the towel around her head like a turban, she took a closer look at her round cheeks, flushed from the hot water in the shower, moist thanks to the torrents of water pouring over her. She bit her lip as she scrutinized her appearance. She did look pretty cute. She hadn't developed a double chin, yet, but her round, cherubic cheeks gave the hint of a rather well-fed goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very idea made her laugh at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent the next couple hours sorting through clothing she could wear. Some things exposed too much cleavage, others not quite enough. The biggest issue with all her clothing, however, was not how much of her recently expanded boobs she showed Mikuru, but rather how much of her clothing actually fit over her expanded form. all the jeans she buckled on dug into her sides, leaving her flesh no where to go but to roll over her buttons and zippers. One particularly tight pair actually ripped as she tried to pull them over her thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she found something that did fit. It was simple, a white blouse with faded jeans.  The jeans were stretched out along her broad belly as she breathed slowly.  She patted herself gently as she noticed how loose the blouse was, considering how tight the rest of her clothing had been. Satisfied at last, after styling her hair as she always did, she left for Mikuru's.</span></div></div>",

I mean, I just haven't gone to one; mostly, I eat food I cook or the food you give me.  This'd be my first time...\"<br>\r\nHaruhi chuckled.  \"Well that's good!  Then I can treat you to a pleasant surprise,\" she said, placing a hand on her love's soft tummy.  Mikuru blushed deeper, and followed the brunette to a booth for them.  Harsh seated Mikuru and said, \"Wait right here; I'll be right back, 'Kay?\". She winked, and sped off to the food line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru blushed, and quickly checked her dress for tears.  She had had some difficulties finding a dress that still fit, so she was forced to wear one of her older dresses.  It did fit, but just barely; it hugged her body tightly, and despite Haruhi being ok with her size, Mikuru didn't exactly feel comfortable with her fat rolls being visible to the public.  In fact, there was a part of her which felt afraid that, if she ate too much, her dress would rip and expose her to everyone.  Nervously, she scanned for any sign of a rip or tear in the dress, but found none to her relief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Haruhi came back, carrying not one, but several plates and platters of food, from thick cheeseburgers to a bowl of chicken fingers, and even a plate of waffle fries.<br>\r\nAt first, Mikuru was startled.  \"H-Haruhi,\" she asked, \"are you sure it's ok to take this much?\"<br>\r\nHaruhi smiled and explained, \"This is an all-you-can-eat buffet, Mikuru.  You take as much as you can eat, and you pay after you're full!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru's worry at that grew into anxiety.</span></div></div>",

Check the '<i>Fetishes that will appear during this story</i>' to see what new things you can use in your additions and routes.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelcome, I'm sure most of us are familiar with The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, but for those who aren't here's a brief over view of what the series is mainly about;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A cynical high school student by the name of Kyon is suddenly recruited into (or should I say forced into) a club known as the SOS Brigade which was founded by one, Haruhi Suzumiya. Said club is strictly devoted to finding Supernatural beings (Aliens, Espers, Time Travelers, Sliders, ect). It is later revealed that, most of the members who joined the SOS Brigade are in fact supernatural beings, albeit, undercover as high school students to moniter Haruhi and her power. For you see, Haruhi herself is something of a God, having the power to manipulate the universe to her wishes only she herself is unaware of her own abilities. Wouldn't you want to keep an eye on an impulsive, short fused teenager who could nuke the universe with so little effort that's not even funny? (which it isn't, no one likes a dead universe).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this Interactive Story, you the reader will have a chance to give each of the girls from the series (including the genderbent ones) some extra poundage, a womb swollen with babies or have her gain through devouring others. You're free to enact anything you wish to get the girls to swell up; OCs, evil organizations, alien powers, whatever you have in mind, you're welcome to use. However keep in mind there are a few ground rules (found below) to consider when writing a chapter. That aside, have fun and happy writing~!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+Fetishes that will appear during this story...+<br>\r\n- Stuffing/Weight Gain<br>\r\n- Pregnancy<br>\r\n- Vore<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try not to kill off any characters, I may not like Haruhi that much but I won't be giving her the axe anytime soon. <br>\r\n-Meh, I decided to give you the chance to implement H-scenes, but ONLY when it's merit for one (you can't just get into sex right away you have to build into through plot and character development), you can also write it if you're able to handle it as well. If you don't feel comfortable (or confident) about writing it, then don't do it.<br>\r\n-Only the female characters can gain weight, why else would I bringing in the genderswapped male characters? to give you more options, of course~<br>\r\n-No farting/belching/scat or anything else too sexual or in my opinion that defaces the characters' true selves.<br>\r\n-Please use good grammar, I can't stress this enough people.<br>\r\n-One line chapters are a lazy and unintersting, so you should refrain from using those if you can help it. If you can't then don't post until you have a good sized chapter to show you put effort into your writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said you're free to do what you think is interesting. Enjoy~</td>",
