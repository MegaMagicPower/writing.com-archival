He tapped a pen on his desk. There had been so many awful failed reboots where they had seen through his deception, so much so that he himself had put on stress weight. This gave him a wonderful idea! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese stupid humans!\u201d he said. \u201cThey think they\u2019re so beautiful with their dumb breathing tubes and stubby fingers! I\u2019ll show them! They won\u2019t feel so good when they\u2019ve bloated themselves up to immobility! Then!\u201d he couldn\u2019t finish the sentence for laughing so hard. \u201cThen I\u2019ll induce heart attacks in \u2018em! They\u2019ll think it\u2019s their own fault! Oh, then I\u2019ll finally be accepted as a demon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clicked his fingers. \u201cJanet!\u201d She popped into existence with a soft, pleasing \u2018ping\u2019. \u201cJanet, I need you to make the frozen yogurt about 10x more addictive and 20x more fattening.\u201d Michael said. \u201cOkay!\u201d said Janet pleasantly. \u201cOh and one more thing, as the humans get fat, I need you to increase your appearance along with them, make them feel more comfortable.\u201d She agreed and then popped out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014ONE WEEK LATER\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael stood in The Neighborhood\u2019s central plaza, observing the four humans as they milled around him. Already the plans were being put into action with some success. He rubbed his hands together in glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a nearby caf\u00e9 table sat Chidi, frozen yogurt cups sittinging empty in between his piles of books. From Michael\u2019s estimate he had put on about 30 pounds, his soft gut straining against his dress shirt onto his thick thighs. He was to emgrossed in his studies to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver behind him sat Tahani, a good 15 pound heavier and fretting over her love handles bulging from her dress and groaning and sighing. Her cleavage was on complete display, as her boobs had jumped up a size. She was in complete agony over her slight gain, as it was shocking to her naturally vapid personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, still pretending to be Jianyu the buddhist monk, crouched behind a plant and scarfed down two bowls of yogurt, (one Jalapeno Popper flavor, one Jacksonville Jaguar blue). Upon someone noticing potentially watching, he tried to scamper away stealthily, which failed both due to his Jasonness and due to his 45 ib gut and butt bulging out his robes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking past Michael was Eleanor, who was huge. Snacking on her shrimp yogurt, she had gained 60 pounds. Her stomach peeking out slightly beneath her pink sweater, also distorted by her bigger breasts. Her face had softened, no double chin yet, but a softer complexion for sure. As she walked away, Michael dispassionately observed her jeans straining against her huge shelf-like booty, wide hips and thick thighs rubbing together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cackled evily under his breath.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
