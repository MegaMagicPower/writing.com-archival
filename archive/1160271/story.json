Many years ago the corporation known as Chem World International had decided to dump most of its waste underground, right next to a quiet little suburb in Farrowville.  No one in the corporation knew of its effects, or that it would take several years for the effects to manifest.  Even worse, the waste generated by CWI would be most harmful to the youngest residents of the small suburban community.</span></div></div>",

The suburb expanded, building houses, schools, and parks over the toxic land.  As it happened there was a park built over the most toxic area of land in the whole suburb.  And in this park was a children's playground which included swings, a sand box, a slide, and various other forms of amusement for the happy go lucky children of Farrowville.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonth after month the children were exposed to the dangerous materials emanating from under their feet.  The busy children's parents had neglected to notice their children had stopped growing for the past several months and were even showing signs of a reduction in height.  Little did they know a small earthquake would cause a massive leak in bio chemical materials, causing the children to have an extreme height reduction.</span></div></div>",

He especially loved to play in the sandbox with his toy trucks, heaping handfulls of sand into them, pretending he was working on a construction site like his father.  His father was involved in construction, but not as a worker.  He owned a company that had been contracted to build most of the suburbs in the town.  He had become considerably wealthy and had married a woman to worthy of his income.  Andrea was quite tall, in fact at 6ft she was a giantess in her own right.  In order to keep her statuesque figure at the age of 40, she would jog to the park every day at 5 o'clock to make sure her son Justin came home in time for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day as Justin was playing in the sandbox with several of his friends, the earth began to quake slightly beneath them.  The children didn't think much of it, afterall they lived in a state that had its share of earthquakes.  They also didn't think much of the colorless liquid that began leaking from the ground creating small puddles in the sandbox.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, in a playful gesture, picked up a gob of wet sand and threw it at his long-time friend Shin, who came from a wealthy japanese family that had invested in the company owned by Justin's father.  As soon as the toxic sand left Justin's hand, he began to feel quite ill and collapsed to the ground.  Shin, covered in the sand began to feel ill as well.  In fact, all the children in the sand box suffered the same fate as they had all interacted with the mysterious substance.  Justin, Shin, and the others awoke to a bizarre site.  All around them were enormous sand dunes that spread out before them like a desert.  There was something odd about the dunes though.  They were wet...</span></div></div>",

Had aliens captured them and teleported them to their world?  No, despite what he thought were new surroudings, everything seemed oddly familiar to him.  As if he had seen it all in a dream or past life.  He looked over at his friend Shin, who was asking the other children if they knew what had happened.  Justin was about to go over to his friend to formulate some kind of plan to escape the damp desert when he heard a rumbling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 6 foot tall mother of Justin, known as Andrea to her friends and servants, was making her way to the sand box.  It had been a pleasant jog to the park, and she was looking forward to walking home with her son, discussing what he would like for dinner as they always did.  She stood in front of the sandbox, where she would normally find Justin and glanced around the park.  Strangely, the children that normally filled all corners of the park were absent.  Andrea looked at the expensive watch her husband had bought her.  The time was right...maybe Justin had gone to Shin's house to play as he sometimes did.  She was about to leave when she glanced down at the sand box again.  She had missed the opportunity to go to the beach and get her tan as she normally did.  Well sand box sand is as good as any right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea slipped off her shoes and laid down her exercise towel.  Barefoot, she slowly stepped into the sand.  It was slightly moist to her surprise, but the left over toxic materials would have no effect on her as she had not been exposed to it in its pure state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Justin looking up screamed for his life.  His mother was a giant blonde monster threatening to squish him and his friends under her smooth, tan, well manicured foot...</span></div></div>",

Without knowing it, she was about to bury a large number of the neighborhood's children beneath her feet.  Unless Justin did something, this sandbox would be his friend's giant grave.  He started shouting at his friends, who were just now trying to adjust to their new height and were to close to the walls of the sandbox to look over and see their beautiful destroyer.  Justin's voice got there attention and as they saw a shadow forming over them, they began to run in all sorts of directions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!  Andrea's foot landed, creating mini sand waves that swept many of the children away.  Some weren't so fortunate as the sand was difficult to walk in.  They cried out in terror as a foot the size of a cruise ship landed on top of them.  At first they felt nothing.  It was merely difficult to breathe and all light was shut out.  That was until Andrea put all her weight on that foot to step into the sand box.  The poor children were ground into the coarse sand, and at their size it was like being pressed into hills of sharp stones.  </span></div></div>",

The sand feels so good against her foot, she squeezes her toes into it even more.  Justin and Shin run from the giantess and head to the corner of the sandbox.  Only about four other kids make it while the others were crushed or are trapped under Andrea's towel.  Justin signals to the remaining children and they follow him to a safe spot.  The giant woman brings her other foot into the sandbox and it has the same destructive effect.  Luckily, no one was squished this time.  She takes a few more steps then sits down onto her towel.  The giantess stretches her hands high into the air, temporarily blocking the sun from the tiny children below.  She then pulls up her skirt some and unbuttons her blouse.  She slowly lays back.  The children are knocked on their asses once her back slams into the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god Justin, what are we going to do?  We are like the size of bugs!\"  Shin is breathing hard and fast.  \"Iiis this a bad dream or did some of our friends really get crushed?\"  \"I hope it is a dream, but everything seems real to me.  The rest of us have to get out of this mess somehow, but thats my mom over there.  She will help us out,\" says Justin.  \"But she's a giant now, what if she can't see us,\" cries out one of the kids.  \"We have to try something,\" replies Justin.  Next, </span></div></div>",

She might squish us before we can even try and contact her!\"  Justin looked back at his mother, saw her mountainous form rise and fall to the rhythm of her steady breathing.  Looked at her giant fingers each the size of a school bus, its nails painted blood red.  He looked at her feet, which had crushed many an insect.  He recalled the expression of disgust on his mother's face before she would squish bugs, and he shuddered.  Justin snapped out of his flashbacks and said \"we'll just have to take that chance\".  The children looked at each other with looks of anxiety.  They knew there was no other way.  If Andrea got up and left without them, they may never escape the miniature hell.

She sat up and looked down to see what it was. There at feet stood a group of exceptionally tiny black ants. If they weren't moving she might not have spotted them they were that small. Her eyes narrowed, her lips compressed and her face took on a look of utmost contempt. She may have hated bugs, but she loathed ants. They were so horrid, feeding off the crumbs of others. Eating whatever they could get their hands on. They weren't even alive, they were mere machines doing whatever the queen ant instructed them to do. They were pathetic. The thing she hated most about them was their size. So were so small that people could crush them without noticing. So small it wasn't funny, and she hated that. She was a god compared to them, and to her they served one purpose; to be crushed under her like the bugs they were. <br>\r\n&lt;br /&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br /&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;br /&gt;<br>\r\nHow do they get crushed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rest nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n\"But how do we get up there?\" The girl asked. <br>\r\nJustin looked around, His mothers breast towered behind then like giant hills, then he saw somthing, her golden hair draped down the side of her head, and onto her shoulders. \"We can climb her hair!\" he announced. The others agreed. They slowly made their way towards her shoulders. The strands of hair were perfect in size, but they had a large climb ahead of them. <br>\r\n  Taking deep breaths the children started, it was easy going, untill Andrea sat up, Leaving the children dangling, Shin's strand of hair began to swing around her face!<br>\r\n\"ahhh!\" Shin cried as he swung quickly through the air. He finally stopped, he signaled to the others that he was ok, and started climbing. He felt gust of wind coming from above him, looking up he stared into the giant nose of Andrea. Then looking directly ahead he saw he was right infront of her giant lips. A strong burst of wind pourd out of her lips, He held on tightly, soon they began to part.<br>\r\n  Andrea streached her arms and opened her mouth widly in a yawn, Shin stared horrified into the giant cavern infront of him. Gleaming white teeth sparkled in the bright sun light, light filling her mouth completly, her toung pushed back into her mouth. To add onto his fear the toung lowered revealing a massive throat, seemingly large enough to swallow a bus! With her mouth still open she began to lay back down, soon Shin dangled ubove the massive cavern. The others climbed quickly reaching the top of her head, and ran to aid their friend. Shins weight was making the hair droop, and to shins dismay slipped inside her mouth. <br>\r\n  \"Shin!\" Justin yelled. He scrambled down his mothers forehead and down her nose. He saw Shin trying to pull him self up out of Andreas mouth. He grabed onto the hair and pulled, \"Guys!\" he yelled back to the others, \"Help!\"</span></div></div>",

Just a few feet away from the group of children is the monolithic soda can and some of the group walk up to it in wonder, more so at the swimming pool sized spheres of soda that lie beside it. While the massive mom prepares her meal, he group deliberates on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should walk up to her and try getting her attention,\" says one of the girls, Amy. \"She probably wont even see us, we're even smaller than ants to her at this size,\" exclaims another. \"But what if we all made a pattern on the counter, she might notice it and then we'll be saved,\" replied Stuart, one of the older boys in the group.

Justin's mom wraps her lips around her finger and then slides it out creating a kissing sound... only with no more kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then takes a drink of the soda. \"Wow that was surprisingly tasty for a little drop!\" As Justin, Shin,  and the two others watch the remaining two girls still near Andrea, they see them scatter.

Eww a bug!\" Justin's mom turns and walks across the tiled floor, her feet causing loud booms as she gets a fly swatter. \"I hate bugs.

SMACK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin cringes as he sees the flat fly swatter on the counter where the girl once stood. The massive hand of his mom gripped the handle with force so dominantly.

Stains from the children in the sandbox remain. BOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin knew what happened to her.

Instead of being crushed however, the tiny children end up being stuck fast to the goddess' finger as the sticky soda adheres them onto her skin. Screaming and shouting at the giantess, they are slowly brought up to her smiling lips and Andrea's intentions for the four becomes apparent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gonna eat them!!\" Stuart shouts in realization.<br>\r\n\"Quick, we have to divert her attention, maybe if we all run to her strawberries, she'll forget about them and move her strawberries away, thinking we're bugs. There's nothing that my mom hates more than bugs,\" Justin says, hurrying toward the plate containing the food of the goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four children are barely able to move on the soft sticky surface of the giantess's fingertips. Strong vertigo hits the group as they are brought up higher and higher away from the table, passing the soft black blanket of cloth that covers Andrea's tight white blouse and burgeoning bust. Meanwhile, Shin and Justin's group rushes towards the plate of strawberries and cream that looks more like a snow covered hills in the shadow of the mountainous goddess. Together, they manage to climb and grasp onto the side of the plate and slowly, they tumble into the thick cream amidst the red strawberries that dot the landscape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, lets head to the center of the plate, there's a lot of cream there and we're sure to stick out!\" directs Justin, hastily moving to the middle of the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on her finger, the four children are subjected to a rollercoaster of movement as Andrea moves her finger around lazily while chatting with Shin's mother, Megami. One of the girls, Sandra gets sick and blacks out for a few moments, but is soon awakened by the strong gusts of wind blown from Andrea's gargantuan mouth as she speaks, \"I'll be sure to let you know if they drop by here dear..and by the way, these strawberries you sent over the other day look positively delicious! I'll call you back when I have some news...bye now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuck in place, they watch helplessly as Andrea's blimp sized lips slowly part, revealing her wet, pink tongue unfolding in the darkness. A gust of humid air, heavy with the scent of orange soda envelops them as Andrea brings her finger closer to her titanic mouth. The children can barely see anything other than the giantess' perfectly straight front teeth stretching all the way to the back where her long, shapely uvula guards the entrance to the subterranean depths of her body. Panicking and on the verge of breaking down, the kids pass the threshold of Andrea's lips and are roughly licked off by the tip of her slimy tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Justin continues running but slips and lands face first into the imprint created by Megami's big toe. He gags as he gets a mouthfull of sweat and dead skin flakes. Suddenly a huge shadow casts over him.Turning over, the final thing he saw was Megami's big toe lowering down onto him. Justin couldnt believe this is it. Megami was such a nice person to him at normal size. Always treating him like her own child and a very fun person to be around with. If only he was able to get her attention sooner. Now Hes going to die beneath her foot and she wont even know it. Justin covers his eyes before the inevitable happens..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegami tightens the buckle on her black sandal before heading back home. A week passes and still no sign of the children. Megami and Andrea called the police and they searched the whole area but found nothing. No sign of Justin, Shin, Andrew and Lisa. Megami sits on her couch and crys over her missing son. Megami is still wearing the same sandals she always wears to work, which she removes from her feet and continues weap. If she were to look close enough, she could still see the dead children that are buried beneath the grime and sweat. But nobody will ever find out what happened to the children. Megami will simply just walk all over them for the next three years until she wears the sandals out and throws them away.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   As Megami proceeded to the living room, she figured she may as well make herself comfortable.  After all, it was already quarter til 1 and reruns of her favorite show, Desperate Housewives of Orange County, would soon be on.  She walked over to the sofa and sat down, sighing in exhaustion as she plopped down.  After flipping the TV on, Megami leaned forward and stared down at her size 9 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Her feet were very well maintained.  Being moisturized regularly with no sign of dryness, the skin was very soft and pillow-like.  The toes were of perfect form and shape, plump and soft.  Her arches had a few wrinkles and her heel was like a giant pillow of skin.  The nails were trimmed frequently and were always painted a different color each week, this week being a glittery deep blue.  They never stank either.  Infact, the moisturizer gave them a slight strawberry fragrance.  Megami was admiring her feet so much, she couldn't help but wiggle her toes a bit.  She thought about how her husband admires her feet almost as much as she does and sometimes likes to \"play\" with them.  Sometimes Megami would pretend to shrink and crush her husband and put her feet on his face.  She would sometimes squish ants under different areas of her foot until they were nothing more than gooey, mushy blobs stuck to the underside of her beautiful feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Meanwhile, Justin and Shin are looking up in amazement.  Megami's enormous wiggling toes cause them to loose balance and fall face first into the sandal.  Suddenly the wiggling subsides and Justin looks up to see a big wall of flesh.  Luckily, it is only the side of Megami's massive sole, but where is Shin and the others?  Justin gets up and walks towards the heel of the massive left foot when he feels something latch onto his ankle.  He looks down to see Shin's hand around his ankle, pulling himself out from under the arch of his mothers foot.  Shin got to his feet and couldn't help but mention how glad he was that his mother kept her feet well moisturized, for that aided in his ability to slide out from under her soft silky foot.  Shin continued for a few more seconds before Justin interupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are Lisa and Andrew?!\" Justin exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-D-K.\" shin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As Megami was still admiring her feet, unaware of the 4 children at her feet, Justin and Shin set off to look for Lisa and Andrew.  Shin climbed up the sandal strap nearest the heel for a broader look of the landscape. \"Do you see them?,\" Justin asked.  Shin, squinting his eyes, searched along the sandal of the other foot.  \"Not ye....Oh I think I see them!,\"  Shin gasped!  Lisa was sitting next to the giantesses big toe on the right sandal.  Andrew appeared to be stuck in the carpet fuzz after being knocked off from earlier's encounter.  He was right near Lisa, but more so to the side of Megami's big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Shin slid back down to the sandal to tell Justin there whereabouts.  The two quickly ran toward the toe section on the sandal and looked across to see Lisa looking over at them, then down at Andrew, who just managed to free himself from the fuzz.  Andrew was too small to lift himself up onto the sandal, and too heavy for Lisa to lift him alone so he made his way over the left sandal, where Justin and Shin had been, and the two were able to pull him aboard.  Lisa on the other hand, was too afraid to move.  Shin was trying to persuade her but it was no good, she was too afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Suddenly, Shin heard his mom giggling to herself.  \"Hmm, I think I'm going to take my sandals off so I can feel the soft carpet between my toes, maybe I'll moisturize them too.\"<br>\r\nAll four children looked up in terror as the train-sized fingers began descending towards them.  Shin and Andrew were quick to grab on to a strap of the sandal, while Justin had his own plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, where are you going?,\" yelled Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get her attention.\" Justin Shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Justin climbed onto the glittery deep blue toe nail of her big toe and proceeded up on top of her silky smooth foot toward her hand and jumped on it, holding tight to her ring finger.  The giantess, still unaware of her bug sized buddies, drew her left foot out of her sandal,moved her sandal to the left, and gently placed her foot down on the carpet.  Shin and Andrew, still on the sandal, did nothing but watch as the giantess mother let out a relaxed \"ahh\" as she curled her toes in the carpet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Justin is holding on for dear life, but while the giantess was enjoying the feeling of the left foot on the carpet, she raised her hands up above her head and Justin went flying up and landed on the sofa side table, knocked unconscious from the hard landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing,\" Megami moaned, \"Time for the other one.\" she said as she reached for her right sandal strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Petrified by the sight, Lisa is motionless.  Andrew is trying to get her attention but its worthless.  She just stands there as the giantess unstraps her sandal and slides her beautiful peds from it.  The giantess mother picks up the sandal and sets it aside as before, but doesn't notice the ant-sized Lisa fall off and land on the carpet in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Lisa turns over to see the beautiful foot of her friends mom slowly descend and again cannot move, even if she wanted to she was stuck in the carpet fuzz.  Megami's ungodly large, football stadium sized, cold,soft heel comes down at the feet of Lisa and slowly starts coming forward.  Lisa can't believe she is about to be unknowingly squished under the foot of, from her perspective, a goddess.  She begin's screaming, \"PLEASE!  MRS. SMITH!!  PLEASE DON'T SQUISH ME!  PLEEEEAASE!  I DON'T WANT BE CRUSHED!  AHHHHHHHH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Megami can be heard above, expressing her enjoyment for the feeling of the carpet against her foot as Lisa is disappearing under the wrinkles in her arch, which are constantly compressing and contracting as her massive house-sized toes flex up and down repeatedly.  Slowly, Megami lowered her foot, her toes now pointed up and out as her sole came down, closing off any last rays of light for Lisa, who was now face deep in the soft fluffy skin of her arch, closer towards the heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Surprisingly enough, Lisa doesn't feel much pressure.  YET.  She began to think of how she ended up here, pressed into the carpet underneath such delicate a foot, that to her was not delicate at all.  As the giantess's foot flattened out on the carpet, pressure on Lisa's body began to grow as more and more weight was shifted atop her.  She screamed out in agony one last time.  \"MRS. SMITH, YOUR SQUISHING ME UNDER YOUR FOOT!  PLEEEASSE STOP!  NOOOOO.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Unfortunately her cries are not heard by the towering goddess above who is now curling her toes and sliding her foot slightly back and forth on carpet.  Lisa drew one last breath as she heard the giantess moan sensationally and felt her foot press even harder into the carpet. Lisa finally felt her ribs break one by one. Her arms and legs were already crushed completely flat under the immense weight that lay upon them.  All she could do now was hope the end was near, wishing she would just be squished to get it over with, she didn't care if she would be a pile of goo in the end, and she didn't have to wait much longer either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The sensation Megami was receiving was making her hungry.  \"Hmmm, I think I'm gonna go get a snack, I'm reallly hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Lisa heard what she was saying and felt the weight lift slightly off her body.  She didn't know the condition she was in, she only knew pain. The weight was the only thing keeping her from bleeding out.  There was a slight ray of light shining in from the under the giantess mother's arch, just enough for Lisa to see.  She looked around to see how badly she was injured, and nearly had a heart attack at the sight.  Her legs were nothing but gooey mush, stuck to the base of the arch at the heel.  Her right arm was was broken, but her left arm was crushed into the carpet.  her torso was flattened as well, embedded deep in the fibers of the carpet.  Suddenly it was dark and she knew what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SQUISH* *CRUNCH* *SPLAT*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Megami stood up with all of her weight on her right foot, grinding the remains of Lisa into the carpet below her.  She had no clue she had just crushed the life and guts out of her son's friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Meanwhile, Shin and Andrew, seeing that Lisa had fallen off of the sandal, ran over to see where she had landed.  By the time they got around the giantesses left foot, they were too late.  All they heard were Lisa's final screams as the giantess mother stood up, then bones breaking and flesh shredding.  They were so dazed by what they had just seen that they had no time to even think of moving out of the giantess mother's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Without warning, The giganitic left foot swung over the two boys heads and landed right in front of them, The heel missing Shin by only fractions of an inch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Shin's towering mother proceeded to the kitchen, leaving behind a red stain that was once Lisa embedded deep into the carpet.  Andrew and Shin both cried at the site of their friends mangled remains.  A few minutes pass and Shin's mother returns with a bowl of popcorn in her grasp.  Shin signals Andrew to hide under the sofa with him, but he doesn't comply.  Instead he sits down on the carpet and waits. Shin leaves him and runs under the sofa and looks out as his mother walks toward Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he sat up, his head began pinging with overwhelming pain.  He looked around to see a big wall of white on his left and a transparent wall on his right.  In front of him was a big white landscape, which he soon realized was the sofa.  He tried standing up, but quickly feel over after taking a step.  Apparently the fall caused him to severely sprain his right ankle.  Using the vast white wall to lean against, he quickly remembered what had happened, he was shrunk to the size of an aunt and he was trying to get Megami's attention.  Then it dawned on him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shin....SHIN...Shin, where are you,\" he called for Shin, but he heard no answer. \"Shit, I must have fallen off of her finger and landed...here...where the hell am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Justin studied his surroundings and quickly realized he was standing on the side table next to the sofa.  The gigantic transparent was as a vase of some sort with roses in it.  The same roses that Shin had bought his mother for Mother's Day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Justin seized his thoughts as a big white glob of goo fell from above and landed right at his feet.  It had a strawberry scent to it.  Looking up, he quickly figured out it came from the giant white wall next to him, which was a bottle of Lotion.  Before he can move, another blob falls down and plops around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" he says, \"Now I'm gonna smell lik..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Another blob lands on top of him, causing him to fall face first into the mass of lotion.  He is trying to fight his way out when he here muffled booming sounds from around him.  Megami is walking back into the room with a bowl of popcorn.  He hears her walk over and sit down on the sofa right next to the end table, unaware of what is about to happen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking down he sees a speck on the floor.  At first he thought it was just a tiny ant.  He jumped on to the sofa arm, forgetting all about his severely sprained ankle until he hit the firm fabric with a loud *smack* as he nearly slid off the side of the arm.  He mumbled cuss words to himself as he struggled to pull himself to the top of the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When he crawled to the top, he hurry towards the edge of the arm right next to the giantess mother's left hand.

He was laying face up on the carpet staring directly into the eyes of the giantess that peered down upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Andrew had originally intended to climb up the towering goddess and get her attention, but now that she spotted him, he had to resort to a different plan.

He quickly thought to himself that maybe he could get her attention, maybe if he waved his arms she would see him.  Only problem was that she was not looking down.  Not yet anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Andrew stood up and ran out toward the coffee table, hoping to get a view of the giantess mother's face.  Unfortunately at his height, the angle of view did not change much at all and Andrew could not see anything past her knees.  He was also exhaust from running all the way to the coffee table, so he sat down to catch his breathe.  He wasn't very fit either, his parent had always let him eat whatever he wanted, so he was a bit chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As he sat there thinking of another way to get the giantess's attention, he couldn't help but notice her glittery blue nails of her toes as she curled them into the carpet, then his face lit up with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!,\" he said snapping his fingers, \"I'll climb on one of her toes!  I'm sure she is sensitive enough to feel me walking on her toes, then she will look down and see me waving my arms and we will all be ss..WOOHHH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Andrew was intrupted as the unaware giantess mother lifted her right foot and moved it in his direction.  He turned around to run, forgetting the coffee table was right behind him...\"SMACK\"...Andrew ran right into the table and feel on his back, looking up to what he thought was his final moments as the foot hovered over his tiny, unseen body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NOOO, THIS IS IT!  I'M ABOUT TO BE MASHED UNDERNEATH HER TOES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Andrew waited for sudden death, but it never came.  He opened his eyes to see the huge ceiling of flesh resting against the coffee table, the sweet scent of strawberry filled his nose.  He sighed in relief.  Then he heard the goddess speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally my show is on!  I wonder who's gonna fight this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As the Megami was enjoying her popcorn and her show, Andrew decide now would be a good time to get the hell out from under her foot.  Only problem was that he was  somewhat pinned between the carpet and her soft skin where her arch meets her sole.  She was also very sensitive in that area, so Andrew had to work extra slow and carefully so he wouldn't spook her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It was tricky, but he was just about out when the gigantic flesh ceiling shifted a little bit more pressure on his leg as he became stuck, his body sticking halfway out from under the enormous sole.  He decided to just yank it free, but that was a big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Megami quickly lifted her foot back and peered down to search for what tickled her.  Andrew didn't move a muscle as the eyes of the giantess searched the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHA!,\" Megami exclaimed, leaning down toward Andrew, \"A tiny little bug playing around my feet ehh?\"  \"Do you like them little bug?\" \"Do they smell nice?\"  She had a very odd grin on her face as she questioned the tiny bug, which she had no idea was one of her son's friends.  \"I have no idea why I'm asking you these things, I know you can't talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Andrew was so horrified, he didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are you gonna run little bug?\"  \"Isn't that what you normally do when you are spotted?\" said Megami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Megami was silent for a few more seconds, then an evil grin came across her face, and Andrew was so scared he nearly pissed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know why you're not running away. You think my feet are so beautiful and soft, you want to see them some more, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Meanwhile, Shin was calling for Andrew, who heard him and decided to take a run for the sofa when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!  The giantess mother slams her foot down in front of Andrew, blocking his escape. \"Now where are you going little bug?  Are you embarrassed because I know you want my feet?  Don't feel that way, I love when bugs your size want to feel my warm soft soles squish, I MEAN rub against their tiny body.  And I am ready to do that for you little bug, now HOLD STILL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Andrew had no where to run and no time to think.  He was doomed.  He looked to the skies to see the gigantic hand come and scoop him up, holding his body firmly so he would not squeeze away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With Andrew clenched in her hand, Megami walked over in front of the TV and sat down on the carpet with her legs out straight.  She carefully placed her new \"bug\" friend on the floor in front of her, then drug her feet back towards her along the carpet, angling them so that the bottoms were facing inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, little bug, I think I will call you....Andrew!  I don't know why, but I feel like calling you Andrew.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Andrew cannot believe what he is hearing.  Not only has this giantess mother mistaken him for a bug, but she ends up calling him by his own name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Andrew, remember my beautiful feet you love so much?  Well...HERE THEY COME!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Andrew looked around to see two enormous walls of flesh slowly moving towards him.  tried running away but it was no use.  In a matter of seconds he was pinned between bother of her truck-sized pinky toes.  He was squirming around trying to climb out from between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, that tickles, Andrew, NOW CLIMB UP MY BEAUTIFUL TOES BEFORE I CRUSH YOU RIGHT NOW!\" Megami demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Andrew, obeyed the goddess and climbed his way up her long, soft toes, being pinned, briefly, between each pillow-like toe along the way up.  When he reached the inner side her plump, big toes, he heard the goddess once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good listener for a bug Andrew, and I like that.\"  Megami continued.  \"The last bug didn't listen to well and uhm...he didn't make it past the first couple minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does she mean 'the last bug,' she does this regularly?\" Andrew mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As he was climbing between Megami's soft big toes, he thought the space between them was getting tighter...and it was!  Megami was intentionally closing the gap between her toes.  She wanted to feel his squirming reaction as he tried to pry the soft, cushioned skin away from his face.  The sensation reminds her of how good domination feels when the one being dominated is so small and insignificant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does this feel Andrew?,\" Megami asked, \"You just love when my massive pillowed toes completely close around your body without harming you, allowing you to breathe in the sweet aroma they give off.\"  \"I know you love it, and you have been such a good listener, therefore I will allow you to spend a minute or two in between them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Andrew didn't know what to do or think.  He had no chance of crawling away.  Before he knew it, he was completely trapped by the giantess's soft silky smooth skin of her enormous toes.  He was so small he could almost squeeze between the groves of her toe print.  As his face was pressed against the skin, the last bit of light that shined upon him vanished and it was dark.  The sweet scent of strawberry still in the air.  He figured he may as well get used to this, after all, it may not be that bad in the end.  Maybe she will let him go.  He was so exhausted from all the excitement that he began falling asleep.  Her feet where too comfortable, he couldn't resist.  He gave one of the toes a kiss and fell to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Meanwhile, Megami was planning on what she wanted to do next, she loved playing with her bug friends slowly, making sure she got full pleasure out of there tiny little lives before grinding them to a mushy, gooy pulp under her sole.  But at the same time she wanted to watch her show.  She knew she could always find another bug to toy with, so she made her desicion....It was crunch time for Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The giantess mother quickly spread her toes apart to reveal Andrew, who was stuck face first to the toe on her left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little Andrew,\" giantess Megami said as she quickly, but gently pushed Andrew back between her unbelievably silky smooth soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Andrew quickly awoke to the giant finger pushing him deep between those ungodly large soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am missing my show because of you Andrew,\" Megami bellowed, as she pushed Andrew dead center of her soles.  \"I am missing my show and I am not very happy with you at the moment.\"  \"Do you know what happens to tiny bugs that make me unhappy?  DO YOU?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As if expecting a reply,  Megami quickly pressed her soles together blocking light once again for poor Andrew, who was now feeling a bit of pressure for the first time from the giantess as she squeezed him between the soft flesh of her freshly scented soles.  He didn't know what to expect next.  Was this it?  Was she about to squash his puny body lifeless?  All these different thoughts were running through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Suddenly the pressure was gone and Andrew hit the floor face first.  When he rolled over on his back, he saw that the giantess was dangling her right foot over his small speck of a body.  She then brought the toes down slowly and placed them on the carpet above where his head lay.  He was staring directly into the moist sole of the giantess mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"When tiny bugs like you make me unhappy, I choose an area of my foot that I like, usually my sole because it is the most sensitive. Then I put said bug in the direct path of that area and slowly bring it down on them.  At first it doesn't hurt because my feet are so soft, but as I press harder,the bugs will start squirming, and I LOOOVVEE when bugs squirm under my sensitive feet.  It tickles me so much I begin to press harder to make it stop, building up pressure even more so on the bugs tiny body, until finally *CRUNCH*!!!  then I feel there guts splatter all over my feet and grind it one last time deep into the carpet.  One time a bug was still a live at the end of it all, so I left him stuck to my heel for almost a week after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegami gazed down at the speck one last time before deciding how to end his life.</span></div></div>",
