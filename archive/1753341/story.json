As he sat there contemplating which course of action he was going to take he realized that his eyes were beginning  to droop from lack of sleep. Before he had even had a chance to get up and go back to his own room Hitsugaya passed out right there at his desk and fell into a blissful sleep dreaming about a world without paperwork. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\nThe sun began to rise over the Soul Society telling the world that it is going to be another wonderful day for all, well maybe not for one.
