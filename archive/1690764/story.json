Ash gleefully cheering him on giving him instructions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's It Pikachu we'll be ready for Clemont in no time!\"  Ash gloated <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika pika!\"  Pikachu agreed as he trained.  Meanwhile both Serena and Bonnie were watching Ash intently, Serena had a blush on her face seeing him in action while Bonnie looked impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad but your going to need more than that to beat my brother!\"  Bonnie shouted, then she noticed Serena was quiet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's up?\"  The young blonde girl asked.  This whisked Serena back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, oh I was.....impressed by Ash's training.\"  Serena said with a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His training or him?\"  Bonnie teased, which cause Serena's blush to go even more red before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess there's no hiding it from you, I just wish he would notice.\"  The honey hair coloured girl sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheer up I'm sure he'll notice you one day.\"  Bonnie assured.  \"Anyways wanna drink?\"  she pulled out this weird pink liquid and showed it to Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonnie, where did you get this?\"  She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bought it, the guy said it was supposed to help you find true love or some nonsense like that, as if I'm dumb enough to believe it.\"  Bonnie eye rolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you buy it?\"  Serena asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To prove him wrong of course, I'm going to drink this to show there's nothing wrong with it, but I need a second person to test it to verify my claim which is why I want you to drink it with me.\"  Bonnie explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this?\"  The older girl queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, watch.\"  Bonnie boasted before taking a drink of the potion.  \"Hey this is actually tasty, here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena was a bit skeptical but drank it too nonetheless and to her shock Bonnie was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this is good!\"  Serena exclaimed happily.  Their thoughts were interrupted as a jolt of electricity came down as the familiar cry of \"Pika......CHUUUUUUUUUUU!!\"   Bellowed.  Both girls drew their attention to the commotion to find Ash getting his Pikachu to thunderbolt a immobile target he set up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work Pikachu!\"  Ash cheered his partner on. The second their eyes laid on the black haired Pokemon trainer, both girls blushed frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh wow, I never noticed how handsome Ash was</i>  Bonnie thought with glee.  Meanwhile Serena was having a different effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm done being shy</i>  Serena knew what she wanted to do, and she marched up to the boy in question to do it.  Ash noticed her approaching him and greeted her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Serena want to have a Pokemon...\"  Ash was cut off with Serena putting a finger on his lips, she gave him a sultry look before kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMM?!\"  Ash was confused at what was going on, after she was done kissing him she gave him a stern but endearing look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here Ash, I'm doing playing the waiting game, I'm done not being able to tell you how I feel so I'm going to spell it out for you.  I love you, I loved you ever since we were kids and you helped me find my hat.\"  Serena confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Bonnie was seething in anger <i>How dare that hussy take my man away from me, Ash is mine</i>  Bonnie stormed up to them to claim Ash for himself   Bonnie angrily coughed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I won't let this happen, why settle for her?!\"  Bonnie angrily shouted before flashing Ash a seductive smile \"When you can have me handsome.\"  She blew him a kiss and gave him a wink.  Now Ash was really confused.  Serena in turn was angered at her so called friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you keep my Ash away from me traitor!!\"  She shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Ash?!  He's mine, I love him with all my heart and I know I can show him what a real girlfriend is like!\"  Bonnie argued back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh....</span></div></div>",

Serena having no issues with that grabbed it and flipped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait don't I get a say in this?!\"  Ash mentioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them turned to him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do sweetie but why would you want to turn us down?\"  Serena mentioned in a suggestive tone as she grabbed the coin. when it came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you find us beautiful my love?\"  Bonnie chimed in.

As he does, something surprises him. \"Woah, what is that?!\" He yells as metallic pieces come together to form a head, torso, two hands, and two legs. It is a Living Armor. \"All right, let's finish this\" Roxas says as he charges into the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Living Armor fights using it's sharp hands to claw at Roxas, but he is able to dodge many of the blows. Then, the arms and legs separate from the body and Roxas knows that is his chance. \"Nice try! Event Horizon!\" Roxas cries as he activates his Limit Break, since he'd taken just enough damage to use it. His keyblade becomes bathed in light as he repeatedly slashes through the Living Armor's arms and legs. Once they are gone, all that is left is the body and head. However, once the arms and legs are gone, the rest is an open target. \"You're finished!\" Roxas cries out as he goes into Final Limit. 4 pillars of light surround him and spread out, cutting through the last of the Living Armor.

From behind a gate walked Hayner, Pence and Olette. Of course, at this time, Roxas had only met Pence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Roxas, how are you doing?\" Pence asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. How about you?\" Roxas replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh same old same old.\" Pence says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh, who is he?\" Hayner asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Roxas. I met him a while ago when he and one of his friends were searching for another of their friends. Oh, did you find your friend after all?\" Pence asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks to you.\" Roxas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, shucks.\" Pence says, slightly embaressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyway, thanks for taking out that thing.\" Hayner says as he walks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait for me Hayner! See you later Roxas!\" Pence says as he chases after Hayner. Olette is still there. \"So, who was your friend?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Xion. We spend almost every day together.\" Roxas replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's so sweet!\" Olette says. Then, Roxas remembers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, can I ask you something?\" He asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what is it?\" asks Olette.</span></div></div>",

With his silent permission, Sakura put on a sultry look as she backed off a bit and began removing her clothes in a slow fashion making sure the man she now loves enjoys every second of her performance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was indeed entranced by the show she was displaying, slowly removing each article of clothing in a teasing fashion to get him riled up.  It wasn't long before she was standing before him in her underwear causing him to be mesmerized by her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura...you're beautiful!\"  Naruto commented, causing the pinkette to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my love, care to finish the job?\"  She offered, puffing her chest at him and even shaking her body a bit back and forth.  He didn't need to be told twice as he approached her, with shaking hands he fumbled on her bra for a bit before finally unclasping it as it fell to the floor unnoticed by the two teens.  Naruto couldn't help but be fascinated by her breasts, his hands instinctively reaching for them.  But Sakura caught them gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet my soon to be lover, you still have a job to finish remember?\"  She teased as she motioned to her panties.  Naruto seemed to catch himself, and nodded quickly.  Sakura giggled as she let go of his hands to allow him to remove her panties.  His hands reached down to pull down the article of clothing, Sakura helped him by lifting her legs to step out of them.  Once they were removed Naruto nearly lost it right there as the sight of a now naked Sakura was standing there looking at him with intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're turn now.\"  Sakura chimed as she moved to Naruto to remove his clothing  \"If you behave yourself and keep your hands to yourself until I finish, I'll give you a special treat.\"  Naruto stammered but he liked the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...sure Sakura I promise.\"  Naruto agreed wanting this special treat.  Sakura flashed him a smile before removing his clothes even slower than her own.  For Naruto it was pure torture, as she took her time getting each article of his clothes off one by one, stopping to moan a bit while rubbing her breasts in a seductive manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naruto look at what you're doing to me!\"  She moaned happily as she tweaked her nipples, also lifting her breasts up close to his face.  Naruto sweated and groaned but he still held on, fighting every urge to grab her.  Sakura couldn't help but admire his tenacity as she went back to removing his clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Naruto was left in just his boxers, and before she took the last article of clothing off to reveal her prize inside, she decided to caress it with her thumb, causing in to moan in bliss at her treatment. His manhood was getting harder as it was trying to poke through the garment but she would not relent with her ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So big!\"  She said in an erotic tone as she continued to stroke it.  Naruto could barely take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura please, stop teasing me and take my boxers off already.\"  He begged wanting to get to main course, and of course his special treat.  Sakura flashed him another smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you my love!\"  She said warmly as she proceeded to remove his boxers.  Once they were off, she got a good chance to admire Naruto's member proudly standing at attention.  She licked her lips at the sight of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised you a special treat, well here it is.\"  She got on her knees and placed his manhood on her hand stroking it a bit more before places kisses on it.  After kissing it a few times she gave it a few licks around the tip, before opening her mouth and putting his manhood in it.  She wrapped her lips around it and started to bob her head back and forth while sucking on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was in heaven right now as the woman he loves is giving him a blowjob.  He wondered what will come next.</span></div></div>",

However his inexperience would be his downfall as he unexpectedly felt a building up sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...Sakura I feel weird.\"  He warned, but she gave him an eye smile and sucked harder causing him to lose it and ejaculate his semen into her mouth which she swallowed greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad my love.\"  Sakura mentioned as she lapped up the rest of it \"That was an orgasm you had, it's perfectly natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait you said it was your first time how do you know all of this?\"  He wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We kunoichi go through seduction classes to learn all this in case we get a mission that requires us to use these skills.\"  She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um...will you?\"  He trailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry my love, I'll make sure to not get any of those missions, your penis is the only one I want inside me now.\"  Sakura smiled warmly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto seemed relieved by this answer, and smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways time to return the favour.\"  She mentioned motioning to her body as she got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I don't.\"  Naruto's inexperience once more showing itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll help you.\"  She assured, she guided her hands to her breasts like he tried to do before \"Now watch what I do, and follow.\"   She guided his hands to massage them gently rotating them around, she also took one of his fingers to her nipples to rotate that as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was thankfully a quick learner, and began mimicking what she was showing him to the best of his abilities.  Sakura cooed a bit at his treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...just like that.\"  She moaned  \"Go a bit faster please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\"  He asked as he went faster with his ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Yes!!\" She hissed with joy as he continued to fondle her breasts \"You're doing a good job, keep it up.\"  Naruto nodded as his actions continued.  She allowed him to play with her breasts for a few minutes before softly grabbing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, did I mess up?\"  He wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all my love, but there's another part of me that yearns for your touch.\"  Sakura commented as she guided his hand towards her womanhood.  She used her other hand to put it insider her labia to make sure Naruto was watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look carefully.\"  She inserted her fingers inside her womanhood and used to of them to rub it gently.  She made sure Naruto was watching intently before guiding his hand replacing it with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's your turn.\"  She motioned, the blonde nodded before doing his best to copy what Sakura was doing.  She moaned happily at the treatment as she felt his fingers touch her most private area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, keep it up.\"  She panted with joy.  Naruto nodded as he continued to fondle her per her instructions, \"Now, massage my breasts like you did earlier with your other hand.\"  He complied to her wish as he once more fondled one of her boobs one by one with his other hand, getting a cry of happiness for his efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....that's it.\"  Sakura squealed as she felt herself getting close.  It wouldn't be long before Sakura cried out his name as she climaxed herself  \"Okay, you...can stop now.\"  Her breathing was heavy, Naruto complied and stopped what he was doing, putting his hands back to his side.  Once she recovered she gave him a passionate kiss which he happily returned, they made out for a few minutes before the need for air hit them and they pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well for your first time my love, and with more practice you'll be even better.\"  Sakura complimented, earning a warm smile from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sakura, that means a lot.\"  Naruto thanked and kissed her.  She smiled at him after he did.  Sakura then pulled him in for a hug, both teens groaning as they felt each others respective private parts touch their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for the main course, if not it's fine if we end this here and just cuddle or maybe we can finally go on our date.\"  She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wondered on what to do before giving his answer.</span></div></div>",

She smiled at him while giving him a kiss, she went to Naruto's bed to lie down and spread her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all yours my love, take me.\"  Sakura seductively said.  Naruto nervously went up to her and and looked her in the face with equal amount of love she was giving.  Sakura smiled warmly and softly took Naruto's erection and guided to her labia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm going to slowly put that in here.\"  She pointed to her womanhood.  Naruto nodded as he allowed Sakura to set the pace as she slowly moved his member to its destination, Naruto helped her by scooting a bit closer, as it was entering her more and more until it hit a barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\"  He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The indication that no man has yet to touch me, I offer this to you in full.\"  She explained in a loving tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so how do I?\"  He began asking her.  Sakura knew what he was about to ask and answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to thrust really hard into me, it's unfortunately going to hurt but don't worry, after a while it will disappear being replaced by pleasure.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Sakura.\"  Naruto nodded and readied himself, after taking a few breaths he pushed really hard into her causing her to cry in pain. Naruto dared not move as she was in agony, wanted her to be okay until he continued.  Once time has passed Sakura caressed his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine now my love, please continue, just keep thrusting in like you did before I'll help you.\"  She mentioned.Naruto nodded and he began thrusting per her instructions.  Sakura helped in by meeting his thrusts and told him \"Match me.\"  He did as she asked and they found themselves a nice pace.  Both of them moaning as their thrusting continued,  Sakura guided Naruto's hand to her breast, which prompted him to do what she taught him earlier and massage it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were thrusting Sakura took the time to wrap her legs around him while doing some hand signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop for a second please?\"  She asked, Naruto complied as she touched her stomach \"Okay you may continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"  He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something to prevent pregnancy, I would love to have your children one day but I fear the time is not yet upon us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Sakrua, I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.\"  He assured which caused her to smile warmly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my love, now please continue.\"  Naruto didn't need to be told twice as they began thrusting once more.  They kept at this for a good while until Naruto felt his pressure again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's happening again.\"  He warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's fine, keep going.\"  She assured him, this caused him to smile and do as she asked.  Eventually their climaxes hit as they felt tired after their love making.  Naruto was laying on top of her recovering his breath with Sakura once more caressing his cheek.  They stayed like this for a good while before Naruto got up to lay beside her, she immediately cuddled him and cooed in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's stay like this for a while, and once your ready we can do something else.\"  Naruto suggested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course my love.\"  She smiled warmly at him while laying her head on her chest hearing his heartbeat.   Naruto smiled and kissed her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your forehead is so lovely, it makes me want to kiss it.\"  He parroted all that time ago when he was disguised as Sasuke.  Sakura recognized that quote and put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was you all along my love, I wish I knew sooner.\"  Sakura sighed  \"But I will make up for all my past mistakes, I love you and I will never let you go, Sasuke means nothing to me now.\"  She smiled when saying that, not moving from her spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled back and kissed her once more, ready to have his next activity with her.</span></div></div>",

She opened the potion to sniff it. \"Smells okay.\"  Before she even knew what she was doing she took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey not bad.\"  Ino commented and drank it a bit more before catching herself \"What am I doing, first I insult him, then I drink his drink I am the worst!\"  She panicked a bit before she saw it refill itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....convenient maybe he doesn't need to know about this, I dug myself out of one hole don't need to dig out of another.\"  She said to herself.  Closing the potion back up, she entered the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto I have your drink!\"  She shouted and heard nothing, then she heard loud moans inside the kitchen room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, oh well here goes nothing.\"  Ino exclaimed as she closed her eyes and cautiously head towards the kitchen.  She arrived hearing the two teens go at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"  Ino exclaimed, she heard a shriek and then angry footsteps approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"  Sakura growled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Naruto's drink, he dropped it.\"  She explained as she handed her the potion.  She felt Sakura take in then called the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your drink my love.\"  Ino heard more footsteps and someone grabbing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sakura.\"  He said as he put it back in is pocket where he discarded it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now leave, we're busy.\"  Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, got it.\"  Ino mentioned as she backed up still with her eyes closed.  Unfortunately because she didn't watch where she was going she misstep lost her balance and crashed hard to the wall, Ino landed on her ass and seemed unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Ino!!\" Sakura exclaimed, and rushed towards her with Naruto in tow both of them ignoring their lack of modesty in favour of helping her.  They had their differences but Sakura would never wish any ill intent towards the platinum blonde.  Both Naruto and Sakura looking down at her with concerned faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on pig your tougher than this, wake up!\"  She cried to her sleeping from as she checked for injuries, using a medical justu on her just in case.  It was a few minutes before Ino groaned as she opened her eyes to greet a concerned and relieved Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forehead?\"  She weakly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you too pig.\"  She smirked when saying that.  Ino smirked back as she felt a sharp pain in the back of her head and moved to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me to never walk with my eyes closed again.\"  She chuckled and groaned \"I do not think things through do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see your feeling better Ino.\"  Naruto commented, glad to see she was okay.  Ino turned to face him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank youuuuuuuuuuu.\"  She trailed as her eyes widened and a blush formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino, Ino?!\"  Naruto said as he waved her hand in front of her \"I think she hit her head harder than we thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno blinked a few times before smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm alright thank you for your concern.\"  She said in a sweet tone.  Naruto was confused but smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good to see your okay then now why don't we...\"  He trailed before Ino continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love.\"  She sighed happily.  Naruto took a few moments to process what she just said, he blinked and then blinked again before laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ino, good one, you had me going there for a....mmm?!\"  He trailed before Ino kissed him, he was really confused, and Sakura was fuming mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your hands off my man!!\"  She growled at her.  Ino turned to her and stuck her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he wants a better woman now!!\"  She taunted.  Before sighing and looking at Naruto \"I can be twice the woman Sakura is my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that's it I'm going to.\"  Sakura mentioned before Naruto interrupted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop fighting, let's just talk about this like adults.\"  He insisted.  Both Ino and Sakura turned to smile at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course my love.\"  Sakura mentioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll happily discuss this with you.\"  Ino finished.  Naruto was really confused, but didn't question it as it got the desired effect.

Naruto blushed, he still was confused be supposed he could get use to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess I am too.\"  He smiled at them, this caused both girls to smile back and hug him.  Naruto wanting to be a gentleman gave each girl a kiss on the head, which both girls cooed in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Sakura do you mind I have a turn with him now?\"  Ino asked in a suggestive tone, Sakura smiled back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means, just don't keep him too long for yourself.\"  She replied as she left the two alone.  Naruto blushed as Ino eyed him hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we my love?\"  Ino asked as she began undressing herself.</span></div></div>",

Eventually she was fully naked in front of him and took the time to give him some sexy poses, making sure her assets were on fully display.  Naruto's eyes couldn't help but be glued to her breasts which got a giggle from Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like them my love, well they're about to take care of your poking rod in your crotch.\"  She purred as she noticed a bulge in his pants.  Naruto didn't quite know what she meant as he was still a bit inexperienced but he trusted her and nodded nonetheless.  She gave a wicked smile as she approached him to strip him naked.  Once he was naked, she took the time to get on her knees and gently put his erection in between her breasts.  Using them she began rubbing his manhood softly with them giving them the full attention it needed.  Naruto was groaning in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't know this was a thing.\"  Naruto mentioned as he moaned some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor thing, nobody taught you much about sex did they, well not to worry I'll take care of you along with Sakura, you'll be a sex machine in no time.\"  Ino cooed giving him a wink to boot, she decided to speed up her rubbing a bit to give him more pleasure which caused Naruto to moan out Ino's name in appreciation.  Eventually Naruto couldn't take it any more as he reached his climax and his cum sprayed over Ino's chest.  Ino looked at herself and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you got me all dirty, we simply must take a shower now.\"  She said seductively as she gently grabbed Naruto to bring him to the shower.</span></div></div>",

Nothing too damaging of course, but harmless pranks I thought were funny at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, you were so lonely at the time and all I could do was watch like a coward, but that all changes today.\"  Hinata began.  Ino and Sakura weren't happy where this was going but like so many times before they didn't want to upset their man so remained quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, you don't need to...\"  He began before she gently cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me finish, please.\"  She replied.  Naruto said no more and allowed her to talk.  \"Naruto, you did so much for me, like the time you saved me from those bullies, ever since then I was fixated on you but I had no confidence.  Not in myself, not in anything.\"  She paused before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father expected much but me and was very strict in my training but I didn't want to hurt anyone.  Thankfully he noticed and had me train with practice dummies, it was enough for him but not for the elders, kept calling me a disgrace and wanted my sister Hanabi to be the heir, which she declined all the time, I couldn't be where I am without her support.\"  She sighed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first it was admiration, but it developed into more, into something much more.  I wanted to know you, to make you happy, to share your pain but my own fear prevented me, I stood and watched you from a distance wanting to do something, anything to make you smile but I did nothing.  Well, that changes today.\"  She looked at him with determination and all the love she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more running, no more self doubt, I know what I want and I want you.  I love you, I have for the longest time and I hope you feel the same way.\"  Hinata finished glad to finally get that off her chest.  Naruto stood there, stunned at her confession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata...I....I don't know what to say.\"  He began.\"   \"I...I don't know what to do....I want everyone to be happy I just....don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that Sakura and Ino came up to him and comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love your heart is huge, everyone should share it.  Something I came to learn.\"  She began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree my love, Sakura allowed me to be with you, having Hinata as well shouldn't be a problem either if that is your wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely my love.\"  The pink haired girl assured.  The blonde looked a bit uncertain, but then he smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say Hinata?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!!!\"  She jumped for joy before calming down. \"I will happily accept your offer, my love.\"  She added happily before leaping into his arms and kissed him.  Ino and Sakura both smiled warmly and kissed him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that out of the way, let's all enjoy our date here together, or maybe you want to head back.\"  Sakura mentioned with a smirk adding the last part with a suggestive tone.

After a few minutes the two of them stood fully naked in front of one another, both of them admiring the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo words needed to be said, their eyes that sparked love and acceptance spoke volumes, they went in for another kiss as they held each other tight, Hinata got to enjoy the arousal of Naruto while the blonde got to feel the softness of Hinata's breasts pressed against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked at Naruto with loving eyes and said.</span></div></div>",

She stayed like this for awhile until the pain went away, once in did she began thrusting herself on to his erection with eagerness moaning happily at the sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long, I wanted this for so long.\"  She moaned happily rubbing her breasts, Naruto went to help out by grabbing her waist but Hinata gently stopped him.  \"Just relax and enjoy, this is my treat to you.\"  She gave a wink and kept riding him still rubbing her breasts while moaning Naruto's name.  Meanwhile Ino and Sakura watched with intent, both of them rather turned on by what they're witnessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, it's always the quiet ones.\"  Ino whispered to her ex rival, which earned her a nod.

They shuffled around a bit to make it even more hard to guess for them before each Naruto went to one of his three girlfriends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's begin.\"  Hinata exclaimed excitedly, a bit of a perverted laugh coming out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, maybe you should reel it back just a bit.\"  Sakura mentioned with a sweat drop.

Naruto blinked a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...didn't know you were a woman.\"  He mentioned.

Another reason why I hate humans so power hungry.\"  Kyuubi explained, her eyes glaring into Naruto's soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case I can explain it to...\"  He was cut off by her laughing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So stupid, they hate you remember it's why you secretly hate them, and yet you're content on being this villages' punching bag.\"  She scoffed.  \"What do you hope to achieve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know but I will find I way, I never give up!\"  Naruto assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall see.\"  Kyuubi mentioned.  \"But I highly doubt it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a promise of a life time, in fact why don't I start now?\"  He mentioned before showing her the pink potion.  \"Here, take this as an offering of my friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, a drink who you take me for?\"  Kyuubi mentioned, her patience growing thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the drink, it's a sign that says I want to be friends with you, I may have hatred like you said but I don't let it consume me, I accept that part of me and learn to grow so I don't let hatred dictate my life.\"  Naruto mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I'll drink it, if only to stop your insufferable talking.\"  She mentioned, she walked up to him to grab the drink and took a gulp.  When she was done She gave it back to him still with her eyes closed which he took, unaware it refilled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now leave...I'm....\"  She began as she opened her eyes, a blush formed on her face upon gazing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"  Naruto wondered, it wasn't long before the red haired woman was looking at him with love at her eyes, and went to hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, you're right, maybe we should be friends.\"  She purred and kissed him \"Actually, maybe we can be more than that my love.\"  She cooed with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was confused as all hell, before grabbing the potion once more.  He studied it a bit before finally putting two and two together before frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...it's the potion.\"  He muttered sadly \"They don't love me, I made them love me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's not true at all, I can feel it's effects binding me to you, allowing me to feel these wonderful feelings.  The love people feel for you drinking this is genuine, if someone already loves you they'd simply gain the confidence to tell you.\"  She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata.\"  He mentioned, now her new attitude made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, it also doesn't work on relatives or married women, so you see there's no false love.\"  She smiled warmly at him \"I could in theory  shake this off but I don't want to, I wish to explore this, I wish to be yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, I should just accept this?\"  He wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not, they'll love you forever now, just like I do.  But that's a good thing, it's helping you grow, making you a stronger container for me.  I've already stated my case on that at some point.\"  She cooed happily as she kissed him once more. \"Besides, you'll be breaking their hearts, can you really bring yourself to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I can't.\"  Naruto admitted.  \"Fine, then I'll just have to accept responsibility and treat you all fairly, I'll also make sure nobody else drinks this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you and I both know at some point the temptation will get to you but that's okay.\"  She purred as she hugged him happily \"Maybe this your answer to bringing world peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By having all the single women in the world love me?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what it takes.\"  She purred. This caused Naruto to actually consider this. \"Now, shall we mate, or do you wish to head back?\"</span></div></div>",

Naruto turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like you said Sakura, some idiots need to be put in there place, besides he would've hurt all of you and I always protect my precious people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the girls to smile at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so thoughtful my love, just make sure not to carry the burden by yourself.  You're not alone anymore.\"  Ino mentioned and the others nodded in agreement.  They began to continue their walk back all the while Naruto was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll be this villages' punching bag no longer.</i></span></div></div>",

As they were talking he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Y\u016bgao right, I'm sorry for what happened to Hayate.\"  He started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not supposed to know that.\"  The woman answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means you admit it.\" He answered back \"For all you knew I could've been tricking you and I had no idea who you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....are correct.\"  Y\u016bgao somberly said. \"An error I will atone for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to go that far, I mean you're an ANBU captain so you must be skilled.\"  He mentioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that were true Hayate would still be alive.\"  She mentioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't blame yourself for that, he wouldn't want you to live in sorrow feeling guilty.\"  He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but I still feel responsible nonetheless.\"  She sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you but what picks me up when I'm like that is a drink, I have one if you'd like.\"  He offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on duty.\"  She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A non alcoholic drink.\"  He corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also not allowed to take my mask off.\"  She mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't say anything, but I won't force you either.\"  He told her.

One of them even said and I quote 'I will show you whores real mean.'  I believe that implies rape.\"  He began \"Furthermore they called me a demon on more than one occasion breaking the third's law no matter how you look at it I was well within my right to kill them and broke no laws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brat, if I thought you broke any laws you'd be behind bars, but what you did was still reckless. The only mercy from this is that this hasn't reached public ears yet otherwise they'd call for your head and I'd be unable to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning what, last I checked your word was law.\"  Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's things behind the scenes you don't understand, my power is only so limited and I can only do so much.\"  She began \"All it would take is one vote of no confidence and I'll be unable to do anything, and they'll give my hat to someone who wants you dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean to tell me, where this is supposed to be a dictatorship, the one in charge is powerless to advisers?!\"  He asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a messed up system founded by the previous Hokage's, I'm doing what I can to remedy this but if you pull shit like this it doesn't help me.\"  Tsunade groaned \"Regardless what's done is done and I hope you'll refrain from doing this again for both our well beings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens now?\"  He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you said, you broke no laws and I intend to keep this hidden for the public.  In return you will be doing D ranked missions for five months without pay.\"  She stated \"Just be thankful this didn't get worse for you, those that want you dead would be way less forgiving than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is all I wish to address the matter of why the ANBU showed up immediately the second I defended myself but whenever I was beaten within an inch of my life they weren't there, cat lady here can attest to this.\"  He motioned to Y\u016bgao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is correct lady Hokage, furthermore one of my men broke the third's law.  I believe there is corruption within ANBU, I have a list of possible suspects.\"  Y\u016bgao told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, show me.\"  Tsunade replied, as Y\u016bgao approached her with a list in her hand and made sure it caught her full attention.  As she did she opened the pink potion to slip it within Tsunade's booze without her knowing and discretely give the one she loves a thumbs up.  \"Take who you can trust and look into this when you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if there's anyone I can trust, anyone can be against Naruto maybe all of ANBU aside from myself is corrupt.\"  She mentioned.  Causing the Hokage to groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The will of fire my ass.\"  She muttered, \"I need a drink.\"  She went to grab her booze and gulped it down, unaware the liquid of the love potion was inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taste's different.\"  She muttered \"At any rate...\"  She paused upon seeing Naruto before shaking it off. \"At any rate I want you to be careful okay?\"  The last phrase she said in a sweeter tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Odd, it didn't work maybe she meets the restrictions?</i>  He thought before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will granny.\"  Naruto grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brat.\"  She said sweetly \"You can call me Tsunade you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or maybe it did, but then that means....</i>  Naruto was inwardly shocked at this revelation <i>Tsunade was in love with me already?!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Tsunade, I don't want to upset you, I know I tease you and egg you on by calling you 'granny' but that's just my way of showing you my affection.\"  He told her.  Tsunade blushed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Naruto.\"  She walked up to him and kissed him on the forehead like she did previously \"Naruto...do you love me?\"  She looked at him hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do.\"  He assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, like a man loves a woman?\"  She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a beautiful woman, and I would be lucky to have someone like you if you wish it.\"  He smiled at her which got her to smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad, I was worried an old woman like me wouldn't be good enough for you.  I harbored these feeling of love for you since you brought me back to this village but I suppressed them due to our age difference.  But, I don't care about that anymore, I love you and I'm not afraid to say it anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Tsunade, I will accept you then, with all my girlfriends, you won't mind this at all.\"  He told her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not my love.\"  She said warmly and did what she wanted to do for a long time and kiss him on the lips, which he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our family lady Tsunade.\" Y\u016bgao smiled as she removed her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're in his family too, you have a big heart my love.\"  She smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, and I want Shizune in this as well, I hope you'll help me with that.\"  He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course my love, I can get her now if you wish or Y\u016bgao and I can have some fun with you first.\"  Tsunade purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that second option very much.\"  Y\u016bgao smirked.  Naruto liked both ideas, but decided on the best one.</span></div></div>",

He went to find a few himself, he'll need all the single women as possible on his side to achieve his goal, with that in mind he went to find a candidate himself while searching around Konoha.  His search took him a while but it wasn't long before he found someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had purple hair with hazel brown eyes, she was wearing a chain shirt and a jacket while eating dango.  He knew this was Anko, he remembered when she threw a kunai at him before the Forest of Death.  Having her would be fun, and get some punishment in.  With that in mind he took out the potion to begin his plan.  He approched her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anko.\"  He starting, she looked at him and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, the brat.\"  She cheered. \"Come and have something, but don't touch my dango!\"  He chuckled and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, have my own thing.\"  He showed her the potion \"Want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe in a bit, I want to talk to you first.\" Anko began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure what about?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First on the new look, no complaints mind you just curious.\"  Anko brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanted to try something new.\"  He mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me, next up how's your love life?\"  Anko wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well actually if you catch my drift.\"  He told her with a wink. She laughed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, life is too short to be a prude!\"  Anko chuckled, Menma laughed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I know it, I woke up to a lot of things.\"  He confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That drink there helped?\"  She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that.\"  He coyly said, she looked intrigued now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you have my curiosity, let me have a sip of that there.\"  Anko asked.

Naruto smirked at that as he was approaching Hinata's body.

Naruto grinned as he grabbed the potion back.  He gave it to Konohamaru himself to drink and since he's a guy the potion had no effect.  Taking it back he grinned at his 'rival'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck.\"  He winked before Naruto and his girlfriends went inside to greet Iruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he mean by that?\"  He asked himself, only to find both of the girls he's with giving him loving eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, girls?\" He began \"Why are you looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're the most handsome man in the world my love.\"  Moegi sighed in happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to her, I'm the one you truly want my love.\"  Hanabi insisted trying to earn his affections Moegi growled at her and she growled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls I don't know what's going on but can you not fight?\"  He asked, thinking they're playing a prank, but to his surprise they smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem my love.\" Moegi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to share you then.\"  Hanabi cooed as they both hugged him.

Along the way, they gathered many more recruits. One of them was the Princess of the Divine Dragons, a girl named Tiki. After Bantu and Marth were able to wake her from Gharnef's grasp, she happily joined them, becoming a little infatuated with Marth himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, we start a little while after the battle at the Fane of Ramon, where the army is resting for a while. \"A much needed break\" said Marth as he rested himself. He especially needed the break after the fighting. Then, he got a visitor. \"Mar-Mar!\" yelled a very young voice. Marth smiled and turned around to see Tiki right behind him. For a dragon princess over 1200 years old, she acted like a 10 year old due to lack of memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Marth thought it may be better that way for her. \"Hello Tiki, what do you need?\" he asks her politely. \"Where are we going?\" she asks in all her innocence. \"We're going to Grust first. Need to take care of them first. I'm sure you'll be ready then?\" he asks. \"You bet! Nobody can beat us!\" said the young princess. Marth laughed at her enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Tiki walks off to have a little alone time. As stated earlier, she was a little infatuated with the young Altean prince. However, she probably didn't really know it since she was so young in a manner of speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she comes across something in the nearby forest.</span></div></div>",

She suddenly felt very thirsty however. \"Hmm, well I am quite thirsty\" she said to herself. \"I guess a little drink wouldn't hurt\" she told herself as she took the top off of the bottle. Soon enough, she chugged down the vial of pink liquid, feeling odd as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, Tiki felt a little wierd. Her cheeks were rosy, as if she was blushing. \"Maybe I drank a little too much\" she told herself, oblivious to the real change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiki! Are you out there?\" asked a voice.

She had a slight infatuation for the Prince but she was feeling..as if it was much more than that. She suddenly felt rather shy, more so than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok?' asked Marth, seeing how red in the face she was. \"I-I'm fine really!\" she replied rather quickly. \"Ok\" said Marth smiling again. Tiki felt the urge to smile as well. 'He cares for me so much' came into her head. Due to being a kid mentally, Tiki had trouble understanding these feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she could say that she felt..good.

Although, while Tiki's affection was more childish (according to everyone else), her infatuation with the young prince stemmed from the more typical handsome prince saves the lovely princess thing. Of course, that started when Marth freed her from her years of captivity in prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the young, often stubborn, cleric came up to where Tiki just was. Of course, she was still in her little romantic fantasies. The ones Minerva would wish she would grow out of by now. However, just like Tiki, she was shaken out of her thoughts by her foot hitting something hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! What was that?!\" Maria yelled as she grabbed her injured foot. Then, she looked down and saw the blue vial on the ground. \"Oh, looks like someone dropped this.\" She said in her naivette. As she picked it up, she started thinking about how thirsty she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a small drink wouldn't hurt.\" The red haired princess said as she took off the top of the bottle and poured some into a cup. She brought it to her lips to have a little drink. She was interupted, however, by a familiar precence, one who didn't realize that Maria had just picked up a bottle off of the ground to have a drink, so the person thought that it was a drink that Maria had brought with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria! Could I have a drink?\" A voice from behind her asked. Maria poured out some more into another cup, which she handed to her companion, neither realizing that the bottle refilled itself.

The \"master thief\", as she self-proclaimed herself, was on the Western Isles, taking what treasure she could from the ruling nobles. In her mind, with all the back-breaking work the common folk did on this island, the Etrurian nobles hardle deserved the treasure, which gave Cath more than enough insentive to steal them. Not for herself of course, but to help the common people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after pilfering a couple chests, Cath noticed another in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot!\" she smirked to herself, walking over and picking the lock expertly. Inside the chest was something that was not familiar to Cath, and perplexed her a bit. It was a small vial, about the size of an elixir bottle. It was filled with an odd pink liquid, and the smell it gave off reminded Cath of strawberries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, did someone forget their purfume or something?\" asked Cath, slightly gagging at the thought. However, she could figure out from the vial it was in that it wasn't purfume. It obviously looked like a kind of drink. Come to think of it, it had been a while since Cath was able to swipe herself a drink outside of water. However, she wasn't that stupid. The battlefield wasn't the kind of place to drink something that she was unfamiliar with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, might be worth checking out once I get out of here\" she said to herself. Pocketing the vial, Cath began her escape, unlocking the nearby door and trying to get out. Thinking the view was clear, she stepped out, aiming for a quick escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha doing here, little lady?\" asked a male voice from behind her. Cath lightly gasped and looked behind her, seeing an enemy of the Soldier class looking at her. Carrying a steel lance, his voice carried serious intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Crud! I was so close too!'<i> thought Cath. Cath knew she was in trouble if this soldier was skilled. His lance had an advantage over her tiny iron sword. However, there was no way she could get out of this without clashing blows at least once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you with that Pherean's army? If so, prepare to die!\" said the soldier, preparing his lance, as he apparently wasn't expecting an answer. He had already answered it for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If I can dodge his initial strikes, I think my speed can get me out of here'</i> thought Cath as she unsheathed her iron sword. She was a Thief after all, not a class fit for direct combat. Her iron sword was slightly modified, looking more like a knife or dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier struck first, lunging his lance forward. Despite being a steel lance, he was pretty quick with it. Unfortunately, a little quicker than Cath predicted. Bringing her sword up, she somewhat deflected the blow. However, her weapon was a poor choice for this fight, and she didn't have the muscle to outright block his strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier grinned as he analyzed her actions. He knew exactly what he was dealing with: an experienced thief but hardly worhty for combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow!\" said the soldier as he quickly struck again. Cath's redirect wasn't near enough to get him off balalnce from his first lunge, making a second strike all the easier and quicker. Using every ounce of her instincts, Cath tried to turn her body away to sidestep the dodge. However, it wasn't nearly enough, and the soldier's lance struck a great blow to the side of her right thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh!\" cried Cath as she fell to the ground hard. It wasn't a glancing blow, it was a direct strike that left a deep wound on her right high. Her skirt remained in tact, but her leg struggled to move with all the pain. Seething through the pain, Cath imagined that at least half her health was gone, if not more. Not to mention that the blood loss had almost numbed her leg, hindering any chance of escape for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'This isn't good! Gotta recover before he strikes again!'</i> thought Cath as she reached for bag of items she carried on her waist. At first, she was about to grab a vulnerary, but then decided against it. A vulnerary was better for smaller wounds. It wouldn't do her any good. Luckily, she had brought an elixir with her. That would patch her up enough to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath reached around in her bag for the elixir, smiling as she felt her hands grab a vial. The soldier wasn't waiting. She needed to hurry up and recover in time. Acting quickly, she grabbed the vial she had her hand on, quickly uncorked it with her mouth and drank it down heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow. This elixir tastes...different'</i> thought Cath. It had a very....strong taste to it, and actually tasted good, compared to past elixirs Cath had to ingest. If only she had noticed that the liquid wasn't the usual blue that elixirs were colored, but rather it was pink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this mental lapse gave the solider a free shot at Cath. Her mind was hardly focused on the solder now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you- AHHHH!\" shouted the soldier as he felt a blade pass through his heart. Looking down, he saw the thin blade of a rapier before his eyes glazed over and his last breath left him. Cath heard the sound of the sword slice and started to turn around to face her savior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was too close\" said a soft masculine voice. Cath noticed that it was likely the guy who saved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Hmph, I could have taken him. What's this guy's problem?</i> though Cath, her usual stubbornness coming back to her. With her leg feeling a little better (but still needing some help), she turned to face her savior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the young son of Pherae himself. Roy.</i></i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cath immediately turned her head to give this guy a piece of her mind. However, right when she did and her eyes met her savior, her body froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Roy, the son of Marquess Pherae and leader of the army. The very same Roy who had encountered her before at Castle Toria and Castle Ostia. She lividly remembered their discussions.they had: talking about whether or not Cath's actions were justified. Cath really didn't feel much for the Pherean noble. To her, he was as clueless as the rest of them. To that end, he seemed perplexed as she left the 2nd time at Castle Ostia, as if something she did hit a nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while those past feelings came up, it wasn't quite what Cath immediately thought when she locked eyes with Roy. What came instead incredibly perplexed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were an amazing blue: a shade that seemed to embody the gentleness and compassion Roy was known for. Even among nobles, he was a handsome guy, and it made it all the better that he hardly cared for titles amongst his friends. His hair was a fiery red, just like his father, Eliwood, before him. Cath had seen these traits before, but now they couldn't leave her mind. She honestly couldn't move her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What is wrong with me? Why is he looking at me like that?'</i> thought Cath, somewhat arguing with herself to move. After briefly getting the blood off his rapier, Roy turned to Cath and his eyes widened in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cath? You made it here too?\" asked Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes\" stuttered Cath, confusing her even more. She never stuttered before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....I want to apologize\" said Roy, holding his head down a bit like a kid who been caught stealing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" asked Cath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time we met, I said some harsh things. I called you a villain without knowing about the things you had gone through\" said Roy, his sincerity showing in his words. For some reason, Cath actually felt moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Aw, that's actually kind of sweet'</i> thought Cath before she could stop. Where in the world did she come up with that thought. \"I-It's fine. I'm o-over it\" she stuttered again, trying to get her odd thought off her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I still don't think you're doing the right thing!\" said Roy, being a little more forceful than usual. Perhaps it was the certain tone, but Cath actually regained most of her senses with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a lot of nerve, saying that to me\" she replied. Roy recoiled a bit at her reply, but easily readied his next sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, give me a chance. Watch me\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Cath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When this war is over, I will make sure that the villages are restored to their former selves. I will see to it that the taxes villagers pay is put to proper use. So, until then, I would appreciate it if you would stop stealing\" said Roy. His voice never rose to a hostile tone during that speech, always maintaining a peaceful tone that he was known for. Cath honestly felt her heart racing as her face went slightly red. Roy, obviously, didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when would that be?\" Cath asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever this war ends. I can't say exactly but it will happen\" said Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You sure?\" asked Cath, that unsure tone coming back into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. In fact, why don't you come with us? You probably still don't really trust us, so I want you to see and watch us. I'll prove it to you\" said Roy, smiling as he said it and offered his hand to shake on it. Cath felt that warm feeling in her chest come back, as her hand seemingly moved on its own. Her hand gently grabbed Roys, and she honestly couldn't come up with words to describe it. Roy, on the other hand, was glad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm glad to have you\" said Roy. Cath once again couldn't come up with words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Why am I feeling like this? What happened?'</i> thought the confused thief. Her mind was snapped out of it when a green-haired archer yelled and ran towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Roy, we defeated the dragon!\" yelled Wolt, happy to deliver the good news. Roy smiled back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Well done. Too bad I was too busy to help\" said Roy. Wolt shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. In all honesty, you wouldn't have been much help. The defense of those Manakettes is crazy. The only reason we won is thanks to Lilina and Lugh. Oh, and of course Lugh's brother\" said Wolt. The last part confused Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His brother?\" asked Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, his brother Lleu. We ran into them and Lugh convinced him to come\" said Wolt, pointing over his shoulder. Roy and Cath looked over to see Lugh, a green-haired Mage, heckling another boy that looked just like him, with the exception of darker clothing. According to Wolt, Lleu was a Dark Mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lleu! Chad's waiting for us! Let's play!\" yelled Lugh, obviosuly happy to see his older twin sibling. Lleu's face was nothing short of frustrated at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time Lugh, I don't want to play. I grew out of those games long ago\" contested Lleu. Lugh, in his childish enthusiasm, pretty much ignored it and dragged Lleu over to where Chad, a Thief and a friend of theirs, waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, brotherly love\" laughed Wolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy chuckled along with him, while Cath just looked at Roy, the unsettling feeling in her chest still lingering on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What in the world did I just get into?'</i> was all she could think about.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon after the victory over the Manakette Aine, Eliphin informed Roy that they located a cabe that housed the legendary weapon of the Western Isles: the Thunder Axe, Armads. Naturally, Roy decided to pursue the axe, as getting each legendary weapon would be very important. After a little traveling, as the cave wasn't too far, Roy chose those who would enter the cave with him. After all, bandits had claimed the cave as their own, so they would need to be deal with first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe selected fighters were: Lilina, Clarine, Wolt, Lugh, Lleu, Dieck, Rutger, and (to some surprise) Cath. Roy figured that she was the strongest thief of the bunch, a fact that made her blush instantly. Lugh and Lleu were brought due to how their magic could help against the slow and clumsy fighters of the bandits. Lugh delighted in fighting alongside his brother. However, the feeling wasn't mutual, at least judging my Lleu's exasperated expression. Clarine was the most effective healer and Rutger was a terror against axe-wielders. Liline offered good magic and support with Roy. Dieck had his own sword skills and Wolt was effective at long-range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cave was dark, as to be expected. Grero's bandit forces had spread all around, attempting to take the treasure in the cave for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, there are 2 main pathways here. Lilina, Wolt, Cath and myself will go this way. You guys cover our rear on the other side. You'll face a lot of bandits most likely so Clarine will stay with you. Agreed?\" commanded Roy. There was a collective \"Yes sir!\" throughout the group, except for Rutger who almost never talked. Cath was surprised to see herself cheer along, a fact that confused her to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Why am I acting this way?'</i> she continuously wondered. Unfortunately, she never made the connection to the pink vial she found earlier, thinking that it was still a normal elixir. Not only that, she had left said vial back with Merlinus. Unknowingly to her, it had magically refilled itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the group went their separate ways, fighting the bandits along the way. At the groups back end, Lugh and Lleu made quick work of whatever bandits they could attack, safely behind reasonable barriers with Dieck and Rutger. Rutger was nearly untouchable, even while enduring Clarine trying to talk to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wolt, you and Lilina scout over there. I see a couple of bandits. Shouldn't be too hard for you to take them out before they see you\" said Roy. Wolt and Lilina nodded and followed their orders, although Lilina tossed a worried look back at Roy before leaving. Seeing this somehow made Cath feel a small pang in her chest, but she ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cath, how about you take care of these treasure chest over here? You should be fast enough to deal with those bandits\" said Roy in his usual kind tone that never left his voice even when giving orders. Cath found herself giving a bit of a salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. They'll be no problem\" said Cath, a smile on her face the whole time. She immediately went off to fulfill her part of the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's gotten really cooperative\" muttered Roy to himself. Not that he objected in anyway, but it was nice to see Cath getting along so well. At least, that's how it was from his point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath herself couldn't figure out why she was so willing to fulfill Roy's request. Not too long ago, she thought he was a stupid noble like the others. Now, she seemed to be happily following his command like anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is up with me? I mean, this feels nice somehow. But why?\" she constantly wondered. Anyway, her train of thought was broken when an axe-wielding bandit appeared near the chest she was aiming for. Even in the darkness of the cave, Cath was easily capable of dealing with such a slow fighter. It barely took any time for her to slit the bandit's throat with her iron knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pilfering the chest, she found her way back to Roy. The gang was nearing the spot where the bandit leader, Grero, was waiting. The bandit seemed initially stunned that so many had beaten his gang, but he didn't back down. The leader ran down and began clashing with Roy, who was too fast to take a bad hit from his steel axe. He was then stunned when a direct Thunder spell from Lilina struck him, which made things easier when a direct Elfire strike from Lugh made him stagger backwards, low on health. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasy pickings for the others, Rutger came in, slashing him across the chest with his Killing Edge. As the leader fell, Cath, who had stayed away on Roy's orders, ran over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" she asked as she helped him to his feet. Roy wasn't hurt, but the force was fighting back with the strong bandit leader exhausted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm ok. Thanks\" said Roy, making Cath blush again. After investigating the throne in the back, the Thunder Axe Armads was discovered. The blade was a hulk of a weapon, befitting it's former wielder, Darbos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing such a weapon didn't deter Cath from her thoughts, which seemed to intensify as time went on.</span></div></div>",

After consulting with King Caineghis of Gallia, the group traveled back to war-torn Crimea and boarded a ship. Their destination: the Begnion Empire, grandest of all nations on the continent of Tellius. The story happened ony way. This is another way, with many twists of fate transforming the lives of the warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the mercenaries and their friends were resting after a battle with some ravens from Kilvas. They made for tough foes so they really needed the rest. They were approximately 3/4 of the way to Begnion, with about a week or so left before they reached it's shores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss! Time to fight me!\" yelled a feminine voice from the deck. Everyone knew that voice well. It was Mia, a mercenary hired by the Crimean Army who latered joined Ike's group. A myrmidon obsessed with finding her 'white-robed rival', the girl never took no for an answer. After traveling with the group for a while, she had 'fallen in love' with Ike's sword style, although how that was interpreted was never divulged. Anyway, it was barely sunrise, but everyone knew that's when Mia got up so they were used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Now?\" asked a groggy Ike. He was a hard worker but even he wasn't much of a morning person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I've been dieing to try again after you beat me after our last match!\" said Mia, completely excited with fire burning in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't really much of a match\" muttered Ike. It really wasn't; Ike barely had to try to beat her. That's how far they were in skill. However, there was no escaping this so he sparred with her. Long story short; Ike won, convincingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's no good! I'll get you next time though!\" said Mia, her smiled on her face and no lost confidence on her. Ike sighed but smiled at the energy of the female myrmidon. She would need such energy if they were to defeat Daein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after the spar, Mia went off to the dining area to get a drink. She was thirsty after that fight. However, she ended up finding an odd vile on the table with an interesting color of fluid in it.</span></div></div>",

She was always eager to try new things. However, she soon got a visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mia, how are you this morning?\" asked a soft female voice. It was Princess Elincia of Crimea. She was Ike's charge in this war and Ike's job was to guard her. Elincia never really stoof on ceremony and got along well with the merenaries, which was in part thanks to her odd upbringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm good. I came this close to beating Ike!\" said Mia, bringing her right thumb and index finger together to get her point across. Elincia smiled, even though she pretty much guess that it was no where near that close a match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what's that?\" asked Elincia, pointing to the vial in Mia's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this? Just something I found in here. You want some? Let's share\" said Mia. Elincia didn't see the danger in such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok sure\" said Elincia as she grabbed herself a cup and Mia poured the whole vial into the two cups. There wasn't much in the small vial. Without a second thought, the two girls drank down the odd drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not bad. That felt goo...\" started Mia before she started to feel faint. In an instant, both of the girls fainted on the ground, unaware of what they had just done to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho to follow now?</span></div></div>",

She looked down and realized that she was not wearing her usual princess dress that she had been wearing this whole time. She was wearing a small orange garment that was sleeveless and the 'skirt' as you could call it was small, hardly similar to the large ballroom skirt Elincia's dress had. Her legs were covered by black stockings with typical black footwear. Her forearms were also covered similarly. She turned her head and grabbed a piece of her hair. It was purple (sort of).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?\" she asked herself, thinking that she must be dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok? Did you hit your head when you fell?\" asked Ike.

'That's not my voice!' She thought. She looked down to see that she was still wearing the school uniform, but she noticed that her bust was significantly smaller than usual. Not only that, she couldn't feel her usually long hair on her back. She grabbed her hair and noticed that not only was it short, it was black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What happened?\" She stammered.

And those students study, not conventional school topics, but psychic powers. The technology used in this city is twenty-to-thirty years ahead of the outside world, so the whole city is essentially one big experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouma Kamijyo, the weakest Level Zero psychic \u2013 the lowest of the low \u2013 was sitting on a park bench, lamenting his typically abysmal luck (just today, he had dropped a ten-thousand-yen bill and had it blown away by the wind, and while chasing it, he had enraged Mikoto Misaka, aka Shocker because she was a temperamental Level Five Electromaster, by accidentally peeking up her skirt, and had to fight her off while attempting to explain the situation, and in so doing, lost the bill forever), when he saw something in the bushes behind him. \u201cWhat is this\u2026?\u201d he said aloud, twisting around to reach it. This proved inefficient, so because he had nothing better to do at the moment, he leaned forward to try and reach it. Thankfully, the bench was nailed down, so Touma was able to reach a lot farther than he normally would because the bench wouldn\u2019t tip over on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more inches\u2026 and\u2026 got it! Touma grabbed the thing (which was a preservation jar filled with some kind of liquid), and no sooner did he grab it, than he heard a very unwelcome voice behind him saying, \u201cHey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap! It was Mikoto Misaka. Touma lost his grip on the bench and fell into the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Touma?\u201d Mikoto asked. She was looking at Touma in a way that reminded him of their first meeting. She was holding a can of soda in her right hand, and a can of curry in her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouma scrambled to his feet, ready to fight, and was surprised when she threw the soda at him, which he caught. Not only was this a shockingly ineffective attack coming from her (or anyone), but Touma didn\u2019t see her as the kind of person to waste maybe three hundred yen on a soda can from a vending machine when she could get it for free with either a high kick or a blast of electricity. And since the security droids (which looked like private-use garbage cans that could move) weren\u2019t there, she must have bought it legally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Touma could say was, \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, okay?\u201d Mikoto said, flushing slightly and turning her head to the left. \u201cAnd\u2026 I lost you that ten thousand yen, so consider this repayment. So would you stop hiding in the bushes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouma worked his way back to the bench and sat in it, still holding the jar and the soda. \u201cThanks, and I accept, but you really don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d He popped the tab on the soda, and it sprayed him in the face. \u201cSuch misfortune,\u201d he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto popped the tab on her curry, drank out of it slightly, and immediately spit it out. \u201cWhat the hell? I thought I got a lemon soda!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for not paying attention,\u201d Touma said unsympathetically. He drank deeply of his soda, which wasn\u2019t really to his tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you supposed to sympathize with me here or something?\u201d Mikoto asked. \u201cAt least give me that other thing you\u2019re holding!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, this?\u201d Touma asked, holding up the jar. \u201cI found this in the bushes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, just give it here!\u201d Mikoto said impatiently, taking it away from him before he could react. She unscrewed the top and drank the entire thing\u2019s contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat color was the potion?</span></div></div>",

Find out if he has any other weapons or experiments, or any other activities in that area before, and if possible, destroy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Admiral. But am I supposed to do this mission alone?\", Erio asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are a little underhanded right now, with the relief and repair operations we've been doing lately, so I can't form a permanent team for this mission. Of course, I'm granting you the permission to have a single partner for support but just one other, in order to maintain secrecy for this mission. I prefer you would pick one of your comrades from Riot Force 6, since you are all familiar with the case.\" said Midget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am, I would ask if one of them is available for this mission, and will complete it without fail.\", Erio said with a hint of seriousness in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, but don't invite one of the girls just because she is your crush, Erio!\", the Admiral teased him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no ma'am, I won't invite them just for that!\", he said as he hurriedly salutes and leaves the office to hide his blushing face.</span></div></div>",

        "created":1279216920,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Powerful potions make there way into the worlds of anime, cartoons, and video games, and it will cause major chaos. In the case of a video game world, the story must focus on a male character who is playable in the storyline of that game (meaning not just in bonus content and/or a multiplayer option, unless there are no male characters who fit that description), and in the case of an anime or cartoon world, the story must focus on either the protagonist or another male main character, unless one doesn't exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPotions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove potion: Causes the girl who drinks it to fall madly in love with the first male non relative she sees, and if she already loves him, be unable to hide or deny it (even from herself as the case sometimes seems to be), overcoming any shyness in the process (if the girl in question doesn't realize her feelings, she will suddenly realize them). She will be so much in love that she will do anything the male wants, and she won't ever fall out of love with him. At first she will try to fight off any girl she thinks is trying to steal away the affection of the boy she loves, but as she will do anything he wants, he only needs to tell her not to. This potion is pink<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave potion: Enslaves the girl who drinks it to the first male she sees (even if it's a relative). Once enslaved, the girl can't disobey any commands from the guy she's enslaved to if he wants her to do it (so if he accidentally says something sarcastically, or uses a figure of speech, she won't carry it out if he doesn't want her to), unless it isn't possible for her to do so, but she'll still try. The girl doesn't have to like the guy, she can even hate him, but even if she tries, she can't go against his orders, unless it involves changing her true emotions or opinions towards someone, If he tells her to act a certain way, or say a certain thing, she will, even if she doesn't want to (For example, if this potion is used on Sakura to enslave her to Naruto, he could make her act like she loves him and hates Sasuke, even if she doesn't). This potion is sky blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBody swap potion: Causes two people to switch bodies if drank. The potions' effects work for the souls of the people, not the bodies, so if a girl drinks a potion, and the boy who is the target of the potion's effects switches bodies with someone else, the girls won't love/be a slave to the body of the boy, but to the actual boy in another body. This potion is blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTG potion: When a boy drinks it, it turns the boy into a girl permanently (doesn't turn girls into boys, and can't be used on the person the story is focusing on). If you use this, then please put a link to a picture of the female version of the boy in the chapter the TG happens. This potion is red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale clone potion: Creates a female clone of a guy who drinks it (even the character the story is focusing on). Like with the above, please put a link to a picture of the female clone in the chapter she's created. The DNA of the clone will be made different by the potion however, so it wouldn't be incest if she gets under the effect of the love potion to the original, it does nothing to a female, except if it's a female clone of a male character, in which case, it will alter the DNA. If the character has some condition that causes them to have a gender switch that isn't controlled by them, but keeps the same mind, this will fully separate them, just with the girl version being a more feminine version of her original. This potion is purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeparation potion: If there are two or souls/spirits sharing one body, if the person has more than one personality, or if there is something sealed away in someone, this potion, can separate the souls, creating another body for that soul (the souls must leave on their own after the potion is used, so if one isn't aware of what's going on, it won't work), with no negative consequences to either of the two (if it is the main character who uses this, both/all parts will be the main character if they are both/all males, except if it is just to remove something sealed inside). This potion is yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransformation potion: Turns a character who isn't humanoid/human into a humanoid or full human. This potion is green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge potion: Changes a girl's age to the age of the first boy she looks at. This potion is orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGhost potion: Gives the person who drinks it ghost powers. Only the main character, or a girl who is under the effects of the love, slave, mind lock, and multi-body potion can use this. Along with the standard invisibility, being able to pass through things, and possession abilities, the one who uses the potion can find and use the memories of whoever they are possessing. This potion is light green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind lock potion: If a girl drinks this potion, it locks her mind away so that she can't think, beyond knowing how to do what she is ordered to do by the one she is bound to. The girl is then bound to the first male she sees, having to do whatever he orders  (with the exception of being ordered for her mind to no longer be locked away), and if it is impossible, she'll keep trying until she is either killed or ordered otherwise by the one she is bound to. When she has no orders left to carry out, she will just stand/sit where she is and not do anything at all, with the exception of breathing, as if she is a living doll (which she basically is). The only ways to counter this are the love potion and multi-body potion, and as such, the mind lock potion won't work if the girl is under the effects of the love potion or mult-ibody potion. If someone uses the ghost potion to possess her, they can still access her mind, she just can't use it. This potion is bronze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulti-body potion: If a boy drinks this potion at the same time as a girl or multiple girls, the girl or girls' mind(s) will disappear, and the boy will be in all of their bodies (the girl or girls' minds can never come back). The boy will have all of the girl or girls' memories, and thus, know everything about them. The bodies will start off all making the same actions at the same time, and the boy has to learn how to move the bodies separately. This potion is violet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the exception of the transformation potion, all of the above only work on humanoids/humans. I'm open for suggestions of more potions, but that doesn't mean I'll take them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potions won't work on girls who are married, unless they are widowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo gay/lesbian stuff or incest. Romance between a boy in a girl's body/form and a boy in their own body is ok, but if that is used, then the boy must stay in the girl's body permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I find out that someone who adds has stolen someone else's chapter, and then posted it as their own, then I'll delete it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse proper grammar and spelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStick to the story that's going on, don't switch it all the sudden without any explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there is ever a debate on the gender of a character, then ask me, and I'll decide. Characters that are counted as female:<br>\r\nHaku (There is no way that Haku is a boy in my opinion, and I've got a few reasons).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion from Kingdom Hearts is a female clone of Sora, but since her form is made based on his memories of Kairi, she doesn't have his DNA, and instead has Kairi's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm going to give 300 to anyone who makes an actual chapter without breaking one of my rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf someone ends the story, I'll either remake the chapter so that it isn't over, or get rid of it if it isn't use able at all. If I keep it then you'll get half the gift points, if I don't, then you get no gift points for the chapter.</td>",
