He turned around to find Andrea staring at him, her eyes blood red. \"Meshnel... Where is my demon essence?\" she asked is the sweetest voice one could imagine, the tone itself filled even Meshnel with a small amount of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeshnel blanched slightly. \"Listen, I need you to find Feanaro and talk to him. I need to meditate on recent developments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in the camp... now... tell me... what exactly... happened... to MY demon essence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't exactly tell you, that's what I'm trying to meditate on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea paused for a moment, trying to decide between slahing the mans face or incinerating everything within 20 yards of herself. She took the latter option as this wouldn't kill him, only give him the scent of smoke for a few hours. Which explained the odd odour as the two of them walked back into the camp they'd set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temper temper...\" Meshnel mumbled to himself, taking a seat on top of the carriage as he began to think. It was going to be a long, painful day......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feanaro allowed a brief smile to play over his features as the demoness and the mage took a seat around the fire outside their shelter. They were hiding under a huge mass of wards and deflection runes in an attempt to prevent discovery by every skilled mage in the entire continent that was at the Pleasure Cult's bidding. Feanaro muttered a curse under his breath, that's where it had all started, the damn Pleasure Cult. He even recalled with bitter resentment how such a foolish journey had begun. He had been severely bored and had chanced upon an old file he had stashed away some two hundred years earlier. The file had been a small summary of an invasion he had lead into a rather unimportant and insignificant realm after sowing agents of perversion and corruption some twenty years prior to his attack. The report had detailed how his agents had been exposed mere weeks before the attack and as such almost every single agent, all demonesses or sorceresses greatly skilled in the arts of sexual orientated magic and moral corruption, had been purged by the current ecclesiarch. The realm's forewarning of his attack had proved sufficient enough that while Feanaro could have wiped them all out his spare resources were not enough to make the endeavor worth the effort. So four months into the invasion and with only half the realm under his control Feanaro had withdrawn and left not a single one of his troops behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it would turn out that apparently a few members of the pleasure cult Feanaro had planted in the realm before his attack had managed to survive the purging since two hundred years later the pleasure cult had re-established itself and not only had it grown it had become the only religion of the realm! It was a guild in theory but since religion had disappeared with the elimination of all churches and devout believers of the old religion the pleasure cult had offered company and satisfaction in a war-torn ravaged world. The cult had taken off and now the Pleasure Cult was rumored to have more power than the king. Curious to see what a world would be like where the only religion was based around a sex cult he had established himself some two hundred years earlier Feanaro had called on one of his allies and his close friends to enjoy and learn from such a rare experience. At least that had been the plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever upon entering incognito to the first village they came across, a small village that none the less possessed a population of almost 500 he had estimated, things had turned pear shaped. A public embarressment spectacle by two lowly sorceresses of the pleasure cult on a few village girls had irked Meshnel into sufficient anger to teach them a similar lesson. <i>That was the first mistake, Feanaro thought to himself.</i> After that the group had rented an entire tavern for their private use while the groups had split off into three separate groups to learn what they could about the realm since Feanaro had last been there. However due to a chop-happy Aner the result had been killing the Pleasure Cult's local demonic avatar. That had led to a greater problem, before Aner had chopped the demon avatar in half she had emblazoned a rune on her back, the purpose of which would be revealed shortly after as Feanaro would attempt to overcharge the rune, filling it with so much magic that the rune would shatter. The attempt had been successful however the cost had been a high one. Aner's body had been filled with shadow energy and as she was so much in tune with shadow energy the energy had been swiftly absorbed by her body and stored. The energy that had been neccessary to break the rune had however left Aner with breast and a behind each the size of basketballs and a belly the size of two at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Rena had wanted to try to at least partially shrink Aner and so had asked for Andrea, Feanaro's demoness, to create her a demon essence that consisted of the magic elements present in the realm most heavily which had turned out to be sex and shadow magic. Feanaro had allowed Rena to try to shrink Aner at least partially by examining the demon essence Andrea had made and while the effects had been less than desired it was enough to make the clone mobile again. Due to his absence at the time Andrea had then entrusted the demon essence temporarily to Meshnel who had placed it in a magic box reinforced with runes to suppress it's corrupting influence. However Meshnel had made a critical error, the wrong rune had been engraved on the box and instead of making it a containment rune it become a tracking rune. Hardly useful as Meshnel had then walked around for several days with it's sexual corruption slowly tainting most of the members of the group as he kept it in his pocket. That night after Rena had partially purged Aner of the shadow energy and Andrea had lost to Askurei in a drinking competition the tavern had been attack by the remaining Pleasure Cultists amd their thugs, a force numbering nearly one hundred in total. The battle had ended in a victory for Feanaro and his allies but the tavern had been set alight and the group was forced to flee before the mages of the capital arrived and made the situation significantly more challenging. It had taken half a days worth of riding into and out of the various levels of hell and into the current realm before Feanaro had lost his mage hunters and which point the group had gone to ground and rested for the remainder of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had followed next was were Feanaro got vaguely irritated. According to Meshnel, upon his realisation of the mistake in the rune markings a demon in the guise of Andrea had appeared and said she would take back the demon essence before reappearing shortly after and attempting to murder Meshnel. While the attack had failed Meshnel had failed to either kill or capture the demon and it's appearance, let alone it's identity was still unknown to the group. And with the demon essence in her possession, and thus presumably the Pleasure Cult it would only be a matter of time before they figured out how to use such a object to their advantage. In the worse case scenario the essence could be analysed sufficiently to take control of the real Andrea and Aner too if they were really unlucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeanro cursed again and stared into the fire near him and his allies. There were Rena and Aner still with them, the holy paladin and her shadow wielding clone, though due to a recent prank by Askurei and Andrea both weren't quite their normal size. Rena the holy paladin, a dark elf her race called themselves, sat down on a log and rested her large water filled breasts that now were approximately the sized of basketballs on her legs as she leaned in to take in the full warmth of the fire. There was an audible slosh and Rena shot a look at everyone that the first comment about her breasts were discover the true meaning of holy retribution. Aner on the other hand while a shadow clone of Rena was in every regards an exact copy of her original self bar the fact she used shadow not holy magic, at least she had been an exact copy. There was also the fact she was a bit more Aggressive than Rena was. While it was true Rena had partially shrunken Aner down Askurei, as reward for besting Andrea in the drinking contest, had demanded to be taught any many of Andrea's demonic succubus magical techniques as possible, the result had been Rena's breasts filling with water while she had bathed and Aner's holding in the air she had breathed in while sunbathing. Aner now sat on the verge between being incapable of fighting with her body, while Rena would have to adjust to a new centre of gravity and quickly by the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeanaro cast a glance at Adjara, the only member who seemed to have avoided both ill luck and attack throughout the course of their journey. Adjara was unique to put it in Feanaro's own words, she was a being made from his own soul and composed of exactly 50% pure evil and 50% pure good and had the useful, if sometimes embarassing ability to absorb any magic energy she came into direct contact with. Appearance wise she appeared to be a mere black haired catgirl who simply had the scary ability to conjure a twin pair of blades or Katar out of nowhere. She sat in the tree at the moment, watching the skies every now and then before turning back to watching the roads nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeanaro sighed. \"Well with this new development we definitely have a problem. We can continue on to the capital or else try and track this demon down that stole the demon essence. Both are important but I would prefer we stay as a group, so we'll have to make a choice... Which is more important to us?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aner was having less difficulty, but that was because of the power rush she got from being on this dark and evil planet. Should they return to earth, Aner would have trouble being mobile in her state. Vice versa, while Rena was still powerful here, she would be much stronger on a planet beloved by the light, like Earth, and would be able to carry herself more easily.<br>\r\n\"But if I must put up a point..\" Meshnel began, brushing ash off of his cloak from Andrea's attack, \"If the cult is as strong as you say, their base is likely in the capital, where their hold could spread farthest. And the essence is likely to be taken to their base. So, one leads to the other. We're going to the capital either way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeanaro nodded. \"It is settled then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena and Aner glared at Andrea, though not nearly as vehemently as they had been under the essence's influence. While the essence of the demon Aner killed had not affected Meshnel, Andrea, or Feanaro, Adjara and Askurei had become a bit more perverse, Askurei also becoming more mischievous, and at the same time, Rena and Aner had down-right gotten meaner. It had taken a counter-essence, Meshnel's own, to revert these affects, and while the three of Meshnel's friends were grateful to him, none of them knew what Adjara was thinking, or how she felt, considering his first attempt to help her ended up slightly damaging her. Only on his second attempt had he properly administered his own essence. Each of them now carried a piece of Meshnel inside them, though he doubted they knew it. He also doubted they knew they could draw power from him, en vice versa as well. Feanaro was likely the only one with any inkling to that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you staring at me?\" Andrea asked, feigning innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena coughed, making her not-so-subtle assets bounce noticably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault. Blame Askurei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was under the essence's influence, like us. You weren't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, that's suddenly an excuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you, stop arguing.\" Meshnel and Feanaro said at once, both of them instantly quieting. Meshnel looked at Feanaro, and continued. \"We need to get our rest for the morning, so that means no arguing all the time. Get some sleep, as much as you two can.\" he said, indicating the two elves with their bloated forms. They nodded, and laid down by the fire, trying to find peace in sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: They are attacked in the night, possibly leading to more growth. This will have to be fought off in main by Meshnel, Feanaro, and Andrea, as the others are still recovering from their corruption and are still a tad dazed, as well as the fact that Rena and Aner have to get used to their forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption2: They sleep peacefully, but their sleep isn't so peaceful. Their dreams are whirling, Aner and Rena sharing a connection of their dreams, due to their background, and all of the others are also having nightmares or very important dreams. The morning comes with much comic relief and they set out on their journey.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feanaro sat before the low burning fire and gazed into it, it's warm glow casting evil shadows behind him. Several hours had passed since everyone had gone to bed and Feanaro sat around the low burning fire, occassionally adding a bit more magic to it to keep it burning. \"Do you find sleep hard to find? Or is there something on your mind?\" he whispered as Meshnel emerged from one of the tents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm an early riser and I slept perfectly?\" replied the mage with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doubtless. Unless approximately 2am in the morning is your ides of an early rise... that and you only went to bed two hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeshnel shrugged. \"One of the few bonuses to having demon traits is that you can function just fine for several days without sleep if need be. Well what's your excuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need sleep, not unless i want to... that and Adjara snores dreadfully when she's nervous. She may not look it but she understands our plight just as deeply as you or I. A demon entity with an entire realm's magic and resources to call upon is most likely aware of our position and may even possess the power to kill both of us if we're not careful. I don't know about you but just because I'm immortal doesn't mean a few too many sword blades sticking in my ribcage won't kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few? You'll have to show me that trick.\" remarked Meshnel with a slight chuckle. \"But honestly I just came out because we're so damn exposed here, wards or not. That damn demoness bitch from earlier knows where we are and it would only take an hour or so to summon sufficient magical forces to a specific location if this demon has as much power as we expect. An attack could come at any moment and we've got nowhere to run to for cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we'll be under attack in the space of about two minutes or so actually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeshnel spat out his recently summoned beverage and grabbed his sword. \"What? I didn't sense anything! How long have they been here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I onlt just noticed them now. They have disabled all the wards successfully up to the last one, where the mage got a litle too careless and triggered it for a second or two. So if you wouldn't mind waking the others so at least as they attack we'll have weapons in our hands. I'll hold odd one of their waves off and give the other waves coming in from different directions a moments pause.\" With that Feanaro stood up and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeshenl swore and sent out a telepathic message into all the others, jerking them awake. \"We're under attack, grab your weapons and defend yourselves! Rena, Aner I don't want you to press the attack, just engage those that get past any of the others and make it to you. You're too much of a liability in combat with your new bodies.\" Meshnel ended his message there. Feanaro would already have issued orders to Adjara and Andrea. Just as well he had finished his message by then as a bolt of lightning suddenly shot out from the darkness towards him. Meshnel gave a wave of his hand and deflected the blast with minimal effort, noticing that the bolt of blue lightning that came from the mage had also illuminated another 4 or so people in red robes around her. He sighed. It also got tricky when there were more than one spellslinger at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe teleported into their midst and unleashed a basic fire dome around himself with a quick spell and forced the mages to jump outside the ring. However one man, clad in several peices of what was obviously magically reinforced plate armor and carrying a huge tower shield simply took the attack and allowed the fire near him to be absorbed by the shield. The man then charged in towards him, sword in his spare arm pointing while using his shield to absorb any further magic attacks, like an old roman soldier almost. Meshnel easily teleported behind the young soldier and was about to run him through when about three or so lightning blasts launched themselves at his back, forcing him to teleport away just in time. <i><br>\r\nDamn! They're pretty skilled at fighting as a group, I might outmatch them in power easily but with their co-ordination this might take longer than i can afford.</i> Meshnel thought to himself as he reappeared behind one of the mages, only to have three of the mages throw up a barrier around the mage, deflecting Meshnel's blade. He raised his arm for a second strike with which to hopefully break through the barrier but the soldier was already at his flank, sword raised to the side of his shield, while the last two mages furled another few lightning bolts at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the dark Adjara had teamed up with Askurei as the two worked togther to sew chaos among the many other waves, halting their attack on the main camp as Adjara would appear before them and attack distract them. Usually getting into melee with any nearby soldiers, forcing the mages to rotate  around the two of them to get a viable shot at the cat-girl as she jumped around the soldiers, her blades flashing, parrying and striking out at the men with magic-prood shields. Normally her attack would strike enchanted armor or shields but on occassion she would strike a glancing blow on one of the attackers and leave him open to a follow-up attack like a katar to his neck and up into his brain. But this was primairily a disraction so that Askurei could sneak up behind one of the mages and neatly run one of his daggers through their heart, dropping them silently and unnoticably.<br>\r\n It wasn't untill Adjara teleported behind one of the remaining mages and the sorceress threw up her barrier she realised that the other mages, who were supposed to be reinforcing her shield were dead, allowing Adjara's attack to break through the barrier with enough ease. However it was time consuming and both Askurei and Adjara were aware that for every group they eliminated another one got past them. They could only hope that Meshnel and Feanaro were faring better than them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeshnel however wasn't faring so well, working solo meant he was forced to exert large amount of magic to break through their barriers in single blows and even then, reinforced by four others he didn't always succeed. Obviously these spellcasters were not only skilled but channeling one of the higher up demon's energy. And a fair amount too if he/she was able to empower so many people to such a degree. But the main concern he had was that he had to use so much magic, it was really starting to tire him. He had ablready eliminated about 30 people, five groups worth and there always seemed to be one more group, ready to strike from the darkness the moment he thought that he might have dealt with the final group and they were armed with the knowledge of his previous exhibited combat abilities too, dragging on the fight even longer. Still... there couldn't be too many left. Soon the attacks would stop... surely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack within the camp site Rena and Aner tried to hold their own against a group of swordsmen and women who had gotten past Feanaro and Meshnel, while there was only about six of them in Rena's expanded state every single one of her sword swings sent her off balance and forced Aner to step in with a parry to prevent her twin from being cut in riposte. Though Aner was much more full-figured being in a shadow warped world such as this enabled her to move with enough enhanced strength and speed that she able to negate her bigger figure to a degree. Still it was only a matter of time Rena figured before her edowments brought them both down. <i>Now that is an interesting idea. So heavy you can't stand. If you survive wanna give it a try?</i> came a telpathic whisper. \"Andrea! Damn you, you perverted demon. This is your fault we're fighting for our life and losing so badly!\" cursed Rena as she blocked a crude swing aimed at her head and tried to follow the attack through with a swipe at the women's overextended swordarm. The lunge almost tipped her over and as she was forced to drive her blade into the ground to stop her inertia bringing her down Aner used some of her shadow energy to speed herself up enough to dive over to her twin and block the swordswoman's partner's counter attack. But a third swordsmwoman who had been studying the two of them had been waiting for this moment and lunged forward with his blade, aiming at Aner's exposed rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now.\" chided the demon, materialising behind the man who had been waiting for his chance to attack and driving her extended nails through his skull, freezing his body mid attack before Andrea lifted the body, still attached to her right hand and effortlessly tossed the corpse over her shoulder, the body sliding loose with a sickening sucking sound. \"If you're not open to that how about at least a little reward for saving your twin's life?\" She smiled as the remaining five swordsmen and women were forced to reposition themselves with the appearance of a new foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you!\" retorted Aner as she took up a defensive stance to her remaing two opponents. \"You're the reason we're like this! Why should we thank you for anything?\" She dodged the first attack that came at her, a swing at her head, and used the weilder's remaing momentum to overbalance and give her a shot at her other opponent, allowing her to slice through his swordarm. The appendage and blade dropped to the ground with a scream of pain and the woman dropped to the ground, rolling clutching the bloody stump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Askurei's fault to be honest. He beat me and on my honor as a demon i was forced to train him in whatever demon techniques he wanted. Besides, you were there when you heard him ask it. Hell you even said you didn't mind. What did you think i was going to teach him? I'm a succubus! Did you think I was going to show him how to teleport into hell? Or make demon contracts?\" Andrea slashed one of the swordsmen's chests and red blood squirted out from the five long lines that went diagonally alon his entire torso. The other swordsman cried out in shock as her partner was cut and raised her sword to strike back at the demon in vengeance but the demon disappeared from sight and materialised behind her. A moment later her body ignited as Andrea pressed a rune into her back with her left hand, the right one shooting a fireball at a sorceress who burst unto the scene from behind one of the sents. The sorceress countered with a water spell of her own that caused a large explosion as the two opposing elemental magics made contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would almost have been preferable!\" snarled Rena as she finally defeated her single opponent, using her extra weight to add force behind her as she broke through her opponent's guard when the two had locked blades. She then was able to help Aner finish off her last opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow I doubt that. The way you two reacted to the arousal spells Askurei threw at both of you you're more suseptible than I would have suspected. Meaning this wasn't your first experience with sex magic or your first consentual experience either. Besides from the way you two were reacting at the spring as you expanded I'd think you were almost enjoying it. But I suppose i could have been reading that wrong... Pleasuring yourself and moaning in enjoyment obviously went you were fighint it the whole way... right?\" The demon laughed as she halted the water spell the sorceress threw at her, keeping the ball condensed in her extended right hand. With another light laugh she teleported behind the mage, knocking her spell staff from her hand as she turned around. \"My gift to you.\" she whispered to the sorceress, blowing on the ball of water in her open palm as she held it in front of the sorceress's face. The water take upon a life of it's own as the demoness's breath caressed it. Expanding to half the size of a full sized adult the water then jumped from Andeea's hand and forced itself down the sorceress' throat, litre by litre. The effect was almost instant. The young woman, grabbed her breasts, a somewhat impressive C-cup initially surged forth, instantly causing her form fitting red dress to rip in a few places to allow for her breasts new size. \"Obviously a battle mage.\" remarked Andrea. \"Her dress doesn't expand whatsoever to accomodate her better figure. What an oversight on the designer's behalf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress raised one of her hands away from her chest in a vain attempt to stop the water spell from filling her but the pressure behind the water was too great to make any effective barrier and Andrea made sure to keep her arousal spell up to mess with her opponent's mind enough to prevent her casting a spell, though soon it was obvious that probably wasn't the only reason Andrea maintained the spell. Her arms which had been wrapped around her chest, trying to suppress the expansion vainly, moved back slwoly as her hands unclenched and began to massage her own breasts. A gurgle came through as the sorceress moaned in pleasure at the feelings in her chest. As the sorceress's breasts surged even bigger as they filled with water and reached the size of an average basketball the spell slinger began to stumble as the new weight had it's effect on her body. She bent forward slightly, and took several steps forward as she tried to understand her still changing centre of gravity, the gurgling noise began almost constant as the arousal spell continued and enhanced the sensations the sorcess was felling ever more strongly. Her top ripped completely at that point, ripping along the side lines of the dress and allowing her breasts to pop free of their inadequate container. The sorceress sank to her knees as the water spell finished by driving the last of it's self into her breasts in one big go, crying out in pleasure as her breasts ended at the size af a beachabll, being huge enough to rest of her knees as she sat in euphoria, rubbing her breasts in ecstasy. Andrea quickly bound her hands and her mouth with a single spell, simple black bindings wrapping around her wrists and mouth, muffling her moans. \"That ladies is how you capture an enemy. I think after a few hours this little elf will tell us anything we want.\" remarked Andrea with a note of satisfaction as both Aner and Rena blushed and turned around, watching for more enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you were watching Askurei. This is one of the methods you can use to capture an enemy with little struggle and no visible harm. Though you'll find such methods generally limited to women as males generally are more resistant to arousal spells and can still use a sword quite effectively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I understand. They're all dead by the way... Dead or teleported away. The others should be back in a moment or two once they realise that we're safe.\" replied Askurei as he sat down on a log by the fire and began to wipe his blades clean of blood and ichor. Adjara nodded to Andrea as she reappeared from the shadows before walking back into her tent without a word. She knew the events that would follow and decided it unneccesary to listen in and miss any more of her sleep. Sure enough Meshnel appeared a few moment later, a slightly haggard look to his features but a faint grin of satisfaction there as well. He grabbed a seat by the fire, let out a sigh and took a drink, basking in the momentary silence before something came to his attention. \"Who is she and why is she like that?\" he asked after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My prisoner.\" declared Andrea with a broad smile and boastful tone. \"I think after an hour of 'self reflecton' she''ll probably be easy enough to break. I'll leave that to either of you two magely men. My job is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeanaro was already leaning against a tree as everyone turned away from the water-filled soreress to face the fire again, making everyone wonder just how long he'd been there. As everyone took a seat around the fire Feanaro spoke. \"As you're aware the attack has been repelled in no small part to all of your efforts and now the demon behind the attack with need time to regroup his or her forces. Once the suns up we'll move. Adjara will be driving while I attempt to see what I can do for Rena and Aner. At the moment you two are a liability if anything and it would almost be wiser to leave you two back in earth's realm did we not need the numbers. So I want everyone to get a few more hours rest. Meshnel and I will keep watch, just in case.\" As the group began to head back to their tents Feanaro spoke once more. \"Oh Andrea. You're sleeping in Rena and Aner's tent since they can't defend themselves properly at the moment.\" A look passed between the two dark elves and the demoness but Feanaro choose to ignore it. \"I'll see you all in 5 hours again. Be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The night passes with no noteable mention and the group prepares to leave for the capital, allowing Feanaro to work on Aner and Rena for part of the trip before stopping for a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Andrea (ever loyal to her succubus nature) has what amusement she can with Rena and Aner as they (try to) sleep.

He has an excellent fear factor when he needs to.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress sat (sat isn't really a good word but there isn't one.) on the ground, spell-binding ropes tied around her, preventing her from casting a spell. The others watched quietly. They wanted to see the show before turning in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Any reason you particularly need that demon essence?\" he began. She spat in his face. He wiped it off and continued, more firmly. \"Why do you need the essence?\" She spat in his face again. This time, The spit boiled off, his skin heating as his demon magic did its work. This alone was a bit scary, watching the spit dissipate into steam from his skin. He snapped his fingers and held his hand in a thumbs-up position. A small fire appeared in the area above where the tip of his fingers met the palm, making it look like the fire was sitting in front of his thumb. He slowly, gently, placed the fire on her arm, burning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AGH!!\" She growled in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, it can get a lot worse. It doesn't have to though if you just tell me what I want to know....\" He said, looking down on her. Aner, Rena, and Askurei couldn't help but cringe. They had never seen this angry, almost sadistic side of Meshnel before. It scared them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to hell...\" She uttered, glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeshnel truly scowled, then bared his teeth. And before her eyes, they grew longer. He already had fangs, but now they were an outright mouthful of sharp, painful-looking teeth. His eyes turned completely red, even the whites and pupils, and curving, malicious-looking horns of fire developed on his head. His hair and beard caught fire as well, giving him a very evil, demonic look. His wings sprouted from his back as well, for extra effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me when I say, you do not want to know the power of the Baalrog...\" He growled, his voice multi-layering, sounding as if many Meshnels were speaking at once, along with a darker....More sinister voice. \"I find it humorous you told me to go to hell..Since that is the place I call home. Perhaps you would like a trip there. I can take you there now, and back, in an instant, and still show you everything...\" His every breath let out a small whisp of flame that heated her face, but didn't quite burn. When she managed to remain quiet he placed a hand on her head, and they disappeared, and reappeared in a moment. The sorceress considered crying right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Ok, I'll tell you everything!\" she said, tears beginning to flow down her face.<br>\r\nThe rest of the interrogation went smoothly, Meshnel learned everything he needed to learn.<br>\r\n(I'll leave the individual information up to Likalmor, since this plot was his idea.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara sat calmly during the interrogation and watched it calmly before heading back to bed. She hadn't so much as bat an eyelid through the enitre process. However Andrea had been the perfect accommodating audience member all the way, cringing and twitching where things got harsh and leaning in a little when the suspense got the better of her. How much was for acting purposes even she probably couldn't tell. Feanaro had watched silently as well, nodding at certain moments in acknowledgment or agreement with certain methods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, Meshnel returned to the group. The flames receeding from him.<br>\r\n\"B-but...You're not a Baalrog.\" Rena stammered as he approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, yes. I asked Raknasa for a bit of help, as she was being stubborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, excellent show. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.\" Andrea said, twitching a bit as she remembered the horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets all get some sleep.\" Meshnel said, walking over to his place on top of the carriage and laying down. As everyone went to their beds, Andrea went with Aner and Rena to their tent. A short time afterwards Rena was awakened by a soft brushing against her rear. \"What's that thing brushing against my ass...\" she asked slightly angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, that's my tail.\" Andrea said, moving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.....Well.....Wait, why was your tail there?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It twitches while I'm asleep.\" she responded, as if that was an obvious answer. Rena went back to sleep, but Andrea didn't. Making sure to cast a spell where they would sleep soundly until morning. \"You, my dear Rena, need a little bit MORE ass...\" she said to her, as if she could hear, and began to expand her rear until it matched her breasts. \"And Aner...Well, I did need a pillow.\" she said, making her all-around bigger. She then rested her head on her bloated stomach, and her tail once again fell on Rena's ass as she twitched in her sleep. This was a great night. Can't wait to find out what happens in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: In the middle of the night, their new sizes affect their dreams, and all 3 of them manage to have a linked dream. The contents of the dream can be determined by the next writer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Similar to option one, only the dream leads to the spell breaking early and they wake up earlier than morning, which leads to them realizing their new assets.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rena was suddenly aware that she was kneeling down, praying before the altar of a small chapel. The white stone walls seemed to glow almost and the stained glass windows shone with a golden light, despite the darkness outside. The was a faint hum in the background that put the mind at peace. \"Such a calm soothing place... I must be dreaming.\" thought Rena. She looked herself over, she was back to her normal size and wore her usual armour, it's elaborately engraved and consecrated symbols engraved on it's shoulder plates and torso as well as various holy litany scrolls trailing from her belt warding against demons and unholy powers. It annoyed her a great deal that none of them seemed to stop direct attacks on her body. \"But... as long I can stay like this... in this place... I don't think I mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>You always were such a boring person...</b></i>\" whispered a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\" she asked out loud, though she already had a faint inkling about whom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>You already know, so why ask?</b></i>\" replied Aner as she stepped out of the shadows to Rena's left. As she did Rena realised with slight horror that as Aner appeared the chapel began to decay. The glow faded from the stones and even their actual colour began to change, turning dark grey and lending the room an atmosphere of gloom. It wasn't just the stones walls of the chapel however, the stained glass windows lining each side shattered loudly, their small fragments hitting the floor and tinkling quite heavily in the silence. The humming had disappeared. The chapel continued to degrade until finally it halted halfway across, Rena rolling to one side to avoid the desecrated ground. She stood up and looked around at what had become of her sanctuary, it was like a horrible nightmare. While the right side of the room had remained untouched, perfect as before the left half of the entire chapel had been ruined. Desecrated and left to turn to ruin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you want?\" she demanded. \"I wouldn't have thought you were that bored to invade my dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not, this is my dream. So I have as much right to be here as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how do you figure that? Up till you appeared this place was hardly what I\u2019d call familiar territory for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should take a look outside. It will explain a lot of this.\u201d Replied Aner as she walked outside, leaving Rena to strangle the air in mild frustration for a moment before following her out. As she did she couldn\u2019t help but make an involuntary gasp. The whole of their surroundings were split in half right down the middle, just like the chapel. On Rena\u2019s side the land was black and smouldering, like a fire had run through the area and all that was left was chaos. But on the other side all the ground was grassy plains, calm and peaceful. Nothing like Rena had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought that we were so different on this level. You know as well as I do how horrible a place this place is. Surely you see it as I do but embrace it rather than accept it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know the world isn\u2019t as simple as you want it to be Rena. The world isn\u2019t a place of filth and perversion\u2026 well it is, but it\u2019s not just that. You find enjoyment in life\u2019s simpler things.\u201d Aner had been about to continue when a whisper was carried across the wind to the two twin\u2019s ears. Scanning the area around them they located the source, it was all around them as slowly figures materialised around them on the plains, incorporeal at first but then finally fully solid after a minute or so. Each one was a female figure but the face was obscured, like no matter where they stood a shadow always fell on their faces and hid any means of recognising them as specific people, or humans even. But it wasn\u2019t just their faces that were odd, each and every single creature was an overly developed version of the typical female body, many had a huge rear that swayed from side to side as the beings walked across the ground, while others had a large bust like Rena recalled having back in the real world. Those ones walked leaning forward slightly and held their arms underneath their chests for support. There were also other variations, sometimes a bloated figure like Aner\u2019s old form or an hourglass shape that seemed to defy possibility or even anatomy\u2019s usual restrictions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chill Rena realised that the female figures were calling out, their voices carried on the wind. Those whispers that Rena heard were calls for help, of pain and suffering because of their bodies, a call for aid from their plight and Rena felt a burst of anger that such forces existed that would do this to people in real life. She turned to Rena. \u201cAnd I suppose those cries of pain are how you amuse yourself? They\u2019re crying out for help and you sit their drinking in their calls with a smile on your face and a slight red flush to your face! You\u2019re twisted!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d muttered Aner in reply. \u201cCan\u2019t you hear the voices as I hear them? Come, step over the gap and listen to their calls from my side. When you hear what I hear then you\u2019ll enjoy-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d yelled Rena. \u201cThis is wrong! Can\u2019t you hear them? Can\u2019t you see the corruption, the sick desires in this world and the real one? It\u2019s wrong! You\u2019re the one who is wrong! I am gong to try to help these people you\u2019ve created.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t my creations Rena, well not all of them, just the ones on my side... Those ones over there, they\u2019re a part of you. You\u2019ve dreamed of things like this before I bet. They\u2019re as much a part of you as me and if they are the product of a corrupted mind then what does that make you? Do you desire to be like them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou take that back! I am nothing like you! We are opposites! Different in everyway!\u201d Rena\u2019s fists were clenched and she stood at the limit of her area, the last stone tile that remained pure and white before the floor transformed into it\u2019s horrible counterpart. Aner rose as well, she wouldn\u2019t strike first but if she attacked\u2026 she would act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, opposites that look the same and can guess what the other is about to say. I think that suggests at least some partial connection. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Stated Andrea as she materialised in between the two of them, her hands on their shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena threw off Andrea\u2019s hand and backed away a step. \u201cNo! I have no desire to look like these women. Expanding your body for yours or another pleasure is a sin, no matter how you look at it! I refuse to partake of such a vile act and I would never willingly indulge in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, those religion chains are set in deeeeep.\u201d commented Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, it would take a real miracle to budge her mind on an issue like this.\u201d remarked Aner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I may not be able to make a miracle but will you settle for demonic persuasion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t fall to your demonic tricks!\u201d declared Rena defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor an issue she\u2019s so certain about she\u2019s really becoming unhinged, huh?\u201d quipped Andrea and Aner nodded in reaction. This uncommon loss of control of her calm nature was mostly because in the outside world one could hide their facial expressions and emotions with little effort, however in a dreamscape like this one\u2019s inner thoughts, not expressed thoughts came through quite strongly. That\u2019s why Andrea was being even more blunt than usual. Andrea slowly walked over across to Rena\u2019s side and grabbed her wrist. \u201cYou know if you really have nothing to fear there\u2019s no reason why you should worry Rena. But of even greater importance is that unless you confront this aspect of yourself and either understand it and reject it or understand it and embrace it you can\u2019t be a true paladin of the Light.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor all the good a paladin of the Light is on a world where Holy magic is weaker than carnival tricks\u2026\u201d muttered Aner. Andrea silenced her with a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Rena let me do this\u2026 just a little bit. You don\u2019t become resistant to snake venom by getting the whole thing injected into your veins, you let it be absorbed little by little over a long period of time, until eventually you can be struck by the snack and brush it off without a concern. So will you let yourself at least understand one of your foe a little better.\u201d Rena gave no verbal acknowledgement but she nodded ever so slightly, she would persevere and show her true strength. As Rena was led back to the edge of her side of the world Andrea walked behind her and with a single hand against her back she slowly began to pour a fragment of her demonic energy into the night elf\u2019s dream body, giving the order for her demonic energy to reshape the body to her will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena stopped, and shuddered as she felt the wave of energy flow into her back before being directed towards her rear. She felt the fabric of her garments tightening, and tried to fight it. \"No, stop! Oh.....\" She finished that last sentence with a moan. She couldn't fight it. Her body knew what it liked, and this was one of them apparently. As her butt got bigger, her thighs and hips rushed out to meet it. Her rear formed a nice heart shape as it dragged her down, its sudden new weight an off-balancing situation. It continued to grow as it went, slowly pushing her off the ground. All the while she was groaning in pleasure, but trying to fight it at the same time. Finally Andrea pulled her hand away and allowed Rena to gather a little more self control over herself and she stood slowly, tentatively, the caress of her garments while they did their best to hold together all the while rubbing against her backside with every move she made. She rose, her face red with embarrassment and satisfied desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Aner... I know you\u2019re not as opposed to this as your counterpart\u2026 am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes but having such a body makes me less effective in combat, it\u2019s impractical and a danger to my survival. So I can\u2019t let it happen normally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we\u2019re in a dreamscape here Aner\u2026 What happens here is restricted to this place, you can be as big as you want\u2026 whatever part you desire\u2026\u201d She raised her hand towards Aner and placed her hand on Aner\u2019s back and began to channel. Aner took the expansion much more excitedly than her opposite. A shiver ran down her spine as her rear and thighs began to widen and push outward. Her pants began to feel tight, and she unbuttoned them to give them more room. \"Oh, that feels good.\" she said, moaning as her legs and rear continued to get bigger, the pants tearing at the seams. She continued to moan until the weight became such that she was forced to the ground just as her pants exploded off of her, revealing her underwear, which was fast becoming a thong. She groaned as her rear passed basketball size. Man she loved this. She shivered as the growth hit a jump, and had to physically keep herself from pleasuring herself. At that point Andrea cut the channelling of demonic energy and pulled back from Aner, smiling at a job well done. While Rena was smaller than Aner by a fair bit one was a lot different to the other in regards to mindset so Andrea was confident she had made progress. Her goal certainly wasn\u2019t to tempt the paladin into serving the demonic forced, but a little less preaching and a little moaning every now and then would do wonders for people\u2019s spirits and morale. Besides every group needed eye candy. With a smile, she disappeared from both elves sight, off to return to her own dream if possible. Leaving Aner and Rena to their own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena was the first to come to her senses properly, Aner was still very distracted by her body and was trying to dislodge her underwear without incident, so Rena took this moment to do something she had never done before. She stepped off the chapel grounds and onto the ash and brimstone ground outside. The figures barely recognised her presence, a few hard to recognise figure glanced over briefly then turned back to looking downwards as they milled around. They appeared to have given up hope and only the occasion cringe of pain was a sign that these \u2018women\u2019 were even real. As Rena took another step closer one of the figures approached, a whisper could be heard on the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dWon\u2019t you help us? Free us?\u201d</i> it asked in a hushed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cry for help struck a chord in Rena, she bit her lip for a moment before sighing in resignation and muttering in reply. \u201cBut how? What do you want me to do? I can\u2019t reverse demon magic as I am, like this. It\u2019s hopeless. I\u2019m as helpless as you are right now.\u201d The figure stood there for a moment in thought before it spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \u201cThen will you ease the pain? We could bear this if only not for the pain.\u201d</i> Rena didn\u2019t know what to say. Ease the pain? She gave the figure a hard look, before she had turned her eyes away to shield her mind of such influences but now she looked closely she could see they wore small outfits consisting of mostly faintly see-through silk or gauze but were strung up by a piece of leather that was far too tight for them. It cut into their expanded bodies tightly, making Rena wonder how they didn\u2019t die from their circulation getting cut off. She moved around to the back of the figure and found the clasp for the bra and underwear and loosened them enough to be worn of ease. Underneath the place where the leather straps had been the soft flesh was a red welt, the bindings had been sooo tight. She couldn\u2019t imagine the pain\u2026 well actually now that she thought about it. It was kind of similar to her own garments at the moment, but hers weren\u2019t adjustable, they had the length to give. She could either face the pain the others had suffered, or loose her garments completely\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a dream\u2026 and it\u2019s only just this once\u2026\u201d she rationalised as she slid off her overstretched garment and wondered why a breeze would blow in a dreamscape. Never mind, soon she would wake and this strange occurrence would be good and forgotten. She returned to the chapel and sat down to pray, her expanded rear on the cold tiles sending strange emotions through her made it quite hard to focus though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho would have thought that a person such as yourself would sit naked before an altar to the light? You\u2019re full of surprises here Rena.\u201d Commented Aner who stood just behind Rena in her own naked and expanded form, she was standing on her corrupted side of the chapel\u2019s floor but still had for the first time in her own memory had actually entered the place. Rena made no reply or movement to the remark and after a moment or two of silence Aner began to move back towards the chapel\u2019s exit. As her foot was about to cross the threshold and step outside Rena spoke, her voice quiet and slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019ve realised Aner? It may be against what I\u2019ve held onto for so long but it may just be that an occasional evil for ones' sake, or the sake of another, is tolerable\u2026\u201d There was another long silence and Aner was about to leave once again when Rena spoke once more. \u201c\u2026And that maybe\u2026 once in a while\u2026 I can find it within myself to allow that pleasure onto myself and those around me\u2026\u201d Aner smiled and gave a little chuckle and a nod to her twin before continuing out of the door and into her more preferred world, leaving her naked, expanded twin to find a balance that suited her. As she gazed out at her side of the world she gave a lustful sigh and contemplated how to best find some way to enjoy what was left of this dreamscape and it\u2019s remaining time, however, had she looked back towards the chapel she would have seen a familiar demoness sitting on the roof snickering to herself. Laughing at the fact her little plan had exceeded her expectations so much she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. The next few days would be truly testing for the soul searching paladin as Andrea wondered just how far she could be tempted and still serve the light? How much could she eat of her own cake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream slowly faded away for all three as sunlight peeked through the gaps in the tent and noises outside roused the three from their erotic slumber. Rena was the first to wake as she felt a sensual rubbing on her rear, which was wrapped tightly in her nightwear, enhancing her figure. As she slowly woke she realised three things, one her body was even bigger than before it had been before she had gone to sleep, most likely the work of Andrea\u2019s magic\u2019s in their dream she deducted. The second thing she noticed was that even though she had rolled over away from Andrea after waking the sensual rubbing persisted, looking over her shoulder she saw that Andrea\u2019s tail had somehow, through devious nature most likely, snuck up her leg and under her underwear, rubbing against the bare flesh of her expanded rear. Finally, it was as she screamed out in anger and smacked the demoness with a two handed blow that sent said demon flying a clear thirty meters out of the tent, smoking and cursing in the demon tongue, that she realised her close contact with Andrea had somehow given her a link to her Holy Powers. For Andrea now ran around in circles with her rear branded with a holy symbol where Rena had struck it. The Symbol had also incinerated Andrea's nightgown as well and she was complaining about barbaric wakeup calls while she twitched occassionally on the ground, at the symbol's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you three are finally up and about!\u201d called Meshnel as he walked up to the three\u2019s tent, a coiled rope in one hand, his sword in another. \u201cBreakfast has already been made by Adjara and if you want any I suggest you hurry up, get fitting clothes on and grab it. We\u2019re heading out in fifteen minutes the rest of us have already started loading up the other gear.\u201d Aner\u2019s head popped out a moment later next to Rena\u2019s, blurry eyed and uncomprehending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClothes, food, move!\u201d summed up Meshnel, sighing and shaking his head before walking off with the rope and blade, stowing the rope in the back of one of the caravans. Aner looked at Rena before turning back to look at her own body, she then spotted the twitching body on the outskirts of the camp and gave a small smile and a nod before turning back to the tent to get dressed. After a minute of fumbling the two elves emerged from the tent, clothed in clothes that had once fit properly and now looked like a second skin, so stretched and tight was the material. Their armour was stowed in seperate bags they carried in one hand, their blades carried in the other. As the two sat down, slowly and carefully to maintain dignity and fabric integrity even had Meshnel and Feanaro were gazing for a moment or two longer than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll have to promote Andrea for all her fine work one day.\u201d Commented Feanaro to Meshnel as they levitated the bulkier items into the back of the caravan, avoiding the heavy lifting while Adjara kept lookout in her favourite tree. Most of the camp was packed up by now, only one tent and the odd bits of detritus from last night's battle remained on the ground. \"Without her along I can't imagine how boring some of these journeys would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight I suggest removing the holy symbol first before bestowing on her any additional honors?\u201d replied Meshnel, gesturing to the succubus who still lay bare and slightly smouldering on the grass a way away. Feanaro shrugged and after the last folded up tent was stored in the caravan he went over to the demon and without any apparent effort wiped away the holy symbol. \u201cClothe yourself and get onboard Andrea. We\u2019re heading off now. With any luck we\u2019ll make it into the capital just as night falls. There's a light meal for you in the back of one of the caravans, I had Adjara keep it aside.\u201d As Feanaro and Meshnel each took command of one of the caravans and took the drivers seat the other five were left to organise themselves into whatever groups were manageable for the trip. Feanaro took control of the caravan storing the magical artifacts he deemed neccesary to accompany him, while Meshnel was stuck with the slightly crowded and prone to exploding caravan loaded with the makeshift alchemist bench and a majority of the camping supplies.

When it was finished, Rena was still a bit larger than normal, her chest a good large size, and her rear fairly noticable, but it didn't at all impede her combat. \"That's as low as I'm willing to go!\" Andrea said with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena felt up her figure and looked over herself. \"I like it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the morning wore on Feanaro\u2019s caravan was rather quiet, the sound of wheels turning and hooves hitting the ground the only constant noise while Aner lay down in the back of the caravan, her massively expanded form limiting her positions and putting her in a somewhat irritated manner, an expanded body was satisfying but as the night had proved, troublesome to control in battle. So as she lay on the mattress in the caravan, her flesh moving along with the movements of the cart while Askurei was alternating between maintaining his various many knives perfect condition and juggling them out of boredom. Eventually the silence became too much though and Askurei summoned his courage and called out to Aner, \u201cSo what do you think we\u2019ll do when we reach the capital? I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to just waltz everywhere through the town, chances are the survivors from last night already know our appearances and if-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Askurei?\u201d Aner said, interrupting his little dissection of the situation. \u201cShut it. I\u2019m not in the mood to talk, when we get to the capital I\u2019ll kill whoever threatens me, everything else is just needless \u2018what ifs\u2019 at the moment.\u201d With that she tried to roll to face the other way, but her large stomach made the position so uncomfortable she quickly rolled back to lying on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAskurei could take an unsubtle hint well however so rather than trying to press the issue he decided to chat to the third figure aboard the caravan, the quiet cat-girl Adjara, who still sat atop the wooden caravan, watching the surroundings for any hint that they should be discovered, no matter how sure the two mages were of their chances of remaining hidden in their mystical cloak. So without further ado he removed himself from Aner\u2019s side and climbed up the little collapsible ladder that led to the top hatch of the caravan. There he was momentarily blinded by the harsh light as he pushed up on the hatch and when he blinked his eyes to clear his vision he realised that Adjara was sitting on the end of the caravan, watching out behind them and casting partial glances to the left and right. \u201cYou\u2019re surprisingly attentive despite our security. You really should be resting, we\u2019ll likely have no chance to sleep as we near the city. Unless you get captured of course, then you\u2019re free to sleep whenever they allow you.\u201d He said as a way of greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara didn\u2019t move from her position, her face hidden from Askurei\u2019s view as she watched over towards the direction they had come from. \u201cTrue, we are relatively safe here and now, but if we were to be attacked and my Lord not sufficiently warned due to my negligence it would never be a valid reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you do this out of fear of your lord?\u201d joked Askurei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d declared Adjara, with surprising fervour. \u201cIt would never be a valid reason for myself, I would blame myself for getting complacent and I would expect Feanaro to regard me with a likewise manner, especially if anyone was injured.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAskurei wasn\u2019t sure what to say about that so for the moment he dropped that topic, instead pursuing another path. \u201cYou know...\u201d he started. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make too bad a team last night, you\u2019re amazingly agile from what I could see in the faint light, I know you were at times using magic but when you weren\u2019t your movements were maybe even on par with my own. Though your attacks could use a little improvement, they lack the punch to break through an opponent\u2019s guard, and range, but thats because of your weapon, nothing you can do about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara seemed to relish the change in conversation to something a little less personal. \u201cIt\u2019s true during the fight last night my attacks did lack power, but that wasn\u2019t the goal of the battle. I realised you had more aptitude at stealth attacks while I am often used as a distraction to allow others attacks to find their mark. To try and simply cut down mass numbers of armoured soldiers and spellcasters on one\u2019s own requires more raw ability than I possess without posing a risk to myself. Much safer to allow you to strike them down while I draw their attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAskurei nodded, impressed. \u201cNot bad at all. I thought there might be something more but wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d Adjara simply nodded, leaving Askurei to try to engage the quiet cat-girl in conversation again. <i>Still... more entertaining than dealing with big, dark and cranky</i>, he thought to himself. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk much do you?\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara turned her head to actually face Askurei at this point. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I may seem less talkative than Andrea but she\u2019s very \u2018in your face\u2019 as it were. I prefer to gauge people before talking to them, just in case. That and my sentry duties usually force me apart from the group anyway.\u201d She shrugged uncaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... You said you prefer to gauge the people before you really talk to them. Care to tell me what you think of everyone so far? I\u2019m curious and I promise I won\u2019t tell them. Hell I won\u2019t even tell myself, you know, just in case it hurts my feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara stared at the rogue for a long moment before cracking a small smile. \u201cFair enough.\u201d She said, conceding to Askurei\u2019s request. \u201cBut I want your opinion\u2019s first, of everyone. Give and take as it\u2019s called, no?\u201d<br>\r\nAskurei nodded, hoping Aner wasn\u2019t able to overhear them. \u201cYeah fair enough.\u201d He lay down on the roof, taking a more comfortable position and began to play with a single dagger, spinning it around one hand and then tossing it back and forth between both of them, as if to help keep his body occupied while he reflected. \u201cWell I\u2019ve known Meshnel for... a fairly long time... he\u2019s a wise, if strange, old man with demon blood. It\u2019s not exactly a secret but he doesn\u2019t exactly tell everyone he meets but he\u2019s got this being called Raknasa, a Baalrog, as a companion, something that I don\u2019t even think that guy all in black knows. Hmm... as for Rena and Aner... well Rena is a typical paladin: a bit too uptight and seems to have something consistently stuck up her ass, Aner doesn\u2019t help. She seems to mock everything Rena stands for, she\u2019s like Rena's mischievous perverted twin sister, which I guess in a way is true. Though they aren\u2019t completely black and white, Aner has at times done something a little nobler than I\u2019d expect of her usual self, same with Rena but reverse. No one\u2019s perfect I guess. Least of all us, hey?\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara just grinned faintly again. \u201cTruer words were probably never spoken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. \u2018This trip was a bad idea\u2019 strikes a certain truth factor pretty solidly as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cannot deny that either.\u201d remarked Adjara. \u201cNow what\u2019s your verdict of myself and the others?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh... Well that guy you call your Lord, Feanaro, strikes me as a cold, calculating man who wants people to think of him as a heartless bastard. I\u2019ll reserve my opinion on whether he actually is or not though. As for that Andrea... she\u2019s pretty soft on the eyes, that\u2019s for sure, and she\u2019s certainly the most outgoing of all the sombre people who are here. I had an enjoyable time with her back at the tavern in that drinking match, even managed to learn a few new tricks off her. As for you... you seem quite clever and extremely intelligent. Can\u2019t say much more, it\u2019s not like you really get involved with everyone so it\u2019s hard to \u2018gauge\u2019 you yourself. \"Oh and as for myself, well I\u2019m an extremely dashing rogue with almost unrivalled sword skills and a razor-sharp wit to match. Before my abilities no treasure is safe, no heart cannot be unlocked and no foe may stand before me!\u201d At that Askurei jumped to his feet and made a somewhat grand pose, daggers in hand and a grin playing at the corners of his mouth before his posture suddenly dissolved into a small laugh. \u201cActually I'm naught but a simple man who fell into the company of those greater than me and is tagging along to this little venture, and if my skills should prove useful, so much the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh... Modest but with a sense of humour, you really are in the minority in this group, aren\u2019t you?\u201d joked Adjara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m a real rarity. Now don\u2019t forget our deal. You\u2019ve got to tell me what you think of everyone yourself now. Give and take, as you said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, only fair.\u201d said Adjara, turning her head back to face the rear of the caravan to focus her thoughts. \u201cWell I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>ASKUREI! Get down here! Now!</b>\u201d came a yell from below the two through the wood of the caravan, it was Aner\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh cripes. She didn\u2019t hear me did she?\u201d asked Askurei out loud. \u201cStill I better get back down there, if only so I don\u2019t wind up with that big sword run through my leg one morning as a reminder to pay attention to her when she calls me. Don\u2019t think this ends the deal though, next chance we get you\u2019re telling me your opinion on the others.\u201d He said, making his way back to the hatch of the caravan as he spoke, maintaining his perfect balance despite the sometimes erratic movements of the caravan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAskurei opened the top hatch and was about to close it as he began to climb back down when Adjara suddenly stopped him. \u201cHold that thing open! I think it\u2019s time I take break, I might as well join you guys in the caravan and see what Aner wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack down in the caravan Aner was sitting down, her back against one of the walls, her body still as large as Askurei remembered it. \u201cHuh... Adjara as well?\u201d Aner said, noting the sentry\u2019s presence. \u201cShouldn\u2019t matter. Now Askurei, you learnt some of Andrea\u2019s demon tricks and magic, right? After all, it was you who was responsible for that prank yesterday that almost cost us our lives, so I demand you undo the effects of your handiwork and also Andrea\u2019s own work from last night. When I go into battle I want to be able to stride through my opponents, my blade and body becoming one as they become a blur in battle. At the moment the only thing my body can do in a battle is be a shield or battering ram, neither one appeals to me. So fix this problem already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually Aner I can\u2019t.\u201d Said Askurei, somewhat tentatively. \u201cAndrea never taught me how to reverse the process, at the time I hadn\u2019t really cared but that might have been because of the essence\u2019s corrupting influence. Sorry but I can\u2019t help you.\u201d Aner shot Askurei a look of fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually. I think I can mostly reverse the process if you wish.\u201d Said Adjara speaking up from where she had hidden herself, on top of a tall cupboard that rattled faintly with the caravan\u2019s movements, hinting at glass beakers or jars hidden within and hopefully secure. \u201cI\u2019m quite familiar with both demon magic and this particular type of its application. If you wish I can simply purge the demon magic out. It\u2019s not a particularly delicate process but from what I can read in your body\u2019s aura you\u2019ve got several variations of sex magic in your body, which makes it hard to neutralise the magic or drain it. Purging works but the spells will work to resist the purge and once the purge is adapted to I can\u2019t do anything more to the spells, meaning it\u2019s not a complete solution but it\u2019ll work to a fair degree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAner seemed to think about this for a moment. \u201cFair enough. Do it anyway. I don\u2019t mind a few extra curves to my body <i>(Askurei had to bite his tongue from uttering the phrase \u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d)</i> for the time being, as long as I\u2019m combat able I\u2019ll be satisfied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara nodded, \u201cFair enough... Brace yourself though, the purging isn\u2019t painful but it\u2019s going to feel like you grabbed a hold of an electric fence.\u201d Aner merely nodded, her muscles tensing faintly in her arms and neck as her body prepared itself for the ordeal. It was then without any further warning that Adjara suddenly pulled back her hands before unleashing two twin streams of lightning at Aner\u2019s body. The lightning left Adjara\u2019s hands and began to arc all over Aner\u2019s body, enveloping her body in small steams of the constantly jumping blue lightning. Aner\u2019s body seemed to go stiff the moment the lightning reached her but as the purge continued her body would twitch and spasm occasionally despite Aner\u2019s taut body. \u201cOver stimulation of muscles in her body as the purge passes through her.\u201d Commented Adjara, who threw another lightning blast at Aner to recharge the purge as it tired from combating the three separate spells imbedded in her body. It took a moment for Askurei to notice through the bright light of the lightning covering Aner\u2019s body but he could slowly see her body shrinking towards it\u2019s original figure, Her general plumpness wore away first to return to it\u2019s fit and toned definition before her breasts, butt and stomach too began to shrink, quickly at first but with reduced speed as it became obvious the purge was being countered by the spells. It only took a minute before in a small shower of sparks the lightning disappeared without warning, fading before the temporarily blinded eyes of the onlookers, leaving a panting and sweating Aner leaning against the wall, her body still larger than normal but definitely reduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara knelt down to Aner\u2019s side and waved her hand in front of Aner\u2019s face, reading her aura. \u201cYour stomach is still somewhat plump and I wasn\u2019t able to remove the largest concentrations of magic but aside from those three areas your body is free from the demon sex magic. I was able to purge Askurei\u2019s air inhalation spell completely and most of Andrea\u2019s spell too, most of this residue is from that brand curse you were afflicted with, it was remarkably resilient and the purge had only a minor effect. It must be a very powerful patron who crafts these runes to make them so potent and resilient. So... how are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike I fell into a lightning golem\u2019s core.\u201d Aner grinned suddenly then. \u201cBut I can feel my sluggishness gone, when next I meet my opponents I will be able to fight with no restrictions. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me I had best return to sentry duty.\u201d Adjara said, a full smile on her face, though there was a slight red tinge to her cheeks oddly enough. As Adjara made her way back to the drop-down ladder and climbed up to the roof Askurei though that he could hear the faint sounds of stretching leather from her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll join her actually. I just remembered we have a deal to finish.\u201d muttered Askurei to Aner, taking a step towards the ladder. He stopped suddenly when a small steel grip was placed on his shoulder, Aner had gotten a hold of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just yet prankster. I still have one more use before you go. You may not be able to reverse your tricks but you still know how to do them. That\u2019s a skill I want for the time being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAskurei raised an eyebrow at that statement. \u201cBut you only just returned to normal, well an improved form of normal anyway. Why would you want to go through it again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot me. Andrea. I think it\u2019s only fair that little demoness gets a little punishment for playing around with such dangerous opponents. Don\u2019t you? Now grab a seat, we\u2019ve got some planning to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Aner plotted in the back of the caravan and Askurei was press ganged into helping her Feanaro had been talking to Meshnel about the information they had obtained from their captive the night earlier. Who had been disposed of once their interrogation was finished. \u201cSo let me get the facts summarised.\u201d said Feanaro to Meshnel. \u201cThey want the demon essence of Andrea to create their own goddess, since their current 'faith' never had a focal idol for worship, so generally just a particularly attractive demoness or woman figure was used as a model for each town's avatar. However if they can create a real goddess, a focal point for their devotion, not only will they gain the ability to wield divine magic and all it's annoying benefits, but their cult will have the ability to expand beyond just the current continent most likely, enveloping the whole world and posing a threat to other realms through portal gates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeshnel nodded, even though Feanaro couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cYes, and needless to say, a sex/shadow goddess with connections to Andrea and Aner would not be a positive boon for either of them, they would probably be enslaved as minions, unable to break the link. All in all I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in anyone\u2019s best interests if we let them fulfil their plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, so I guess we either recapture the demon essence, removing their chance to expand their power, or we destroy the cult\u2019s power structure via a process of removing the ambitious leaders of the cult. Maybe both if necessary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of those are temporary measures at best and you know it Feanaro. Eventually the cult will develop new leader\u2019s, ambitious ones at that, who will try the same stunt the current leader\u2019s are now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll measure are temporary Meshnel. Even if we annihilated the entire cult from top to bottom there would always be another religion or cult to surface and the process would begin again, the only way to stop this occurring is to regularly check up on the planet and curb it or... hmm... that just may work if the opportunity presents itself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust what are you planning Feanaro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeanaro simply smiled, his grin invisible to all but himself. \u201cNothing of significance at the moment. But if the option becomes viable rest assured I will explain it fully to you.\u201d At that point Feanaro\u2019s voice fell silent and the mental link was cancelled. Meshnel was left with nothing but the creak of wheels and the whistling of the wind to keep his thoughts company.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can slip a little of this into her drink when we stop to eat.\" Askurei said, finally having agreed to help Aner get back at Adjara. He held up a small vial <br>\r\n<br>\r\nof liquid something, looking dark purple, yet turning clear when it was spun about. \"It'll blow her up right good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have that?\" Aner asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Experimentation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....nevermind.Alright then, let's get planning.\" Aner said, as he and Askurei leaned close to plan her revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Meanwhile, on Meshnel's caravan-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I absolutely will NOT play strip poker!\" Rena said, rather loudly, as she rummaged through her medicine pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, come on! What's a bit of fun? Besides, it's the lesser of all the other evils we could do. What are you looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something to deal with you.\" Rena replied.

She was afraid it might be a holy artifact hidden in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought paladins didn't drink alcohol.\" Andrea said, somewhat surprised as Rena took a big gulp from the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good pain-killer, and you're a good pain.\" She said,her cheeks taking a slight coloration as she finished the skin and reached for another. Andrea took the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nflask from her and downed it herself, however, before filling each skin to bursting again with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how about that game?....-hic-\" she said, a small hiccup working its way to her as she downed her third sack, Rena her fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fine...\" Rena said, finally acceeding with her buzz getting the better of her. Andrea lumped four decks together and began dealing. It took her three minutes, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nconsidering the drink breaks, to finally deal the first hand, and she was tilting a bit with a sly smile on her face as both began looking at their hands. Andrea laid <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndown a set of three sixes (big surprise), and Rena laid down four tens. Andrea huffed and took off her top, a dark bikini-like top, the silk cloths crossing over her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbreasts to cling to the opposite breast from the shoulder they rest on., smiling coyly as she pushed her nude breasts up with her hand, the mammaries swelling slightly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nas she bit her lip to keep from moaning on accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what yhou shee?\" Andrea asked, her voice slurred as she giggled a bit at Rena's slightly gaping mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yhou know, it ishn't really fair. Yhou have more clothing.\" Andrea said as she dealt a higher hand than Rena, who only removed her shoulder guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also didn't want to play this game in the first place...\" Rena said, a bare slur in her voice, as she took another swig, her cheeks taking on more color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But thash just personal opinion...\" Said Andrea, not making any sense as she was dealt another hand, mainly because Rena was get suspect if she won too many of her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nown hands. She then took another swig and tried to read Rena's expression. \"You know for a holy won. You are quite famil... familiar with the vices of the world... If <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou don't mind my shay sho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call it a rigor of the induction of my order.\" Rena said, her voice taking on more slurr, but not enough to truly make her words unintelligable, and her face taking <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyet more flush as she downed another flask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea's face fell slightly as she lost another hand and removed one of her boots, causing Rena to wonder why she had taken her top off first. \"Hey Rena I have a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nproposition for you. Since you've got more clothes how about for every third item of clothing we remove the other gets to ask a question we have to answer truthfully?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke slowly so as to prevent slurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Rena said as she lost the next hand, removing her gloves. She was removing clothing in pairs, while not forcing Andrea too, to even the odds a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea smiled happily, taking another draught of the skin and having to pause a moment to clear her head. \"You sure we're drinking at an equal pace? I'm really <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbeginning to doubt my drinking capabilities of late. First the rogue, now you. Soon I'll be losing to a teenager...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd have no issue with Meshnel. He doesn't drink at all. Aner...Alcohol doesn't have any affect on her at all. The only person from our side of the group that you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncould out-drink is Meshnel. Askurei drinks heavily, and I have a natural Alcohol resistance.\" Rena replied, forcing herself to speak slowly, as her fast speech was <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbecoming a bit too slurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... ish depreshing.\" Andrea said, dealing the next hand, both of them tied at 2 garments lost each. She looked at her hand and saw she had triple sixes again, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen high. She raised her cards and played them, curious to see what Rena had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over it.\" Rena said, more coldly than she mant to, as she laid down a straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm supposed to represent vice, how can I do that if everyone i meet can kick my ass in drinking, and probably in battle too.\" She sighed. \"Anyway, ask you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nquestion. Make it personal or businesslike I don't mind. Just don't ruin the game and skip on it, thats just mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you actually like your work?\" Rena asked, throwing a curveball as she put a hand to her forehead to stop the room from shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In general?\" She asked, thinking to herself. \"Or is there a particular aspect of it you were refering to? Technically my job is demoness bound in service to Feanaro, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhich details anything and everything. But he typically gets me to do tasks I would do if I were still a member of the demon hierarchy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, ash a succubus.\" Rena said, the drink finally infecting her standard-speed speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... It's fun some of the time, exciting other times and boring or disgusting when it's not that. I like meeting interesting people and that's something I'm <br>\r\n<br>\r\nassured of in this kind of work. The whole seducing and sleeping with people... it can be fun if you meet the right people. Then again I guess in your line of work the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmost interesting people you meet either try to kill you or respect your status too much you never really get laid, hmm?\" She said, boldly stating the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My husband is dead...At least that's what everyone continue to tell me...\" Rena said, growing sullen as she looked down at her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnder smiled a little sadly and patted Rena's leg a little. \"Rest assured Rena, everyone, sooner or later, loses someone they care deeply about. The key is to enjoy <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe time together and reflect on it with a smile... Though what do you mean everyone tells you? You suspect he's not truly dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We never found his body. There should have been a body, even in the way that he died, and I just feel like he's still out there sometimes, watching me..\" she replied, <br>\r\n<br>\r\na tear tracing its way down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndea was a demon but she wasn't a souless monster. So she sidled over to Rena and hugged her, wrapping her arms around her, ignoring the irritation the holy marks on <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRena's armor gave her (thankful on this word the outfit didn't outright burn her), and holding her until the tears stopped flowing. She didn't speak at all untill the <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntears stopped. \"You okay?\" was all she said at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think sho.\" Rena said, wiping the tears from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint smile settled on Andrea's face. \"So do you want me to stop hugging you? Or are my bare breasts against you that comforting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more worried about you lighting yourself on fire.\" Rena replied, grinning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you don't pour Holy water on me I'm fine. This world deadens normal wards and runes to a mild irritation. It's itchy but not painful.\" slurred Andrea still <br>\r\n<br>\r\ngrinning. \"What do you say we just get pissed and chat... I'll even strip naked as if I lost the game.\" She added with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we not?\" Rena asked, hopeful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara had been sitting alone on the top of the caravan a short while when she grew uncharacteristicly bored and decided to seek out someone to talk to, Meshnel seemed <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe best choice as she could still keep an eye on the horizon for foes while she chatted, and the mage seemed pleasant enough company. So with her mind made up and her <br>\r\n<br>\r\neye adready guaging the distance she effortlessly vaulted from the roof of the caravan onto the seat next to Meshnel in the caravan behind. \"Morning Meshnel.\" She <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsaid, a little stiffly. \"Apologies but I grew bored and wanted someone to talk to, how are things on this caravan? I expected to hear a scream or explosion before now <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're actually keeping pretty well together in there.\" Meshnel said, not taking his eyes from the road. \"I haven't heard so much as a foul word thrown from one end <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto the other. They've probably drunk everything there is to drink in there, though, so you'll have to go to your own caravan if you get thirsty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... I guess alcohol could take the edge of things in there sufficiently. Though Andrea might use that as a chance to cause another incident...\" She said with a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsigh. \"Still after last night I think even I could use a drink, just a small one though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hurry back. It's boring over here.\" Meshnel replied, his eyes glued to the road ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I think I can help with that...\" Said Adjara as she cast a small spell that allowed Meshnel and Adjara to clearly hear what was being said inside. The first <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwords they both heard were: 'You like what you see?' from what sounded like a drunk Andrea. Adjara had a slight red tinge to her face as she smiled. \"I guess they're <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhaving quite a fun time, hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mental flick, the spell was shattered. \"I'd rather not listen to that too much.\" Meshnel said. \"Go get your drink and come back if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara was still faintly blushing when she returned a minute later from the caravan in a faint puff of shadow. \"Maybe it's better if I just stay out here for the time <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbeing and drink...\" She said, taking a sip from one of several bottles, though specifically not a blue one, she had been told that it was a gift from Aner to Andrea to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsay no hard feelings but both of them had known it wasn't what it<br>\r\n*seemed. Still Adjara didn't mind either way as long as she didn't get caught in the blast. Blue bottle was a no, everything was okay. \"I presume you don't want any, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsince you've got to focus on the road.\" She said to Meshnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right.\" Meshnel said. He straightened when he heard the sound of crying and reference to Rena's husband inside. \"Oh no, she's thinking about Daresh <br>\r\n<br>\r\nagain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara slowly sipped at the bottle she held. \"Hmm... Daresh... I can not say I know that name. Sensitive subject?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeshnel pulled out a small cylindrical object, looking much like a cigarette, though it appeared to have many markings on it, and placed his hand over it, lighting it, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nand taking a long pull. \"Daresh...\" Meshnel began after a breath, \"Was the best of us. He was wise, kind, generous, caring....Somebody we all aspired to be like....He <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas our leader, our trusted friend....He died being our leader....He died protecting us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara nodded solemly, \"I see. He sounds like an impressive person. I would have liked to meet him. I guess Rena and him were close.\" It wasn't a question, From the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlook on Meshnel's face she could tell what Rena's connection to Daresh had been. She took a long sip of the bottle and tipped it in Meshnel's direction, offering it if <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe would. \"To the fallen and the ones left behind. Their sacrifice. For today never forgotten and their connection with those who knew them, never broken. Lessien Vala <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemtor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was her husband.\" Meshnel said, taking the bottle and taking a swig before handing it back. \"Keep the rest, I don't want to drink all of your ale. Besides, Alcohol <br>\r\n<br>\r\nisn't my vice of choice, thunderbloom smoke is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjara nodded. \"Fair enough. Though it's hard to raise a smoke to others in memory.\" She said, attempting a joke before grabbing the bottles around her and about to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstep inside. \"Has it calmed down in there?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're calmed down. Not sure if they're clothed, though.\" Meshnel replied, smoke rising from in front of him as he continued driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
