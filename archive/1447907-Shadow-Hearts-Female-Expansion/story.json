The morning was too dark, the night too long, the sweet scent of flowers gathered in the towns they traveled through were nothing but an annoyance to the girl who was once willing to slow down to a crawl just to smell them. Alice missed the lanky Harmonixer almost as much as she missed her dear father, her heart aching from having lost two people so close to her within a relatively short amount of time. When she wasn't working with Zuzhen, she found herself left to her own devices in the small town they had settled down in, a quiet place, where everyone knew everyone else. The place reminded her of her own home town, and she settled in easily, her gentle nature and kind heart soon winning over a good number of the locals. Of course, for the young men of the village, there was another reason to be very drawn to the young English girl who wore a close fitting and somewhat short dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVillage life had been good to her, perhaps too good, if such a thing were possible. Alice's face, worryingly thin at times, was fuller, her cheeks rounded and flushed with life. The buttons of her close fitting dress had to be fitted to the second hole, the thick material pulled tightly over a small, but protruding pot belly, her already shapely legs soft enough for her thighs to rub gently against one another as she walked. The look suited the previously too thin girl, she was starting to look a lot more like the healthier and robust womenfolk of the village. It was a mixture of a diet infused with the sweet bakery goods she was offered almost every day from the baker's wife who had taken a liking to the well spoken girl, and the fact that without Yuri, she fell easily to comfort eating to try and fill the gap his presence had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She found joy in the simple act of helping other women to feel as at ease with themselves as she was, which was perhaps why the females of that particular town happened to be on the softer side. On first meeting Alice Elliot, the shy young English girl, Lena could see the clear sadness in the pretty blue eyes, and vowed to help ease it in the way that she knew best. It had taken some patience, Alice had a fairly small appetite and was too polite to accept what extra treats Lena would try to give her. But now.... Lena glanced up from the bakery counter on hearing the bell of the shop door ring, a smile crossing her face at seeing the young girl walk in through the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had blossomed under her care, and seemed almost a whole new girl away from the thin, pale creature she had been on first traveling to the village. She easily hit 200lbs on the scales, perhaps more, a rounded and firm belly protruding out from her waistline, her young physique stopping the fat from sagging just yet. Her face was full, the hints of a double chin under her first , the material of her newly altered dress stretched tightly over softer and dough like arms. Even with her plumper figure, Alice kept the hemline of her dress short, showing off her far more shapely legs,  jiggling gently as she walked into the bakery. She gave Lena a small smile, before curtsying, the action causing the material to pull even tighter over her fleshier figure. \"Good morning.\"  </span></div></div>",
