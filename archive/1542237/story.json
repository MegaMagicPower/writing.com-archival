I even picked up a new spell book to aid us.  You never know when a little magic might prove useful.  With your sword combined with my magic we\u2019ll be unstoppable.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spindly young man hurried up to you.  A magic user of questionable ability.  A friend from childhood who often got you in trouble rather than out of it.  His spells in the past often went awry.  Once while trying to light a campfire he caught your pants on fire.  Micah proceeded to douse the flames but instead of water an icy blast struck you.  You got frostbite from his error.  You felt leery of letting him join you.  He meant well and maybe he improved since the last time you met.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said, \u201cHey Micah sure that you wish to join me?  It could be real dangerous.\u201d  Your feelings drifted between the desire for company and worry of what disaster he would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah responded, \u201cI am in we will make names for ourselves.\u201d  His excitement exuded from his silly grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, \u201cThen let\u2019s make our way.\u201d  You traveled into the late afternoon before coming across a couple of goblins.  Goblins were a race of diminutive evil creatures.  You figured this would be an excellent time to test your mettle.  Pulling your sword you shouted a battle cry charging them.  They turned seeing your youth they thought they were in for easy prey.  Micah voice behind you calling forth some magical force.</span></div></div>",

It felt good parrying their strikes.  They seemed slow and inept.  You manage to deliver small cuts whittling away at the goblins bodies.  You heard Micah fumbling around with something.  He began to stuttering and stumbling through some spell.  The hairs on the back of your neck stood up as a surge of magical energy struck you.  You ignore the distraction hoping that it was only a bolstering spell that hit you.  Continuing with fighting the goblins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few more rounds of back and forth combat you manage to put the pair of the goblins down.  You search the pair of them for any loot they might have on them.  They stank but you got a few coins for your trouble while hoping the smell didn\u2019t linger on you.  You turned around to face Micah who looked guilty.  You asked suspiciously, \u201cWhat did you do Micah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen it isn\u2019t my fault.  In all the excitement I might of messed up the pronunciations.  Don\u2019t worry if there are side effects I am almost positive there should be no lasting effects.\u201d  Micah said cringing afraid of your reaction.  You glared at him for a minute before a dizzy feeling came over you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally awoke, your \u201cfriend\u201d looked down at you worried.  You suspected whatever the side effect to be you now suffered from it.  He said, \u201cIt really isn\u2019t that bad.  No one will even notice.  I will fix it as soon as I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at yourself looking for any sign of change.  Shock crossing your face seeing no bulge protruding from his crotch you shouted at Micah, \u201cYou better fix this you moron.  Is this it or did you screw up even worse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah answered, \u201cOh I am sure this is it.  I tried to cast a spell to increase your masculinity but it backfired.  I am confident I will come up with a solution in a few days.\u201d     </span></div></div>",

On a cliff-side is a crooked tower as black as the night.  It is surrounded by rainclouds, and is very intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA less experienced adventurer would flee, but not you, you are going defeat <b>Mortask</b> and rescue <b>Princess Emily</b>.  As you walk over to the door, you hear a crash, and some explosions coming from inside.  You kick open the giant doors, which are surprisingly unlocked.  Drawing your sword you prepare to smite the evil sorcerer, but all you see is debris of what once used to be a lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBroken wood and glass litter the floor, and potions pool into each other.  Then in the corner, you see a girl in a white dress.  Princes Emily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop your sword and race over to her.  \"Princess, are you alright?\" you ask, lightly shaking her.<br>\r\n\"Did I do it? Did I defeat Mortask?\" she asks in a weakened voice.<br>\r\n\"I think so, I don't see him anywhere,\" you answer.  With this the princess smiles and passes out.  You pick her up, and promise to carry her all the way to the king yourself if you have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is surprisingly light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, after a long journey home, you arrive in the kingdom, on a white horse, with Princess Emily holding onto your back for balance.  The king's soldiers see you riding down the street, and immediately circle your horse to protect you as you are escorted to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The princess has returned!\" some of the peasants shout, and cheers echo through the city.  Soon church bells are ringing and you are taken before <b>the king</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking his daughter to examine her, the King returns in the jolliest mood he has ever had, and asks for you to see him on his throne.  You walk there and await you reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren, you are but a boy, but you have done what my army could not, you have defeated Mortask, and rescued my daughter.  To this I you have my eternal thanks.  I would reward you with the most prestigious job you may obtain,\" he says.<br>\r\n\"It is my honour your majesty.\"<br>\r\n\"Very well, you are to be top aid <b>Prince Kevin</b>, heir to the neighbouring kingdom of <b>Kotor,</b> and future husband to my daughter.\" he decrees.<br>\r\n\"Eternal thanks your majesty,\" you say as you kneel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis that the court erupts into thunderous applause, as you go off to meet Prince Kevin.  The result is less than welcoming.<br>\r\n\"So you're the  stooge the king has sent to me,\" he says in a disgusted manner, as you enter his room.<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir, it was my reward for saving the princess, your future wife,\" you explain.<br>\r\n\"Wife in name only I assure you.  This marriage is to protect both kingdoms.  Sorcerers such as Mortask are becoming more common.  We need to pool resources to defeat them.  But I am sure all this is too much for your peasant head to follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a painful smile and shut your mouth, realizing that if you hit him, your life would be forfeit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot stand the site of you, dolt. Take this to Emily's room, and profess that it is a symbol of our love,\" he says as he tosses you a ring.  \"Don't hurry back, I assure you that I will not be leaving for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he pushes you out of his room, and slams the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo maids walk by, lowering their heads as they pass.  The king had declared that none but royal woman could speak in the presence of a man who was not her husband, unless they were spoken too first.  As they hurried by, you could see the <b>bracelets</b> each one wore wearing those made it impossible for them to break the laws, or disobey direct orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked to Emily's room, you felt an odd sensation in the air.  Whatever it was made your skin tingle, protection magic perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the ring tightly as you walk towards Emily's door.  Knocking to see if she was awake.  A maid opened the door, and went to tell Emily that the boy who had saved her was here.  Emily immediately sent away her maid, and bid you enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind you, you could see that she had just finished getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren.  My hero.  What brings you here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Kevin, your prince sent me with this ring,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"What a sweetheart, but you know, it is just a ring, he was not the one who rescued me.\"<br>\r\n\"We both know you rescued yourself, I just picked up the pieces.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes my dear Ren, but we are the only ones who know that.\"<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\"<br>\r\n\"And we are both better off because of it.  My father doesn't know that I studied black arts, and you get to be the hero.  Win-win.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, here is your ring, I suppose I should go,\" you tell her as you hand it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it,\" she says rejecting the ring.  \"I'd rather talk.  You are the only person I talked to for the past week.  And most the time I was very quiet.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me Ren, when you met Mortask, what were you planning to do?\"<br>\r\n\"Kill him I suppose.\"<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.  And how would you have done it?\"<br>\r\n\"Sword maybe.  Dumb luck.\"<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\"<br>\r\n\"It is?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.  That's the difference between you and me.  I think things through.  I plan ahead.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, all that still got you captured.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I escaped. And was saved by the most chivalrous boy I could find.  You never even took advantage of me.\"<br>\r\n\"Princess, are you alright?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, better than ever,\" she answered after a second of thought, a gleam of hate in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen from out of nowhere, Emily drew a wand and pointed it at you, with a loud snap it froze you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren, do you know what this is?\"<br>\r\nYou don't answer, because you can't.  You are frozen in time, helpless as she walks towards you.<br>\r\n\"I don't tolerate assassins.  But unfortunately, I cannot kill you.  You see, I had to use an abundance of light magic in order to obtain this form.  I cannot cause physical harm to anyone like this,\" she admitted, pointing to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to shout the name 'Mortask' to get attention into the room, but can't move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the others in the kingdom know that Mortask is dead, except for you.  That makes you a threat.  But I can't leave you like this, people would think it odd that there was a living man frozen in time in my bedroom.  But I can't let you go either.  And now that I am in the castle, I have no reason for you to live,\" she said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks around you, tapping you with her want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I think I have found a way to solve our problem.\" she says to you.</span></div></div>",

A tingling sensation fills every inch of your body, as you can feel your form become altered by the spell.  Your fingers become slimmer, as your nails become longer.  Your muscles disappear, as the fat on your body reforms.  Your ankles becomes skinner, as your hips become larger, and your ass forms into a bubble shape.  Your chest swells as your nipples darken and expand, and soon, two noticeably large breasts become attached to you.  Your genitalia moved inwards as they morph into female reproductive organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair flows down behind your neck, as it becomes the colour of gold.  Your face becomes fighter, as your chin and nose shrink in size.  Your lips become fuller and redder, almost an unnaturally bright red, and your eyelashes darken as they get longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily laughs giddily at the transformation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clothes begin to change shape as well.  Your shirt morphs into a corset, shrinking your waistline, while emphasizing your breasts and ass.  Your pants rework themselves into a dress, as a bustle appears beneath it.  Your boots morph into heels that are high enough that you would find walking to take lots of effort, if you could even move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou skin becomes snow white, as your teeth transform into the colour of pearls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've hit you with an overdose of white magic.  But since you're a purer soul than me, you should feel some effects that I even never had to deal with,\" the princess says with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, like me, you cannot cause any physical harm to anyone.  But, because you're a virgin, the spell has even more power on you.  You might feel the need to make everyone's happiness, happiness more important than your own. You might act happy and eager about things that you have no reason to be happy or eager about.  Also, if you find yourself trying to look better to please someone, don't worry, that is normal, your looks are one of the few things to can actually change in your life.  And if you are wondering why I am telling you this, its because the overdose of white magic makes me truthful.  It's why I rarely talked on our journey here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked around her room, until she opened a drawer and took out a bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, once I put this beauty on you, you will no longer be a threat to me.  Just give you some simple orders, and I'll never see you in my life again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked closer to you and was about to slip the bracelet over your arm.</span></div></div>",

Ren matches a fittingly feminine flirty smile, with appalling ease.  \"Hi there.

Last night you agreed to do it.\" He replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have been out of my mind.\" You protest and blush remembering the last night. \"Just because I blew you, you can't make me wear such a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then just try it on. And if it doesn't please you, you can still take it off and return to your old clothes.\" Gaven says forcefully. \"I thought you wanted to become a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and finally take the clothes from him. \"If it's just trying them on, I can do it.\" You say and vanish in a changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after waking up in the arms of the knight and still having the taste of his semen in your mouth, he and you went to a tailor the Tavern-owner recommended for adventurers. There Gaven looked at some clothes and finally asked you to put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you hold them before you and sigh. \"Why did I have to agree to it last night?\" You ask yourself and undress. You feel a little ashamed as you see your slim naked body. It's nowhere near the body of Gaven, the muscular knight's. It is rather soft and in some areas a little plump and your penis is very small. You feel ashamed of your small penis, but as you want to become a girl you don't care. At least you think so.<br>\r\nYou lift up the first cloth and hold it before your body. \"Why does it has to be pink?\" You sigh before you put the tunic on. It goes down to your knees and ends like a skirt. On your waist it's a little tight before it gets too wide on your chest. The cutout and the wide chest-part are clearly made for a girl with a moderate bust. But on you with your flat chest it looks out of place.<br>\r\nAfter the tunic you put on a leather jacket on. It too is tailored to fit a girl and not a boy. It squeezes on your belly and makes it look thinner. It also accentuate your missing bust, which makes you feel uneasy.<br>\r\nNext comes a pair of leather boots matching your jacket. They look most like your old boots, but again they are made for girls. The heels of them are higher than on boots for males and make you stand a little on your toes. They also are tighter on your lower legs, which make them look more feminine.<br>\r\nLast but not least comes a pair of gloves. They are made out of the same material as the tunic and are also pink. They go over your elbows and just end under the sleeves of the jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" You ask Gaven and blush. You think you look silly wearing such girly clothes and would rather take them off than show them to him. But as he picked them, you think you could at least show him.</span></div></div>",

And you love having sex, especially with Gaven fucking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time you let out your loudest moan as you climaxed. Exhausted you let yourself fall on the bed beside your partner. Your breasts rise up and down with every breath you took. \"That was fantastic.\" You say while catching your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there is more to come.\" Gaven turns you on your belly and shoves his erection back into your ass. Again you moan loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you moan your voice gets higher. Even your body changes and becomes more feminine as your butt gets bigger and rounder and your waist smaller. Your penis and testicles get sucked into your body and a small slit starts to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, keep fucking me.\" You moan now sounding like an adult woman. \"I love it when your long cock gets shoved into my tight ass-pussy.\"</span></div></div>",

Gaven tells you to close your eyes as he doesn't want the hair-liquid to flow in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you can open them again you look at the reflection of a woman with long blond hair reaching down to her feet. The hair is wavy and looks velvety. Even her face looks different. She wears perfect make-up and a fancy necklace going down to her cleavage. A matching tiara is placed on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that me?\" You ask, turn your head a little and put your hand on your face.

If someone or something will hit and injure you, fatally too, I will restore you. I will not betray your trust.\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you saying this to me Julio?\" You say worried<br>\r\n\"Because it's needed that you protect me, with you body too if you will not be able to do so with your sword.\" answers Julio \"I have only one offensive spell that has only two effects: it kills immediatly the undeads and deprives black mages of their magic abilities. There is only one problem: I'm not able to cast it immediatly, I have to prepare it for some time... approximately I need thirty seconds. In that thirty seconds you will have to protect me or, if I will be disturbed, hit or worst, I will fail...\"<br>\r\n\"So 'I have to protect you' it's intended as 'I have to take on my body all the blows, hits and strokes' that are directed to you! Are you saying that?\" You angrily say<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" said embaressed Julio \"... I know that it wasn't in our deal... but it's the only way that we have to defeat this blackmage... my teachers of the college of magic said to me that he can't be defeated using coventional weapons! Firstly we have to deprive him with my spell, then, after I had restored you, you will kill him with your sword...\" ended Julio.<br>\r\n\"Ok, Julio, I'm not convinced about that... but let's try.\" You concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that argument you and Julio approaches cautiously to the tower.

While Julio is enetring from the door, you try to open the trapdoor and in that moment you are pushed away from there by an unknown magic power. Suddenly the tower door abruptly closes and you and Julio are trapped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done?\" asked scared Julio.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I tried to open that trapdoor when...\" but you are interrupted by someone that is opening the trapdoor from the other part. Two well armed skeletons come outside and start to walk toward you. You embrace your little shield and sword and, knowing that you have no hope with two enemies, try to fight them back. Immediatly you hear Julio saying something in an ancient language... <br>\r\n\"Maybe he is casting his spell!\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment one of the two skeletons tries to hit you in a more violent way. You manage to block its stroke with your little shield that is broken in the attempt.<br>\r\nThe other skeleton is now charging another blow and you scared, seeing that strike as the mean of your departure, try to dodge it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLIP THE COIN</span></div></div>",

The spider girl's face lit up in joy as she bounced up and down. \"Yaaaaaay\" she shouts, happy that she will be human again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off the hairclip, hoping that you would turn back into a boy again. Unfortunately you had no such luck as you still remained a girl. The spell cast by the hairpin permanently affected your body. \"Darn\" you say to yourself in your mind. The spider girl shows her gratitude to you and takes your hand again. \"Oh thank you, thank you, thank you\" the spider girl said. \"But i should give you your gift first\" she says. Holding your hand she starts transferring her energy to you. Her spider form was weakening as she became less and less spiderlike and you became more and more spiderlike. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n    As she transformed back into a human her lower spider body's legs receded into the body itself and the body morphed into two normal human legs. Her teeth became less sharp and smaller like a human's and her hair and body grew a bit shorter to regular size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Transfering her energy to you, you began to feel strange. You feel your teeth suddenly becoming bigger and sharper like fangs as they grew to the point where they hung out of your mouth below your upper lip. Your golden hair grew longer until it reached your waist, which started to morph as well as your lower body shapeshifted. Your two normal girl legs morphed and grew bigger as they came together while ripping your skirt and boots to pieces. The morph was a bit painful but soon your two legs fused together into a spider abdomen. Six skinny little spider legs protruded from your abdomen's sides and gracefully touched the ground as you stood on all six, with the eighth pair obviously being your arms. speaking of your arms they were now long and more feminine, with sharp nails, red like blood, or poison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked down at yourself you poked your abdomen. It was fury like a spider's and you could feel it since it was a part of you. You looked at your nails and how red they were. Each one of your spider legs stood firmly on the ground. You concentrate and give a command to one of the to lift up and it lifts like your own leg. You supposed you were already getting used to how your spider body was wired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW, look how beautiful you look\" the former spider girl said. You wer sort of speechless as it was very unusual to know you were no longer human.<br>\r\nBeautiful gold hair, intimidating sharp teeth and nails ready to tear into your prey\" she said. \"Well, a deals a deal, please give me the hairpin so i won't fall victim to anymore curses<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding the pin you hand it over as the gilr takes it gladly. Putting it in her hair she says \"Thank you very much and enjoy your spider life\". She walks off out of sight through the maze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood aimlesly. You did the right thing and helped someone in need. You were now a spider woman, a queen of arachnids. You thought you should test your powers to get used to them.</span></div></div>",

This is a noble quest I'm journeying on.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Leave the questing to the men, the cocks always fight for their mother hen.

Suddenly, the brush that you were holding has again become a dagger, and you have more muscles that you need to get out of this situation.  Blindly striking your attacker, the boiling water of the pond turns red, as after a moment of calm, you emerge from under it's waters.  You quickly pull yourself out, as your pants squish with every movement you make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute?  Your pants!  You have pants again, and all the proper male parts.  You feel your head, and realize that the hairpin must have gotten knocked loose in the struggle.

This man disappeared three years ago, and had never been seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then hits you, the two creatures that attacked you were both transformed men.  As one, you could also be at risk of transforming in this labyrinth.  But maybe those other creatures only attacked you because you were female.  And maybe the enchantments of the labyrinth need you to do more than walk through it to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly contemplate what to do.</span></div></div>",

Every heave was a painful reminder of the lumps on your chest and you now detected the pungent scent and taste of cum in your mouth.

Worse yet, it was getting dark and the cold breeze of the night made your nipples painfully hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed and you regain enough composure to start making plans. You figure that your most urgent goal would be to regain your manhood and that the best way to do so was to head to a village.

Your vehement focus on men became skewed and you soon find yourself envisioning foreign thoughts. Images of men race through your mind and you imagine their chiseled jaws and muscular chests. You hadn't considered it before, but their arms were so big and the thought of them being able to lift you with ease was exciting. You imagine your hands groping at one of their biceps, totally incapable of covering them, and you feel yourself burning up. Gradually, your imagination takes you lower, and you start to think about cock -- after all, isn't that what you were looking for? </span></div></div>",

Still turned on, your hand glides down your stomach and pauses right before your hole. You allow one finger to run along this crevice of your body, then add a second finger, and you slowly start making circles around your clitoris. It's frightening how easily all of this is coming to you, but you're in far too much pleasure to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your other hand you grab one of your breast and squeeze it with all your might. The excitement far exceed the pain, and the floodgates of womanly desire open. You imagine a man taking you roughy, groping your chest with that mighty strength of his. You feel small, yet comforted in letting yourself be taken by someone so powerful. The thought of such an imposing figure laying himself on top of you is just too much and you increase the pace of your fingering.

You're moaning loudly, gasping for more, and you feel an endless wave of pleasure consume you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arm gives in before your pussy and you can no longer continue moving despite how badly you desire it. A second wind invigorates you as you recall the events of earlier today -- kneeling on the grass, sucking off a man, gagging on that long piece of meat, and swallowing his load. Oh if only you could have that again, inside your pussy, his seed filling you to the brim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's already nighttime by the time you finish. You lie in that secluded corner, pants off, entire body drenched in sweat and your other womanly juices. Your fingers and the inside of your thigh are soaked, and you're panting as you stare up at the stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you calm down you curse yourself for giving in to such primal urges. Had you stayed the course, you may have already been a man again, yet here you are, more a woman than ever before. You hate the lingering feeling in the back of your mind as it thinks about how much more enjoyable things would have been with a real man and a real cock in your hands. \"If I give in to these emotions, I'll never be an adventurer again\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, reality begins to sink even further in and you realize you have no idea where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Long strands of brown hair continually get in your way and you're constantly stroking it behind your ears. At last, you find your carving knife as well as a piece of flint. You fumble around in the darkness for some sticks of wood and fortunately manage to gather some. Eventually, you make yourself a fire and within a few minutes slowly make your way through the forest with a torch in one hand and the knife in another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light from your torch provides lights up a considerable area but only emphasizes the darkness in those places it cannot reach. The flickering shadows scare you, and the various sounds of creatures stirring about only worsen the situation. While your knife gives you some confidence, deep down you know that it won't do much good against anything larger than a squirrel. You shudder. You were once Ren, the mighty hero who'd one day slay dragons, defeat powerful wizards, and rescue beautiful princesses from far away lands. Now, tiny little rodents were your worst nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I am still the mighty Ren!,\" you mutter under your breath, grimacing slightly at the sound of your feminine voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes and soon the moon shines brightly above the forest canopy. Your whole body hurts, your arms are tired from carrying the knife and torch, your legs and feet are sore from walking, and your stomach has only grumbled even louder. Adding to your pains were the occasional burps you were making -- not only was this embarrassing to your female mind, but each burp brought back remnants and reminders of the thief's load.

Footsteps get closer and closer, and you begin to furiously flail your arms around, hoping beyond hope that the fire or knife would scare away beasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears are streaming down your cheeks as the fear of death grips you. Never have you felt so frightened or helpless in a situation, so incapable of escaping your predicament. Prior thoughts of being a great hero conquering quests that no man dared challenge evaporate with every choked sob. Instead you wish you could have someone protect you, someone to save you from all this terribleness. Your knees give in and you're on the ground curled up in fetal position, awaiting your fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you see a light approaching and a call from a stranger. Squinting your eyes you make out the silhouette of...a man! You immediately straighten up and try to wipe away your tears as the figure approaches you. Before long a young man stands before you, looking down with the most welcoming face you'd ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard screams and crying, and rushed over as fast as I could,\" he says as he reaches his hand out towards you, \"you seem a little lost m'lady\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, speechless at how fortunate you were that this hero had found you in this wretched forest. You eagerly grab his hand and immediately notice how big, rough and callous it is -- the hands of a strong man. He lifts you up with ease and before you can control yourself, you've wrapped your arms around him and start to uncontrollably sob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I'm here now,\" he says as he returns your embrace and gently pushes the hair back from your wet face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the man has set up a camp and the two of you are seated next to each other by a campfire. The bright fire is far more luminous than the torch, and you notice your hero's face for the first time. He's a young man, about 20 years old, yet he's got refined features and a rugged look that suggests he's been on the road for a while. Even better was that his body was sculpted to match that of a true adventurer, and you feel like he could take on just about anything. Rather than feel jealous or emasculated, you feel relief that there were people like him who could protect you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou idiot! A voice in your head yells, this is the perfect opportunity for you to regain your manhood. You immediately recall the enchantment -- it would be easy for you to recite the words and have your life restored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to do something so cruel to a man who just saved your life seems so wrong. Is this really the kind of person I am? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man notices your fidgeting, and places his hands over yours. There is a look of confidence in his eyes that immediately calms you down, and before you know it you're lost in conversation. Everything he says enchants you, and you find yourself laughing at every little thing he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the both of you are lying next to each other inside his tent. The man has fallen asleep and is snoring slightly. You watch as his broad chest moves up and down, and your eyes wander down towards his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerform the spell and end this farce, you think.

Your curiosity piqued, you stretch out your arm as you yank the band of his pants downwards, causing his cock to spring out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are immediately assaulted by the smell of it. Inhaling a scent of what seemed like piss and cum, you unconsciously drool at the edge of your mouth. The cock was glorious, all 10 inches of it were hanging low as if it was a fruit ready to be plucked. You take it in your hand as you press your nose against the head of the cock and take a deep breath. The smell was intoxicating and caused you to feel aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly peeled back the skin, you notice traces of smegma lingering around the head of the cock, causing the smell to intensify.

I might as well clean him up a little and call it even.\" As you justify your next act to yourself, you fail to notice that small and sleek tongue was already stretched out of your mouth, pointing towards the large member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you inch your head forward, your tongue lands on his cock and your plump lips proceed to wrap around it. Your tongue proceeds to make quick work of the cock, scooping up the traces of smegma and swallowing them. It has a bitter taste, but strangely you enjoy it. \"Mmph, mmm, thish ish sho delishoush,\" you mumble as you proceed to lick off any last trails of smegma. As you do, you notice that his cock was already standing at full length, at a seeming 12 inches. Just then, you hear a groan from the man as he sits up. Noticing you with your lips wrapped around his cock, he seems confused at the ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you try to take it out of your mouth to explain the situation to him, he smiles as he puts his hand on the temple of your head. With one quick thrust, he lowers your head all the way to the base of his cock, your nose touching his wirey pubic hair. Over the next couple of minutes, he uses his hand to guide your head along his cock, causing it to bob in very quick motions. You make numerous gagging and sputtering noises, but he was seemingly oblivious to your troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slows down his hand, you realize the twitching of his cock was a signal that he was about to blow his load. Getting ready to spit out the goods, the first wave of cum blasts into your mouth and without a moment's hesitation, you proceed to... swallow. As wave after wave of cum sputter in your mouth, you swallow each load almost immediately. You even use your tongue to force any remaining cum out of his urethra and even gave a final cleaning to the head of his cock before parting it from your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you revel in ecstacy, slight traces of cum glistening on your tongue, you suddenly recoil in horror at what you have done. You realize that the spell was forcing you to have an addiction to cum, and that you needed to intake it daily if you didn't want to go insane. Shuddering in disgust, you quickly activated the spell to initiate a swap of genders. After a few moments, you realize that the spell has no effect on him. You guess that it has something to do with the fact that you swallowed his cum, and now he was immune to your spell's effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to find a nearby village, and fast, lest you be known as the mighty \"Ren the Cocksucker\" from now on. You certainly need the help of the guy you just swallowed a \"delicacy\" from. As you walk up to him and explain that you need to find a nearby village, a grin becomes plastered on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, m'lady, I do know a path to the nearby village, and will lead you there, but frankly, after your performance, I did realize that I need some payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face becomes pale as you understand the implication of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will give you two options. You can either drop to your knees every time my shaft stiffens and suck my seed out of it, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trails off as his imagination runs wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may allow me the pleasure of plunging myself into the deep corners of your womanhood. I won't be selfish, one time is all I need and I will immediately whisk you to the nearest village with no complaint. Speaking of which, you may want to make your decision now as you will need to get to work quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes trail his gaze downwards as you notice his cock hardening again. Certainly, sucking him off numerous of times a day would be humiliating and would further cause your need for cum to increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the other option wasn't so nice either. This result would be that you would be stuck in this body forever. As soon as you enter the nearest village, you'll likely make use of the back alley often, bending over and presenting your pussy to various men as a means to survive. Then again, your pussy was feeling incredibly hot and moist right now, so you certainly wouldn't mind to qualm that feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The man stands up to stretch while you make your decision. You can't help but stare as his cock gets bigger, then notice that he's smirking at your gaping face. Quickly you get up to your knees, and lower your gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will suck your seed,\" you say, feeling your cheeks burn with shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" the man cheerfully replies, taking a step closer with his fully erect penis. \"Now fulfill your duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean forward with your mouth open and tongue hanging out. The increasingly familiar smell of his musk fills your nostrils as you wrap your lips around his cock. The angle is different from when he was lying down, more akin to the moment when you lost your manhood that afternoon. He towers over you, fully in control with his hand on top of your head. You slowly inch your way towards his pelvis, your tongue gliding along the seemingly endless piece of meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he lets you control your pace, but when your face buries itself once more into his pubic hair, his hand moves toward the back of your head and forces you to stay there. You begin to gag and instinctively raise your hands to push yourself away but he orders you to stop. Your watering eyes dart upward, pleadingly, but he keeps firm. Just as you're about to run out of air he pulls you back by your hair. As you gasp for breath, there are long strands of saliva and cum connecting your mouth to the tip of his penis -- each deep inhale causes you to swallow some threads but the majority remains. You pray that he's already finished but it was just pre-cum and he stands as erect as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely a few moments pass when he seizes the sides of your head with his hands and forces you back onto his cock. He's thrusting this time, keeping your head in place. The rhythmic motion of his thrusts increases and with each motion you feel him ram the back of your throat deeper and faster. You're choking, trying to control your gag reflex but you can't adapt as fast as he moves. His speed reaches its apex and you hear him let out a loud groan. Suddenly, you feel his cum shoot deep into your throat and you try to swallow as it comes. It's still too much and there's cum dripping out of your mouth when he finally pulls out. You take a big salty gulp and then lick your lips and chin to clean up the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a conflicting mix of feelings when you see his glistening flaccid penis: you're pleased that you satisfied him but disgusted that you feel this pride for the tool that was just used to skull-fuck you. As you tell yourself that the ordeal would be over soon, you realize in horror that the man has lied back down next you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force the words out of your tender throat,\"Aren't we going to the village now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'lady, it's the middle of the night. We'll go in the morning\", he says, pulling up the sheets and turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at his muscular back, shocked and about to cry. Just then, he turns back around and you feel a sense of relief when you see him smile at you. Perhaps it was all a joke -- after all, the moon was full and the night was still bright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" you ask eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're ready to satisfy my morning wood\" he grins and turns back around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away, dejected and in tears. Your stomach is still growling and the stench in your mouth is as strong as ever. To make matters worse, you can't sleep in your normal position lying forward because your breasts prohibited it. You knew it was going to be a long day tomorrow -- who knows how many times you'd have to service the adventurer whose name you didn't even know but whom you've eaten his seed twice without having moved two steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse yet, all the humiliation has somehow turned you on and you realize that your loins are dripping wet. You can feel yourself get hotter thinking about pleasuring yourself next to such forbidden fruit but the rational part of you is screaming to get some sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can feel your pussy aching, just barely covered by the thin cloth that now adorns your figure. The night is chilly and you can feel your cold skin shivering, except for that place down there that seemed to emanate heat. You contemplate about sticking a finger in there to relieve the tension, maybe two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. No, what are you thinking? You are the mighty Ren! Sure, you may have put on a shameful display today, but there was still hope as long as you didn't fall into womanly wiles. You quickly retreat your right hand that was slowly approaching the designated location. You decide to sleep, but couldn't get your mind off about how turned on your pussy was down there. If only you could ease the pain, then you could soundlessly go to sleep. After two hours of sleeplessness, you barely fall asleep from the exhaustion that you are experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dreams this night were not pleasant. You saw yourself being raped by five men in a small village. Three of them were in the front and two of them were in the back. You were jerking off two of the guys while tearfully taking one in the mouth as you kept repeatedly mumbling, \"Pwease dun't hurf me!\" The men kept laughing in response as they kept brutally fucking you, while slapping your ass once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in cold sweat as you experience some pain on your breasts. You look downwards and see a pair of hands violently manhandling them as some sticky, hard thing is prodding your back. Already suspecting the nature of this object, you turn around to come face to face with the man who dumped all of his seed down your mouth just yesterday. You see a grin emerging on his face as he tells you, \"M'lady, I'm sure you know what to expect of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip as you remember yesterday's events. You didn't want to do this, but without his help, there was little chance of you getting through the forest on your own. As you hesitantly get on your knees, the man turns to lay on his back as he crosses his hands behind his head. As you take a glance at his cock, you confirm what you saw yesterday: it was standing erect in all of its 12 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you bite your lip once more, you slowly lean forward as you are about to take the member in your mouth. In your head, you assure yourself that you're only doing this as payment, that you aren't going to enjoy this one iota, and that, when you get to the nearest village and turn yourself back to a man, you will pay back for everything that he has done. You take the rock-hard head of his cock between your lips and give his piss slit a lick. You then proceed to lick under the glands of his cock, as you knew where a man's most sensitive spot is located. You slowly start to bob your head as you keep telling in your head that you are not enjoying, and that you're finding it revolting just smelling the thing, let alone sucking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first drop of pre-cum escapes from the opening of his meat rod, you find yourself accidentally tasting it. And oh my god. The taste is incredible. What should have been a bitter morsel seemed to just melt on the tongue. You stop for moment as your mind proceeds to react to what just happened. You go into a daze as you revel in the experience. The pre-cum was tasty, and you knew that you had to get more of that! You quicken your movements as your hunger for cum begins. You hear the man begin to moan and begin to synchronize the movement of his waist along with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep up that speed for a few more minutes as you desperately lick his entire cock. You try to get the whole thing in your mouth, but you keep gagging due to the length of it. Finally, some other bursts of pre-cum fill your mouth and you revel in ecstasy about the whole experience. Suddenly, you hear the man groaning even louder and his dick began to pulsate. You take this as a signal that he's going to cum. You need to pull out, but some unseen force is preventing your lips parting from the thing. Suddenly, several bursts of sperm are ejaculated into your mouth, filling your cheeks as well as hitting the roof and tongue of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blank out. Although you are sure that you stay like that for an hour at least, it only lasts a couple of seconds. You slowly savor the semen in your mouth, chewing it before swallowing in small amounts. You feel like you're in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you snap out of it. You realize the atrocity of the situation and begin to gag. You want to vomit the contents that you just swallowed right now, but your body is not allowing it, as if saying that it needs more of the man's seed. The situation begins to dawn over you: the curse! It didn't just turn you into a woman, it was also making you into a slut. And you were beginning to become addicted to cum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you need to get out of this situation - and fast. The only way is to have someone else take fall for you. You needed to meet other people and have one of them take your form!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you get back on your feet and brush the dust of your loins that resembled a skirt. You turn to the man and tell him, \"Shall we move on? I want to quickly reach the next village before nightfall.\" The man, with a grin plastered on his face, gets up and replies, \"Certainly, m'lady, that was a fine job you did there.\" As he grabs his cock and pulls it back into his pants, you turn your face away so that the thing doesn't mesmerize you anymore. You are a hero, damn it, not some wanton whore! And you needed to get the face to match it sooner rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turns and proceeds to go in a direction, as you follow his pace with small, but quick steps.</span></div></div>",

As they crawl unddr the edge of his underpants he brings his hands at his crotch.

As you remove his underpants you see the two bubblesuckers that, attached to his crotch, are pumping out his manhood from him. Intrigued from this situation you rub his lower stomach: the man body trembles while the two bubblesuckers enter inside his gland leaving his penis to your mercy.<br>\r\nLooking it you sense a sort of envy: once you had one of these but now... you squeeze your legs feeling the emptiness between them... now nothing hangs down there: as you think to his penis, as you want it for you.

I... can't last... longer....\" he whispers overwhelmed by pain and pleasure.<br>\r\nHis penis throbs harder in your hand, he's going to have an orgasm: you feel it well, you had been a man before...<br>\r\nWithout thinking to much a finger slides insides your genitalia and starts rubbing your clitoris: as moan you arch your spine increasing its exposure. In that moment returns in mind the fact that you are stealing his manhood... this drives you mad and you have an orgasm. While having it you stop briefly your work on its penis... you pant contrapting your abdomen and, after few moments of relax you look at hin and say<br>\r\n\"Still here...?\"<br>\r\nAs you said that you stroke its penis faster and harder, the man moans, pants as his penis throbs hardly... he comes.<br>\r\nAs he spurts his load on your hand you feel his penis becoming flaccid more than normal inside your palm. You release your grip on it and shift your hand on his ballsack: clearly you feel his testicles being pulled up while the skin on his penis retracts leaving his shrank gland naked. As the man moans are becoming feminine you watch his ballsack opening and forming a slit on his crotch; as he opens his eyes you watch his pole changing its inclination and sliding inside the newly formed slit. He became a she definitely while you see his gland, now reduced to a small pinkish sphere, entering between the folds of her crotch.<br>\r\nAs he understands what's just happened he screams loudly: her feminine voice made her understand that she is not an he anymore. In that moment you see the bubblesuckers exiting from their host genitalia and crawling in the room.<br>\r\nHearing the screams the guards knock at the door asking<br>\r\n\"Do you have finish your work?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you reply<br>\r\n\"Put the bubblesuckers inside the cage Rennie and I'll open the door\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clearly doesn't want to become female so he asked to you to lock up the bubblesuckers.

Your upbringing has taught you never to stare at a woman's parts for more than a second, but now that they're your parts, you find it best to get familiar with them.<br>\r\nYour skin looks like it's never seen sun, it's a silky, almost slimy smooth.  You hair feels softer and thicker that you've imagined it could.  It's also a bit heavier than you're used too.  It's no hair fit for an adventurer such as yourself.  It is too easily caught and tangled in enemy hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look at your boobs, their dark nipples are bigger than they were when you were a man.  They're more distracting as they brush against your shirt.  A shirt made for a boy.  The cloth wrapped around your hips is tighter than you remembered before the encounter with the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the cloth, you see what it is now covering.  Your outie has become an innie.<br>\r\nYour feet look different too, although you're not exactly sure how.  You've lost your sandals, and have been going barefoot through the cave since your escape.  In fact, besides the clothes on your back, you've lost everything, including your manhood.  All you really have now if your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange, you didn't even notice you weren't carrying any light as you escaped, your eyes have adjusted to the darkness almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and keep moving until you reach an exit.  A thick brush hides this entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you move down the mountainside into the forest, you feel a warmth in the sky, dawn is soon to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted and hungry, you make it to a clearing.  To the north lies a barn.  To the south a hamlet.<br>\r\nThe Barn is a good hiding place, but the people at the village would help you out, and maybe you could get some new clothes.</span></div></div>",

Delicious.<br>\r\nAs your tongue falls on your lip, you realize the same taste is on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're feeling full.  You must have done something while sleeping.

With your long nail, you easily rip the top-middle part of your shirt.  Your breasts need to breathe.  This loosens up the top of your shirt and your arms can move with more ease.  It still feels strange to walk in your pants.  You want less fabric on you.  It takes a surprising amount of willpower to convince yourself not to run naked through the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you run onto the path, you hear yourself grunt every other step, and you feel like you're bending over farther than most people would.

They look at you strangely. \"Ma'am, you shouldn't be out here, there are monsters about.\" You smirk and say \"Silly boys. You and your fantasies. There are no such things as monsters.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man starts trying to show you proof of why you should stay inside, but you began to feel something strange from within yourself. Your vision sharpened and you could hear their heart beats growing louder and louder. Eventually you couldn't take it anymore, so you looked one of them in the eyes and said \"you will not scream, you won't even move.\" You repeated this to each of them until the last one, who managed to catch on just before you used this new trick on him too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out his sword and slashed at you, but you grab his arm and use your razor sharp claws to yank it off. Then, you go in for the kill, completely out of control with blood lust. You begin to drink from him as his body twitches and shakes. The delicious liquid flowed down your throat, and you felt powerful, sexually and physically powerful in that moment. You ripped open your shirt and pulled down your pants, until you were completely naked. Finished with the man, his eyes rolling into the back of his head, you toss his corpse aside and look at one of his pals. \"You! Come here and satisfy my urges!\" Not in control, but with a look of total fear in his eyes he came over to you and began to rub up against your new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and him went at it for a short while, and finally he finished after you gave him permission, after your 3rd orgasm. You smirk and toss him aside too. You look into each of their eyes and tell them to \"Forget everything you've seen here. Your friend died from a bear attack. You'll burn his body and dump the remains in the lake and if anyone asks, it was because his spirit began to haunt you.\" The men departed and dragged their friend's corpse off with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman dressed in a very classy sense with a fancy hat comes walking along the path and spots you.

You go to her house but find yourself unable to walk inside. You ask her \"Um, can I come in?\" She looks at you oddly but for some reason says \"yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you are able to walk inside. You do so and make yourself at home while the woman hands you some of her fancy outfits and says \"Put these on. I don't mind, we women have to stick together these days.\" You agree with her. Something about her makes you adore this woman, so you decide that you might make her a servant of sorts to you and your \"adventurer\" cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks you if there's anything you want to eat. You think about it very hard but realize that you have no cravings what-so-ever for human food. You say \"no thank you, I had food earlier today\" and she goes back into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere comes a knocking at the door..</span></div></div>",

As you neared the more or less lump of stone you notice the fish has not moved despite your presence. You reach out to grab the statue, no bigger than your forearm for a closer examination.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the statue starts to glow with a red aura. Instinctively you try to drop it but the statue has somehow glued itself to your hands. Then the statue starts to repair itself, shapes began to rise from the worn edges and soon the previously eroded statue now showed a sword. It was then that you realized that the Legends were true, The Legend of the Godlings and the Nine Auras.<br>\r\nThe story goes, that before the existence of men there were nine God-like beings, each with their own power they were; Jurst - the Master of the Sword, Stypt - Master of the Shield, Harqu - Magic, Fetria - Persuasion, Ikobru - Luck, Cizet - Agility and grace, Brouderg - Strength and Wakremiar - Immortality and foresight. Each of them during their last days, made a statue that could store all of their power and skill to outlast time itself. Wakremiar had seen the future presence of man and warned the others of this. So they all built in a safety spell in each statue, this spell will cause an epic explosion if the statue is under another spell, if it is being damaged by living things or if it senses evil souls that seek them.<br>\r\nAs if to certify this epiphany, sword fighting stances flowed into your mind of all types from parries to lunges and actual sword forging to sensing fatal flaws in weapons. You glimpse the tips of your black silky hair redden to scarlet and the large fish suddenly morphed into a reddish obsidian sword. <br>\r\nFeeling the statue's grip go, you place it back on the rocks and you pick up the new sword. It was perfect, the weight was distributed evenly across the handle and blade which allowed you to get solid practice swipes in the empty air. Even better, the sword actually fitted snugly into your old sheath.<br>\r\nHowever the legend also tell of a bad effect each of the statues cause, as no one had actually encountered a statue the effect was unknown.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The man who appeared to be the leader beckoned the group to the statue and began to gaze over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let me out of this!\", you shout rather forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should we do that?\", replied the Leader as he looked up from the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am on a quest\", you say proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A beautiful lady like you, on a quest?\", the Leader says in a confused manner as he strolls up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am going to slay the red dragon\", you state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are here to find rare treasures and sell them for profit\", he said whilst eyeing your breasts, \"...and you look like a rare treasure\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the guys hand make contact with your inner thigh and then he slowly ran his hand up to your throbbing vagina, the only thing protecting your vagina was the latex body suit which was getting very warm. This made you utter a low moan as your female hormones and senses began to surge through your mind. <br>\r\n\"MMmmm.... stop...mmmmmm\", was all you could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get back to you when I have dealt with the statue\", the Leader said giving your vagina another stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from another wave of pleasure, you could see with your heightened senses that some kind of pressure was building up inside of the statue.<br>\r\nYou spotted a young man about your age, he looked skinny and weak but he walked up to the Leader and said,\"Maybe we should let her go, someone might be searching for her, someone powerful. She is after all on a quest to kill <i></i>The Red Dragon<i></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a fool Derik, you know what happens, first we have sex with her then we either kill her or make her our slave\", the Leader told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK captain\", Derik replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to panic, you didn't want to have sex even if a part of you was being turned on at the thought of being fucked by men.<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt your bindings being cut off. grabbing your sword and spinning around 180 degrees in one motion you were surprised to see Derik standing there with a knife.<br>\r\n\"You need to get out of here lady\", Derik whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you, that statue is going to explode any moment now.\", you whisper back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\", Derik asked, one eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the Legend of the Nine auras?\", you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, we should run\", Derik said wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Derik began to sprint away from the statue, along the river. The plan you both shared was that they would dive into the water when the statue exploded but you both knew that it wouldn't be enough to prevent yourselves from being killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as always luck pitched in at the right moment, about fifty metres away there was a waterfall, about 40 metres tall. From where you were it seemed more like the end of the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you grab Derik's hand ant both of you leap off the top of the waterfall.<br>\r\nIt was then that the statue erupted and released a super sonic pulse that threw you and Derik further. Next came the actual explosion, a sound so loud it ripped trees and boulders up from the ground shot through the forest, Finally came the fire, swirling and growing rapidly. It flew over the waterfall and carried on a few acres until it started to fade. Thankfully, the fire had not moved down after the waterfall. Reality zipped back to your vision as Derik bellowed, \"Brace yourself!\". Sucking up a load of air as you neared the waters surface made you slightly dizzy, you entered the water like a cannon ball knocking you unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The words echoed all over the cavern and was followed by the sound of thousands of wings flapping in the air. Hundreds of bats flew out of the crevices and spiralled around you and clumped together to form a man, a man with blood red eyes and orange lips. \"Well done Shadow, this looks like a very, very good vessel\", he said stroking your curves. If you were in control you would have sliced his head off right there. \"Master, would the previous body's soul still exist in here?\", Shadow asked, pushing your body close to his. \"No, no common mortal's soul can survive such power\", He replied, wrapping his arms around you, placing one hand on your ass and giving it a slight squeeze,\"And now I will give you the power to live forever, but remember, you only gain years by stealing years from others\", he said quietly. You could tell that your body pleased him as you could feel his erection pushing against his trousers and your latex covered vagina, but Shadow was also turned on as your vagina started to become moist. The man then said, \"To immortality\" and gave you a long snog. A strange essence poured down your throat and filled your heart\". \"Thank you Master, I will destroy the church of Aerithia\", Shadow replied with your body and dashed back into the tunnels. With super human speed you ran through the tunnels until you reached the normal outside world. \"I must feed\", Shadow muttered to herself and spotted a lone farmer, tending to his crops. At around 18 and skinny, he was obviously weak, but Shadow chose not to force his soul out with strength but with your body instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk sexily towards the farmer and said, \"Hello there Hunk, you want to see under this latex?\", whilst lifting up your right leg onto a tree stump and sliding your hands up and down it.<br>\r\n\"S..s...sure, but I have no mon...\", he began. \"No charge\", Shadow interrupted seeing his desperation to get laid. \"Really?\", He said in a voice of complete excitement. \"Yeah, lets go in there\", Shadow points to a small shed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the shed Shadow immediately strips and grabs the man who reacts by quickly pulling his clothes off and penetrating your moist pussy. \"Fuck me, FUCK ME HARDER\", Shadow demanded, your body was in an extreme orgasm and Shadow gave off a long moan. Then the man started to slow down as a strange light began to pass from him to you and he began to wither away into nothing. you then stood up, put your clothes back on and began sprinting towards the church, sword drawn.</span></div></div>",

Where Shadow's essence was met by the golden glow, a small electrical buzz was given off, eventually all of your body was writhing in electricity. Shadow's consciousness was leaking away. However, she was not going without a fight, she made your body thrash out, killing one of the priestesses who was foolish enough to be close. as Shadow did this, fragments of her subconscious were scattered around and embedded themselves in your mind.<br>\r\nFinally Shadow was destroyed and your body fell limp onto the floor with the world slowly fading to black ...</span></div></div>",

Its claws are immobilizing your hands while hisfeet are spreading your legs: horrified you look down only to see on your flat hairy pube a tentacle that, coming out from the monster belly mouth, it's nearing dangerpusly to your newly acquired grace.

Usually the pregnancy arrives at its conclusion in two days.<br>\r\nAs you experienced, a mapinguari is a feared creature even from the males because, since it needs females, it has the ability to convert the sperm that the creature harvests from its belly-mouth into a terrible poison that, once pumped through the victim throath, if not removed in few minutes it will change the victim gender totally.<br>\r\nThe process is known to be painful because firstly the poisons attacks the victim testicles making them contracting and ejecting all the semen, then it changes fenotipically the subject at all. However Once in this stagge there is no antidote.<br>\r\nWhen the male victim is successfully converted into a female, she is raped by the mapinguari that makes her pregnant.<br>\r\nA last important fact: the newly born mapinguari usually kills its \"mother\" because during the birth process it devours the internal organs of the victim as first meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed two days into the mapinguari lair: you are starving and you are hardly dehidrated. Obviously you have a big tummy that made you understand that you had been made pregnant the day of your aggression. You tried to escape during this prisony but the creature made your escape impossible.<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel your viscera hurting: you instictively stand up as you try to understand what's happening. As your viscera are hurting more and more you feel something moving inside your belly. you look down and you notice a little puddle of blood forming on the floor between your legs. From your slit a rivolet of blood come out. You scream loudly as you are hit by panic.</span></div></div>",

As you are dragged in, dozens of the ugly little creatures show up to jeer and gawk at you.  You are taken to a large tree in the centre of the village and released from your net.  All thoughts of escape are quashed, as you survey all the goblins around you.  Four of them are immediately on you, pinning you as their little hands grasp all about you, dislodging your knives and tools, then stripping you of your armour and clothing.  The assembled goblins hoot and laugh at your naked state, as the ones who pinned you attach a leather collar and leash to your neck.  You can't help but be humiliated, having been so thoroughly beaten by mere goblins.  The largest of the goblins in the crowd suddenly shouts and walks forward, lecherously appraising you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following months you manage to learn a few things: One is that there apparently are no female goblins.  Another is that the spell that was cast on you doesn't usually work unless the victim was particularly weak-willed in the first place.  That doesn't do much for your pride.  You also learn that as a woman, you are far more attractive that what breeding stock goblins can usually capture.  Finally, you learn that the goblin chief gets the right to choose personal wives from the breeding stock.  You are quickly taught to serve his every whim - that is until one of his underlings usurps him and takes you as his prize.  This occurs all to often in goblin society, and you become highly sought-after, causing many of the disgusting creatures to fight for the title of chief on a regular basis.  So it is that you are passed about the village like a prize, constantly forced to perform menial, humiliating tasks for your masters, and bearing many little goblin children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of your years of servitude, you see many young women captured, and almost all of them are eventually able to overpower their guards and escape.  You, however, are either too inept, too weak, or too prized to get away.  You simply grow used to living under the foot of whatever goblin happens to be in charge at the time.  Your long-gone masculinity and dreams of becoming an adventurer become a faded memory as you accept your new lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tale is at an end.  Guess you weren't cut out to be a hero after all.</span></div></div>",

You quickly looked around at her,  she was about your size, and had a walk of elegance. She had Blond hair, and white robes on.

Besides, you already pressed your luck in attacking five goblins today and you feel like taking a bit of a breather. \u201cI\u2019ll play it safe for tonight,\u201d you say. \u201cHow much for a night\u2019s lodging?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot overly much,\u201d the priestess replies. \u201cOur adventurers\u2019 quarters cost about fifty gold an evening. The cheaper rooms usually serve those who are hard pressed financially. They are available for as little as twenty gold, but such rooms are rather sparse and less restful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider your options for a moment. It might be a good idea to save your money for now, but you feel like splurging a bit with your reward from rescuing Heinric. \u201cI\u2019ll take an adventurers\u2019 room.\u201d You decide as the priestess begins to lead you through a large temple courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d she replies, handing you a key. \u201cThis will be for your room Mr...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d you stammer awkwardly. \u201cThe name is Ren.\u201d You hadn\u2019t even thought to introduce yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priestess doesn\u2019t seem to mind your lack of etiquette. \u201cMr. Ren, pleased to meet you. I\u2019m Faet.\u201d She leads you up a flight of stairs and down a few small cottages before stopping at one of the adventurers\u2019 quarters. \u201cThis will be your room.\u201d She gives you a welcoming smile. \u201cIs there anything else you could use assistance with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d You say, walking in and dropping your sword and shield onto the bed. \u201cDo you have a bulletin board or list of quests which I might view?\u201d Faet waves toward the small table in the corner of the room. \u201cWe update the quests every two or three days so this list should be up to date. If you are considering  buying any wears here, I\u2019d suggest you do so tomorrow morning. The market will be a bit crowded until it closes today.\u201d You notice the list as Faet is speaking. \u201cAlso,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe are having a feast tonight followed by an initiation ceremony. Our goddess will choose whom she desires to be her next priestess. We\u2019d love to see you there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Faet.\u201d You nod to her. \u201cI\u2019ll consider both your advice and invitation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil next time, Mr. Ren\u201d And with that, Faet left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the catalogue of quests and notice today\u2019s date written at the top. As Faet suggested it is up to date. Unfortunately, most of the quests are along the lines of thatching roofs in nearby villages or subduing overly aggressive dogs. Only two of the options seem suitable for an ambitious adventurer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Escort a small band of priestesses to the Feastfires Temple<br>\r\n2. Find and capture the bandits (still) hiding in Pertu city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a while. Either choice will probably require that you leave early the next morning. You could either go to sleep now in order to get up with enough time to buy some armor/clothing before you depart or you could go see who the goddess of light will choose to be her new new priestess.</span></div></div>",
