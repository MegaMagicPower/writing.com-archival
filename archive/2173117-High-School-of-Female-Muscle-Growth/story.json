Tired of being pushed around by both the girls and the boys at East Metropolis High, he developed a muscle and strength enhancer. Placing the enhancer in different sports drinks of various strengths and mixtures, Justin was about to try the formula out on himself, or perhaps others in his school. Only there were a couple of major problems he did not foresee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drink would work on boys, but only slightly, no more than a few good gym work outs even at the highest concentration. However, the boys then carry the potential for girls to gain the abilities of the drink at an even higher level through the boy\u2019s semen. And to add to the strangeness, boys who drank the formula became very attractive to females close to them while the drink acted as a pumped up Viagra. The other issue was that girls who drank the formula straight away would gain the abilities Justin had intended, only at higher levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked over the various sport drink bottles he had created. In order to keep things straight he decided to use different colors for different capabilities of his enhancement formula. Of course he could always make more, or change the mix, but for now he was satisfied. If things worked as he expected, then he would be the biggest, strongest boy in school. And then the bullying would stop. At least that was the plan. He needed to decide if he just wanted to go for it, or possibly try it out on someone else to check for any side effects, which he may have calculated to be none. But that\u2019s what field tests were for. Justin looked at his notes and back at the bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue was moderate muscle gain and strength increase.<br>\r\nYellow was large muscle gain and large strength increase<br>\r\nRed was very large muscle gain and strength increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course moderate, large and very large were all subjective at this point, but it did relate to the mix percentages and potencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin glanced at the door of the chemistry lab he was in. The professor allowed him the extra time in the lab as Justin was clearly the best student in school. Now he was ready to see if what he had created really was everything he hoped. So as he pushed his glasses back up toward the bridge of his nose, he looked up at the door, thinking he heard the door knob turn. Looking at the door, he saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Justin froze when he saw who was standing in the doorway. It was Christina, one of the cheerleaders and star of many of Justin\u2019s fantasies. She was drop dead gorgeous and Justin loved to watch her various curves slither as she walked. In truth Christina was the primary reason Justin wanted to create his enhancement formula. Her boyfriend was Stephen, who was one of the biggest and strongest on the football team. Justin thought that if he could build a body to rival Stephen\u2019s (or, even better, outgrow him) then maybe he would have a shot at winning Christina\u2019s heart, or at the very least get to stop being so nasty to him. The added benefit of no longer being the target of Stephen\u2019s bullying was the icing on the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dennis was not prepared to see her, not yet. Not when he was so close to his dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey science dweeb,\u201d she said from across the room. \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he fired back with a frozen stare that told her that he was most definitely up to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina smiled and began sauntering across the room, swaying her hips as seductively as she could. She loved the effect her body had on men, and relished any chance she had to exert her control. She was wearing her cheer outfit which was red and black with a tight top that molded itself to her generous C cup breasts and left just a hint of her stomach exposed above the waist of her skirt. The skirt in question was pleated and swayed as she walked showcasing her favorite physical attribute: her legs, which were shapely, very long, and very very strong. She never told anyone, but her idol was the James Bond villainess Xenia Onatopp. Christina loved to trap Stephen with her powerful thighs and squeeze until he was begging for release. Her upper body was no match for Stephen\u2019s incredible strength but when it came to her lower limbs she was fully in control. She\u2019d been working out for years focusing on cardio routines to keep her fitness level up, but recently she\u2019d added specific exercises to work her legs extra hard with full blown weight training. The results were the sculpted pillars of strength that were now propelling Christina toward where Justin was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rounded one of the desks and came into full view Justin\u2019s heart began pounding in his chest. He watched as her thighs flexed and hardened with each step and her calves bunched into sexy swells. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well originally I was just looking for some notes I had left here by mistake, but now I think I\u2019ve found something much more interesting. What\u2019s with the sports drinks? You must be mighty thirsty.\u201d She reached where Dennis stood and traced a path around him, circling like a shark looking for the right time to strike. The fact that she stood 2 inches taller than him made her all the more menacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just something I\u2019m working on, a.. uh..\u201d he stammered looking for a lie to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA muscle growth and enhancement formula?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin nearly jumped out of his skin. \u201cNO! What... why would you think that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped behind him and reached her hand around his right shoulder while getting her mouth very close to his left ear while her warm, soft breasts pressed into his back. She picked up one of Justin\u2019s many papers from off the desk and held it up. \u201cBecause it says right here that your formula is intended \u2018to increase the mass and density of the subjects muscles creating enhanced physique and vastly superior strength that could, in some instances, be considered superhuman.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina put the paper back down and shoved Justin aside where he went tumbling to the floor. He looked up at the statuesque beauty who just stared at him with contempt. \u201cNow I know I\u2019m just a poow dumb widdle cheeweader, but it looks to me, from your notes, that you set up three different concentrations in the three different bottles. And that if I drink one of them I\u2019ll be able to grow bigger and stronger. I don\u2019t know about you, but to me that sounds like some real fun!\u201d</span></div></div>",

She figured that she'd try the yellow drink first, as she did not want to be a monster just quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin charged at her just as she went to down the yellow drink, but she stopped him with a swift kick to the gut. \"What a wimp.\" She concurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina gulped down the whole yellow drink. \"How long's this gonna take? I haven't got all...\" Before she could finish her sentence, she exploded in ecstasy. Justin could only watch in peril as the beauty, Christina, transformed. Her top became stressed as her breasts swelled larger upon her new enhanced pectoral muscles. Her bare midriff showed an incredibly toned, smooth six-pack. As it always worked with Christina though, her legs got the brunt of the change. Justin gulped as he watched Christina grow taller, until she hit 6'0, all of the height adding to her legs. Her legs even became larger than they were before, but only adding tone. Her butt, which was nice before, was absolutely breathtaking now, as it began to eat up her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that worked out well!\" She laughed. \"Thanks, twerp!\"</span></div></div>",

This will make me even buffer.\u201d She Said as she took the bottle and began to chug it. However what she didn\u2019t know was Justin made the purple potion to take away muscles and strength as well as vision. The goal was to take the blue potion and use the purple one on his bullies to cause them to be physically weaker than he was now and let him grow to enormous heights and strength. Now he just tricked the cheerleader but hey at least it meant she wouldn\u2019t do god knows what to the school with her new strength. As he thought he smirked as the changes went fast. All of Christina\u2019s muscles were drained as her arms were toothpicks now as were her once stunning legs as well as losing tons of height putting her at 5 feet in hight. Also she no longer had her big boobs but instead a cups even nerdy girls would laugh at. Finally her eyes seemed to bug her indicating she needed glasses. The only part of the once beautiful cheerleader was her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou nerd what did you do!!\u201d She Yelled and hit him with a punch to the face as Justin laughed it off. \u201cYou just had to go and bully me and not only that but take my potion now you get the cost for it.\u201d He Said as the girl growled before reaching for the red potion. \u201cOh really well now I\u2019m gonna kick the shit out of you with this.\u201d She Said as she drank until it was no more but nothing happened. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m stupid enough not to make the potion impossible to fix. Face it your stuck with your new body while I..\u201d He Said as he grabbed the last bottle the blue one and drank. He suddenly grew to 6,6 feet tall and gained muscles that made him incredible toned and even attractive. As he flexed he smiled at the cheerleader. \u201cWell this has been fun but I must go and flex off my new body. Good luck with your body now.\u201d Justin Said as the girl looked to him as he walked away as she cried. </span></div></div>",

But Christine, already an incredibly athletic girl before the growth, now possessed the size and strength of a guy football player of equivalent height and easily shoved the nerd aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNowhere, just to the locker room\u201d She said with a smile while taking hold of the energy drink bottles and putting them in her backpack \u201cNow if you will excuse me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! You don\u2019t know what those bottles will do to you! You\u2019ll turn into a huge muscle monster!\u201d Justin protested. As much as he wanted to witness a rampaging giantess, he wanted to be at least in control and be able to stop her if things went out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe?\u201d Christine said in surprise, rubbing her hand down her toned abdomen, partially exposed by her shirt which was too short and too tight for her size now \u201cWho said I was going to the girls\u2019 locker room? I\u2019m heading to where the guys are at!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine slipped out the door of the lab and hastily grabbed a mop in the hallway that the janitor had forgotten.

None of the footballers had issues with her knowing the access code to the locker room. After all, who didn\u2019t love the sight of this incredibly hot beauty prancing in, usually dressed skimpily, and triggering a testosterone-fest in the room of eighty or so football jocks? They were treated to a stunning sight each time she visited her boyfriend Stephen before football practice, which was essentially every day of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was different about Christine today, but it wasn\u2019t immediately noticeable. She had always been toned but today she looked even more athletic; and as she walked confidently across the locker room, plenty of eyebrows (and erections) were raised. It wasn\u2019t the added height that put her eye-to-eye with most of the still-growing football players or how it looked like she was wearing clothes two sizes too small, and it wasn\u2019t the additional muscle that made her arms and legs look noticeably more defined; it was as if Christine was emitting an invisible but intense aura; pheromones that were driving the guys crazy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re finally eighteen as of last week, huh?\u201d Christine giggled as she approached Stephen \u201cFinally as old as I am\u201d Christine had turned eighteen the month before at the start of the semester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrissy? You\u2026 thanks\u2026\u201d Stephen stopped what he was doing and stood shirtless and slightly baffled at Christine. \u201cYou look amazing today. Did you\u2026\u201d he couldn\u2019t put a finger on what had changed, but whatever it was, Christine looked incredible and it was making his member rise within the confinements of his jockstrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy belated 18th birthday sweetheart\u201d Christine interrupted his thoughts with a hug \u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t make it to the crazy dinner, but at least I was there for the after party, right?\u201d Christine smiled as she reached for her bag. \u201cHere, I brought you a little something\u2026\u201d After fiddling around lazily for one of the two bottles, Christine pulled out the\u2026</span></div></div>",

His quads began to swell up, with new layers of muscle suddenly forming around his upper part of his legs. Thick veins started forming all around his quads at the same time as his calves began to inflate with outrageous muscle, almost causing Stephen to panic as he was experiencing an odd muscle growth spurt for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Stephen queried, as he bent down and inspected the muscles that had grown. He felt his hardened muscles, wondering what was going on. His calves were thick and hard. In fact, they were pushing out from the back of his legs with vengeance, having grown as strong as diamonds.<br>\r\nThen his chest and shoulders grew, stretching the shirt apart as his shoulders grew into softballs and spread father apart. His pecs grew into huge melons, stretching the shirt even further and beginning to rip it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lats grew as well, pushing his arms out and giving him an epic v-taper that went down to his hips.<br>\r\nHis back grew also, pockets of ripped muscle appearing across his back. His biceps and triceps followed suit, making his arms massive. His triceps grew huge, and made a ripped horseshoe shape, and his biceps grew to form massive peaks that were extremely hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis forearms grew to an incredible size, and the bowling-pin-like muscle withered like snakes under the footballers skin.

At exactly the 22 minute mark, Amanda felt a gurgling in her stomach. Then her face turned red as all of her muscles began to cramp up all at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH!!!! IT HURTS!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda!! Are you alright???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you idiot!

After 3 minutes, the seizure stopped and Justin helped her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, but right now all I want to do is sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you want me to take you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can manage on my own, thanks Justin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin walked with Amanda out to the parking lot and helped her into her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Amanda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled at him weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you sorry about?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks passed since the incident and Amanda still hadn't returned to school. Justin tried calling her every other day, only to have her mother say she wasnt receiving any calls. This only caused Justin to feel even more guilty about what happened that day.  He spent everyday poring over his notes to find where the problem with the formula lied. On Friday afternoon, Justin sat at the lab table engrossed in thought when he felt someone tap him on the shoulder. He turned around to find Amanda grinning at him. He nearly fell off his stool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda!! Is that you? Are you ok??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep asking me that?? For the last time, I am fine!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez!!! Well sorry for caring about you!! It won't happen again!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda reached over and touched Justin's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, you are the kindest, sweetest boy I've ever known. My mom told me about all the phone calls. I swear to you, I'm okay. Even better than okay. See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stood back and let Justin get good look at her. She was wearing her usual pea-green hoodie and baggy, tan cargo pants. It was then that Justin realized that Amanda was looking him in his eyes!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotten taller!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one thing. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned in a slow circle for Justin. Her hair was in two braids but instead of stopping just above shoulders they now fell down her back almost to her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hair is longer. Extensions??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, all mine. But that's two. Keep going Mr Science Whiz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hair, height, what else?\" Justin thought. He looked at her closely. And it hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your eyes!! They're gray instead of blue!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda grinned as she took off her glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ding,ding,ding!! Congratulations Mr Meacham! You're a winner. And now for your prize!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began reaching for the zipper on her hoodie then changed her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought, let's take this someplace a bit more private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed his hand and led him to one of the storage closets in gymnatorium. After making sure the door was locked and bracing it with a chair she turned to Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, let me say thank you for allowing me to be your guinea pig. The formula worked even better than I could've hoped for. Check out what else it did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda unzipped her hoodie and Justin gasped. Amanda was built like a bodybuilder! Broad, thick deltoids, unabridged dictionary thick pecs, and cobblestone like 8-pack abs. Her now FFF-cup breasts were straining the cheap cotton wife beater she was wearing to almost complete transparency. She slowly flexed her biceps to their 23 1/2 inch size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Do you like what you see??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin swallowed hard in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes. This is why I didn't come back to school right away. After I realized the formula was working, I started using the universal machine my dad had bought some years ago. And I moved the weight bench into my room so I could do a chest workout every night before bed and every morning when I wake up. I took two weeks off to get really pumped up so I can show my last little surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda grabbed the front of her shirt and ripped it off like it was tissue paper revealing her silver nipple studs and her navel ring. Then she unbuttoned her pants and let them drop to her ankles. Not only was she not wearing any panties but she had a tattoo of Justin's initials in a heart just above her vagina. She then kicked off her pants, and pushed Justin down onto a nearby folding chair. Amanda straddled his waist and pushed his face in between her breasts. She then held him there until she felt him struggling for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and in case you haven't figured it out yet, you're my boyfriend now. If I catch any other bitches hanging around you, they're dead. Capisce??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin nodded. Too scared and aroused to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy. Before I forget...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda reached into her pants pocket and pulled out 300 dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this for??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After my mom saw what your formula did for me, she decided she wants some too. This is what I told her it would cost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. This stuff has the potential to make us millionaires. And besides, it's never too early to start saving for Ashley's college education.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley?? Who's Ashley??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name of the baby I'm going let you fuck into me after we graduate high school of course!\"</span></div></div>",

We can't afford to keep giving away freebies. We'll never get rich like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Good thinking Amanda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course babe.

Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he thought his issues with bullying were bad, that all went double for poor little Tammy. Standing at an adorable 4'10\" at <i>16 years old,</i> she would be pushed around like nobody's business. \"Runt\", \"Gremlin\", \"Doorstop\", she's heard them all before. Justin's heard her crying in the bathroom at least twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, Justin was one of the few people she could actually trust and get along with. When she was at home, she found her escapism through video games. RPGs, especially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick phone call and bike ride, Justin made his way to Tammy's place. He knocked on the front door and was greeted by Tammy's mother.<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Justin. Tammy told me you were coming. She's in her room.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mrs. Tesmer.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm have to be at a dentist appointment, and her father's out with his friends, so I'm trusting you two to be home alone. Don't do anything you know you're not supposed to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my god!\"</i> Justin jokingly exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin walked down the hall, knocked on Tammy's bedroom door and let himself in. Tammy was sat at her computer playing <i>The Elder Scrolls: Online.</i><br>\r\n\"Did I catch ya while you were doing something?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, no. This actually a good stopping point. So what's all this about?\" Tammy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin paused for a moment, and before answering the question asked, \"I thought you said that game sucked ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It got better after the DLCs. But no, seriously, why did you want to come over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin paused for dramatic effect and sat his backpack down on the floor. \"I... have a surprise for you.\" He paused again... \"What if I told you, that in my chem lab, I made a serum that can make you bigger and stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy, in a very poor attempt at doing a low-pitched grungy voice, said, \"Don't do that. Don't give me hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, seriously, it's for real!\" Justin shot back. \"Remember that award I got a few months back, that was because I got the serum to work on live rats!\" It was at this point that Justin pulled the 3 vials out of his backpack and sat them on Tammy's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now...\" Tammy continued, \"You want me to try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... honestly, I was all prepared to try it myself right out the gate, but for god knows what reason, it works less than half as well on men... and, more importantly, you kinda needed it more than I did. I've been bullied, but you've been <i>massacred!</i> I figured you would appreciate first dibs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, and you need to make sure it doesn't give you super cancer?\" She smirked. Justin nervously pulled his lips in before Tammy continued. \"I'm just messing with ya. I actually do really appreciate this. So how does this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue is for light growth, Yellow is for moderate, Red is for extreme. Do whichever you're comfortable with.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What the heck were you expecting?\" Justin snarkily replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I thought you would put in, like... lemon flavoring, or something!\" She yelled back, leaning over her desk. She placed the vial down and re-adjusted her glasses. \"Hang on... something happening...\" She spread her feet out and stood straight up. \"This feels... good...\" Justin took a closer look at her, and noticed that her whole body appeared to be pulsing slightly. \"Like something's... <i>ugh...</i> pumping me up...\" As she said this, her breathing began to steadily escalate. Each pulse was becoming more pronounced, and it appeared as though her whole body was bulging outwards a little bit each time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin kneeled down a little to get eye level with Tammy, and realized that the formula wasn't just pumping her muscles out, it was making her taller, too! Every few seconds it looked like she got a new burst of height, like another half an inch was added. \"Something... <i>urgh...</i> stretching me out... <i>oh!\"</i> And she was clearly enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy jolted past 5' 3\", and said, \"Justin... why... why didn't you tell me that this felt so fucking awesome?\" She flexed both of her biceps, causing the sleeves on her t-shirt to tear just a little at the end. She gave a devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... rats cannot communicate their arousal to me...\" Justin responded, in a tone that was equal parts concerned, snarky, and intruiged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy giggled. \"Hehe, I like you Justin, you're funny... <i>urgh...</i> and you make stuff... <i>oh...</i> stuff that does cool things... <i>mmm...</i> like this!\" She says, as she gives one last flex, and finishes off her growth spurt, landing at 5' 6\". Observing the aftermath, Justin looked over every last inch of Tammy's new and improved body. Her new height had caused her skirt to rise up her legs, and her blue t-shirt to start showing a midriff, exposing part of her well well-defined six-pack. Looking over the rest of her body, it seemed easily comporable to that of a far-end fitness model,maybe even a lower-end female body builder. Her legs especially, which were previously small and twig-like, had grown especially thick with hard muscle, and had gotten proportionately longer compared to the rest of her body. Even her breasts increased a fair bit, going from a flat A-cup to a much more noticeable C-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy's brain left its state of delusional euphoria and she was able to take a deep breath. She then allowed herself to have a much more mentally stable freak-out moment.<br>\r\n<i>\"Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod, this is so freaking amazing!</i> I'm actually eye level with you! Do you have any idea how fucking fantastic this is?\" She frantically spouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... uh... I can tell you're pretty excited.\" Justin shyly remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honest to god Justin, I feel like I could freaking kiss you right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued, \"My entire life I've been the butt of jokes about how tiny I am, and you were actually able to give me this! This is seriously the coolest thing that has ever happened to me! I cannot possibly thank you enough!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
