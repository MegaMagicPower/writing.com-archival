Narue\u2019s last known location was that she was headed to that island. A chance she might be there. Chijinda said. You nod your head. Still can\u2019t talk since the surgery? Chijinda said. You nod no. Does it hurt when you try to talk? He said. You try to say narue, but your throat immediately starts hurting. I\u2019ll take your word for it. You know, you didn\u2019t have to go through that thing. He said.  You know that only you were the one who had to go through it. Just in case of a repeat, you would be ready. After a few minutes, the boat docks on the island. Heh. Quaint little town. So this is Hanpanee island? This little fishing village has a wharf on this huke of a rock. Come on. Let\u2019s see if the locals know anything. You hesitate to step off the boat. I\u2019ve told you already, we\u2019ll find her. And trust me, she\u2019ll be ecstatic to see you. And if something does happen, we\u2019ll handle it together. Remember? He said. He extends his fist. You extend yours and bump fists. Nothing we can handle together, right? He said. You nod yes and get off the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and chijinda go around and speak to the villagers. Since you couldn\u2019t speak yet, the questioning went slow. Well, we\u2019ve got nothing, but an urban legend about some damn giga giantess that is so huge, that she could pierce the clouds. Chijinda said. You just roll your eyes when you heard the legend. Ugh. How many girls would match narue here? So far, I\u2019ve seen 5 woman here who looks like her, but isn\u2019t her. Damn. We\u2019ve been at this for hours. You find anything? He said. You show him a few piece of papers that have been torn out of a book. Hmmm. This is narue\u2019s hand writing. She always dot her I\u2019s with a little smiley face. These few pages talks about what she was doing on this island, but not why. We should keep our eyes open for these. Might help us find narue. He said. You\u2019re worried that you might have given narue too hard of a time and that might be the reason she came to this island. Hey, I know what you\u2019re thinking. You didn\u2019t make her come her. She probably has another reason for coming her. Come on. Let\u2019s head north. Must be someone that knows something. He said. You nod your head and you both head north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thirty minute travel, you both come across a school.  Let\u2019s investigate there. Chijinda said. You hold him back and point out the gate is closed and that it\u2019s being guarded by two girls. Hmm. They seem like they won\u2019t let us in. Let\u2019s get out of here. You said. Before you leave, you have the strange feeling of being watched. By familiar eyes. You stop chijinda and point at that school. We can\u2019t get inside. Not with those girls there. He said. You toss a rock near them and the sudden sound catches their attention. With their backs turned, you and chijinda bolt over the metal gate. We\u2019re inside. Let\u2019s go. Chijinda said. You both head into the school. You both make tracks to the headmaster\u2019s office. No one\u2019s here. He said. You put up a spike cam and listening device right on the bookcase but cover it well behind books to hide it, but able to see whoever is in here. Nice thinking. This place was a bust. Let\u2019s go. He said. When you two leave, you bump into someone. Ow! What\u2019s the big idea? Wait, you two!?! \u2026\u2026This is bad! She said. Before you could see her, she runs off out of sight. She left pretty quickly. You ok? Chijinda said. You nod yes and stand up. Let\u2019s get off campus before we\u2019re sighted for trespassing. Chijidna said. You both head out the same way you two came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was uneventful. Didn\u2019t get to fully explore. He said. You smirk and hand him some notebooks you found on that bookcase. You are a detective. He said. As chijinda reads the notes, he seems surprised. This\u2026..just got serious. Look. The Heavenly Queens are here. And there are mentions of us in here. Seems like they want revenge on us. Well, Kanon and Reina do. Ugh. Seems like still, a Neo version was created. He said. You crack your knuckles. *Sigh* Well, can\u2019t say we didn\u2019t try to stop them. After all that we did, seems like people still want to try. Seems like our job is twofold. First, we find narue. Then whatever is going on here is done. Come on. Let\u2019s head to the Inn and put all this together. Chijinda said. You two head back to the village just as evening hits. Come on. Our boss was nice enough to pay for this place. Pretty nice of him since this is an unofficial job. Chijinda said. You both head inside. Since you found more of those diary pages, I think narue is here. Just a matter of where. From what I\u2019ve read so far, she felt never felt the same after that nuke was dropped. She felt responsible. Chijinda said. Now, you feel bad. You did what you thought was right. When we find narue, tell her she had nothing to do with that. He said. You felt somewhat better. You can eat right? He said. You nod yes. Come on. Nice little seafood place near the docks. My treat. He said. As you both set out, you see a two of the Queens. Chijinda! We\u2019ll have you two brought down right here and now! Mizuho said. \u2026\u2026..Indeed, chijinda\u2026.. I will defeat the both of you on my honor! Lady Masque said. Couldn\u2019t pick a better time. Right when we\u2019re worn ragged. Where\u2019s you\u2019re so called \u201chonor\u201d In a straight up ambush? And here I thought we\u2019d already won this. Chijinda said. Your judgment was right. Time to see if it paid off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Masque attacks you, but you were able dodge and kick her back. You attack her and break right through her guard and punch her right in the face. You see chijinda is having little trouble handling Mizuho. Keep her busy. Chijinda said. You nod. Doge multiple sword slashes and grab and stop her sword. Give in! She said. You force her sword into the ground and hit her multiple times in the body. She manage to block your last punch and leaves you open. She slices your mid-section and leaves a medium size gash. When you look at the gash, Masque comes at you with a slash. You didn\u2019t have time to dodge it. You came to a split second decision and use your enhancements. A yellow and black ring forms in both eyes and her attack phases right through you. What is this?!? She said. You turn her around and punch her right in the face with extra strength. You then grab her and force her into the ground and kick her aside. Then the rings disappear from your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUuungh\u2026..They are just as strong as I remember\u2026 Mizuho said. \u2026.Guhh\u2026..These two\u2026.. To think\u2026..they\u2019ve improved\u2026\u2026in skill even further\u2026. Masque said. We do what we can. We\u2019d be happy to hear your circumstances now and\u2026.What the? Rain? Chijinda said. Rain mysteriously starts to fall even though not a cloud is in the night sky. This rain\u2026.n\u2026.No, it can\u2019t be\u2026?! But\u2026..We\u2019re still\u2026. Mizuho said. \u2026\u2026.This can\u2019t be!! Why would they when we\u2019re still here in the village?! Even they can be so low\u2026. Masque said. A drop of rain fail right into your hand. As you look at the droplet, you analyze it with your cybernetic enhanced eye. The droplet is quickly analyze and it shows that there is a special compound in it. Then you see Kanon come out of nowhere \u2026\u2026.I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 disgusted here. I just came to kill time by watching the slaughter, only to see you to getting yer\u2019 asses kicked. And you sad sacks seriously called yourselves members of the Heavenly queens? That been said\u2026.  Ahhhh Fuck all this! I\u2019ve had it with your bullshit! There\u2019s a limit to how damn weak you can be, and you bitches Passed with flying colors! That fuckin\u2019 does it! Just sit back and watch with these assholes here while you all become future red dots! Kanon said. Then she throws blinding dust in chijinda\u2019s eyes. Can\u2019t\u2026..see! What\u2019d she throw?! Chijinda said. Tootles bitches. Try you best to suffer the most pathetic, microscopic deaths imaginable. She said before running off. You chase after her and she seems to notice. She stops and confronts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you did follow me. I thought you were the dumb one. I haven\u2019t forgotten the nuke you dropped in my head! And the fact that you saved my life like I was in need. I\u2019ve thought of nothing but revenge against you the most. All of the queens wanted nothing but that. Maybe Reina more than me, but seems like I will get it first before everyone else. That is, if you want to. Your friend is in some deep trouble back there. Maybe get even worse for everyone there. She said. You look back behind you. Your choice, dickhead. Me and you can settle matters right here and now and I tell you everything, but maybe it will be the last time chijinda or that village is seen alive. Or you could go back and TRY to save them all, but letting me escape and all the precious information I have go with it and never know what\u2019s going on. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe information Kanon has would be a gold mine. She could tell you what\u2019s going on. Maybe even where narue is. But you have to get back to chijinda to see if he\u2019s alright. So, what\u2019s it going to be? kanon said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as you want to bring her down, you decided to let her go and run back to the village. Heh. Maybe he is dumb. Kanon said. You run back to the village, but see nothing there. When you examine the area, it looks like the village has been uprooted. This was the only village for miles. You contemplate for a minute and come to a conclusion that whatever is going down, that school is at the center. You have to get there. You run back towards the school. Under the cover of darkness, you were able to break in and open the front doors. You head off in a random direction. While searching, you see a security camera. As you look at it, the lens extends when it sees you. You stare at it and move on. You manage to find the student rooms. You go in one and see half of the village. It was torn in half. Like it was given to someone. You look at the shrunken village and see only one sign of life. The village was shrunken more than you expected. You hoped that chijinda is ok. You head out of the room. You go into a room a few doors down and you hear talking behind the door. You recognize that voice. It\u2019s Narue. You were shocked to hear her voice. Before you could open the door, you were spotted. Hey, you! What are you doing here?! The voice said. You turn to see it\u2019s society members. You definitely could take them, but you didn\u2019t want to create more of a scene. So you run away. Get back here! One of the shouts. They chase after you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open a door and quickly close it. You hear running footsteps past the door. You lost them and you breathe a sigh of relief. As you look around, you see that you\u2019re in a lab with a bunch of computers. You also see a lever on the wall. You pull it and a tile is pulled back and exposes a flight of downward stairs. By now, you know there is more to this school than it being an all-girl school. You head down the stairs and it\u2019s a whole different story when you reach the bottom. It\u2019s an underground complex of machines and scientific tubes that is a scientist\u2019s dream. After you got over your shock of finding this, you start thinking maybe chijinda is somewhere in here. You start to explore the complex. You\u2019ve seen all this tech before. It was the same exact tech at the last school. Thy must have moved it all here after the society disbanded. While looking through all of the technology here, you find some files in one lab. Before you could look at it, the room starts to flash red and an alarm goes off. Thinking you\u2019ve set off an alarm, you run back to the stairs and head back up them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it back into the lab and catch your breath. If the society didn\u2019t know you were here, they do now with that alarm. Your job just got more difficult. Now you have to find chijinda, narue, and stop whatever is going on here. Hey! What are you doing here?! A voice said. You are suddenly approached by a member of the society. You shouldn\u2019t be here. Let alone on the premise. She said. When she sees who you are, she looks surprised. I should\u2026\u2026Wait. You\u2019re\u2026\u2026you\u2019re the one they talked about. She said. You know who she means by they. Just from what they say about you, I\u2019m not taking a chance on this. You get away this time, but someone\u2019s going to do you in. She said before running away. It seems like the queens decided to share their knowledge of you and chijinda. You all fought each other and know each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. If they know you are here, they are going to play on your one weakness. You have to find chijinda before he gets himself killed or they use him against you. If chijinda\u2019s detective instinct kick in, he would be down somewhere in that underground lab. You head back down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the bottom, the alarm isn\u2019t blaring anymore.  You explore the complex and find all sort of technology and a huge generator. You know that a generator this big has to power something huge. You keep on exploring when you come across some files. When you read it, it talks about a new shrinking compound. It talks about not only shrinking, but to a microscopic level. As you read the files, you can hear multiple footsteps coming. You hide behind a wall and wait. When you see the people, you see it\u2019s Kanon and Renia. \u2026..He\u2019s a bigger problem. If anything, we should kill him first. Kanon said. You think I don\u2019t know that? I won\u2019t forgive him for making a fool of me! He\u2019s been spotted on campus and in the school, but we can\u2019t go after him while he\u2019s on campus. Reina said. Then when the fuck do we?!? When until him and chijinda are together? Which isn\u2019t that bad because I want to rip both of them a new asshole, but they complement each other in a fight. Kanon said. I know. But we both have firsthand experience of them fighting together. One covers the other. One saves the other. They won\u2019t let the other die. Reina said. As chijinda is now, being the size of a flea, I\u2019d love to see him hurt me. Kanon said. That\u2019s when you walk up and bash both of their heads together. Ow! Kanon said. You force her to the ground and hold her there. You\u2026..! When I get up, you\u2019re going to suffer! She said. You try to speak, but your vocal cords still hurt. Then you get off her to dodge a spear. You! Of all people\u2026\u2026I\u2019ve waited a long time for this! Reina said. What makes you think you get first crack? Kanon said. Ugh. Fine. How about we take him together? Reina said. \u2026\u2026..Fine. But I keep him as my shrinkee plaything. Kanon said. The yellow and black ring forms in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kano\u2019s whip comes at you, you hold up your arm and when it wraps around, you pull her towards you and hit her right in the face. When you side step Reina, you slap her. See the red mark on her cheek makes you smile. Grrrr! I\u2019ll make you pay for that! She said. When she comes at you again, you trip her up and you put your boot on her head. You suddenly feel a sting on your back. When you turn around, you are hit by a barrage of whips. You manage to grab the whip, pull her towards you and knee her in the face and then you pick her up and slam her into the ground. You step to your side again and Reina misses again. This time, you roundhouse kick her and she tumbles back. Both of them aren\u2019t hurt badly, but they are starting to get tired. I\u2026..hate to\u2026.admit it, but he\u2019s gotten better. Kanon said. No\u2026\u2026No! I refuse to be done in by the likes of you! Reina said. She runs right at you and she knees you hard in the gut. When you manage to push her off you, you see Kanon throw some strange liquid towards you. You were still reeling from being kneed. You don\u2019t have much of a choice. Your body starts to shake and the liquid phase right through you. T\u2026That didn\u2019t hit you?! Kanon said. You hit Kanon right on her eye and it swells up. You push Reina out of the way and run to the stairs and up them. When you get to the top, you pull the lever and tile moves back over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know what that liquid was, but you didn\u2019t want to find out. Now you have to find chijinda. You look outside and see it\u2019s evening. With everything that is going on, you have to find him now. With it being evening, you will be able to move without being spotted. You head outside with hopes of finding narue or chijinda.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and chijinda have experience being shrunken down, but that\u2019s when you both knew what you were up against. Plus, you left him with Lady Masque and Mizho, two queens who gives you a headache. Knowing how you both left things with them, it wasn\u2019t a good idea to leave him, but you weren\u2019t thinking at the time. You decide to find chijinda first. You head for campus. If what kanon said is true, then you were going to find him easy. You look through every crack and crevice that he could fit through at that size. You also watch were you step to avoid killing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you search for him, your phone starts to beep. You check your phone and see three people on your spike camera. A man who looks no older than Chijinda, a teacher, and a raven haired woman with an eye patch over her left eye. With the listening device you placed, you are able to her them talk. Your incompetence knows no bounds. The woman with the eye patched said. Me? I didn\u2019t do a thing! The man said. I recall it being your job to care off him, yet he\u2019s still up and walking around. She said. It\u2019s not my fault that the underlings are so weak and paranoid. After that alarm went off, every security personal was alerted, and not a single sight of him. He said. Excuses. Just a sorry excuse of a man. Can\u2019t do anything right. She said. If I may. Miss President. He will be looking for his detective friend. From what the queens say about him and what a few other society members say, he\u2019s a bigger pain and hard to deal with. The teacher said. See? Even Maria here agrees. The man said. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re excused. Had you not been\u2026\u2026.preoccupied, you would have caught him as soon as he left. Maria said. Not even Kanon or Reina could stop him. They tried and he blackened Kanon\u2019s eye and made Reina look like an idiot. He said. \u2026\u2026.If I said I want something done, I expect it. Fail me again, and there will be repercussions. Now, go and take care of him. The raven haired woman said. U\u2026..Understood!! he said. Seems like you\u2019ve become a primary target, but that still won\u2019t stop you in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue your search, but come up empty. You continue to search until nighttime arrives. You searched up and down, but still come up empty. You weren\u2019t going to give up yet. You\u2019d continue your search in the morning when everyone is gone. As morning came, you were on the roof. You found out were the queens were staying and did a little bit of ransacking. You found mostly junk, but one item that looked useful. It was a bottle filled with some liquid compound. You decided to keep it just in case. You jump down to the ground and start searching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue your search for hours and still come up empty. You even went back to the underground complex and searched and still didn\u2019t find him. As the hours passed, you were getting worried. On his own, chijinda can get into a huge amount of trouble. As you are in thought, you get a feeling that someone is behind you. You twist the persons arm and force the person against the wall. Ow! The person said. You heard that voice before. The proxy jackass. You slam him into the wall again. Let go! He said.  You weren\u2019t going to give him the chance for him to do what he was sent to do.  Argh! I know where chijinda is! He said. You know he\u2019s just saying that, but what if he really does know? If he did know, you were going to make this bastard talk. You hold him against the wall with your arm on his neck. Even though your vocal cords are still healing, you manage to speak. \u2026\u2026.Where? You said. Ugh! Closer than you think. Right under your nose. He said. You punch him in the face to show him you\u2019re not joking around. \u2026\u2026.Find your little blond haired friend, and you\u2019ll find chijinda. Or what\u2019s left of him. Hahahahaha. He said. You hit him again and knock him out. You remember hearing narue\u2019s voice the other day. You head back to the student quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start checking room until you come across one with a small village on a table. You examine the village and see it\u2019s the same village you and chijinda were in. The village looks like it\u2019s been halved between two people. You can see the small villagers in the village. They look terrified. Like they\u2019ve experienced something terrible. You decide to ransack the place and find more pieces of paper from a diary. As you read it, it mentions your name a few times. How you gave her the cold shoulder. How you treated her like some evil person. The way you look at her isn\u2019t the same. From reading this, it seems that the way you treated narue made her feel that the one person she trusted in the world turned on her. However narue feels, she must be taking it out on this village. But one thing is unsure to you, how did the village shrink in the first place? Someone has answers, and you need to find that person. And if narue is taking her anger out on these villagers, you need to tell her that you\u2019re sorry. Narue might be in one of these classes, so you decided to wait until evening when she\u2019s to get back. If you knew narue would do this, you wouldn\u2019t have done what you done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs evening hits and night is around the corner, you make your way back to narue\u2019s room. When you get there, you definitely hear her voice. But something doesn\u2019t sound right. You just heard her use words she\u2019d never used before. Then after listening again, you hear more stuff she\u2019d never say. That\u2019s when you kick down the door to see what\u2019s going on. The sudden barge in surprises narue. Narue was just as shock to see you as you were to see her. Y\u2026.You\u2026..you\u2019re alive?! She said. When she said \u201cStill alive\u201d A few thoughts came to mind. A\u2026.All this time\u2026\u2026I thought\u2026.. She said. Now you\u2019re really wondering what\u2019s going on. First the choices of words, then the \u201cStill alive\u201d bit. When you look at her with your cybernetic eye, nothing sticks out. \u2026\u2026.But none of that matters now. You came all this way for me. She said. You point to the shrunken village. Oh, that. Well\u2026..It\u2019s the society. They\u2019re back to their old tricks again. This time taking it to a new level. She said. When you look behind her, you can see the villagers on a desk with an x and o on it. This shrunken village was a test. I manage to steal it from them, but they are making more of that shrinking compound. There is a lab somewhere underground that is making that stuff. I\u2019m sure you know what to do. She said. You\u2019re confused about this. Narue\u2019s story makes no sense whatsoever. She happens to find and get the village from the society. You can hear the villagers shouting out at you. Unsure, but determine to show narue you are sorry, you head to that underground lab.</span></div></div>",

As you look, you come across a few small tubes with some creatures in it. As you look closer, you can see that the experiments look similar to the same ones at the last school. As you examine the half spider, half human creature, the thing runs repeatedly into the glass tube to try and get to you. Then after a few seconds, it blows up. You cover your face to protect your face. These bitches have too much free time on their hands. You continue your search for that lab until your endless search comes to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a lad that has a computers, a huge monitor on the wall, and two stasis chambers. You turn on the computer and see a formula has been put in. Then it shows all four of the Heavenly Queens blood. Then you find a note in the computer. \u201cIt seems that a highly concentrated liquid has been injected to the queens. Studies have shown that the given substance has regenerative element that can heal any wound, no matter how serious. Studies also show that the substance can be broken down into a new and improved strain. Recent tests of the new strains has shown an increase in durability, strength, speed, and intelligence. After pain staking months, I have finally found how to combine all of these without resulting brain damage or muscle damage to the individual.\u201d You look at the formulas and equations for a few seconds. Then it hits you. This is boss man\u2019s formula for his stims. It\u2019s been copied and someone has made their own. You and chijinda had special orders just in case this happened. Before you could carry them out, you hear the steel door open. Well, well. A sneaking rat. The woman said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to see a silver haired woman with a lab coat and glasses with double d breast that would make chijinda\u2019s mouth hit the floor. I see you have come across my new and improved stims. Tell me. Do you know your employer? She said. You\u2019d tell her off if your vocal cords weren\u2019t still hurting. I take your silence as no. Well, no matter. Simon was always smart, but he was a fool for using his new breakthrough for just healing. He knew that this stuff could increase a person mental and physical being, but he knew he\u2019s have to make the substance over power a person\u2019s will. I have no problem with it. Let me show you what I\u2019ve come up with. She said. As she said that, the two stasis chambers open up and two school girls fall out of them. They are look like identical twins. The only thing that makes them different is one has red hair and the other has blonde hair. They slowly start to get to their feet. As you look at them, they look hollow and blank face. Ok girls, show this intruder the difference between Simon\u2019s work and my work. The lady said. Like dogs, they follow her order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, both of these girls come at you. They attack you with perfect coordination. You manage to block punches and kicks without showing any opening. But you are caught off guard by a fake out. Just before the blonde attacked, she moves out of the way and the red head hits you in your midsection. If that was any regular punch, you\u2019d shrug it off, but both of them had been injected with that new stim. Hmmm. There was a moderate chance that you\u2019d be out in one hit. The lady said. You decide to go on the offensive and attack. You attack the blonde and when she block a punch, you quickly inserted a syringe in her neck and extract some of her blood. You only need a sample from one of the subjects. You attack and put them on the defensive. Interesting\u2026\u2026 Both test subjects defensive capabilities are over my expectations.  Even though it\u2019s against one person who has more experience, they show no holes in a defensive measure. The lady said. You feel like you\u2019re getting nowhere. You\u2019ve barely damage either of them and they are in perfect synch when fighting. You block a punch from the blonde, but the red head comes to your side and kick you hard. You nearly fall over from being kick so hard. Oh, Simon. Your research is inferior to mine. The lady said. Having little choice, the yellow and black ring forms in your eyes. You attack the red head, but she blocks you. Waiting for the right moment for it, the blonde come to your side and goes for a kick, which is what you want. You grab her leg and swing her into the red head. \u2026\u2026Not bad. But don\u2019t think you\u2019ve caused any damage. The lady said. Both of the girls stand up almost in synch as well and dust off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe come at you at the same time and you see where they are aiming at. You duck low enough and kick both of them. One rebounds, catches and throw the other as a projectile. You grab her and slam her into the ground with force. Even when being slammed down, she shows no sign of pain. The blonde stands up slowly. You see? No matter how much force you use, they will walk it right off like nothing. They will just stand right back up. She said. She seemed confident in her stim, but there is one thing you know that she didn\u2019t know. Right before the blonde could attack, she suddenly collapse. What?! The lady said. Then so does the read head. What did you do?! They shouldn\u2019t fall to you. The lady said. You knew a secret that Simon told you and chijinda. Under the effects off stim, you shouldn\u2019t fight for any longer than fifteen minutes, or the body would go limp from exhaustion. How? I made sure every aspect was taken to make the perfect compound. Simon! Did you do this on purpose?! The lady said. While she\u2019s grasping the situation, you write down the new formula, and then erase it. You then insert a jump drive into the port and download all of the data on the computer. After all of the data is downloaded, you pull out the jump drive. Now for the final step. You head to the two girls and tie them up and place them against the wall. As you tie up the scientist, she doesn\u2019t resist. So. Just going to leave a lady like me tied up? She said. You make sure that everything is accounted for. Now I know how all of my significant others felt. She said. After making sure you have everything, you head out of the lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coming out of the lab, you think narue meant to send you on a wild goose chase, but why? Why would she try to deceive you? What could she gain out of tricking you? You need to hear it from her herself, but first, you need something pickedup</span></div></div>",

What\u2019s in there is some painkillers just in case your throat starts hurting, and a gun just in case. You see it\u2019s the five-seven and it has a note on it. \u201cJust on case push comes to shove. I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d It said. A gun. Even though all detectives under Simon\u2019s employment get guns for protection, he never got the good ones. This could be handy. You holster it and make your way back to the school. Evening starts to loom as you make your way back. You know that you won\u2019t be able to look around now that their classes are out. Seems like finding chijinda will have to wait until tomorrow morning. \u2026\u2026\u2026Chijinda. You said. You immediately take a few painkillers after saying that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning hits, you quickly begin your search. As you search for chijinda, you come up empty. You search in the empty rooms, but can\u2019t find him. As you walk down a hall, you decide to peek in a class and see that a teacher overlooking students doing a test. You think you saw something climbing her leg. When you squint your eyes, you see a small figure scaling the teacher\u2019s leg. You wonder if that is chijinda. Seems like something he would do when he decides to live out his wild fantasies. He even told you scaling a giant woman was one of his fantasies. You can just barge right in there. You\u2019ll make a scene. Seems like you have to wait until class is done. You hope chijinda isn\u2019t indulging in his fantasies. Hey! What are you doing here?! A society member said. You know you\u2019ve overstayed your welcome. You run to the student quarters and hide in one of the empty rooms. As you hear passing footsteps, you breathe a sigh of relief. You walk out of the room and head back to the class, but see that everybody is gone. You punch the wall out of anger. As of now, finding chijinda has become a priority. You\u2019ll turn this school upside down if you have to. You run outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get outside, you start looking, but still come up empty. You search until mid-day and still not find him. You head to the island and contemplate. You\u2019re hoping the worse hasn\u2019t come to past. You found narue, but not chijinda. You know you shouldn\u2019t have let him in the village, but you couldn\u2019t help but chase after Kanon. You feel like a Dumbass. After a few minutes past, you calm yourself down and head back to the school. As you head back, you see the stone bridge has been blown up. As you get closer, you see someone fingers holding onto the ledge. Just before the person falls, you grab their hand and pull them up. When you see the person, you see it\u2019s the Mia. Your eyes widen when you see her here. Oh, Great. You of all people to see my like this! She said. Mia being here means she must be up to no good again. Maybe narue didn\u2019t send you on a wild goose chase after all. But knowing mia here means something must be going on. Knowing her background, it would be wise to toss her into the ravine below. The bitch obviously didn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s life, so why should she have it? But you know chijinda will be badgering you about this forever. You pull out a syringe and take out a full injection of blood. Hey! She said. Then you toss her onto the other side of the bridge. Ow! You\u2026...! She said. You jump the gap and push Mia to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Mia\u2019s here just made the situation even worse. That crazy bitch tried to kill you and chijinda on multiple occasion. Her appearance here can\u2019t be coincidence. One thing you know for sure is that you have to find chijinda before she does. Probably didn\u2019t do any good by just sitting on a railing on the rooftop for the past thirty minutes. All you were wondering was were was chijinda? You jump down and land on the ground and decide to head back into the underground lab. When you get there, you start to look around. While searching, you find can hear distant voices. You think it\u2019s just a society member getting grilled by an upper ranking person, but the sounds persist. As you get closer, the sounds turn out to be sounds of fighting. You decided to find where it\u2019s coming from. As you get closer, you can hear the distinct voices. As you keep going, you hear screaming. Someone must be in trouble, but you don\u2019t think you should go out of your way to save the girl in trouble. You ignore it, but your conscious is getting the better of you. You reluctantly decide to go to the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you see no one is here. You were annoyed, but you see a huge ass diary in front of you. You\u2019re wondering how a dairy got this big, or who wrote in it, but you decide to look at it. When you look at it, you can see it\u2019s narue\u2019s writing. You can tell by their being a little heart instead of an dot on the I\u2019s. As you read the dairy, everything starts to become clear. The narue you saw wasn\u2019t the narue you know. The choice of words, the attitude, even her gaze was a little off. The narue you saw was a clone of her. You kept reading and see that your name is mentioned a few times. Turns out, your cold demeanor towards her in the last time you saw her was the catalyst. Now you know what a driving force for narue being here was. You owe her more than an apology now. If anyone knows where narue is, that clone will know. All you have do is find her, but where is she? You see there is a corridor to your left. Maybe the clone when that way. You head through the corridor and keep going down. While exploring, you found a lab. You look at the computer and turn it on. Turns out, this is where they make their shrinking compound. A few good ideas pop into your head about this, but your morality and chijinda won\u2019t let you forget about those choices. You leave the computer before you change your mind. As you leave, you see a sight that brings a smile to your face. Mia and Kanon are both fighting each other. Turns out maybe you two have a common enemy, but they are both your enemy, so you decide to sit back and watch the fist fly. After 4 minutes go by, Mia beats down Kanon. After letting her ego show, she turns to see you slow clapping.<br>\r\nUgh. Just what I needed. You. She said. You hate giving people you don\u2019t like credit, but she\u2019s a tough one. No remarks? No insults? She said. She doesn\u2019t know you had cybernetic implants, and you\u2019re going to keep it that way. Hm. Maybe I should look at you not talking in a different light. Actually kinda of peaceful. \u2026\u2026.Consider us even. I don\u2019t owe you a thing. Mia said. Mia is the last person you want to call in a favor from. I take it you understand why you\u2019re here and why I\u2019m here. She said. Even if your vocal cords were healed and you could talk, you wouldn\u2019t waste your breath in asking. You said. I don\u2019t like this as much as you do, but if you\u2019ve been following us and seen that dairy, you\u2026\u2026.know that\u2026\u2026we have to\u2026\u2026put our petty differences aside. She said. You do think there is a lot more to this than just a clone, but working with the bitch who wanted you and chijinda dead? Any other time, you\u2019d toss that idea out the window. Believe me, I wouldn\u2019t come to you even if you were the last person on earth. But out of reference to how dangerous of a person you are and chijinda, I\u2019ll only make an exception this time. She said.  \u2026\u2026..Fine. You said. You quickly take more painkillers. I don\u2019t expect you to listen to me at all, but you did save, me from plummeting into the ravine. She said. \u2026\u2026.Chijinda. You said. He\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry. Just pull your own weight. She said. \u2026\u2026.Bitch. You said.</span></div></div>",

Following the special orders, you take a blood sample from her. You then decide to kick her while she\u2019s down.  Move over. Mia said. You see Mia dumps some kind of liquid on Kanon that makes her shrink. You give a questioning look to Mia. Don\u2019t get any ideas. Once all this is settled, I\u2019m taking my time to punish her so she will never think of defying me again. Mia said. You simply roll your eyes. Now, are you coming or not? Mia said. \u2026\u2026Yeah. You said. You and the rest of the mia\u2019s gang head deeper into the facility. As of right now, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse: Whatever\u2019s being planned here, or working with Mia. Bitch has tried to kill you numerous times, and now you two are side by side. Don\u2019t think we\u2019re friends now. This little alliance is only temporary. Once this is all done, we go back to being enemies. She said. You ignore her and just keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After going a little further in, you see three people in the distance. Stop right there!! Chijinda said. Despite chijinda being ant size, you can hear him perfectly. This puts one of your fears to rest. Mia wasn\u2019t lying. Chijinda is fine, but this bitch had him walk directly behind her? At his shrunken size? You\u2019ll deal with that later. I thought something boisterous or another was occurring, but to think we have an intruder. Reina, an acquaintance of yours? Madame President said. Why yes. The lady with the triumphant look takin along a gaggle of shrinkies and a recurring thorn is our former society\u2019s vice director. Of course THAT society has been dissolved and so\u2026 Former vice director is what I should be saying. Reina said. Reina sure has gotten smug since the last time you saw her. *sigh* The only one\u2019s deserving of being lablled \u201cFormer\u201d are you \u201cex\u201dqueens, Reina. The society hasn\u2019t GONE anywhere. Erika and myself at least properly, PROUDLY carrying on our original mission. Mia said. If there is one thing these bitches are, it\u2019s determined. Still hanging on to that delusional utopia knowing that you and a few countries won\u2019t let that happen. I see. Then I\u2019ll leave cleaning up this situation to you ladies. You obviously have catching up to do. Excuse me as I go on ahead. Madame President said. You wait, Raven hair! For what you did to Narue\u2026. \u2026.And for trying to carry out this failed operation again. I can\u2019t afford to forgive you OR let you go!! Chijinda said. I thought there was some laughable, nearly imperceptivity tiny creature here, but that was YOU, chijinda? Still:Raven Hair?) That\u2019s a bit much to take. We\u2019ve already been introduced, but it seems I\u2019ll have to greet you properly again. She said. \u2026\u2026Forget Pleasantries. You said. Just by looking at this woman, she has the same intimidating aura like the director had, but you feel that there something more to her than she letting on. And? I wonder what business you might have with me. If you desire to return to original size, why not take it up with Narue? I am quite busy dealing with my project\u2019s final phase, so unfortunately I don\u2019t have the luxury of speaking with bugs. Then again, Narue is but one step ahead of us at the lakeshore. Ahh, silly me, no narue\u2026..but my clone of her. She said. This woman is smug. Why would she bluntly tell you where the clone is? Either she doesn\u2019t care or doesn\u2019t think you can\u2019t get there.  Narue\u2019s at the lake?! What do you mean by that?! Chijinda said. I wonder, what COULD we mean? Isn\u2019t investigating such things your job, detective? Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026The clone is currently ahead of us in the deep cavity located at this island\u2019s core. The REAL Naure is there as well. If she doesn\u2019t have her body constantly regulated and stabilized, it will very rapidly break down. She said. There she goes again. Tell you things you\u2019d have to find out. In addition, that;s also our production plant for the shrinking hormones is located. This facility at the core is the very cornerstone of the entire operation. And operations are running quite smoothly. All that remains for the operation to be successfully completed is to control the real Narue\u2019s body and release her hormones into the world\u2019s seas from here. Allowing for a bit of time lag across global regions, your humanity will soon find itself reduced to 1/1000th its size in short order. After all, ceasing to drink any and all water is utterly impossible for you Humans, isn\u2019t it? Madame President said. \u201cYou humans?\u201d Why did she say that? She is hiding something. It can\u2019t be\u2026\u2026 You\u2026..you intend to contaminate Earth\u2019s oceans with shrinking hormones wrung out from Narue?! If you do something like that, you\u2019ll wreak utter CHAOS with the Earth\u2019s ecosystems!! It\u2019ll be armageddon!! Mia said. To one\u2019s such as ourselves, that is a trifling issue at best. WE can neutralize the effects of the hormones at this point, you see. If WE remain unshrunk as goddesses, then we can figure SOMETHING out one way or another afterward. Reina said. Indeed. And once all of you Humans are reduced to less than insects, you\u2019ll have become the weakest living things on the planet! And the ones who shall RULE over them as near inconceivable eistences shall be the former Heavely Queens and\u2026. Let\u2019s see, how would you like to join them, Maria? Madame President said. I\u2019m sorry, but I very humbly decline Madame President. Can you imagine the likes of ME ruling over the micro world with you? I\u2019ll leave things like that to grander people like Reina! Maria said. Hmpf. Naturally! Do you understand now, Vice Director? You are NOT the rightful successor to the sciences society!! Only I am qualified, am SUPERIOR enough for such a role!! OOOHOHOHO! Reina said. \u2026\u2026.NOT happening!! You said. That\u2019s that then. So if you desire to save Humanity, DO hurry up, Chijinda. But it\u2019s useless, as there\u2019s nothing you can do to compel us to release Narue. Madame President said. This woman obviously doesn\u2019t care that she\u2019s just giving out information and detail left and right. She\u2019s not even trying to predict your next move. But if she\u2019s just willing to give it all up, could she not be that interested in Operation: Humanity\u2019s Reduction at all? And if she\u2019s not, what sick game is she playing here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame President, it really IS time. Let us be off. Reina said. Wait! You are not getting away that easily, not on my watch!! Chijinda said. Oh, so you think you can STOP us \u201cThat easily\u201d, on your watch? You\u2019ve literally got a mountain of opponents lined up. Plural, really. Maria said. You see two rows of those old model shrink hunting robots from the school. They\u2019re old models from the Yabaize days, but steam powered or not, they should stop you well enough. Rather, I think they\u2019re the perfect enemies for ones such as yourselves. Reina said. \u2026\u2026Hand me downs. You said. Well then, have a lovely day. Madame opresident said. S\u2026.Stop!! Chijinda said as they left. You remember these things. Came across them a few times. Almost cost you an arm. Quit standing there looking like an idiot and help out! Mia said. Rolling your eyes, you simply toss a hidden grenade you had and it wipes out all of the robots. \u2026..Heh. You said. Ugh. It\u2019s like working with a child. Mia said. As you move on, you see a tracks and a train set to go. Do try to follow along, Chijinda. Both your precious Narue, the REAL Narue, and her pitiable clone are waiting for you. Madame President said before stepping onto the train. \u2026\u2026Getting away. You said. Shit, a maglev system too\u2026? They installed something like that through the island underground. Never cease to amaze\u2026Chijinda said. Follow her already, Chijinda!! Trailing your enemy relentlessly back to their stronghold is, I seem to recall, both of you two\u2019s specialty, isn\u2019t it!? Mia said. You got that right. Now that it\u2019s come down to this, I\u2019ll follow them to the ends of the damn earth. Chijinda said. </span></div></div>",

Watch where you put your damn hands! She said. You push the mine cart and it starts rolling. You, on the other hand, decide to follow on foot. With the cybernetics in you, you can run 2x as fast as you can. The yellow and black rings form in your eyes and you run and catch up with the cart. You look right at Mia. \u2026\u2026Slowpoke. You said. You follow the tracks until you and the mine cart come to a stop at what looks like a rear entrance to an underground complex. This must be it. Mia said.

You keep exploring until you all come across Reina. So, you\u2019ve finally arrived, vice director. Ahh yes, and the other peons loitering around underfoot as well. She said. Now this is a bit unexpected. I thought you were so eager to press ahead earlier. Why wait? It\u2019s a curious turn of events is all. Mia said. In a few short hours\u2026. I\u2019ll be drinking mu victory sake. Celebrating my absolute victory, my ULTIMATE victory\u2026. As I ascend to reign as history\u2019s GREATEST empress! Dictating on ALL I can see below me! She said. \u2026\u2026Ego. You said. But before that it seems I must reap some troublesome weeds. Now that the director\u2026..is gone. YOU are my greatest rival. Vice director. It\u2019s the same for you, yes? We truly are the ones most fit to become rulers of the world, weaving its fate in our loom! Reina said. \u2026\u2026Such disappointment. This is EXACTLY why we couldn\u2019t crush these two in the first time. Making buffoons like YOU one of the Heavenly Queens and counting on you for ANYTHING is my and the director\u2019s ONLY blunder. Mia said. WHAT did you just say? Reina said. One who can\u2019t EVEN understand that their own position is that of a convenient pawn, is hardly fit to be leader of ANYTHING.  Reina. Succeeding the Director\u2019s will and ideals is absolutely impossible for you. You were my ally, and perhaps my friend once. So I\u2019ll play you the most sublime requiem to capture you from the board! Mia said. \u2026..That is MY line. The you before me who\u2019s allied with Chijinda lacks all respect and charisma I once admired! It\u2019s unsightly, and so I\u2019ll trample you beneath me right here and now!! Reina said. Ha! If you think you can then by all means, I\u2019d like to see you try!!! However\u2026..Before that\u2026..I have a proposal. You two, Listen. I\u2019d like to face Reina one on one. I know the history between the three of you is bad or whatever, but could you yield to me this once? Mia said. Mia asking you and Chijinda to OK her fight against Reina? Personally, you wanted first crack at her. But there seems to be something deeper at work. I understand. I won\u2019t get involved here. Show me clearly how different she is from YOUR level! Chijinda said. \u2026\u2026Do as you wish. You said. Thank you! Chijinda, you sit there and watch as I show you how cool I can be when I put my mind to it! Mia said. You wonder why Mia won\u2019t just come out and say she likes Chijinda? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch the fight go down, your phone vibrates. When you look at it, you see it\u2019s from the president. \u201cExpect new orders within 30 minutes\u201d It said. New orders? What could the president want you to do? Guess you\u2019ll find out soon. You then hear a thud. You look and see Reina is lying on the floor beaten down. That\u2019s my first objective finally achieved. The heavenly queens have ben routed, one way or another. \u2026..Although since they WERE members of the same society, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m overjoyed at the success. Mia said. When you go to reina, you give her a light kick to see if she\u2019s alive. To your utter disappointment, she is. You pull out a syringe and take a sample of Reina\u2019s blood. \u2026\u2026my bath\u2026Oh, my skin is atrocious. I must draw my bath and refresh myself\u2026.! \u2026..ahhhh\u2026.. I\u2019m sick and tired of cleaning up after Madame Vice director and Kanon\u2019s Messes\u2026. Reina said. \u2026\u2026.Bath? You said. She acts all tough, but even Reina has he own worries\u2026 Chijinda said. Reina\u2019s is she\u2019s just too stubborn. She follows her personal orders with a noble zeal that\u2019s just too much for her. \u2026\u2026.Theere we go. Mia said. You see mia has a vial in her hands. Don\u2019t give me that look. Do you want her up and running behind us? Time to pay the piper Reina. You\u2019re going to wake from THAT nightmare to find yourself in one FAR worse! Mia said. Mia pours Reina with the shrinking compound and grabs the diminutive reina. \u2026\u2026You scare me. No jokes. Seriously. In many ways. Profoundly so. Chijinda said.  What\u2019s with you? Got a problem? Chijinda? Mia said. You all continue the journey into the complex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you keep trekking, you come across mech suits. Hmm, A few of these are new, one is under construction. \u2026..Ahh An older model bi pedal mecha, huh\u2026.? This is the only one of these machines that\u2019s up and running. I might be able to put it to good use. Mia said. As she hops in, she does an assessment of the mech. \u2026..These are equipped with fixed missile launchers. According to the specs, it can fire a missil pressing these button. When mia press said button, a missile flies right by you and explodes behind you. \u2026\u2026Bitch. You said. Just stay out of my way. Mia said. Mia blasts the steel door and blazes a path through all of the security robots. You follow behind her. After blowing all of the robots, mia gets out of the mech and you all enter the elevator. When it goes down and stop, you all exit. You all begin to trek through the complex until you come across a chamber and an operating room. This looks like a chamber to hold test subjects while experiments are being prepped. Looks like its controlled from the room next door. You spot a sprinkler system. It looks like this is some kind of chemical synthesis lab. You see mia place five vials on the table. We\u2019re missing one. Mia said. Now you know what that vial was for. You pull it out and place it on the table Seems we can control he management and refinement processes from the console there. So I guess we\u2019ll need to use it to synthesize what we want. The test subjects and engineer are pretty clear here. I\u2019ll be using this. YOU go enter that other chamber there.  Mia said. Looks like we\u2019ve got no choice. We\u2019re relying on ya, V-D! You said. \u2026\u2026.Ahem! You said. Oh, you two, man. Chijinda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia starts to mix the compounds together. Yes! A resounding success! Mia said. Alright, the six compounds are set I their respective docks. Now all that\u2019s left is for the application system to disperse it via the sprinklers. All of you, into the neighboring chamber! Mia said. As chijinda and the others go into the chamber, you\u2019re stuck with Mia. As you wait, you\u2019re phone rings. You answer it and it\u2019s the president. I just got back from congress. They have decided that these women you encountered are too much of a risk. I\u2019m placing a kill order on them. He said. \u2026..Chijinda? You said. Despite his recent action, I manage to convince them to not include him in the order. Out of respect for you and his friendship. The others, you know what to do. He said. He hangs up. You grab your gun and cock it, but before you could pull the trigger, Mia sees Maria has stopped chijinda. That Bitch! Chijinda, I\u2019m coming to help you right now! Mia said. You quickly holster your pistol and go with mia, but the steel door suddenly closes. She locked us out! Damn! Mia said. \u2026\u2026Shit. You said. You have to do something, and quickly.</span></div></div>",

You want to save chijinda, but Mizho and Lady Masque is with him. As long as she crushes them and not chijinda, you\u2019re fine. Are you seriously going to sit back and watch them become red stains? She said. \u2026\u2026Only the knights? You said. She\u2019s going to kill all three of them. Mizuho, Masque, even chijinda! If you don\u2019t do it for me or them, at least chijinda! She said. You were always planning on saving chijinda, but you wanted to see if Maria does your job for you, but now you decide it\u2019s too risky to leave to chance. \u2026\u2026.Console. Bypass. You said. Mia hurriedly gets to the console. Don\u2019t let this take longer than I hope! Mia said. As Mia hurriedly tries to get the steel doors open, you try to force it open. You hit the door hard, but only make a dent. \u2026.Damn! You said. Come on, come on! Mia said. It takes 4 minutes before the steel doors open up. It\u2019s open! Mia said. You both rush into the chamber. Chijinda!! Get into the capsules!! I finished setting the controls, all you need to do to return to normal is get in!! Mia said. It can\u2019t be!! You\u2019ve already cracked the door\u2019s lock?! Maria said .Don\u2019t you dare underestimate the vice director of the advance sciences society, you slut! I\u2019ll be your opponent!! Mia said. \u2026\u2026Go! You said. Get into the test units while we have the chance! Go!! Chijinda said. As you and mia hold off maria, chijinda, mizuho, and Maque get into the chamber. After a few seconds, you see them step out back at normal size. Excellent, chijinda! Come on, let\u2019s turn this half-baked sexpot teacher into a fully black and blue one! Mia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mia and the two queen\u2019s attack, you and chijinda decide to go all out at the start. The yellow and black circles appear in your eyes. You attack Maria and when chijinda goes in, you attack with him. You block a roundhouse kick and kick her in the stomach. Then Mia rushes her with a speedy beat down. Lady masque dual slices Maria with her swords. You know what to do! Chijinda said. You rush towards her, jumping left and right, and then you hit her right in the face with power behind your punch. Masque slashes at Marie with both of her swords. Mia roundhouse kicks Marie. The sudden force makes her drop her id card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGive it up, Maria!! Chijinda said. Owowowie\u2026. This time you really DID do me in\u2026. And I had such confidence in my hand to hand abilities now\u2026.. Since I played with you tiny ones so often, perhaps I took you a tad too lightly\u2026. On top of that, your simple yet overwhelming strength is all you have. In any event, I utterly resign! I won\u2019t get in your way or attempt to waylay you any further, so just press on ahead\u2026. Maria said. And why are we so calm and composed?! Before we go on, you\u2019d better believe we\u2019re going to dispose of you! You\u2019ve played to your heart\u2019s content with shrinkies this whole time, so I think it\u2019s only right we introduced you to that micro world you\u2019re so proud of!! Mia said. Sorry to say, but that\u2019s quite imposible. You see, I can\u2019t be shrunk. If reina\u2019s level of protection is 1\u2026\u2026and madame president is 100\u2026..then I wonder if mine is 1,000? It\u2019s impossible to shrink me with any of our products derived from Narue\u2019s shrinking hormones. Indeed, you MAY just barely affect the slightly weaker president, but anything regarding myself is utterly out of the question. After all, I\u2019ve modified my own biological structure quite thoroughly.You lot focused so intently on shrinking and related fields that you never once thought to research, let alone master preventative measures. Maria said. You\u2026..Who ARE you? You\u2019re not just some random teacher who got involved here, are you?! Mia said. That\u2026..is a secret. Now then, if you\u2019ll excuse me. I\u2019ll be leaving the island a step ahead of the festivities, but please D get along with the president. If you make it through this, but all means, we shall meet again. Ciao! Maria said before making tracks. She\u2019s good at running. We beat her, buuut\u2026. She still had the stamina to run off like that\u2026. Chijinda said. \u2026\u2026.She knew something. You said. She talked like she knew the director. How did she even get in good with the president here, and what was her goal in all this? It\u2019s like she didn\u2019t care about the new society\u2019s goal at all. Chijinda said. \u2026\u2026In any event, all that\u2019s left now is to deal with the president and narue\u2019s clone. Let\u2019s go, chijinda. You want closure to this case already\u2026..don\u2019t you? Mia said. You\u2019re right. All that\u2019s left is the mastermind. Thanks a lot, v-d. For everything. I can\u2019t tell you how much of a help you\u2019ve been. Chijinda said.  \u2026..Hmph. It was MY fault we got caught in a trap. I don\u2019t need your thanks. And I wouldn\u2019t go getting all friendly is I were you. Remember, once we beat the president, we go straight back to being enemies. Until the day the director might come back to us, I\u2019M the leader of the advanced sciences society! If you ever stand in our way in the future, I\u2019ll be more than happy to shrink you again! Keep THAT in mind! Mai said. \u2026..Try it. I\u2019ll be at your throat! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you all ventured further, chijinda injects you with a syringe. Here. This\u2019ll help. Chijinda said. Chijinda had injected you with healing serum. There. Should be able to speak clearly. He said. I told you this stuff interferes with\u2026\u2026you know. You said. Well, you were talking up a storm eairler. He said. \u2026\u2026Let me see. You said. Whoa. Are you sure. I said let me see. You said. But\u2026.. Chijinda said. I don\u2019t care if those clowns know. You said. You pull up chijinda\u2019s shirt sleeve and see the vial is nearly empty. *Sigh* I told you use this sparingly. You said. Had to stay alive somehow. He said. You\u2019re lucky I brought a spare. You said. You insert the new vile into the tube. There. Only if you have to. You said. Guess thanks is in order. Chijinda said. Don\u2019t thank me yet. Look at what I found. You said. You show chijinda the pictures you took. Wait\u2026\u2026are those boss man\u2019s formulas? Chijinda said. Yeah, except be rework. Turns out the scientist was once Simon\u2019s peer. You said. His name is Simon? \u2026\u2026I thought it was Alex. \u2026\u2026.Are you absolutely sure about this? Chijinda said. Positive. Why do you think I was collecting blood from the queens? Simon\u2019s going to want blood samples and live test subjects who have been under the effects of this new stim. Unless you want to tell him and be his first test subject. You said. \u2026..Arms out. Chijinda said. What? Mia said. Not you. Those two over here looking dumb. You said. Wha\u2026..What\u2019s this all about? Masque said. Unless you want to cough it up, hold your arms out. You threaten. Ok, ok\u2026. Mizuho said. You take blood sample from both Mizuho and Masque. There. Now we can go after the President. You said.</span></div></div>",

This is a notification to all staff within the faculty. Main operation is now entering its final phase. Please evacuate quickly to your established positions. We repeat, the operation is in final phase. A voice said over the intercom. Final phase\u2026?! Is that what this rumbling is all about\u2026.?! Chijinda said. All this rumbling can\u2019t be good! You said. The production output of shrinking hormones is reaching projected parameters. Now executing the surfacing of the underground containment capsule of the giant type test sample. Upon surfacing and stabilization of the giant type sample, control protocols will be enacted while the facility\u2019s output is synchronized with the island environment and surrounding ocean. The voice said. The shaking intensifies and then stops. Surfcing\u2026..complete. The giantess stasis, extraction, and regulation facility, AKA \u201cNarue Tower\u201d, has successfully surfaced. With this, the final procedures of Operation: Humanity\u2019s Reduction have been completed. The voice said. Did they say \u201cNarue Tower\u201d What the hell exactly did they DO to narue?! Chijind said. By going with what the lady said, something big just came from the depths of the island. You said. Then we need to get back to the surface. Now! Chijinda said. I think we just keep following the path! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all follow the path until it leads to a ladder. You climb up first and the ladder takes you to the surface. Get your collective asses up here! You said. One by one everyone climbs out. Come on. We need to get to the tower. You said. By how can we get across that huge body of water? Chjinda said. Knowing these bitches, they have something. Well\u2026\u2026there was an experimental hovercraft somewhere in that complex. Mizho said. Told you. Chijinda, go with them. You said. And you? Chijinda said. I\u2019ll\u2026\u2026..you know. You said. Do it before we get there. Come on. Chijinda said. With the party broken up, you head towards the tower. That is a huge body of water. Ok. The cybernetics should make it to where I can run on the surface. Just have to stay at good pace. You said. You take a few deep breaths and start running at a high speed. Since you\u2019re moving so fast, you were able to move on the surface. You manage to get to the tower and stop when you get to the tower\u2019s base. I still have a lot to learn about these cybernetics, but I shouldn\u2019t be surprise since have of the tech came from these bitches. You said. As you look up the tower, you see the hovercraft Mizho was talking about. You see it comes to a complete stop next to you and see the driver is chijnda. Heh. Can\u2019t drive a car, but can drive this. You said. Ha ha ha. Get your ass in there. He said.  You climb down the ladder and come across a huge tube and who you see in there shocks you. Can\u2019t\u2026..be\u2026\u2026 You said. In the giant capsule, is Narue. The real one. The president was right! She is in there, but how did she get so big? Last time I saw here, she was normal height!  Chijinda said. \u2026\u2026.The growth gun. The one I had reverse engineered. I never took it from her! You said. Our voices can\u2019t possibly reach her from here! We need to find a way up there. Still\u2026\u2026I\u2019d forgotten how damn colossal she was. Chijind said. She was always taller than you. You said. I knew that, but seeing her like this\u2026..It\u2019s still an overwhelming spectacle. To see something you\u2019ve know all your life\u2026..like this. It\u2019s called \u201cNarue Tower\u201d For a reason. Rivals some of the world\u2019s tallest buildings. But this isn\u2019t a time to be amazed. We just have to climb that high! Chijinda said. Then get your ass up here then! You shout. Chijinda sees you already 3rd catwalk. Didn\u2019t waste time\u2026.. Wait for us just a little longer, Narue! We\u2019ll get you outta that capsule soon! Chijind said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you\u2019ve been climbing, you\u2019ve been blazing a path through the guarding robots. Out of my way, you tin cans!!! You said. You take a minute to look at the capsule. Narue\u2026\u2026 I drove you to this place. The things I said to you\u2026.. I can\u2019t take any of it back, but I can make up for all of the cruel things I said by getting you out of that cell! Then I can start regaining your trust. You said. You head inside a small room and see chemicals on a shelf, a computer, and other things. Huff, huff, huff. You know, you could have slowed down. Chijind said. Hmm, the chemicals on that shelf there\u2026. Mia said. Mia shoves you aside and starts searching through the various drugs and chemicals on the shelf. Bitch. You said. As Mizho and Masque see what Mia is doing, you pull out your gun, but before you could fire it, chijnda grabs your arm. What the fuck are you doing!? Doing what I was ordered to do. You said. Ordered? Chijnda said. The president has put a kill order on three. You said. Kill order? On what grounds does their need to be a kill order?! Chijinda said. That\u2019s\u2026\u2026classified. You said. Is it because of their nationality? Chijinda said. This has nothing to do with them being of Japanese descent. You\u2019re part Japanese and you don\u2019t see me pointing a gun at you. You said. Then give me a proper explanation. Chijinda said. Fine. You want to know? Ever since this technology that can make people or things grow and shrink, a few nations have gone dark. You said. What does that mean? Chijinda said. It means they aren\u2019t returning our calls, not coming in on conferences with other global leaders, and all that stuff. Japan, Russia, even Germany have all gone dark and a so have a few small countries. You said. So you think that\u2019s a good reason to kill them? Chijinda said. They have been deemed a dangerous threat to the US. The US, UK, France, and other nations have taken a strong stand against this, but with the countries that have gone dark, we can\u2019t take chances here. You said. I know that. I\u2019m against their plans as well, but I don\u2019t think they should be kill over it. Chijinda said. They seem willing to. And you heard them. They won\u2019t stop till they achieve their goals. And let\u2019s not forget that Miku isn\u2019t dead and gone. You said. So that\u2019s why you want to kill them? Chijinda said. I told you chijnda, some people don\u2019t deserve the cold comfort of a jail cell. You know personally how dangerous they are. You said. And we\u2019re dangerous to them, but are they killing us? CHijinda said. They want to. And they\u2019ve tried to. On multiple occasions. Just as that green haired, gauntlet gun wielding bitch said when we came across here when we came to this island. You said. \u2026\u2026Do you really think they were there to kill us? Chijinda said. Don\u2019t tell me you talked to them. You said. They weren\u2019t going to kill us. Out of our differing respect of letting them live, they were going to keep us as their pets. Chijinda said. I\u2019d have been better off knowing they were going to kill me. I\u2019d rather be dead than someone\u2019s slave. You said. \u2026..I can\u2019t change your how you feel. You\u2019re going to do what you feel is right, but know that this is your first killing, and it will be on your conscious. And you have a guilty one. Chijinda said. After he said that, he lets go of your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to pull the trigger. To put an end to this. To finally be rid of all five of them. But when your finger grazes the trigger, you know your conscious will hound you. All your life, you had a guilty conscious. It hounded you after lying about taking a small pack of gum. Argh\u2026.! I just know I\u2019m going to regret this. You holster you gun. Seems like there is still a heart in there. He said. Yeah. Right it on a damn card. You said. Heh. Later. But look at this journal entry I found. Chijinda said. You read over the entry and learn the real reason why the madame president is doing this. This bitch must high if she think she\u2019s taking Narue\u2019s body! I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s some deity sealed from gaining her true form! She\u2019s not taking Narue\u2019s body! You said. All the more reason to stop her. Chijinda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to see Mia drinking something. What the shit did you just do?! You said. Did you really just take some serum that you have no idea what it does?! Chijinda said. Hmm\u2026.looks like it has absolutely no effects whatsoever. And I wanted to test whether it was an enlarging compound or not. Mia said. Have you lost what remaining brain cells you have left?! You don\u2019t know what that shit does! You said. \u2026..You\u2019re not getting enormous on us. So\u2026.. Chijinda said. Oh, can it. It was just a little bit of mischief on my part. You know the director grew gigantic at the end of our previous jaunt\u2026. \u2026..So as a twist, this time I want to match the pattern\u2026.or something like that. Mia said. Yeah. Like you aren\u2019t already a handful at your normal height. You being a giant is all we need on our end. You said.  You head back out on the catwalk. You really think it worked? Chijinda said. \u2026..You know the code, right? You said. Yeah, but shouldn\u2019t it kick in automatically? Chijinda said. I\u2019m not waiting around when Mia is a raging giant. Say the code and I\u2019ll make sure that bitch doesn\u2019t walk again. You said.</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t just stand there! Help her! You said. You\u2019re not dying today! I\u2019ll heal you right now!! Chijinda said. Even though chijinda performs first aid, it doesn\u2019t help. Shit!!

Aha\u2026..I\u2019m just a cheap copy of Narue, and yet you still get so worried about me in her place\u2026..Just like I always thought. Chijinda;s my prince charming. The clone said. Hey! You\u2019re not going into that white light! Not now! Chijinda said. No, it\u2019s alright. I\u2019ve committed so many cruel and horrible sins. I always knew I wasn\u2019t going to live very long anyway. I deserve to break down, hated and despised, like the pale imitation, the fake that I am\u2026.

The\u2026.only thing\u2026..locking\u2026..the control panel down and stopping it\u2026\u2026will be\u2026..the President\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026Ahhh\u2026..Lookl=s like my time\u2019s\u2026.up\u2026.I\u2019m so sorry\u2026.i was so mean\u2026\u2026and for all o did and said to you. \u2026\u2026And to Narue\u2019s other cared friend\u2026\u2026..she\u2019s\u2026.already forgiven you\u2026\u2026.and still cares for you. She said. S\u2026.She has\u2026.?! You said.  Please\u2026..save the huge me\u2026..we both care about\u2026\u2026  The clone said before breaking down molecule by molecule. This can\u2019t be!! Chijinda said. Goddamnit!!! You said full of anger. You\u2019re so mad that you take a hold of the railing and rip it off with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time for foolish sentimentality has long passed. Right now, I\u2019d be more concerned about how you\u2019re going to survive the day, puny humans! A voice said. Where is that bitch!? You said. She sounds like she\u2019s standing above us! \u2026\u2026Oh no! Chijinda said. Chijinda! Make sure to take a good grip on the handrails! If you were to fall to your death now, it would deprive me of much more entertaining ways of seeing you perish! Don\u2019t disappoint me. Madame President said. Take my hand, Chijinda! You said. Chijinda grabs you hand and you hold onto the other railing while the outer walls are opening. What the hell is going on?! Chjinda said. When the shaking stops, you let go of the railing.  The console\u2019s electronically locked! Masque said. Get to the top! You said. You start climbing the ladder. Th\u2026.These flesh colored mountains\u2026.and those deep, pink peaks\u2026. Chijinda said. You know who they belong to! Just get up here! You said. \u2026\u2026\u2026Make haste and continue your descent, Chijinda! Or else do you desire for me to grind you to paste between my bosem like the parasite you are?! Madame President said. Chjinda get to where you are on the catwalk. It seems as though the clone suffered its programmed self-annihilation. While she did prove difficult to deal with, it\u2019s thanks to her powers resonating at full force with my Krypton compound that I was finally able to fully awaken my potential. Madame President said. That monumental woman\u2026..Have we been shrunken again?! Chjinda said. We didn\u2019t shrink, she\u2019s just grown that huge! You said. Hmmm, at least one of you has basic intelligence. Nevertheless, you don\u2019t have the luxury of free time, now do you? I am now vast and mountains compared to your infinitesimal forms. She said. So then the legend was true\u2026\u2026 You really are descended from the titans of legend. Chjinda said. It doesn\u2019t matter if she descended from the titans or not! But just like the titans, she WILL fall! You said. I had to take quite a roundabout series of detours to get here, but I\u2019ve finally returned to my natural grandeur after much travail. \u2026..As I always suspected, having an immense body feels soooo exquisite. The power and scale of it just can\u2019t be compared to looking down over hordes of shrinkies while\u2026..tiny oneself. Gaze further upon my might and majesty! It\u2019s about the only value you otherwise minuscule, worthless humans can hope to have She said. I\u2019m getting vertigo just from looking at her. She\u2019s at least as huge as Narue was\u2026.Is\u2026..if not more\u2026.! Chijinda said. Those eyes of yours, steeped in despair, they\u2019re truly marvelous, Chijinda. However, you should know that THIS is hardly the limit of my omnipotence. At the moment, I\u2019ve only grown so immense due to my Krypton. I can feel the genetic limiters weakening. Soon now, I shall return to the true magnitude of my ancestors\u2026..on TOP of this!!! Can you even comprehend that? I am not yet even one tenth of the immensity I shall be!! My awakening as a colossal goddess will continue onward, I shall grow stretching even higher into the heavens, farther and farther, larger and larger until you humans are but the size of bacteria! She said. You have such an ego! Maybe even an inferiority complex as well! You think you hot stuff because you\u2019re growing! You say you have the power of a goddess? Well, come prove it! You said. Easy! We can do it like this! Look. Those patters on her body are sigils of the Daidarabotchi bloodline. If what the old man told me was true, then we can\u2019t win in against her at this size. We have to go. Chijinda said. Fighting and escaping seems unlikely. This is far different from fighting humans as shrinkies. Combatting a gargantuan opponent of such unbelievable mass at this size\u2026. Masque said. Back down. Chjinda said. You and chjinda climb back down the ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe console is locked, remember? You said. Damn! I at least wanted to wake up Narue from her coma! Chjinda said. ufu\u2026..Look, the feeble mites, being glared at so intently by the titaness are mustering the limits of their valor and bravery to seek out one last desperate hope\u2026.. Such a spectacule scene you show me, chijinda. And\u2026? What shall you do next? Will you bend your knees and beseech your goddess? Will you pled for your lives to I, who have Narue imprisoned? Madame President said. Who\u2019d yield to you over some dame show of ego? In all seriousness, I would rather die than do any such thing!! Chijinda said. Same here! You bitch! You said. So he says. I had thought you of all people would say something like that in the first place. But being supplicated to by imperceptible vermin is rather unpleasant. Come, I shall eradicate you in one breath. Showing hostility towards me no more than even once is enough merit, without exception\u2026. No\u2026indeed. I suppose there is a bit of room in my doctrine to overturn it just once. Chijinda, if you were to prostrate yourself and BEG me, I might be convinced to give it some thought. Allow me to give you just this ONE chance. She said. You look down your nose on us humans, don\u2019t you? Chjinda said. You don\u2019t understand? I would like to show you, without fail, the gratitude I owe unto you. After all, reflecting on it, isn\u2019t it only thanks to you that I was able to return to my rightful enormity? I shall be acting as a goddess henceforth. Even if my opponent is a worthless human, when it comes to debts, I would like to square all accounts. Therefore, I shall grant you a choice. If you should chose to submit to my doctrine, I shall grant you special leniency and allow you to live on as my anointed priest. I shall create my central shrine within my left eye, and there you shall be lifted up, whereupon you shall consecrate your entire left to me! She said. Her left eye socket is hollow. Chijinda said. If that sounds disagreeable, then by all means, do whatever you please. You\u2019re free to escape, or to attempt battle with me whichever you choose, your end shall be the same. Just like all similar humans, you will be crushed out of existence by me! She said. If that was the case, then you\u2019d already had done it by now! Chjinda, let\u2019s take the fight to egotistical, self-proclaimed goddess! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what, let\u2019s! Let\u2019s give her the asskicking she deserves. Chjinda said. That\u2019s absurd! There\u2019s no wat we could even hope to win, Chijinda. Mizuho said. Do you understand what you\u2019re saying? As I said, this is different from battling humans as shrinkies. Our enemy is the ultimate lifeform, a force of the natural realm. Could you hope to win a battle against, say, the wind!? Masque said. You two want to give up? Fine. Go ahead and prostrate yourselves! But we\u2019re going to fight! We\u2019re not going into that quiet night so easily. You said. This is the only chance e got! You heard her, she\u2019ll keep growing more titanic! If we have the slightest chance of turning this around, this is our only chance! If what she said is true, she\u2019ll be able to crush entire cities underfoot! Countries maybe! And she\u2019s got her own enlarging juice in her system on top of those genes! We have to put her down, now! I see I suppose you\u2019re right! We\u2019ve got no choice but to fight her here and now! \u2026..I suppose you can think of it that way as well. Her defeat is only possible right now! Let\u2019s use the Rangoon, which can get us high off the ground! It\u2019s impossible without bare hands, but with the Rangoon, we have a shoot. Oh and I forgot, Omega Delta Foxtrot. Chijinda said. Code received. Omega mode engaged. Let\u2019s do this! You said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u2026.So in the end, you\u2019ve chosen to challenge me just as I thought. Not bad, chijinda. Although I despise humans, I\u2019ve taken a fancy to you, so to speak. Although from the very start, all thought of you resisting are both impossible and meaningless. The possibility of you actually struggling your way back to the ground is nonexistent! Madame President said. Ignore her! Keep moving! Chijinda said. Oh, that\u2019s good! Struggle with all your pathetic might! Let\u2019s see\u2026.I shall bequeath you two minutes. If you escape my field of view in that time, I\u2019ll let you all go for now. She said. Two minutes?! No! We don\u2019t have time to worry here! I\u2019ll take that offer! Chijinda said. You all continue to climb down the ladders. Heads down! You said. Everyone gets down before the Madame President could grab anyone. She\u2019s not going to make this easy! Masque said. Just keep going! Chijinda said. You all keep climbing down ladders while advoiding madame president\u2019s colossal hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all come to a stop when the path is blocked by her thick, dark hair. Damn! We so close too! Chijinda said.  She\u2019s must be bigger than Miku was. You said.Humans are such tiny, pitiful things, aren\u2019t they? From your infinitesimal vantage, your minds can\u2019t even begin to gauge my gargantuan scale. I wonder if you understand the reasoning behind why I\u2019m deigning to let you scamper around as you wish? It\u2019s because trying to fight each and every mite like speck around me is the height of stupidity. Madame President said. Like I need you to tell me all that\u2026.! Her hair is like bridge cables! And it\u2019s so thick that cutting it with hand by hand tools isn\u2019t going to work. Chijinda said. Fufu\u2026..You are as amusing as I thought, Chijinda. Normal humans would long since abandon hope after witnessing this, but you\u2019re not even close to breaking, are you? However, I assure you, This IS the end. Your goddess\u2019s compassion and mercy have simply run out. She said.  Chjinda! Back away! You said. Feel honored by this privilege! To pay my respects for your valiant efforts, and even your help, I will personally, carefully, smite you with my own finger. She said. Acting on pure instinct, you push chijinda away and take his spot. What are you doing!? Chijinda said. ohhhhh. Trying to protect him, I see. It doesn\u2019t change a thing but the order I wanted to dispose you all in. She said. As her hand gets closer, you ready yourself. Piss off!!! You said. With a single punch, you hit her hand away from you. What?! Madame President said. As I said before! I don\u2019t care how tall you are! You\u2019re just going to hit the ground harder! You said. I see\u2026.. So you weren\u2019t all talk at all. But at most, you hit was just a minor sting. I was planning on make your demise a pleasurable one, but now\u2026\u2026that\u2019s no longer an option. She said. Come closer then! I\u2019ll cause more than a minor sting! You said. So the omega mode does make it possible to hurt her! But even by himself, our chance are still slim. Chijinda said. Come, human. Let me see just strong you really are against a goddess. She said. With pleasure! You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t get so full of yourself just yet!! You\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s grown into goddess hood today!!! A voice you know too well said. Wha?! Madame President said. You see a giant Mia smack away Madame President\u2019s colossal hand. VD\u2019s enlarged into a giantess as well?! \u2026..This must be the stuff of nightmares are made of\u2026. Chijinda said. Seems like my gamble paid off. I was more compatible with the growth compounds as I had expected! Mia said. You bitch, you drank my prototype sample. This is such unbridled nonsense!! That batch had no effect on me or anything else till this point!! Why did it only work on you?!? Madame President said. Why, isn\u2019t that completely obvious\u2026..!!! It\u2019s the power of love! \u2026..between the Director and I!!!! Mia said. She just said that to where everyone in the entire world heard her. You said. You lot, don\u2019t just stand there staring at me in wonder! Get up and get going already!! I\u2019ll keep her held down, so move! Mia said. R\u2026.Right! I\u2019m in your debt! You really know how to come through, VD!! Chijinda said. Just get going! I won\u2019t be able to hold her forever!! Mia said. Chijinda and the others continue their descent down, but you stay behind. That includes you as well! Mia said. No! I\u2019m not going anywhere! She picked a fight with me first! So she\u2019s getting it! You said. This is no time for jokes!! Mia said. It\u2019s no joke! I\u2019m staying whether you like it or not!!! You said. \u2026..Don\u2019t get in the way. Mia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia attacks madame President with eight quick punches. Madame President holds out her hand and lightning strikes Mia, but she shrugs it off. You ok?! You said. Just a scratch. She said. I have an idea! Hold your hand out. You said. This better be good. Mia said. Mia holds her hand out and you jump on. Now. Throw me! You said.  Throw you?! She said. I\u2019ll be fine! Just do it! You said. Mia takes aim and throws you with all her might. With you in omega mode and the velocity of mia\u2019s throw, you hit madame president and manage to make her take a step back. Not bad\u2026\u2026for a human. But\u2026..! She said. As you jumped back, you see both of her hands close in on you! If anyone kills him, it\u2019s me! Mia said.  Mia punches madame president and catches you. Never thought you\u2019d save my life. You said. Don\u2019t get use to this. I only\u2026\u2026 Before she could finish her sentence, Mia toss you aside before the lightning could hit her. As you fall, you could make out the sound of the Rangoon. You see it coming towards you with the hatch open. You land on the front seat. I didn\u2019t know you could fly! You said. Don\u2019t be so surprise at what Boss man has me do sometimes! Chijinda said. Chijinda flies the Rangoon right into the fight. Sorry to keep ya waiting VD! You\u2019re back up has arrived!! Chijinda said. I\u2019d like to say \u201cGlad to have you\u201d!, but she is seriously powerful! Don\u2019t get too far in front of me! Mia said. Alright! Let\u2019s take it to her! You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia attacks Madame President with a rush of eight attacks. Chijinda fires lasers right at the President. \u2026.nghhh\u2026. What is the meaning of this? For my ascended body to actually feel your bombardment this badly?! This thing fires lasers? You said. Anti-giantess weapons.  Don\u2019t you look down on US, President-zilla! Reina excavated these from the Twin Peak\u2019s ruins! Obviously they\u2019re some kind of ancient, anti-giantess weaponry created to take down your ancestors! I mean, did you think your people shrank themselves to make your life miserable!? It\u2019s probably because they drove the humans against them!! Chijinda said. Rally? Reina\u2026..that girl can actually get things done when she puts her mind to it! I can actually see a chance of winning this fight now! Mia said. You dare talk down to me just because you\u2019ve grown a bit as well?! I shall make you regret opening your impertinent mouth to me! Madame President said. Mia attacks Madame President before she could call down lightning. Chijinda! You said. I know what you\u2019re thinking! Don\u2019t get yourself killed! He said. Chijinda opens the hatch and flies directly at the president. You jump out and assault her with a flurry of strong attacks. Chijinda flies close to the president and catches you. Gnnhh\u2026.! What is going on\u2026.?! The seals on my body have been completely released, and yet I\u2019m weakening\u2026.. Madame President said. Like I said, do NOT underestimate the power of humans, President!! Chijinda said. This is your just reward for using Narue! You said. Let\u2019s do this!! Everyone together! One unified moment! We\u2019re all coming at you at once!!!  Chijinda said. ha! Baseless confidence as usual! However\u2026.much as it pains me, I\u2019ll acknowledge this: I did make light of you and your friend abilities. I shall not ALLOW, as a descendant of my titanic race, humans to defeat us again!! Come at me, tiny hero! I will give you my ALL!! She said. You want us, you got us! You said. </span></div></div>",

You jump out of the hatch and attack the President with a flurry at the same time Mia attacks her. To your surprise again, mia catches you as you fall. Second time. You must care. You said. I\u2019m really resisting the urge to crush you between my fingers right now.  Mia said. That\u2019s mean. You said.  Hey Miss President, suddenly you don\u2019t look so calm and confident anymore. Cijinda said. Rghhhh! Chijinda!!! Madame President said. Hey! What\u2019s with the tone?! Chijinda said.  Just be silent and listen! You\u2026.both of you\u2026..do you really intend to save Narue? She\u2019s going to remain colossal for the rest of her natural life. If you two return to your normal world, nothing but pain and suffering! Will you still save her? Will you never see her as a burden? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s better for her if this giantess remains locked away like this? She said. There will NEVER be a time when I think of her as a burden, nor will she BE one! In the first place, whether what\u2019s waiting for us\u2026\u2026is suffering, or happiness, or just our everyday lives and problems to work through together is for US o decide! NOT YOU!!!! Chijinda said. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s a giantess or not! We\u2019re still going to save her! Come Hell and high water!!!! You said.  And If, If she tells me she\u2019s suffering after that, we will fill her life with enough fun and happy things, and care for her so much\u2026..that she won\u2019t have the time to think about her troubles! Even if I bug the hell out of her, I won\u2019t stop staying by her side!! I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve heard, and clearly understood everything I need to. And I suppose I\u2019m done with talk as well. Done with everything. \u2026..It seems those who don\u2019t learn from ARE doomed to repeat it. Madame President said before a bright dazzle of light consumes everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground.<br>\r\nYou\u2019re lying there on the ground completely exhausted. Then you see Chijinda. Need a hand? Yeah. You said. You grab his hand and he pulls you up. This\u2019ll be the adventure to tell Simon. You said. And a story for the media. Chijinda said. Yeah. Meet me half way? You said. You extend your fist. Chijinda gets the idea and bumps your fist. Brothers! Together and forever! You said. Damn straight. He said. Heh! Becoming more and more American each day. Now. Where is Mia and the others? You see Mia, Masque, and Mizuho are gone. And so is the Rangoon. Shit. Seems like they escaped in the Rangoon. I hope Mia\u2019s back to normal size. Heh. Imagine her growing to that size every time she got mad? You said. Please. I\u2019m already going to have nightmares. Chijinda said. You both look to see a bright light appear. The president is returning to normal size too\u2026 No, wait\u2026.. Not returning to normal in her case. Rather, she\u2019s shrinking back to human size again\u2026 Chijinda said. She just couldn\u2019t stand being a god among humans. She was used to looking down on people. It\u2019s not easy to go from power to no power. You said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..You got me good, didn\u2019t you? It\u2019s the very destiny of titans to be defeated by mere humans\u2026.is it? History has repeated itself again. She said. Give it up, Miss President. You surrender now and we won\u2019t hurt you at all. Chijinda said. But before that, you\u2019re going to release Narue from her induced coma. You said.  I don\u2019t even have to DO anything to revive her. Now that the machinery is down, she should awaken in about a day on her own. It\u2019s your complete victory. Now all that\u2019s left is for you to kill me and end this. She said. Can we? You said. I said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: No. We have no intention of taking it that far. The plaque on MY door reads \u201cDetective\u201d\u2026.though we may save the world from time to time. Our job ends once we\u2019ve discovered the perpetrators and turned them over to the authorities. Anything beyond that is out of our hands. \u2026\u2026you are SUCH a killjoy. We\u2019ve come this far and you say such boorish thing. So you won\u2019t even kill your hated enemies, eh? However, if THAT\u201dS the case, then I do wonder whether our battle is actually ending in a draw. It IS an honorable creed, however what a shame for you in that case, Mr. Detective. You both see her body start to fade. \u2026.nghh\u2026.As I suspected, my body can no longer hold out. It will now disperse, and return to the island from which it came. Whether you\u2019d call this the \u201cdeath\u201d of a human, or the \u201csealing\u201d of a troublesome youkai, I don\u2019t know, but\u2026.either way, I\u2019m not going to be arrested, now am i? She said. You see chijinda is at a loss for words. Keep you cheap sympathy/. I still haven\u2019t lost. I WILL return one day to claim my revenge on you all! You\u2019d do well to remember me!! She said. We\u2019ll be waiting for you. And if you can\u2019t find us, just ask around. You said. In that case, you better make sure you fight differently next time so you DON\u2019T lose. If you don\u2019t use a more peaceful method of accomplishing your goals, next time I WILL see you apprehended. \u2026.Heh. You\u2019ll never learn, will you? Do you ever get tired of playing the hero? If\u2026.I haven\u2019t forgotten your words just now when next I awake\u2026.I\u2019ll give them some good thought. She said before disappearing into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026That concludes our debriefing, Boss man. Chijinda said. Hmmm. Quite a turn of events. Simon said. Did you ever get those samples I sent you? You said. I did. These are from an old scientist friend who I was sweet on. But she was always thought of control a person was stronger. Simon said.  So did you go to the island? You said. I did. Her research had come a long way, but still failed in comparison to mine. He said.  And, boss man, what about Narue? Chijinda said. She\u2019ll be treated with the utmost respect. Anyone who says something out of line will be under immediate punishment. He said. Thanks, sir. Chijinda said. Least I can for my best employees. He said. We should keep an eye open, though. Mia and her croons slipped away from us. They\u2019ll be back. You said. I have every available detective out there searching for a lead on them. We\u2019ll find them. I laughed when I first read that report you sent in, but now that I know the threat is real, I will devote every asset I have. Simon said. It\u2019s going to take a lot. These girls are determined. We just have to be much more determined. You said. I agree. I don\u2019t fancy craning my neck to look up at someone.  Simon said. I also spoke to the president about them as well. They are on every intelligence agencies watch list. They\u2019d like Simon to share any of his finding. You said. They can expect my help, but if they are asking for you know what, they aren\u2019t getting it. He said. They\u2019ll very much like to hear it. You said. Very well. You\u2019re both dismissed. Feel free to take a short paid vacation. THAT\u201dS a direct order. For all three of you. Tell her the good news for me. Simon said. He said. Yes, sir. You\u2019ll get no arguments from me. The three of us have a lot to talk about and come to terms with. Chijinda said.  Come on. You said. You and chijinda leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, even though the case is closed, left a lot of problems. Chijinda said. Worry about it later. Right now, we\u2019re on leave. You said. Good work, you two! How\u2019d the debriefing go? Narue said. Whoa\u2026! You came to meet us, Narue?! How\u2019d everything check out with your body? Besides the obvious? Chijinda said. Yeah! My health is a-ok!! My body\u2019s still as enormous as ever, but the numbness has faded! I\u2019ve been told I\u2019ll be allowed to team up as your partner from now on!! From now on, Narue\u2019s right as rain!! She said. Hey, Narue\u2026.. About what I said\u2026.You said. You don\u2019t have to say anything. I\u2019ve already forgiven you and it was half my fault as well. If I had stayed by your side from the beginning\u2026\u2026. Narue said. It\u2019s fine. I was just\u2026..depressed. But it\u2019s all water under the bridge. But if anyone gives you troubles, just tell me. I\u2019ll handle it personally. You said. Heh heh. I know I can rely on my two close friends! Narue said. She can\u2019t remember anything, does she? Chijinda said. Not a second of it. That\u2019s a good thing. No need to tell her now. She\u2019d only get upset. You said. Yeah. I can\u2019t stand to see her upset neither. Oh! By the way, Narue! We just got some paid leave and permission for you. Anywhere you want to kick your feet up and relax? All three of together of course, like we always used to! It\u2019s on the company, let\u2019s splurge! Chijinda said. Really?! Alright, let\u2019s go to the beach this time for sure!! If I take us, we don\u2019t even need to worry about a plane or boat to get there! Narue said. Going first class by giantess? I\u2019ll take that offer. You said. Narue airways soon departing! Chijinda said. You pry open the glass window and hop onto narue\u2019s hand. Come on Chijinda! Or we\u2019re leaving you behind! You said.  \u2026..The lord is my shepherd!! Chijinda said before jumping and land right next to you. Wasn\u2019t that bad. You said. This is a sight I never dreamed of. The two closest people I know in the palm of my hand! Narue said. Should we be happy or scared? You said. A little bit of both. Chijinda said. I\u2019m just teasing! Now, hang on Narue said. Narue, making sure not to crush anything, makes her way to the beach. I could get use to this kind of traveling. You said. We still have some work to do, but let\u2019s save it for later. Chijinda said. With Narue back as your side and everything forgiven, you and chijinda are ready for whatever\u2019s next in life. </span></div></div>",

When you twist the handle, the door opens. The door\u2019s unlocked? Are they expecting someone? You said. You go inside and it\u2019s a whole different story when you see machines and computers line the walls. This is al their tech. How\u2019d they get it across the ocean? You said. As you look around, you spot a strand of blue hair. Blue hair? It\u2019s not miku\u2019s hair. That could only mean that blue haired cyber girl is here. Haven\u2019t seen her in a long time. If I come across here this time, the playing field is even. You said. As you look around for evidence, you hear voices. Seems like I\u2019m not alone. You said. You slowly open the door, but see nobody. Strange. I heard something. You said. You can still hear the voices. I think the voices are echoing through the vents. Looks like I\u2019m going to be Batman. You said. You pry open the vent gate and climb into the vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou traverse the vents until you find were the source of the voices are coming from. Oh great. Look at who it is. You said. You look through the bars in the gate to see the Queens. And look who\u2019s among them. You said. You see that blue haired girl. Still up to no good. Well, I better get back the President and\u2026\u2026wait. Is that\u2026..You said. You look down to see a Japanese agent. What\u2019s a Japanese agent doing here? You said. When you get a better look, you see it\u2019s multiple Japanese agents. 4? What are they doing here?! You mutter. You they walk away to another room and you fall down to the ground. What the hell are Japanese agents doing here? You said. As you think, you hear something fall over. Huh? You said. When you go over to what fell over, you see chijinda hiding behind a create. Uhhh\u2026.You found me? He said. What are you doing here? You said. Well\u2026.. I couldn\u2019t just let you go here b yourself. He said. *Sigh* No one is suppose to know I\u2019m here. I\u2019m on a mission for the president. You said. We can do it together. He said. You text the president and he texts back. What\u2019d he say? Chijinda said. Your ride out of here will be here in a few minutes. You said. Come on! He said. This is more than some investigation. Do you have any augmentations? You said. Well\u2026..no, but I signed up for the procedure you had. He said. Ok. When you get those implants, you can do this stuff. Until then, you stay on the other side of danger. You said. You felt something nudged in your back. Give me a sec. You said. Yellow and black rings form in your eyes. Your body distorts as you turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. If it isn\u2019t the vengeful cyborg. You said. Cyborg, no. vengeful, yes. She said. Is she the one you told me about? Chijinda said. Yeah. She\u2019s the one who replaced half of her body with nuts and bolts. You said. Like you can talk. You gave me shit about it. What about you? You did the same thing I did. She said. I still have all of my organs and stuff. All I got were augmentations and implants. And I didn\u2019t do it out of revenge like you. You said. Word it however you want. Still changes nothing about what you did. I finally get another chance. Not only against you, but chijinda as well. She said. You really think things will be different this time? You said. I don\u2019t think, I know. I might have failed back at the school, but this time\u2026..will be different for sure. She said. Really? You didn\u2019t get us when we were as small as an ant. You said. If I wanted to, you\u2019d both be greasy, red stains on my foot. She said. Big talk for someone who lost to us twice. Chijinda said. The let\u2019s stop talking then. I\u2019ll rip out both of your throats!! Starting with you, chijinda!!! She said. As she aims her wrist mounted laser gun at chijinda, you step in her way. If you want chijinda, you go through me first. You said. Heh. Very well. I\u2019ll kill you nice and slow. And I\u2019ll make you, chijinda, beg for the sweet release of death. She said. Quit talking and let\u2019s go. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she fires her laser gun, you simply move your head. Cocky jerk! She said. She comes at you and you grab her fist. You leg sweep her and when she hits the ground, you grab her by the throat. Get your dirty hands off me! She said. Tell me what the fucking Japanese want! You said. Sure. I\u2019ll whisper it in your ear when I decapitate you! She said. The hard way it is. You said. The yellow and black rings appear in your eyes and you wail on her. After the first furry, you ask her again. You\u2019ll have to kill me. She said with a cocky smile. With pleasure! You said. You go to hit her again, but chijinda grabs your arm. No. Not like this. We\u2019re better than them. He said. You let go of her and restrain her. Compared to me, the CIA will have a field day with you. You said. You and your government don\u2019t scare me. I survive the transformation to cyborg. Nothing you can do will scare me. She said. We\u2019ll see. You said. You\u2019ve gotten brutal. Chijinda said. Comes with the territory. You said as the rings disappear.  Omega Delta Foxtrot. Chijinda said. Voice recognition confirm. What was that for? You said. Just in case. He said. You both suddenly hear the sound of a chopper. That\u2019s your ride. You said. The wall blows open from a rocket shoot. This is hotel 3. On station. He said. Good to have you, hotel. Room for package plus one? You said. Plenty. He said.  You carry the self-proclaimed cyborg to the chopper and throw her on. Enjoy the ride, cyborg. You said. Heh. Joke while you can. You have no idea what\u2019s coming your way. She said. I\u2019ll manage. Get on. You said. Chijinda reluctantly gets on. You know narue won\u2019t be happy about this. He said. I\u2019ll deal with her later. Hotel. Get airborne before too much attention is drawn. You said. Affirmative. Hang on back there. He said. The chopper flies out into the distance.  Ok. Back to the task at hand. You said. Before you could turn around, you felt something go through your stomach. You look down to see a sword being pulled out and you\u2019re kicked to the ground. Hurry. He won\u2019t stay out for long a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the chopper.<br>\r\nYou have a lot to explain. Chijinda said. You think I\u2019ll talk to your spooks. You won\u2019t get a word out of me. She said. I wish you luck with that. Chijinda said. Oh. I won\u2019t be needing any luck. You will be needing all the luck you can get. She said. What do you mean? Chijinda said. There are big plans in the making, chijinda. Big plans. When you realize what\u2019s finally going on, it\u2019ll be too late to stop it. You\u2019ll wish you\u2019d die back at the school. She said. Pilot. How far out are we? Chijinda said. A few hours. The only reason I got to your location so quickly was because I was already 2 minutes out. He said. Best hurry back. We need to know what she knows. Chijinda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later in a interrogation room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArg\u2026\u2026Is\u2026.that all you spooks got? Don\u2019t go lightly just because I\u2019m a girl. She said. We don\u2019t want to hurt you too much. You still need to be able to talk. One CIA agent said. Is this kind of interrogation legal? Chijinda said. As far as the public knows. He saids. Chijinda walks up her and grabs her by the head. What are your croons planning?! Chjinda said. All will be revealed soon. When it\u2019s close, I\u2019ll let all of you know. I give you this for now. It will be hell on earth. She said. Chijinda lets go of her. I think that\u2019s all we\u2019ll get. He said. She\u2019ll stay locked up until she gives all the information. The agent said. Can we really keep her locked up in here? Chijinda said. She\u2019ll be under 24/7 surveillance and still have basic privileges. Let me know when she talks. Chijinda said before leaving the room. You leave the secret CIA hideout and head back to the office. When chijinda gets back to the office, he goes into Simon\u2019s office. Chijinda. I heard about your little escapade to Japan. He said. Well, it\u2019s not like it was hard. I just left before he did. Chijnda said. The fact that you knew where he was going before you did is somewhat unusual. Simon said. I am a detective. One thing I know for sure about the situation is that there is a bad wind blowing, boss man. A very bad wind. Chijinda said. Bad times are coming chijinda. We all will be tested when it comes. Simon said.</span></div></div>",

You hear voices and beeping sounds There is a burning sensation in your chest and digging through you. (Am i\u2026..cut open?!) You thought. You wait until the person operating on you gets closer and grabs them by the throat. You slowly stand up from the operating table and the incision that was made on you seals up like new and your eyes shoot open. You hold the doctor by the throat tightly as you check your surrounding. You see you are in a surgery room. You\u2026. You said. Please! They made me do it! Against my will! He said. Lies! I felt they way you cut me open. You did so with such curiosity and precision. You said. No. I swear!! He said. You throw the doctor through the table. You put your boot on his neck. Tell me who and you walk away with a hurt back. You demanded. They\u2026..did. He said. Who\u2019s they!? You said. Then the door opens up and you see another doctor walk in, holding a clipboard. Did you find-oh God!! He said when he sees you. Before he could run, you grab him and throw him out of the room. Tell me who did this! You said. Before he could speak, you hear an alarm. Damn. You said. You quickly run to the exit, but when you reach for the knob, you felt this searing pain in your head. Hmm, seems like chip works. A voice said. The pain is so intense that you kneel over. We have plans for you. Big plans. The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week later.<br>\r\nI\u2019m starting to get concerned, boss man. An entire week and nothing. Chijinda said. Maybe he went to ground. Simon said. He\u2019d at least said something. Narue worried sick and the last thing anyone wants is having a panic-stricken giantess around. Chijinda said. Then the sound of a jet passes then an explosion. Jesus!! Chijinda said. A little bit close for testing a bomb. Simon said. I don\u2019t think they are testing a bomb. Look! Chijinda said. Simon looks to see japannese tanks and transports dropping of soldiers. I think we\u2019re being invaded! Chijinda said. I never thought it would be the Japanese. Good thing I have a plan for this. Chijinda. Find that blue hair girl and make her squeal. Simon said. Will do. Chijinda said. Chijinda leaves the building. Simon goes to his PA system. Miss Stone! Lock down the building! He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChijinda, using the alleyways, gets to the CIA hideout. Where is she?! He said. Chijinda barges in the interrogation room. Well, well, look who came to visit. She said. Can it! Why are there Japanese troops here?! Chijinda said. So it begins. Since this will be the last time we meet, I\u2019ll tell you. The Japanese government has made a deal with us. They\u2019ll back us in our pursuit if we leave them be and get them your cybernetic friend. She said. You what?!? So all that back then was\u2026.. Chijinda said. A ruse. All to lure him out. And it worked. The USA will be our stomping grounds. Literally. She said. You didn\u2019t\u2026. Chijinda said. That\u2019s right. Our growth tech is theirs when all the queens and our director has cybernetics as your friend. He\u2019s probably being dissected as we speak. She said. You\u2026. You won\u2019t get away with this!! Chijinda said. Oh, we will. My only regret is that I was a pawn in the plan. To have you at my feet is a dream of mine. She said. Chijinda leaves the safe house. This is bad. Really bad! I have to find narue. Where would I be if I was a giant? Under these circumstances, protecting people. Chijinda said. Chijinda stays out of sight until he finds narue directing hordes of civilians. This way, everyone! Narue soad. Narue! Down here! Chijinda soad. Chijinda! What are the Japanese doing here?! Narue said. Later! Right now, we need to get as many civilians out of harm\u2019s way! Chijinda said. Right! Narue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping with the evacuation and falling back, chijinda tells narue what\u2019s going on. So it was all a ploy?! Narue said. Yeah. It was! Just to get him. Chijinda said. We have to go get him! Narue said. It\u2019d take too long. Even for you. We need to deal with this first! Chijinda said. But\u2026..! Narue said. I know this is tough, but we have to deal with this problem first. Then we go find him. Chijinda said. If they did something\u2026\u2026! Narue said. We\u2019ll deal with when we cross that bridge! Let\u2019s go! Chijinda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 Days later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it begins. Never thought it be the japs. Bowman said. Which is why I always said never trust those eastern countries. They\u2019re always to themselves. John said. So how much did we lose? Chijinda said. Almost all of the southwest states and upper northern states. They made quick progress in a short time. Cynthia said. And no word from the Japanese? Chijinda said. Not at all. No demands or anything. Bowman said. We need to do something. We can\u2019t hide away like this! Chijinda said. What can we do? Three trained section agents, a detective and giant girl. Cynthia said. We can take the fight to them. Just like you did before. We take back what\u2019s ours! Chijinda said. You don\u2019t have a problem with killing your own? John said. Me and narue maybe of Japanese descent, but we know this is wrong. And we were born here. So as long as I live here, America\u2019s my home! Good enough for me. Bowman said. Ok then. We hit their central command for this area. That should give the army a fighting chance. Cynthia said as she tossed everyone a gun. Ok. Let\u2019s take the fight to them. John said. Everyone leaves the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. I have eyes on the building. Chijinda said. Great. Get the soldiers attention, and we\u2019ll do the rest. John said. Chijinda fires up in the air which alerts the guards. Before they could fire back, they are all swiftly taken down. Quick. Alright. Let\u2019s get in there. Bowman said. Everyone runs inside and hears a Japanese solider on comms. Cynthia quickly puts a bullet in his head. I don\u2019t know what he said, but it didn\u2019t sound good. John said. Reinforcements. He was asking for that. Chijinda said. Then it\u2019s narue\u2019s turn. Cynthia said. Narue. We have a problem. They\u2019ve phoned for reinforcements Can you deal with them? Chijinda said. Don\u2019t worry. I got this. Narue said. While she\u2019s doing that, I\u2019ll be tweaking this radio. Bowman said. As bowman fiddles with the radio, you can hear gunfire and explosion. She must be enjoying herself. John said. Got it. Radio\u2019s tuned to army\u2019s frequency. Bowman said. Cynthia gets on the radio. To any military personnel out there, sector 3516 has been cleared. Repeat: sector 3516 has been cleared. She said. So now what? John said. We keep doing this until they are gone. Chijinda said. </span></div></div>",

We can soon go back to living normally. John said. Just then, a red flare is fired in the sky. Flare! Impending attack! Bowman said. As everyone takes their positions, the flare still hangs high. Where are they? Cynthia said. A flare was fired. Maybe it was one of ours? John said. As the flare disappears and everyone eases down, there is a shout. \u2026..Attack! Under attack! A soldier said. Guess it was a distraction. Let\u2019s go. Cynthia said. As you all move out, the shouts and screams of the soldiers are heard. Where is he?! One shouts. There! Shoot him! Another said. He\u2019s so fast! No! Stay back! Stay\u2026 AHHHHHHH! Another said. This person means business. John said. Then one of the soldier comes flying through the brick wall. Take him down! NOW! A sergeant shouts as he shoots his gun. The bullets are going\u2026..through him?! A soldier said. As chijinda and the rest walk in on the sergeant and his squad being killed brutally and efficiently, they are shocked to see it\u2019s you. EX?! John said. As your eyes set onto your friends, the yellow and black rings disappear from your eyes. \u2026\u2026.Mission failed. Returning. You said. You leave through one of the many holes you made you\u2019ve thrown soldiers through. Ex\u2019s alive. And he\u2019s\u2026..the one attacking us? John said. Makes sense from the reports. Inhuman speed, brutal nature, bullets phasing through. Bowman said. You think\u2026..John said. No. No! He would never do this. Those bastards did something to him. A clone, a chip, something. The EX I know would never do this! Cynthia said. (So that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t heard from you.) Chijinda thought. We\u2019re going after him! Cynthia said. Wait. If we do, we\u2019ll be up to our eyes in japs. John said. I don\u2019t care! I\u2019ll kill all of them to get to him! Cynthia said. That\u2019d go double for narue. But we have to do this right. Chijinda said. Which would be right fucking now! Cynthia said. No. we\u2019ll do more harm than good. We need to think this out. Chijinda said. That\u2019s a load of-he\u2019s right, Cynth. John interrupts. We\u2019d rush to our deaths. Bowman said. We\u2019ll figure something out, and have him back before winter\u2019s over. Chijinda said I\u2019m holding you to that. Cynthia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a good distance from the makeshift base. Chijinda\u2026\u2026 You said. You stare back at the base, then walk off into the cold night. As the days go by, you\u2019ve been raiding markets and small shops for the Japanese since the US army has almost pushed them out. As you load the food on the truck, you take your usual 1/3 take. You lean against the wall and eat a bag of chips as the truck pulls away. As the truck pulls away, it suddenly blows up. Unflinching, you continue to eat as piece of the truck rain down all around. You already knew who it was, so you weren\u2019t surprised when a group of US soldiers arrived and rush your position. Weapons down. All of you! Cynthia said. You stop eating when Cynthia shows up. Ex. What going with you? Cynthia said. Before you could say anything the ground shakes. What the?! One of the soldiers said. As the soldiers begin to panic, you are ordered to fall back. You use two soldiers as hopping stones, climb up on the roof of the adjacent building and head back to command. When you get back to the staging area, you head into a tent with the general and two soldiers. Leave us. He said. The two soldiers leave. Answer me this. Are you still a human? He said. Yes\u2026.. You said. Then this next part will be easier\u2026.. He said. The general tells you of operation mayhem. A testing op of utilizing the tech from the society. This is why you were ordered. We\u2019ll see how effective this is\u2026..He said. (Chijinda\u2026.. Everyone\u2026..) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the weeks go by, the giantess utilized by the Japanese crush any opposition. They ran amok throughout the US unopposed. Destroying cities and lives. You were a witness to the destruction. You could have easily stop them, but the chip in your head prevented you from action against them. The US army was defenseless against them and was decimated in all attempts of attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 month later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith winter here, all offensives have been halted until the weather clears. Leaving you with free reign until then. <br>\r\nYou walk the desolate streets of new York.  Littered with destroyed building, crushed cars and dried bloodstains of soldiers where they were crushed. You stop and look at a tv with the news on. As if giant school girls and Japanese on our doorstep wasn\u2019t bad, reports of a three-day long blizzard is coming. We ask any and all people out there, wherever you are, to be safe out there. The coming days are going to be brutal. The reporter said. A blizzard. Best find shelter. You said. You continue walking until you find a store that has power. There. This will do. You said. You put some stuff together and make a makeshift bed. You sit down and contemplate. From detective to cybernetic soldier to traitorous cybernetic soldier. Heh. I\u2019m on the rise. You say despondent. You sit there for a few hours until you see three people run by. They sure are in a hurry. You said. When nighttime approaches, you head back out. As you walk down the street, you took a dead soldier\u2019s sniper rifle and his dog tags. As you go, you find your friends hold up in a building. You look through the scope and see Cynthia, John, Bowman, and chijinda. Where\u2019s narue? She\u2019s usually not far away. You said. You see them talking. You were ordered to kill any sort of combatant you came across, but you manage to fight the control chip\u2019s influence and shoot the mug in Bowman\u2019s hand. They scatter from the window you shoot through. This chip needs to go. You said as you throw down the rifle. You walk back to the store and sleep for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up in the morning, the air is cold. That blizzard will be here soon. You said. You get up and eat a few rations in the store. Not the best, but it\u2019s something. You said. You hear a jet fly by overhead. You sit back down and sit there for a few hours until you hear another jet fly by. Then a few seconds later, you are enveloped in an explosion. After the explosion subsides, you see a truck unload US troops. They see you sitting among the rubble of the building. Wrong move, jarheads. You said. You stand up and walk menacingly towards them. They quickly hop back in the truck, but you grab the bumper before it could drive away. You toss the truck into s building. Jerks. You said before looking for a new shelter. As the cold night comes in, you find a small building with power and heat. I\u2019ll ride out the blizzard here. You said. You get settled in for the blizzard. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you wake up the next day, you look out the window and see the blizzard has arrived. That wind sounds violent. Nothing to do but hunker down. You said. As you sit there waiting hours on end, you receive a message through your phone. \u201cReturn to base. Evac is on route.\u201d It said. Seems like the japs aren\u2019t going to let me freeze out here. You said. After waiting 15 minutes, you see a Japanese transport outside. You head out and are about to step in when the vehicle explodes. You are blown back into the snow. After laying there for a few minutes of lying in the snow, you get up and see a helicopter with a searchlight fly in the air. The searchlight shines right on you as you. Damnit! You said. After shining its light on you for a few seconds, you see multiple red dots on you. Lasers. Coming from multiple areas. You said. The rings appear in your eyes and you jump onto the chopper. You break the window and toss out the pilot. The chopper spins out of control and crash into the ground. The kicked up snow and smoke gives you the perfect cover to run and hide behind a truck. You take a peek and see four US soldiers with night vision googles on. You crouch down and sneak behind them. You grab the last guy, snap his neck, take his gun, and shoot the other three before they could break for cover. *Sigh* More lives on my conscious. You said. Then the gun is knocked out of your hands by a bullet. No sound. Suppressed sniper rifle. You said. As you take cover, you look for the sniper. Can\u2019t see him in this snow. Visibility is poor. You said. You duck down when you hear the bullet ricochet out the car you\u2019re hiding behind. Can\u2019t work in this weather. Time to go. You said. As you\u2019re about to go, you grab the person behind you by the throat. Ack! It\u2019s me, EX! Cynthia said. You wanted to let her go, but the chip in your skull is forcing you to tighten your hold. EX\u2026\u2026It\u2019s me\u2026\u2026 Cynthia said. Can\u2019t\u2026..fight it! You said. You said. Just before you break cynthia\u2019s neck, the chip in your head shut down. ( I\u2019m free.) You thought. You quickly let go of Cynthia and she gasps for air. Then you hear booming footsteps. Acting quickly, you run into the dense fog of the blizzard. Cynth. You ok? John said. Yeah\u2026. I\u2019ll be fine. She said. Come on. We\u2019ll be frozen solid if we stay out here. John said. So close.... Cynthia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch from the atop a roof as a chopper comes in and takes away Cynthia. I\u2019m no longer bound. I need to follow that helo. You said. You jump down and run in the direction of the chopper went. As you follow the chopper, you come across a US base. Looks to be a HQ. Lots of foot traffic. I\u2019m going in. You said. You walk up to the checkpoint and toss the guard through the gate and take his gun. The sudden noise attracts other guards and an alarm blares out. You are quickly surrounded by armed soldiers. You hold the gun up and shoot all the bullets into the snow until you hear a click. After that, you toss it to the ground and place both of your hands together like you were handcuffed. You are quickly cuffed and lead inside a room that was your makeshift cell. You easily break the handcuffs and pace back and forth. As you pace, you can hear arguing just outside the door. Seems like cynthia\u2019s giving it to the guard. You said. You stop pacing and look out the window. The second this blizzard\u2019s over, they\u2019ll be back. You said. You sit down and wait. You stay locked up for the rest of the blizzard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 days later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the sun rise. Crack of dawn. Blizzard\u2019s come and gone. Where are they? You said. You hear the door open and see chijinda. Chijinda? You said. The one and only. He said. I thought\u2026.. You said. Please. It\u2019ll take more than the Japanese army, giant girls, and a blizzard to do me in. He said. Wait. You look different. You said. How so? He said. You look and feel the same way I did when i\u2026\u2026 You didn\u2019t. You said. That\u2019s right. I went under the knife and now i have cybernetics. He said. I thought we were going to talk about it first. You said. We did. Me and narue did. He said. Narue? Is she here? You said. Yeah. And worried sick. She said she wasn\u2019t going to stop destroying them until you\u2019re safe and sound. She said. Well she can stop. Where is she? You said. Just outside the base. She didn\u2019t want cause a scene. She said. You hurry outside and go to narue. I forgot how big she was. Narue! You shout up. Narue looks down at you with a shocked look. Narue quickly, but gently picks you up. She hugs you tightly. N\u2026.Narue. Can\u2019t\u2026..breath. You said. Oh. Sorry! She said. Narue lets go of you. I\u2019m just happy to see you alive and well! She said. I wouldn\u2019t say well\u2026.. You said. Did they hurt you?! Just say so and I\u2019ll deal with all of them! She said. Damn. What happened to that nice girl I knew? You said. She left when the Japanese stole you from me and did experiments on you. She said. Well, no need to turn into Mia. I\u2019m fine. Just leave the killing to me. You said. Just then, you hear loud footsteps. Oh no. You said. They aren\u2019t wasting anytime. Narue said. As you ready yourself, you feel a surging pain in your skull. Narue sees you in excruciating pain. Hey. What\u2019s wrong?! She said. G\u2026\u2026Get away from me!! You said. You jump down from narue\u2019s hand and fire a flare into the air and run off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep going until you get to the Japanese central command. You approach the general and he tells everyone to leave the tent. The use of these giant girls have accelerated so much of our progress. Plus, with the cybernetics we have, we\u2019re ready to see a few of our own in action. He said. You both hear a chopper. Here they come. He said. You both step outside and when the chopper lands, you see a few familiar faces. (The queens?! Augmented with cybernetics?!) You thought. You stare them down and they do the same to you. Our\u2026..friends here have volunteered to undergo the process. Now all we need is find out who makes this. He said as he holds a vial of the stuff you and chijinda use. (Simon.) You thought. Fighting the control, you take the vial and head off to Simon. The queens were ready to chase you, but the general stops them. No! He\u2019ll lead us to him. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to simon\u2019s building. You kick open the door and head to simon\u2019s office. Simon. You said. Well. Look who\u2019s here. \u2026\u2026.Have they found out? He said. Yes. They are coming for you. They want your formula. You said. I knew this day was coming. Good thing I\u2019m prepared. He said. Simon pulls out two syringes. The last two. He said. You take them. Here. Take this. He said. Simon hands you a vile with a blue liquid in it. That is a new compound I made with the combination of mine and the other formula. It\u2019s very potent, but dangerous. It will push your body to its limits. I say only use it when absolutely necessary. He said. Simon\u2026.. You said. Don\u2019t get all sentimental on me. I\u2019ve been waiting for this. Now go. He said. Reluctantly, you leave through the window. A few seconds later, trucks pull up and unload troops and they rush inside. Hello gentlemen. You need warrant to be on the premise. So allow me to show you the door. Simon said. Explosions ring out through the entire building and soon it collapse in on itself.</span></div></div>",

As you watch, chijinda jumps onto the roof you\u2019re on. So. The crazy bastards done it. He said. \u2026\u2026Yes. You said. Does it hurt? He said. You look at him with a confused look. The chip in your head. You\u2019re fighting it. He said. \u2026\u2026Like crazy. You said. Hold still. He said. Chijinda pulls out a tazer and shocks. The ten thousand volts course through you and fries the chip in your skull. Fee better? He said. Yeah. A heads up would be good next time. You said. Yeah. Next time. Chijinda said. Then a drone flies in front of you and chijinda. You both look at the video the drone shows you. Wait. It\u2019s that MIku?! Chijinda said. It is. Augmented. And so are the queens. You said. Like being regular wasn\u2019t bad enough. Chijinda said. Looks like they want to fight us both. On top of the school building. You said. The place where all this stared. He said. It stared there, it\u2019ll end there. You said. Well lets. He said. With chijinda\u2019s back turn, you knock him unconscious. Sorry chijinda. But this is my fight. If I don\u2019t come back, you know what happened. You said. You head to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get there and jump onto the school\u2019s roof. Miku. You said. She turns around when you called her. It feels like an eternity since I last been here. Remember it? She said. I\u2019ll never forget. You and your twisted work. You said. It can\u2019t be helped. We are two different people. Two different ideologies we believe in. She said. Mine doesn\u2019t involve shrinking people. You said. And yet here we are. In the middle of a war between our two countries. Here to determined which one will stand. She said. You both look to see a news chopper has flown in. What are they doing here? You said. Filming this. Miku said. What? You said. All over the world, they are watching us. To see who comes out on top. America or Japan. The world has already seen the rampaging giant girls. Now they will see two cybernetic people clash. She said. Fine by me. I\u2019ll beat you in front of the world. And they\u2019ll see your way\u2019s the wrong way. You said. (I can\u2019t lose here. I just can\u2019t! To stop this war, I\u2019ll beat her!) You thought. Camera\u2019s live. Let\u2019s start the show. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the US base. <br>\r\nCynthia opens the door. Ex. Are you here? She said. She sees you\u2019re not in there. Ex? She said. Cynthia. John said. John. Have you seen Ex? She said. Come with me. He said. John takes Cynthia to where a group of soldiers and bowman are watching the tv with you on it. Ex?! What\u2019s he doing?! Apparently, he\u2019s fighting the head of the society he told us about. Bowman said. We have to help him! It\u2019s obviously a trap! She said. I already asked. All the choppers are gone. John said. So we can do nothing?! Cynthia said. Yeah. All we can do is put our trust in him. Bowman said. Ex. Cynthia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both rush at each other and lock hands. Miku\u2019s strength was incredible, but you push pass her and slam her into the ground. Miku simply gets up and dust off. Not bad. For a brute. She said. Miku comes at you fast. You block her punch. (The force behind it. I didn\u2019t know she had that much strength.) You thought. You block another punch and elbow her in the face and kick her in the face. Very good. Very good indeed. She said. I haven\u2019t even started yet. You said. Well, let me help you. She said. You look behind you to see she\u2019s about to kick you. You duck down uppercut her in the chin. The force of it makes her land on her back. Yeah! That\u2019s how it\u2019s done! One of the soldier\u2019s shouts. Miku gets up without even reacting to your hit. I expected nothing less. A hit like that makes me wonder how it would have been if I fought you in the first place instead of chijinda. She said. Results would still be the same. You said. Let\u2019s see. She said. You both go at each other again. Exchanging punches and kicks. (She\u2019s trying to outmaneuver me. She\u2019s hoping that her speed will overwhelm me. But it won\u2019t work!) You thought. You manage to keep up with her as her attacks get faster and faster. Then you catch one of her kick and slam her into the ground. You pounce on her and start beating her. Give it to her! That\u2019s it! A soldier said. You get in a few punches before she grabs your both of your fist and stands up. She powers you up and slams you into the ground. You roll over before she could punch you and you tackle her into the railing. You punch hit in the gut and the face a few times before she shoves you onto the railing and do the same. You move out of the way of one of her punches and kick her right in the head. She stumbles, but moves out of the way of you going for a tackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to admit. I\u2019m impressed. You are just as good as they say you are. She said. I aim to please. You said. Well I am pleased. Very pleased. But it\u2019s time for round two. She said. Two? You said. You remember how we originally fought? She said. Yeah. You were a towering bitch. You said. Well. How about a repeat? She said. She jumps off the ground and when you go to look over, she shoots back up to the size you fought her at last time. Holy\u2026.. You said. The chopper only was up to knees. Jesus! She\u2019s gigantic! A soldier said. Come on! You still got this! John said. Just like last time. She said. (It is just like last time, but under different circumstances!) You thought. The yellow and black rings form in your eyes. Come on! You said. Miku slams her fist onto the school. You jump onto her fist and run up her arm. She tries to grab you, but you jump and punch her hard in the face. With your omega mode still active and the cybernetics increasing your strength times miku\u2019s height, you were able to make her take a step back. You land on the building. Hmmm. Not a bad hit. For a shrimp. She said. She slams her fist right on top of you. Pushed to one knee, you push her fist back. Nice display of strength. Let\u2019s see you do it again. She said. She does it again, but with more force. You almost fall on both knees, but you shove her fist aside. Nice, but\u2026..She said. Realizing too late, her hand grabs you tightly and she brings you to eye level. Now. Let\u2019s see how much pressure it takes for your head to pop off. She said. Miku\u2019s grip increases. You bit your tongue so you don\u2019t shout in pain. Is there no other mode of transportation?! Cynthia said. Not until resupply gets here and that\u2019s hours out. A soldier said. Damnit! Is there nothing we can do?! Cynthia said. Nothing but hope. Bowman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel the pressure of her hold start to break a bone. You try to break free, but can\u2019t. Admit defeat and maybe I\u2019ll spare you. She said. That\u2019s my line! You said. (No choice!) You thought. You feel the serum course through your body. You power free, jump and punch miku square in the four head. The sudden impact of your hit knocks her off her feet. She hits the ground with an earthshaking thud. You land on the ground as miku starts to shrink back down. Yeah! That\u2019s the way! A soldier shouts. You check the vile and see it\u2019s empty. You take it out and put in the one simon gave you. Ok. Time to do what I should have done the first time. You said. You walk towards her with a slight limp and grab her. I should have done this from the start. You said. Your right\u2026\u2026 So should i. She said. What are getting at? You said. I mean I should have ordered your demise. She said. You see a whip wrap around your left wrist and sent towards a shield that swings right into you. The impact sends you into the building. That damn combo can only be by two fuckers I really hate. You said as you get up. Reina. Kanon. So nice of you both to join. Miku said. You and your croons. Never change. You said. Kanon\u2019s whip wraps around your arm and you pull her towards you and punch her in the face. And never learn. You said. Reina comes at you with her lance and you move out the way. Reina goes straight through the wall of the school. You were always a hothead. You said. You grab Reina\u2019s lance as she charges at you. You toss her back through the wall and throw the spear at her. So barbaric. No grace or elegance. Miku said. This is a fight. Not a dance. You said. Let\u2019s see about that. She said. You hear a gauntlet gun start to spin. Oh no. You said. You run as the bullets zip past you. You stop when Lady Masquerade jumps out of nowhere and start slashing. Dodging her sword, you manage to grab her sword. (She\u2019s stronger than last time. The force she\u2019s exerting is tremendous.) You thought. You manage to push her away into Mizuki. Never could touch me, Masquerade. And never will. You said. Taking on the queens is not an easy feat. I am impressed. Miku said. This isn\u2019t the first time. You said. Usually the first time is the last time for anyone. I want to see what kept you alive all those time. You see Kanon, Mizuki, and Masquerade get up and surround you from front, left and right, and Reina from behind. Show me how you stayed alived for so long. Miku said.<br>\r\nThat\u2019s it! I\u2019m going down there! Cynthia said. There\u2019s no vehicle or bird available. We\u2019d have to walk there and that\u2019d take forever. John said. We\u2019re not walking. Cynthia said. Then how? Bowman said. Narue. As a giant, she\u2019ll cover a lot more distance. She said. Cynthia, bowman, and John head over to Narue. What do you three want? The last thing I need is you three today. Narue said. Narue! Ex is in trouble. He\u2019s fighting Miku and her lackeys by himself right now! Cynthia said. What?! Narue said. No time for that. We need to get to the school right now! Cynthia said. Narue picks up all three of them and heads towards the school.</span></div></div>",

Before it hit you, you grab Renia\u2019s lance and toss her aside. When Kanon\u2019s whip wraps around your arm, you pull her to you and toss her back into Kizuho before she spins up that gauntlet gun. To take on the queens and make light work of it. Just when I think you couldn\u2019t surpass my expectations. Miku said. Must be do something right. You said. Must be. I can\u2019t help but think\u2026.. How much would we achieve with someone with your talent? We could achieve our goals and more. She said. Good thing I didn\u2019t met you first. I don\u2019t want anything to do with your kind. You said. As the queens reassemble and surround you again, Miku calls them off. Ladies. Back off. This is between me and him. She said. Reluctant, but honoring her wish, the queens stand aside. Come. Let\u2019s pick up where we left off. She said. (Even though I haven\u2019t taken serious damage, I\u2019m starting to slow down. But I can\u2019t let them pick up on it.) Let\u2019s. You said. As you and miku lock horns again, you both hear a jet fly over and take out the copter. What the?! You said. As pieces of the chopper rain down, you are surrounded by Japanese soldiers. Fuck\u2026.You said. Before you could do anything, you hear gunfire from the building. Whoever is shooting is killing the Japanese soldiers. Hey! Get in here! You said. Keeping your head covered, you run into the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close and lock the door behind you. Hurry! Follow me. A person said. You follow the person to where the shooting is happening. You guys are Section agents. You said. Yeah. Just like you. Except no cybernetics. A guy said. We\u2019ve been watching the whole time. That is until those japs showed up. Another guy said. So how long have you guys been here? You said. Ever since those bastards invaded. Even though this school was shut down since the incident, it\u2019s been nice to us. He said. But not to me. Been trying to forget this place. You said. We\u2019ve all heard the news about this place. Shrinking, giant schoolgirls and all that. Derek. Are we good? He said. Yeah, but those five bitches got in here. They\u2019re going to hunt us down. We have to become scarce, James. Derek said. There\u2019s a back and side entrance to the school. Sort of a friends and family kind. You said. Wouldn\u2019t you need some kind of key? Derek said. I am a key. I can open any door. We need to move now. They\u2019ll find us if we stay here. You said. With Derek and James in tow, you head for one of the exit\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bet this was once a great school. James said. You three come across the door. Ok. Let\u2019s see. You said. As you hack the door, you are force to the ground to avoid bullets. Shit. They found us already?! James said. Ok. Plan b. You said. You kick hard and the door comes off the hinges. Come on! You said. You fire off a flare in the air. You three find cover as more bullets fly pass. That green haired girl has us pinned! Derek said. Get her attention! You said. Derek and James both fire at her and she hides behind a tree until the chopper lands. Go! You said. Before you three could jump over, bullets fly over head. Damn! Can\u2019t move! James said. The hell with that! You\u2019ll have a window! You said. You jump out of your cover and block your face as bullets rip through you. You shove Mizuki into the wall. Go! You said. Derek and James get into the chopper and it takes off. As for you-Ack!! You said. You see a sword pierce through your stomach. You turn around and Masque slashes you across your chest. You try to get up, but the pain is too great. You then try to use the stim, but it is taken off by Miku. N\u2026.No\u2026\u2026.D\u2026..Damn\u2026..You said. You keep your eyes open long enough to see another news chopper fly over you with a spotlight. A new order approaches\u2026.. Miku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarue and co arrive at the scene and see your body. EX!!!! Cynthia said as she runs over to your body. Wake up!! WAKE UP!!! PLEASE!!! She said. Cynth\u2026..he\u2019s gone. If the bullets didn\u2019t kill him, the deep cuts did. John said. I\u2026.is\u2026.is he\u2026\u2026. He ca\u2026..he can\u2019t be\u2026..! Narue stammers. He\u2019s\u2026\u2026dead. Cynthia said. The ground shakes as narue collapse on the ground in tears. Cynthia\u2019s grief quickly turns to anger. They\u2019ll pay\u2026.. Every last one of them!!!! She said. Cynthia\u2026..it\u2019s over. Jacob said. Nothing\u2019s over till I say it\u2019s over!! She said. No\u2026.. I mean the fight. With Ex dead, we lost our only cybernetic soldier. And with the a legion of giant girls on call, The US has surrounded. He said. This\u2026.has to be a nightmare. John said. Wish I could say so. All armed personnel are to stand down. Effective immediately. May God have mercy on us all. Jacob said. <br>\r\n5 minutes later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChijinda slowly regains conscious. Shit. He hit me hard. Always rushing ahead. He\u2019s going to get killed one day. Chijinda heads to the school, but sees no one is there. Where is she? Wait. How long was I out for? He said. Chijinda quickly heads back to base. When he gets there, he finds Cynthia and the others. Guys. What\u2019s with the long expressions? Chijinda said. Who tells him? Bowman said. Tell me what? Chijinda said. Ex.... He\u2019s\u2026.. He\u2019s\u2026.. John said. He\u2019s what? Chijinda said. He\u2019s\u2026.. I can\u2019t. John said. What happened? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s dead. Chijinda said. There\u2019s a long silence. No. No! He can\u2019t be dead! There\u2019s no way! He\u2019d never die to her! Chijinda said. It wasn\u2019t just her. Her thugs were with her. His body had bullet holes and two sword punctures. Cynthia said. No\u2026.. NOOOOOOOOO! Chijinda shouts as he punches a giant hole in the wall. So\u2026.. What now? Chijinda said. Nothing. The US has surrendered. John said. Jesus\u2026..

The voice is feminine and soothing. You open your eyes and see darkness all around. Who\u2026. Who\u2019s there? God? You said. No. But I\u2019ve been called that. The voice said. Who\u2026.are you? You said. You should remember warrior. You and I are enemies. The voice said. You see the raven haired woman appear in front of you. You\u2026.. You said. Yes. Me. She said. Why\u2026\u2026 You said. I can\u2019t have you dying. Not yet. She said. Oh. That\u2019s why. So you\u2019re here to resurrect me. So I can be you follower or something? You humans have a saying. \u201cIf anyone kills you, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d She said. Wait. You\u2019re saving me so you can kill me? You said. Yes. You beat me. A descendant of the titans. I can\u2019t have that. Plus, I promise that it\u2019d be my hand you are either dead or enslaved by. She said. Well, someone beat you to it. You said. And I can\u2019t have that. Which is why\u2026..She said. You feel a sudden power overflowing in you. Whoa! What\u2019s this?! You said. I\u2019ve bestowed upon you my power. She said. Like what? You said. Power like no other, speed faster than lightning, the power to strike down those who oppose you. Everything I\u2019ve used against you. She said. Even the growing like you? You said. Yes. Try it. She said as she grows to a towering height. I forgot how big she was\u2026.. Ok. You said. You concentrate and you shoot up to eye level with her. Whoa. This will level the field. You said. It better. So I can kill you in said field. But first\u2026.. She said. She heals your body completely. I\u2019ll be watching you. Now go! She said. Then there\u2019s a bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, your eyes shoot open. What\u2019s this cramp place? You said. You force open the small door and crawl out. A morgue?! Oh yeah. Dead. How much has changed? You said. You walk out of the morgue and out into the city. Whoa! What\u2019s with all of the Japanese flags?! Has the US been taken over?! I thought we\u2019d fight to the bitter end. You said. You walk the streets. Wow. The Japs took over like it was nobody\u2019s business. You said. You continue to walk when you see a civilian being harassed by a soldier. You walk up behind him and knock him out. You ok, sir? You said. I\u2026 think so. Thanks. Ever since they took over, they\u2019ve making life for American\u2019s difficult. He said. How long has it been? You said. A year or two. The Japs took over everything. Any who resisted where brutally put down. He said. Jeez. I didn\u2019t think it was this bad. You said. There are those who are fighting back. They\u2019ve made some progress, but it\u2019s a losing fight for them. He said. Where can I find them? You said. Nobody knows. They are there, then gone. He said. Ok. Thanks sir. You said. You take the Japs weapon and load it and head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to the base where you were arrested at. Shit. Crawling with them. But with this power, I can take them. You said. You shoot the guard and the base goes into alert. With deadly aim, gun them down and with the power you have, you send lightning down on groups of them until the base is cleared. All clear. If there is a resistance, best to let them know. You find an American flag on in the supply closet. You head to the flag pole on the roof, take down the Japanese flag and put up the American flag. U.S fucking A. You said. You leave the base and become scarce. You find a abandoned apartment and set up there. This will do. You said. You look out the window. A lot of work to do. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the populated street. Looks like martial law\u2019s in effect. Checkpoints, searches, seizers. They are giving it hard. You said. As you are in line for a checkpoint, you hear an explosion. That can\u2019t be good. You said. As people run and bullets are fired, you see the resistance fighters you were told about. Rugged, untrained, inexperience, no discipline. They are rebels. You said as you watch. When it all stops, you walk off. That was like boot camp. No way those could be section. Too sloppy. You said. You come across a message scrawled on the wall. \u201cIf you resist, we\u2019ll find you.\u201d It said. If that\u2019s the resistance way of recruiting, they need a new HR manager. You said. You keep walking until you hear a distance explosion. No stealth like, are they? You said. You keep going until you stop in front of a big building with lots of guards. This is my target. With the japs taken over, they should the list of section agents. You said. You take one step and you\u2019re past all the guards. I think I might keep these powers. You said as you enter the building. You make your way to the top of the building and into the top office room. There\u2019s the computer. You said. You hack the computer to find the files, but they are gone. The files aren\u2019t here. You said. The door opens and you grab the person who enters. Wait, Tsao? You said as you drop him. Yes, me. He said. So you\u2019re the head here? You said. Like I had a choice. All I wanted was to go home to my family. I didn\u2019t even want to be in command of the invasion of America. How could our plan fail so miserably? He said as he looks out the window. Don\u2019t blame yourself, Tsao. It was my fault. I lost to miku and now this. You said. You must be a sore loser to come back. He said. You can say that. I freedom fighters on the way here. They aren\u2019t taking this occupation lightly. You said. I wouldn\u2019t blame them. The files I have on your fellow agents was given to someone else. He said. Who? That list of agents wouldn\u2019t do any good to anyone. You said. Unless you\u2019re out for the bounty we have on them? He said. Bounty?! You said. Yes. Not my idea. I wanted to extend an olive branch to all enemy combatants, but idiots in high command said we need to wipe out all potential oppositions. So as incentive for any kill or captured agents, a high bounty is placed on them. He said. Tsao. Where are these people? You said. Out north. Look for something out of place. He said before you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head north and look. What would be out of place in this destroyed lot. You said. You look until you move a board out the way and find a steel door. You kick the door down and you walk into a huge compartment. A hideout? In a destroyed lot. That would be out of place. You said. As you explore the hideout, you find a computer. Here. You said. You hack into the computer. As you hack, the whole room starts blaring. Shit! You said. You hack quickly and find the files. Ok. Half of the agents are either dead or MIA. I just need to find three. You said. You scroll until you find their names. Ok. John\u2019s alive. Bowman\u2019s alive. Wait. Cynthia\u2019s MIA. Cynthia wouldn\u2019t just up and leave. Not when things are like this. You said. You continue to search, but the results are the same. Damn. I can\u2019t stick around any longer. You said. You run out of the hideout and back into the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia. MIA? It\u2019s better than KIA, but still. Where could she be? I could track her, but I\u2019d need to know the last place she\u2019s been. You said. You look around you. No. Better idea. If a can get a rumor about me circulating, she\u2019d have to show herself. If she knew I was alive, she\u2019d come running. You said. </span></div></div>",

Everywhere you went, you sprayed an eagle symbol. News about this spread and people started to revolt. I don\u2019t know what you did, but it worked well. Tsao said. I just gave them something to believe in. Hopefully, this occupation will be over soon. You said.   Just then, the door is kicked open and three people rush in. What is the meaning of this?! Tsao said. (Wait. I\u2019ve seen these three before.) You thought. You pulled out your gun. General. Remember when I said that list was of no use to anyone? You said. Yes? He said. Not unless you\u2019re Section agents. You said. Section?! He said. So you\u2019re one of us? Then there\u2019s no need to play dumb then. The leader said. Playing? I thought you were dumb ever since the you three pointed those same guns at me last time. You said. Last time? Wait. It\u2019s him! The detective turned cybernetic soldier. One said. And you goons went from Section agents to asskissing traitors. Who\u2019s boot taste better? You said. Are there more of these agents? Tsao said. A lot. We\u2019re a last resort. At least some of us are. You said. Don\u2019t go getting an ego just because you have cybernetics. He said. And I\u2019ll use these cybernetics of mine to remind you what happens to traitors who hunt their own. You said. Our own? What do you mean. One said. The list of agents I found. It had the names of all the agents. You said. List of agents? So there are others who are still alive. The leader said. So you are hunting agents! You said. No! We might not see eye to eye with the others, but killing our own is out of the question. You were the only exception. He said. So if you\u2019re not the bounty hunters then that would mean\u2026.. Get down! You said as you tackle Tsao and a bullet comes through the window. Shit! They\u2019re here! We have to go! The leader said. Him and the other two leave. Who fired that? Tsao said. It was all a trap! There were never any bounty hunters to begin with. It was something they just told you. They knew you\u2019d betray them eventually and they waited until then! You said. So i walked into a trap? He said. Yes. We have to get out of here before this place is flooded with troops. You said. You escort Tsao out of the building and into the populated streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should have seen it. I knew there was no bounty hunters, but I just wanted to go home so badly. I\u2019m a failure. He said. Calm down, Tsao. You\u2019re just a man who wanted no part of this. You said. Where am I to go now? I can\u2019t go back. I\u2019ll be shoot. He said. Then that only leads one place. You said as you point to one of the propaganda signs. The resistance\u2026.. He said. No body better than the leading general of the invasion to join the cause, right? You said. But\u2026\u2026 You think they\u2019ll even listen to me? He said. They\u2019d have to. You know all the patrols, the bases, and when those giants will come into play. You\u2019re more valuable to them alive than dead. You said. I suppose so. I just hope they find me. He said. Seems like they are. Look. You said. You point out two resistance soldiers blending in with the crowd. We\u2019ll meet again, Tsao. You said as you disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days go by, you hear about spikes of resistance all over the U.S. Seems like with Tsao, the resistance is hitting key places. Less work for me, but there is one thing I need to find before them. You said. You head out to where the facility where Tsao told you that had the formula. Simon never wanted this to fall into the wrong hands. I\u2019ll make sure the formula is deleted. You said. You go up to the two guards and knock them out and head inside. Ok. Where would I keep a regenerative formula? All the way in the back. You said. You make your way their until you come across an observation room with dead bodies on tables. Seems like the dose they had was too powerful. Pushed their bodies past what they could take. You said. You keep going until you come across the lab that had the formula in it. Ok. Now to get rid of it, but first. You said. Using your knowledge of what Simon showed you about the formula, you make two serums and a stim. Ok. Now I just need to make an injector. You said. Using the parts around you, you make an injector and attach the stim in. Ok. Now to get rid of the formula. Japs won\u2019t being using this. You said. Before you could destroy it all, you hear a noise. What the\u2026.? You said. You are hit with the butt of a gun. You stumble, but keep your balance and knock the person over. You kick his gun aside and punch him in the face for a few seconds until you see three set of guns being pointed at you. Up. Now! One of them said. You get off the man with your hands up. You see that they are resistance fighters. (Must be here for the same reason I am.) You thought. Daniel. Watch him while we get this. The man in a black sweater said. Got it. He said. (Good thing I was able to alter the formula. As it is now, it\u2019ll break down before it can do anything.) You thought. Ok. We have it. The man said. And him? Another said. I\u2019ll just show myself out. Good luck with\u2026.whatever you are planning. You said before disappearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear in the abandon building. That should keep the formula from them for a while. You said. As the days go by, you can tell the japs are stepping up their game. You saw them bring in a group of their rampaging giantesses. The resistance is in for a hard time. You said. As you watched the tv, you heard something about a new type of soldier. Augmented soldiers? Must be done playing around. You said. You leave the building and head out.  As you cut across a rural area, you hear gunfire. Sounds close by. You said. You head towards the gunshots and see freedom fighters in a struggle against jap soldiers. Hmm. Something seems\u2026..off about those soldiers. They move very fast and attack hand to hand over using a weapon. The tallow rings form in your eyes. A\u2026Androids? So that\u2019s why they look human like. Seems like the japs decided to go a step further than cybernetics and went full on robotic. I wonder if this is the augmented soldiers they spoke of. You said. You watch as the four androids back the fighters against the wall. You jump out the window and run at them. You tackle one of them and force them through the wall. You block two punches and grab both arms and slam them both into the ground. The last one runs at you quickly. You take one step and punch straight through him, leaving a hole in his chest as he collapse. As you look at the body, the other three surround you. Right here, you metallic jerks. You said.  \u2026\u2026Return to HQ. One of them said. All three of them leave quickly. Better run\u2026. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the down android. Outfitted with the latest tech, but still retaining your humanity.  Stick fucks. You said. You stand up when you\u2019re done and walk off. You stop when you get back to the occupied urban area. That should draw her out. You said. You feel something jam to the back of your head. Don\u2019t move\u2026.. The voice said. You roll your eyes and punch the person and take his gun. When you get a good look at him, you can tell he\u2019s former Section. Drop it. Now. Another voice said. You toss the gun away and hold your hands up. We have him\u2026.. The man said.</span></div></div>",

You are navigated into a room and told to take a seat. You can feel your hands being bind and then the sound of a door close. You wait for hours until you hear them open again. Ex\u2026. A voice said. You know that voice. The blindfold is removed and you see Jacob. Back from the dead so soon? He said. You nod. Quit playing. I know you got your binds free hours ago. He said. Heh\u2026. You said. This isn\u2019t the way I picture happening. Jacob said. You stand up as Jacob sits down. Hang on. He said. Jacob presses a button on his watch. Ok. 2 minutes of freedom. You know they were watching. So you didn\u2019t say anything. He said. \u2026\u2026Still Jacob. You said. You\u2019re not dumb. You could tell I\u2019m working with them. And you know who they are. At least a few of them. He said. Former section agents\u2026.. You said. Bingo. And I know that you\u2019ve been mapping out a way out of here as we\u2019ve been speaking. He said. And? You said. And I can\u2019t let you. Even with our history. He said. \u2026\u2026.Very well. You said. You go to Jacob and hand him one of your syringes. Good luck to you too. Jacob said as he leaves. Lock down this area. Tighter than Fort Knox. Jacob said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit there waiting, you see the few former agents. You recognize them as they recognize you. The hours go by and you see the door open. Well, what have we here? A voice said. You look up to see the c rank girl. And here I thought you were hiding. She said. She forces you up. You should have stayed dead! She said. \u2026\u2026Fuck you. You said. Still defiant. Even when the world around you has change. I\u2019ll tell you just like I told that perv chijinda. The US would be our stomping grounds. She said. You grab her and force her against the wall. Where is he\u2026..? You said. You think\u2026..i keep track of that slimeball? She said. Where?! You said. I don\u2019t know. Dead, maybe? She said. You throw her across the room. You obviously don\u2019t know how things work now. She said as she gets up. We run things now. Those goons out there, those section agents, work for us now. Everything you\u2019ve have is ours now. Everything. She said. \u2026\u2026.You\u2019d like to think that. I don\u2019t quit. I\u2019ll deal with those turncoats later. After I turn things around. You said. You really think you can? What will be different this time than last?! From where I stand, you\u2019re all alone. No friends, no agents, and no giant girl. So enlighten me. She said. I\u2019m never alone\u2026.. You said as she\u2019s knocked out by Jacob. What took so long? You said. Did some harsh soul searching. I took an oath. He said as he hands you back your syringe. And what will you do? You said. Start making things right. I\u2019ve found everyone for you. They\u2019re all alive and well, with the resistance. He said. Then I know where to do next. You said as you walk outside and fire off a black flare. They know now. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down a rural road and see a graffiti image of an eagle. No better freedom symbol. You said. As you admire the image, you get the feeling someone\u2019s behind you. Don\u2019t move\u2026.. The voice said. \u2026\u2026Not good for your heath\u2026\u2026Johnson. You said. You elbow him in the face, kick his leg out from under him and take his gun. Nice try\u2026. You said. You know. The fact that you know my name is scary. He said. I know. Still leading that so called team of yours? You said. Yeah. It\u2019s you.  He said. How\u2019d you go from ghost to babysitter? I guess it all happened since your supposed death. Score to settle? He said. Death can\u2019t hold someone with a purpose. You said. Your purpose must be good. I hope. He said. I\u2019d expect that level of mistrust from that asshat, but you, Johnson? You said. You knocked out one of mine, nearly killed a squad, and gave us a fake formula. So forgive me if I don\u2019t extend an olive branch. He said. If those people actually acted like soldiers, they wouldn\u2019t be out on their asses. Speaking of asses, where are yours? You said. Come out team. He knows. Johnson said. You sure this\u2026..thing is ok? Horace said. I have a name, jackass. I prefer to be called by it. You said. Thing? More like abomination. Dan said. Save your technophobia for someone who cares.  You said. I don\u2019t have a problem with tech, but when tech and man combine, that\u2019s when I have a problem. He said. Still bitching about my cybernetics? Get over it. Where\u2019s the other? You said. Bedridden. Got brave last time, took a bad bullet. Johnson said. And that\u2019s just him. Dan said. \u201cJust him\u201d? How many are you babysitting now? You said. Six. He said. Oh jeez. Old man, technophobe, jackass, and babyface. Now recruiting. You joke.  Ha ha. Don\u2019t think those cybernetics make you untouchable. Horace said. I died already. What more can happen now? You said. Worse things than death. Dan said. Yeah. Like a giant girl stomping around is worse than that. If we\u2019re done here, I have some things to take care of. You said. Wish I could let you go, but I can\u2019t. Johnson said. Why not? You said. We got orders to capture you. He said. Really Johnson? You forgot what I do. On who\u2019s authority are you acting on? You said. I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s your business. Dan said. Let me sum this up so you understand. There\u2019s fire, there\u2019s brimstone, and there\u2019s me. Death by giantess is quick. Death by cybernetic soldier is slow. You might be grown men, but you\u2019ll be crying for your mom and dad and God to save you from the hell I bring if you cross me. And you three know I can deliver said hell. So. I ask again, Who\u2019s authority? You said. \u2026\u2026The resistance. Johnson. All you had to say from the get go. You said. Don\u2019t think we\u2019re escorting your ass. Dan said. I don\u2019t need an escort. I found out where you jokers where ever since Tsao came along. You said. Wait. You sent him to us? Horace said. You didn\u2019t think he showed up on a whim, did you? You said. Thinks he\u2019s hot shit. Dan said. I am. Can do your job and mine. You said. Enough banter. Shall we? Johnson said. Let\u2019s. I could use a change of scenery. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are lead to a subway. A subway. No better place. You said. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers. Johnson said. You sure about this? Bringing this\u2026.. Say it and I\u2019ll show you your insides. You interrupt. Save it, Dan. Not worth the headache.  Johnson said. They lead you down into the metro where you see fighters, civilians, and medics working on injured. You weren\u2019t lying about the injured. More wounded than beds. You said. Why do you think we needed that green shit in the first place? Dan said. They lead you to central. Cynthia. You here? Johnson said.  (Cynthia? She leads this band?) You thought. You see Cynthia in black and blue survival gear. Not trouble, but he has a mouth on him. Horace said. Leave us. You did good. She said. As they leave, Cynthia walks up to you. So you lead this group. You said. She slaps you. I guess a new form of hello. You said. That\u2019s for dying right in front of me. She said. Then she hugs you tenderly with tears in her eyes. And this is for not staying dead. She said. I guess i gave you a scare. You said. Do you have any idea? Couldn\u2019t eat, couldn\u2019t sleep\u2026. I think my hair started to fall out. She said. Speaking of couldn\u2019t, where is he? You said. He hasn\u2019t been the same ever since. You said he was a perv. After finding out about you being dead, all that seem to stop. Barley talks, no jokes. Like he\u2019s been taken and replaced. She said. He\u2019ll be back to normal. Just let me see him. You said. He\u2019s down there. Door on the left. She said. You head down the way you were pointed and knock on the door. \u2026..Go away. He said. You continue to knock. You hear the locks open and the door swings open. Hey, Chijinda. You said. You\u2026 Stay back. He said. He grabs you arm and let\u2019s go. Any more? You said. I\u2026.. When\u2026.. But\u2026. He said. Breath first. You\u2019re not one to panic. You said. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m seeing a ghost or the real thing. He said. I haven\u2019t possessed you, so I must be alive. You said. \u2026..Where the fuck have you been? He said. In hiding. When I heard of you not being a perv, I had to come out of hiding. You said. All that went out the window. Everything just lost its joy after your supposed death. Perving, eating, sleeping. The only solace was the sound of silence and being alone. He said. Turn straight emo. Hope Narue is better. Speaking of her, where is the girl of wonder? You said. Something I like to know as well. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t seen her in a long time. Like she vanished. He said. If something happened to her\u2026.. You said. Just relax. No need to fry your cybernetics. He said. I know\u2026. I\u2019m sure we can find her. You said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There. That should do it. You said. You insert the serum into the injector. This is what Simon made before he died? Chijinda said. Yeah. The last of it. You said. Not really. Only you know the formula. He said. Can\u2019t do it without a lab and right materials. You said. People are hot under the collar about what you did. He said. Simon said this stuff can\u2019t get into the wrong hands. You know what this stuff can do. You said. I know, but the many lives who are in critical here\u2026. He said. They have medics and doctors. They\u2019ll be on their feet. You said. I hope so\u2026.. Chijinda said before leaving. Narue\u2026.. Where are you? Can\u2019t be that hard to find a giant girl. You said. You sit down at a wooden table and think. After a few minutes, you hear the door open. As the footsteps get closer, you look to see a man clad in body armor with a gun pointed at you. You stand up slowly and grab the gun before he could shoot. You rip it from him and slam him through the table and walk out. You walk into the metro to see a small army of soldiers who have taken your friends hostage. You see chijinda, John, and Bowman on their knees. Ex?! John said. Not even death\u2026.. Bowman said. Just can\u2019t keep away. A voice said. A voice you dread. You see Norton walk past the soldiers in his blue overcoat and black jeans with knee pads and elbow pads. Back amongst the living. He said. The yellow and black rings form in your eyes. I still don\u2019t see why Simon liked you. You were always headstrong. He said. You walk slowly towards him and toss away the gun. Just like now. He said. One of the soldiers shoots you and the bullet phases through you. You punch that soldier out cold. Screw this!! One of them said. He runs away and after a few seconds, the most of the rest except three leave. So much for plan A. Get in her, Theta. Norton said. The glass above you breaks and five androids corner you. Rough him up. But not too much. Norton said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look for which one will attack first until you block a kick from behind. You punch him and toss him into another android. You duck the other three and leg sweep them. You grab one and slam him against the wall. He moves his head right when you fist would have hit. The impact leaves a hole in the wall. You are shoved off by two of them and dodge all of their attacks with ease. You grab both of their arms and toss them around. When one comes running towards you, you punch hard enough that it send him flying through the wall. Jesus. Those cybernetics don\u2019t play. John said. Even these androids don\u2019t hold a candle to him, Norton. Quit while you can. Chijinda said. You really think I came here without a plan c? Norton said. Sylvia. You said. You hear the clicks of heels and you see Sylvia holding Cynthia with a gun to her head. Been a long time, hasn\u2019t it? She said. Chijinda. You know these two? By some chance? John said. You meet Norton. That silver haired devil over there is Sylvia. Fuckers have no ethnics. You said. Still living in that \u201cmorality\u201d world of your, chijinda. That\u2019s the reason you were never number one. Norton said. If being number one means being horrible like you two, I\u2019ll keep my second place. He said. Nobody cares about second. I thought you learned that years ago. Sylvia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2026.the fuck you two want?! Cynthia said. Glad you ask. I was never interested in that dead man right there. Sylvia said. That \u201cdead man\u201d has a name, you bitch! Cynthia said. Can it. But since he was the very first to be implanted with cybernetics, he\u2019s a gold mine for the Japanese. He could turn these tin soldiers into effective killing machines. She said. Like hell you\u2019re getting him! Over my dead body! Cynthia said. Which will be a matter of seconds if you keep talking. Now dead man, if you don\u2019t want me to splatter her brains all over the place, you\u2019d drop to your knees. Sylvia said. Ex! Don\u2019t you do it! Cynthia said. I will kill her! You know I will! Sylvia said. You still had the syringe, but for it to work, you\u2019d have to get to Cynthia before her body hit the floor. And that\u2019s a good run from where you\u2019re standing. You take one step and Sylvia shoots Cynthia in the leg. Ow! Fuck! Cynthia said. That\u2019s your only warning! Next one goes right in her brain! Sylvia said. (Wait.) You thought. You had that lightning power the raven haired lady gave you. You were about to raise your arm, but stop. You see you\u2019d have to impale Cynthia as well. And you couldn\u2019t light step without her killing Cynthia. You reluctantly fell to your knee. Good boy. Cans! Sylvia said. Your arms and legs are restrained by the androids. You witch! Cynthia said. Be glad I didn\u2019t shoot you. Even though I wanted to. Sylvia said. She lets go of her. Come on. We have a schedule to keep. Norton said. Let\u2019s. Get moving, dead man. Sylvia said. You walk into a waiting armored van and sit down with the five androids. Three in front and two on the side. After a few seconds, the van drives off. Bowman, john, and chijinda rush to Cynthia. John helps her up. Get any and all able people ready. We\u2019re going after them! She said. Cynth, we need to doctor that wound. John said. You know what\u2019s a wound? Losing Ex again. I will not go through that pain again! This time, he stays alive. Cynthia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long ride, the van stops. Out. Norton said. You step out and are lead into a cell. The restraints stay. Sylvia said. You take a seat and wait. As you sit there in the cell, you see one of the androids come to your cell. You both just stare at each other. She\u2019s different than the other. She\u2019s wearing a black dress with a skirt and knee high heels. You two stare each other down until Norton comes along and opens the door. Get him on his feet. He said. The android grabs you and pulls you up and pushes you out. That way. Norton said. You are lead into what looks like a training room. Norton takes off the locks. Make this interesting. You\u2019re being watched. He said. Alright. Let\u2019s see what you can do, dead man. Start the test! Sylvia said. The yellow and black rings form in your eyes. You duck an attack from behind, grab the person and slam them hard onto the pavement. Brutal. Norton said. Step it up! Sylvia said. You are cornered by 3 cybernetic soldiers. You block grab the two that attacked you by the arms and toss them into the wall. The third you dodge all his attacks and punch him hard in the face. He\u2019s goes flying through the wall. Come on, you clowns! You should be putting him to shame! He\u2019s just one person! Sylvia said. For 10 minutes, you easily take care of these soldiers. Useless! The whole lot of you! Sylvia said. You turn back to leave when you feel a sharp point in your back. You turn your head to see that same android from before, but with a sword. You swing, but she jumps back a few feet. You take a good look at her. Her stance, the way she holds the sword with confidence, and her facial expression. For a second, you see Lady masque, then back to the android. The real reason your back from the dead. You ball up your hands, but you stop, calm down, and walk away.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you sit there and think, you hear the clicking of heels. You expected Sylvia, but you saw that same android. Just like last time, you both stare each other down. \u2026..What are you? She said. You don\u2019t give her an answer. Your silence makes her mad. I said what are you?! She said. You still don\u2019t responded. Your cell door flies open. Before she could do anything, Sylvia comes creeping by. Get dead man on his feet. Now. She said. The android hoist you up and you are lead out into a van. Keep him company while we go. Norton said. Following Norton\u2019s order, she gets on the other side as the van starts to drive off. Just you and the android. She stares at you with daggers in her eyes. You take the time to fully study her. (Not like the others. She seems to be a new kind of cybernetic soldier. I don\u2019t think her choice of clothes are right for battle.) You thought. After a few minutes, the van stops and you are pushed out. Let\u2019s see how good you really are, dead man. Sylvia said. After saying that, she drives off. Hmmm. A deserted part of the city, I guess. You said. As you look around, you feel the ground shake. That\u2026..can\u2019t be good. You said. You know those tremors well enough to know what\u2019s coming. You remain balance as you see a giant society member topples a building with ease to get to you. Oh boy, I guess I got to try now. Can\u2019t half ass it this time. You said. The society member glances down at you and smiles evilly. Such a cute face too. Not even three. You said. When she reaches down for you, you jump onto her hand and run up her arm. Before she could react, you hit her hard in the head. The sudden force knocks her on her back. With one blow, you took her out in less than a minute. If anyone told me this was possible years ago, I\u2019d laugh. But the times are changing. Simon personally oversaw my surgery and augment me with a few of his own design. I could really use boss man about now. You said. That was quick. And here I was thinking you\u2019d be paste. But I guess if you survive one giantess, you can survive them all. Norton said. You are shoved back into the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit in your cell, you see that android again. She opens the door. I wasn\u2019t done with you. I still want my question answered. She said. You look at her and back down, which angers her. You died once. How about again? She said threaten. \u2026\u2026That your best threat? Piss poor. You said. Then how about a physical threat? She said as she makes a dent in the wall behind you. \u2026..I\u2019ll say this clearly so it gets through your processor. I\u2019m not trap with you. You\u2019re trap with me. You said before punching a hole in the wall, but she doesn\u2019t back down. You think that scares me? She said. No. Because cold machines like you can\u2019t feel. Android is just a connation word to give you some sort of humanity. You\u2019re just a machine. Created. Wires and bolts. You said. And you think you\u2019re any different? I know all about you. She said. A machine\u2019s suppose to know. You said. You think you\u2019re better than me?! She said. I came from a womb. You came from a lab. So take a guess. You said. Nothing is stopping me from killing you again. She said. Like you could. All you androids no\u2026..machines are a dime a dozen. You said. Trust me, I\u2019m not like any other you\u2019ve seen. She said. How so? You cry when you get hit? Tears or oil? You said. Before she could react, an alarm goes off. This isn\u2019t over. She said before walking away. Tin can. You said. You sit there while the alarm continues to blare until it stops 15 minutes later and Norton comes back. Seems like we have some visitors. Up Norton said. You get up and are escorted to the training ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEx! Cynthia said. On your knees! Sylvia said. Cynthia and the rest of them are forced to the ground. Norton. Tell him what\u2019s going to happen next. Sylvia said. You\u2019ve been holding back on us. I know you aren\u2019t going at 100%. So we got a little incentive for you. He said. Which one gets a whole in the head first? How about mr. philosopher here? Sylvia said. You clench your fist. Not enough of a reaction. Norton said. Well, how about too cool to care here? Sylvia said. I prefer John! John said. Nope. Still nothing.  Norton said. How about this turn coat? In fact, maybe I\u2019m doing you a favor. Sylvia said. You clench your fist tighter. Still no reaction. Next. Norton said. I know this will work. Sylvia said. Get off me! Cynthia said. Maybe watching the light in her eyes go out will work. Sylvia said. You wanted to react, but decided to chance it. A better reaction that time, but still nothing. Norton said. Then that just leaves my least favorite person in the world. Sylvia said. When she got to chijinda, you tense up. Bingo. Norton said. I\u2019ve always dreamed of killing him. Sylvia said. You\u2019re a sick fuck! You know that! Chijinda said. A sick and ALIVE fuck. She said. Omega Delta Foxtrot! Cynthia said. What\u2019s that? Sylvia said. An omega mode. But it\u2019s voice recognition. She said. You think he\u2019s badass now, you ain\u2019t seen anything. John said. Sylvia. Norton said. I know who. Sylvia said. She grabs chijinda. Say it. She said. Screw\u2026.you! He said. All the years you\u2019ve know me, chijinda. You know I will blow your brains out! Say it! She said. Trust me. Cynthia mutters. \u2026..Omega Delta Foxtrot. Chijinda said. \u2026..Code receive. Omega mode activated. You said. You snatch norton\u2019s gun and throw it at Sylvia. When the androids rush you, you effortlessly and quickly dispatch of them. Fatally. Nice. Just how I imagined. Norton said. You quickly free your friends. You step back  when that android attacks you. You block all her attacks with ease. When she kicks high, you duck and leg sweep her and punch her into the ground. You put your foot on her throat. You could have killed her, but you let her live. Get back here\u2026.. We\u2019re not done here! She said. Before you walk away, you kick a gun towards her. Some sort of pity?! She said. \u2026..Come after me when you get your improvements. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on. Narue. We got him. Exit plan. Chijinda said. A giant fist crashes through the glass ceiling and grabs all of you. With you all in tow, Narue takes you back to base. Amazing. We get all that? Norton said. Every last second of it. Sylvia said. </span></div></div>",

Just shoot him. We got bigger things. John said. We would, bit she seems of importance. She says she knows chijinda. He said. You stop in your tracks. Where is she?! You said. The power room. He said. You make a beeline to the power room. Wait! Nice job, soldier. Ex! Cynthia said. Man. He so serious all of a sudden. Bowman said. Omega mode makes him focus. Chijinda said. You kick open the door to see the blue hair society member. Well. Look who it is. Still alive I see. She said. You grab her and shove her into the wall. Where\u2026..is\u2026.she? You said. I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking about. She said. You throw her into the generator. Quit playing dumb! Where?! You said. Like I\u2019d tell you. She said. You bash her skull into the generator. I can do this all day. You said. Go on\u2026\u2026 Do it. She said. You brake both her arms and hit her a few times. Keep going\u2026.. I know you love this\u2026.. Give it to me! I can take it! I can take all of it! She said. Ex! Ex!! She just wants you like this! Cynthia said. I don\u2019t care! You said. You beat her more until her eye is swollen, her nose is broken, and she\u2019s coughing blood. Where is she?! You said. Heh\u2026\u2026 It\u2019ll do you no good anyway. You\u2019ll just die again. Go back to where it all started. That\u2019s where. It started there and it\u2019ll end there. Only this time. It\u2019ll be a repeat of last time! You said. With that smug look on her face, you snap her neck. Something I should have done from day one. You said. The most brutal interrogation I\u2019ve seen. John said. You walk past them. Ex! Where are you going now?! Cynthia said. To right a wrong. This shit stops now. You said. She\u2019s killed you once. If what she said is true, then it will be a repeat. She said. It won\u2019t! Not this time. You said. You walk out of the subway. Should\u2026\u2026we go after him? John said. No. Where he\u2019s going, we\u2019d only get in the way. Chijinda said. Where is he going anyway? Bowman said. To make more enemies. Chijinda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to Simone\u2019s house. Simone did most of his research at home. If i\u2019m right, it should be here. You said. You enter the 5 digit pass code and the door opens. You step inside. He finally cleaned those notes up. You said. You search around until you find a secret button behind the tv. The couch moves to the left and the floor opens up. Simone only showed this to me once. You said. You head down into Simone\u2019s personal lab. This is where the real magic happens. You said. You look at the beakers and tubes and beeping machines. As you look, see some tapes on a shelf. I wonder if this is Simon and his goons? You said. You find a player and play the tape. Everything is as I should be. Simone said. Sir. Can you really trust that new kid? You put him with chijinda. A voice said. Thanks Dave. You said. His interview was good. And his questionnaire answers were great. I think he could work well with chijinda. Simone said. It\u2019s not chijinda. It\u2019s him. His first day and he automatically gets your stim. Dave said. And that\u2019s your job to watch. Now back to work. Simone said. You put in the next tape. These progress reports are something else. Simone said. You see the number of stims he\u2019s using? Blowing through more than everybody who works for you. Dave said. It is a little worrying, but he gets the job done. Efficiently to. Simone said. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a problem? A female voice said. Oh. Gloria. You said. What do you mean? Simone said. He\u2019s doing things so well and good? Don\u2019t you think he may be looking for favors or something? She said. If he was, he\u2019d call for them. Just because he\u2019s doing good, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s out for something. He knows what happens if he tries anything out of hand. Simone said. You put in the next tape. Tell me you\u2019re joking. Dave said. I\u2019m dead serious. Simone said. Sir\u2026\u2026 Simone. Are you sure you want him. A voice said. I am. Time and time again, he proves himself. Simone said. I admit. Taking on a giant school girl is\u2026..commendable and a reward in itself, but are you sure you want him to run the business?! Gloria said. I am. He\u2019s earned my trust in more ways than one. If something happens to me, he runs this place. And you will listen to him as if it was my own words. Simone said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone\u2026..wanted me to run the company? I don\u2019t know the first thing about business. You said. You look around. Simone\u2026\u2026 I wanted to impress, but not like that. I did what he said, I followed his protocols, and I gave 150% out there. You said. You find the formula you were looking for. Here it is. The stuff Dave and his jerks got. You said. You were about to take it, but stop. \u2026\u2026.Is this right? Would Simone be ok with this? He said he wanted to keep this out of the wrong hands, but he\u2019s not here anymore. No. I have to do this. You said. You look at the formula and mix all the compounds together. Ok. That should do it. You said. You pocket the formula and the stim. Simone\u2026\u2026.if only I had your advice. You said. Just then, the power goes out and the room is pitch black. (Here we go.) You said. You stand still for a few seconds and grab the person\u2019s arm. You both struggle until you throw the person from you. The lights come back on, but the person is gone. Then you feel something against your side. Hand it over. The voice said. Please\u2026.. You said. Now! I won\u2019t ask again. The voice said. Sorry stealth, but I need this 5x as more as you. You said. You swing behind, but they duck. Before they could attack, you knee them in the chin and force them against the wall. Wait. A ninja\u2026\u2026? I thought they only exist in stories. You said. She tries to stab you, but you grab her wrist and force the blade out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeez. Boss man must really wanted to feel safe. Dressed in the normal ninja shit. Knives, mask, blades. The works. You said. She stares angrily at you. \u2026..Go on. Kill me, traitor. She said. (She must be one of Simone\u2019s goons.) You thought. What are you waiting for? An invitation? She said. You pull down her mouth cover. Do. Your. WORST. She said. You could feel the venom in her words. You move closer to her and kiss her. Mmp! She said. Then you break it. I\u2019m not as bad as you think, ninja girl. You said. You go to head out, but Dave stands in your way. So it is true. You are live. He said. Out of my way, Dave. Norton was one thing, but I don\u2019t have time for you or your thugs. You said. And what are you planning on doing with that? He said. Doesn\u2019t concern you. Move. You said. I don\u2019t know your intentions for that. And Simone\u2019s not here to back you up anymore. He said. Get mad all you want about simone liking me more than you, but I\u2019m here on business. Now scram. You said. Can\u2019t. For all I know, you could be selling that. He said. If I wanted to, I\u2019d done it by now. I had more than one chance to off this stuff. Now are going to let me go or do I have to embarrass you and your goons? You said. You know how this ends. He said. Fine. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t give you the chance to walk away. You said. Get him! Dave said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the base.<br>\r\nChijinda. Who are these enemies you said Ex is going to make? Cynthia said. The only person who could top Norton\u2019s sadistic streak was Dave. Boss man\u2019s personal right hand. He said. What did he do? John said. Boss man had a counter for everything. In case someone went against him, Dave took care of them. In a way that makes Norton and Sylvia look like saints. He said. He\u2019s that bad? Bowman said. It gets worse. Dave wasn\u2019t the only one. There were more. Lots more. So many that they were broken down into teams for clearance levels. He said. Clearance levels? John said. Yeah. You start with d clearance and worked your way up. Each one had a team that took orders from boss man. He said. So they did what Dave does? Cynthia said. Yeah. Trust was a huge thing to Boss man. Betray him and it\u2019s your head. He said. So how dangerous are these people? Bowman said. They are not run of the mill. From what I heard, they are trained from a black site under the most grueling conditions. If it can be used to kill, they know how to use it. Guns, knives, daggers, you name, they know how to use it. And they have killed numerous people. He said. You sure it was a hot idea to let Ex go there? John said. We\u2019d only be a distraction at best. I\u2019m telling you, these people put the Ghost to shame. Chijinda said. And they are as good as it gets. Bowman said. What about Narue? They can\u2019t handle a giant girl yet. John said. Doesn\u2019t mean they are eager to. These are not some government hitmen. These are the people who make you watch your back, who you talk to, when and where you sleep, eat and piss. Chijinda said. For something like that, they should be called nightmares. Not people. Bowman said. I\u2019ll show them a true nightmare if they touch him! Cynthia said. Section agent vs elite military train killers. Close one. John said. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This guy is something else. Darek said. And don\u2019t forget it, emo bastard. You said. You grab the ninja girls weapon and force her against the wall and throw it right next to her head. No good, man. He knows all of our movements. Ely said. Not this on. Do it. Dave said. Two smoke bombs are tossed at your feet and explode. As you cough, you swing behind you, but hit nothing. You suddenly feel something jam into your neck. Now! Gloria said. Through the smoke, you make out a figure with a raised weapon. You try to move your arms, but are paralyzed. (Can\u2019t\u2026move!) You thought. Then you feel a slash across your chest. Blood drips from the wound as you fall over. A down grade form of what they use to execute death row inmates. Not enough to kill, but temporary shutdown the nervous system for a good minute or two. She said. Gloria then looks you over. Cybernetic implants, an omega mode, stim and all. Simone made sure his golden boy was taken care of. She said. I sense\u2026..some jealousy. Not his\u2026..number one anymore\u2026\u2026did a damper on you. She said. I was downtrodden at first. The fact the he\u2019d leave the company to you is beyond me. She said. Unlike you, I do\u2026.good work\u2026.. Not some declassified government wet work. You said. You wouldn\u2019t know good if it hit you ten times over. Speaking of over\u2026.. Kenja! Gloria said. Kenja holds your head up and places a dagger to your neck. (No choice\u2026..) You thought. Focusing, you feel the lightning course through your body and you discharge it all around you. Since Kenja had her hand on you, the lightning coursed all through her. With her stunned, you get up and run out before they could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way back to the Subway. Ex! You\u2019re back. She said. Putting on a brave face, you responded. You sound like you weren\u2019t expecting me to. You said. With you, I don\u2019t know what to expect. She said. Relax. I\u2019m fine. I got what I wanted. Quit worrying your blonde head about me. You said. That makes it even worse. She said. You head to the medical part of the base. Doctor. You said. Yes? He said. I need\u2026.you to look at you to look at something. He said. Take a seat and show me. He said. You sit down and lift up your shirt. Oh\u2026. That looks serious. He said. Can you run some tests on it? You said. I\u2019ll\u2026.see what I can do. He said. For a while, the medic examines and observes your gash. Ok. So from what I\u2019ve gather is that the cut itself won\u2019t kill you. But you run the risk of infection. Strange thing is, your cells aren\u2019t repairing the cut and new ones aren\u2019t growing. It seems like whoever did this, wanted you to suffer. He said. Anything to lessen it? You said. At most, all I can give you are painkillers. It won\u2019t fix it, but it will dull the pain. He said. Thanks doc. You said as you take the painkillers and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s just as I feared. Her blade was coated in a toxin that stops the cells from growing in the inflicted area. Luckily, I switched out shirts on the way back. Cynthia or anyone won\u2019t know unless I tell them. Better that way. You said. You find Chijinda in the generator room. Did you get it? He said. I got it. You said. And Dave and his crew? You said. Out for blood. You said. Well they\u2019ll be on the list of things to do. While you were gone, I\u2019ve manage to find exactly where Miku and her croons are. You remember the tower? He said. Yeah. She\u2019s there? You said. Yeah. He said. Then let\u2019s go. You said. Hold on, Rambo. We can\u2019t just up and go. There\u2019s a lot of territory to cover between here and there. He said. So how do we get there? You said. The same way last time. Under the school. Those tunnels there will lead us straight to the tower. He said. Then let\u2019s go now. You said. We need a way first. I stole a map and schedule of the patrol routes. Right now, there is no patrol in the area around the school. He said. So let\u2019s go before a patrol gets there. You said. I think we should wait, but knowing they are backing the enemy here might make the Japanese pull out. I\u2019ll get a few things first. He said. As Chijinda\u2019s back is turn, you\u2026.</span></div></div>",

I started all of this. I\u2019m going to end this. You said. You prop chijinda up against the generator and leave. As you leave, Cynthia spots you. Don\u2019t you think you should rest? The bad guys aren\u2019t going anywhere. She said. \u2026.I\u2019m not stopping until the American flag is flying high in the sky. You said. As patriotic as that sounds, it means nothing if you aren\u2019t there to see it. You\u2019ll run yourself into the ground like this. Even soldiers need R&amp;R from time to time. Even if they are cybernetic. She said. \u2026.I\u2019ll rest when the job\u2019s done. You said. That\u2019s what I was afraid of. You ok? You look like you\u2019re in pain. She said. You sure you don\u2019t need the R&amp;R? I\u2019m fine. Look. You said. You grab both John and bowman and lift them up like it\u2019s nothing. He\u2019s fine, Cynth. John said, trying to breath. You drop both of them. See? You said. *Sigh* Just\u2026..be back before night. That\u2019s all I ask. She said. Ok, mom. You said. You head out. As you do, you see Narue sitting next to the entrance. You jump onto her leg, which makes her look down at you. I see giant life is treating you good. You said. It has it moments. I thought I\u2019d be use to it by now. She said. Problems? You said. Well, for starters, people are always on egg shells around me. They think I\u2019ll crush them if they say the wrong thing. She said. Well, you can. But I guess your gentle and nice nature makes it hard for you. You said. Maybe. And i have to be extra careful when I have to people around me. Twice as much with you and chijinda. She said. Would you trade it all away? You said. I thought it was cool to be a giantess at first, but now\u2026\u2026 If it means I get to protect the two closest people who I care about, I\u2019ll deal with being this big. She said. You sure, Narue? You said. Positive. She said. I guess I have nothing to worry about. You said. You jump down and leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk through the streets, you stop. So you\u2019re not going to take my advice? A voice said. Norton. You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m in a hurry or I\u2019d show you your insides. You said. Fair enough. Something I\u2019d say if I was put through what you went through. He said. If you were, I\u2019d gut you on site. You said. This hero complex of yours is dangerous. You\u2019re going to get killed one day. He said. I\u2019ve already died once. You said. Lightning doesn\u2019t strike twice. And with that gash that little ninja gave you, every minute matters. He said. Which is why I\u2019m going to do what I should have done since day one. You said. And you think doing it alone will work? You said. My problem, Norton. You said. Doesn\u2019t mean others want to help. Those friends of yours. He said. What the fuck do you know about friendship, Norton? Sadist don\u2019t have friends. You said. I know those people care about you. Not be there when you\u2019re in trouble care, but go straight to hell, pull you out of the lake of fire, and back into the world of the living care. They seem like they will die for you on call. You should use that. He said. I\u2019m not stonehearted like you or Sylvia. I have a conscious. I can\u2019t look myself in the mirror and go on like that. You said. And how is that fair to them? They\u2019d go anywhere you say, yet when jumping into danger, you don\u2019t want them to. He said. Are you going to mourn them? Can you even name four of the people who died while being a partner to you? You said. I didn\u2019t bother cause I knew they\u2019d be dead within the month. He said. That\u2019s the difference between you and me. I care. You don\u2019t. You said. You walk off. If you go it alone, it\u2019s a one way. And you know Dave and his merry men will come for you. Norton said. I\u2019ve warned Dave already. If he or any of his thugs get in my way, they\u2019ll get the same as Miku. You said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to the school. Here I go. You said. You enter the building and find the ladder from last time. The one me and chijinda climb down. You climb down the ladder and see a mechanical door. Easy hack. Once I\u2019m in there, no going back. You said. With determination, you hack open the door and enter the tunnels. These tunnels are dark as fuck. All power is gone. You said as you go through. As you walk, you fall over. You pull up your shirt to see the mark is black. It\u2019s infected. The dead flesh is rotting. It\u2019s only a matter of time. You said. You get up and continue through. Where is that ladder? You said. You walk through corridor after corridor of deactivated machines and robots. You search until you finally find it. You climb up the ladder and push open the trap door. You step out to see that there isn\u2019t rubble isn\u2019t everywhere. They rebuilt this place. Is there anything they can\u2019t do? You said. You head up to the top point, but stop when you cough blood. It\u2019s spreading\u2026.. I\u2026.have to\u2026.. You said as you climb up the ladder to the top of the tower, where Miku is waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was true. You are alive. And you came alone. She said. I\u2019m here for one thing. You said. You really think defeating me will stop everything? She said. That\u2019s not a concern right now. I want payback. You said. And they said women hold grudges. She said. I\u2019ll show you how long I\u2019ve harbored said grudge. And when I\u2019m done with you, those queens are next! You said. You go to attack, but stop and cough up more blood. What\u2019s the matter? Have a sickness? She said. Nothing that concerns you, of all people! You said as you charge her, but she moves out of the way. And here I thought we could be civil about this. She said. Fuck your civil! I\u2019ll do what chijinda couldn\u2019t! You said. You both attack each other and even thought you are hurting, you put up a solid offense and defense. I\u2019m surprised. You\u2019ve improved. New form of attack, better posture, and focus. She said. I\u2019m been planning for this. I won\u2019t let this slip away. You said. I see. Let me see just how determined you are to get to me. She said. Knowing what she means, you duck down and a sword slashes where you were. You tackle Masque to the ground. You go to punch her, but a whip wraps around your arm. You pull Kanon to you and kick her into the wall. You get up but are charged into a wall with a lance in your abdomen. You pull the lance out and sock her hard. You grab her and her a whirling sound. Oh jeez! You said. You turn around and see Mizuki with her gauntlet gun spinning it and firing. You run around in a circle to her and force her down. You gun wielding- you stop mid sentence when you remember what happen last time. You move to you left, but your right arm is severed. Argh! You bitch! You said as you kick her hard into a nearby machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery nice. Miku said while giving you a slow clap. I must\u2026.be doing something\u2026..wrong if\u2026\u2026your appending. You said. It\u2019s something I do when my expectations are surpassed. Hm. That severed arm must hurt. She said. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2026.got the remedy. You said. You inject the stim into your missing arm. Within a few seconds, your arm grows back. Always have a solution, right? She said. How do you think I\u2019ve survived this long? You said. That, I will congratulate you on. But how about we take this to a new level? She said. You see her pull out one of those growth guns. (Oh geez.) You thought. Let\u2019s change history. She said. Not this time! You said. Before she could fire it, you tackle her and you both fall to the ground. You pound on her as you two freefall and struggle over the gun and soon hit the ground hard. Concrete\u2026..does not make\u2026..a good cushion. You said. You slowly get up and walk over to Miku. You check for a pulse when her eyes shoot open and she shoots herself with the gun. Shit! You said as you backed away. You watch as she shoots up to a terrifying height. This\u2026.brings back memories. She said.  Yeah. Terrible ones. You said. Do you think you can do this a third time? She said. I can and i\u2014You suddenly fall over. The\u2026.infection\u2026.. eating away at me. Can barely see right in front of me. I\u2019m\u2026..not taking the journey alone! You said as you force yourself to stand up. Show me what you got, tiny. Miku said.</span></div></div>",

At least make an effort. She said. You jump out of the way when her fist hits the ground. It\u2019s only a matter of time. You getting slower and slower. She said. She\u2019s right. My body won\u2019t be able to keep up. Even with me using my cybernetics. That only leaves one choice. I didn\u2019t want to use it at all, but I have no options left. You said. Before you could do anything, you are suddenly  grabbed. Are you going to fight or do I have to pop your head like a grape? She said. You see a jet fly by.  That\u2019s a Jap jet. He\u2019s phoning this in right now. You said. (I gave you power. Use it!) A voice said. (Y\u2026..You\u2026..!) All right. No more horseplay! You said. You feel the electricity build up and you discharge it, which makes her drop you. You feel you muscles and bones expand and you grow to the same height as Miku. Someone has been using our stuff. She said. And? What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander. You said. If it is good, then this will be what I\u2019m hoping for. She said. It\u2019ll be more than that! I\u2019ll show you what I can really do! You said. That\u2019s what I want to hear. Show me the fight we would have originally. She said. Let\u2019s! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChijinda slowly stirs awake. Ow\u2026.. That hurt\u2026. He said. Chijinda slowly gets up and collect his senses. Fuck. I knew he was going to do that. I didn\u2019t react fast enough. Chijinda said. Chijinda runs out of the generator room. Whoa. Where\u2019s the fire? Cynthia said. Did he leave yet? Chijinda said. Who? Ex? He\u2019s been gone for an hour. She said. Shit! He said. What\u2019s the problem? She said. He went after Miku. He said. That blue hair girl who became a giant? John said. Yeah. I told him there was a way to get to here. We were planning on going, but he knocked me out. Chijinda said. Why would he Bowman said. He wants revenge. Norton said. Norton walks down to the group. You got a lot of nerve being here. Cynthia said. Nerve, bravado. Call it whatever. He said. What do you know Norton? Chijinda said. You worked with him before. He\u2019s carrying the world on his shoulder. A lot for one person. Norton said. What did he go to do?! Cynthia said. He wants revenge. For being killed. Norton said. So he went after her by himself? John said. You bet. Told me that he wouldn\u2019t be able to look himself in the mirror if everyone he cared about died doing something he wanted. Norton said. He wouldn\u2019t just up and do that. He\u2019d at least have a plan. Bowman said. Plan is kill Miku or be killed himself. He\u2019s dying. Norton said. Dying?! Everyone said. What the hell did you do to him?! Cynthia said as she grabs Norton. Cynth! We need him to talk. John said. Cynthia lets go of him. None of you notice he was in pain? Heavy breathing? Sudden weakness? About to collapse? Norton said. He did have trouble walking when I saw him. Bowman said. He looked like he was in terrible pain before he left. Cynthia said. Oh God. Chijinda said. You guessed it. Norton said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?! Cynthia said. Dave\u2026.. He\u2019s been hurt. His cells aren\u2019t regrowing and he\u2019s caught an infection. Chijinda said. Bingo. I told him to spend time with you guys, but it seems like he wants to use his time for something else. Norton said. He can be fixed, right? Cynthia said. Nope. Uncurbable. Medication will only just slow it down. Norton said. No\u2026\u2026 No! There has to be a way! If we find this Dave, he\u2019ll give up how to save him. Cynthia said. There isn\u2019t. Not even the stuff we take will work. And going after Dave and his merry men is a death wish. Norton said. Ma\u2019am! A soldier said. What do you need, LT? Cynthia said. We\u2019ve got word of two giants giving each other hell. He said. Ex! She said. The japs are scrambling and in disarray over the two\u2019s fight. The soldier said. Launch a full out assault. We\u2019re going to end this tyranny. Cynthia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss Miku to the ground. She moves her head when you try to punch her and she knees you in the chin. This is what I wanted. I wanted to see what you had when I first got reports about you. She said. I don\u2019t disappoint. You said. You don\u2019t. You and chijinda are the only two who make me try. She said. It wouldn\u2019t be a fight if we didn\u2019t. You said. Yes. Let\u2019s continue this. I want to see more of your skill. She said. You see more than enough! You said. You both lock horns. What was all this for?! What was taking over the US going to accomplish? You said. You\u2019ve been listening to our that c rank turn cyborg. Her feelings got in the way of what I truly meant. I never wanted to take over. All I wanted was to prevent the world from spiraling into the dystopian I told you about. She said. And how\u2019s that going? You said. If this keeps up, we\u2019ll be soon. She said. Then I\u2019ll make sure you aren\u2019t around to see it. You said. You headbutt her and uppercut her. She hits the ground hard and you jump on her and start beating her. You only do this for a few seconds until you heart stops beating and you fall over. You and miku both shrink back to normal size. Madame\u2026.. Reina said as she helps Miku up. No\u2026. No more. There\u2019s been enough. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Dave and his group show up. No pulse. The infection grew out of control. Dave said. And Simone preferred him out of everybody. Gloria said. Might be able to get something from him. Nikita said. She pulls up your eyelids. Just as I thought. No wonder he knew everything you did. Simone implanted his eyes with special cybernetics. Could analyze, hack, and predict where and what to do. She said. So would he know when the Jets when the superbowl? Eli said. Wouldn\u2019t put it past it. Ok. Bypass firewall and\u2026..done. Alright. We can go. No need to stay here. Nikita said. A few minutes after they leaving, your body slowly gets up and the raven haired lady stands in front of you. You are a special person. Such determination. Resolve. Won\u2019t say die. If you were around during the age of the titans, you\u2019d make either a great ally or dangerous enemy. You\u2019d make for a good king. She said. She holds her hand over the blackened gash and heals the infected and dead cells. Now. Breath warrior. She said. You suddenly breath in and open your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain? Why? You said. I told you before. If anyone enslaves or kills you, it will be me. No one will deny me that satisfaction. She said. I thought you were only joking. You said. I wasn\u2019t. All those times you were threatened, why didn\u2019t you use the power I bestowed on you? She said. I didn\u2019t want to become a bigger target than I already was. But that\u2019s over with now. I died a long time ago. She said. What do you mean? She said. I mean that the person who I was before Miku and before you is dead. You said. And your friends? She said. They should think I\u2019m dead. All I have to do now is wait until you return to full power and we go from there. You said. That\u2019s still years away. You have plenty of time before I exact my revenge. She said. Then I better prepare. You said. And your friends? She said. Like I said, I died a long time ago. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tower. You think he\u2019s here? John said. We\u2019ll search up, down, in, and out for him. Cynthia said. As Cynthia and co search everywhere for you, they can\u2019t find you. We\u2019ve looked all over. He\u2019s not here. Bowman said. You think they\u2026.. No. Ex is too strong to die to them! Cynthia interrupts. Narue. Anything? Chijinda said. No. I don\u2019t see him. She said. Ma\u2019am. We\u2019ve searched the surrounding area, but nothing. A soldier said. No\u2026\u2026 No. No. NO! He has to be alive! All the other times we thought he was dead, he was alive! Cynthia said. How about the assault, soldier? Bowman said. Great. We\u2019ve pushed them back as far as three states. And we had word about other countries fighting back as well. He said. A normal life seems likely.  John said. Not until we find Ex. Cynthia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days turn to weeks and weeks turn to months, the Japs are slowly but surely driven out of the US. Even though it\u2019s been months, Cynthia and everyone else have not given up hope that you\u2019re still alive. Ex. Wherever you are, I\u2019ll find you, And we can be together again. Pick up right where we left off. Cynthia said. These friends of yours. They don\u2019t give up. She said. I know. You said as you watch them from a far. They are right there. You could go down there. Give them peace of mind. She said. No. They\u2019ve been through enough. The person they are looking for is gone. You said. The one who stood up against me? She said. No. The normal one. He\u2019s dead. The one in front of you right now has nothing to look towards except you. You said. If that\u2019s true\u2026\u2026then I will want to see this new you. She said. You\u2019ll see. You said as purple lines course down your body. You will see the new me. You said before vanishing in a flash of lightning. </span></div></div>",
