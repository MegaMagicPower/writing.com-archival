For a card game anime it was fairly well done and there was little you could do to complain about it. Suddenly you notice a weird flashing on the screen and out of nowhere your whole vision goes white. When you wake up you find yourself not yourself but in the body of a character from the anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now:</span></div></div>",

Looking around you are definitely not in your room anymore, and judging by the make up on the table, and the generally flowery or frilly designs on the bed which you lay, this was no doubt the room of a girl. Slowly you sit up in your bed, bringing your hand up to scratch your head. Your hand is met with a handful of long flowing hair that extended past your shoulders, \"My hair isn't this long!\" you exclaimed, surprisingly in a smooth alto voice of a young woman. You quickly move your hands to your throat in shock, and now that your senses had been shocked into a state of awake, you begin to notice other anomalies. As you sit there you feel a strange weight on your chest that wasn't there before. Looking down, you notice two lumps of flesh that were definitely not there. You bring your hands up a little in surprise, \"B-breasts!\" you exclaim, the feminine sound coming from your mouth now the least of your problems. It was clear to you that something was definitely wrong. Looking down at your hands they were manicured and rather dainty, especially when compared to the larger and rough hands you were suppose to possess. You quickly move to get off the bed, the smooth feeling of your now hairless legs gliding across the bedsheets and blankets, you'd be lying if you said you didn't like that feeling even a little, yet another reminder that you were no longer yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally making it to the mirror, you gasp in shock \"M-misaki!?!\" you say, again in the now identified voice. You bring your hand up to your face, now getting a better feel of how soft the girls skin feels, \"I-I'm Misaki.. h-how...?\" you take a step away from the mirror and look around the room when a feeling washes over you, a thought that was not your own began to invade your mind, \"I shouldn't just stand here staring at the mirror, I need to get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccumbing to the urges you rush to the wardrobe to pick out an outfit. Strangely you looked through, taking care to pick the perfect look for today. Undressing you begin to understand the feelings of your new body a little better. Reaching for underwear you slip your smooth legs through the panties to put them on, and you quickly grab a bra, putting it on properly. It was as if you were use to doing this every day. Once this was done, you picked up the white tank top and put it on, with a blue denim vest over it. You then grab a denim miniskirt and grab a belt, putting on the unfamiliar garment around your waist, with the belt holding it in place. You now move over to the vanity and brush your hair and apply make up, finally completing your morning preparations. You now look in the mirror satisfied with the way you look today. You grab your key necklace and put it on, as well as grabbing your Vanguard deck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finished with your \"morning routine\" you get a hold of yourself, \"Wait, why do I feel so good about this, I'm not a girl!\" you think to yourself. Your new clothes were tighter than anything you would have worn as a guy and further accentuate how different your new body is. The tightness of the top on your chest was awkward enough, but the exposed midriff the tanktop left was also something that was completely foreign to you. As well as that, the miniskirt left majority of your legs bare, taking a couple steps you are overwhelmed by how different everything about you feels. While you are fascinated by your new body, that same feeling washes over you again, \"I have to hurry up and go!\" You quickly put on the high heels sandals at the door and move out under the influence of Misaki's body to. As you walk out the door, another thought reinforces what you are doing.</span></div></div>",

Walking out of the room you take notice of how your new body moves. Much unlike your old body, with each step you take, your hips sway side to side in an alluring fashion. It wasn't that you were trying to walk like this, but it was unavoidable while walking in heels. Speaking which, you don't seem to have much trouble walking in heels as you make your way downstairs to the card store. After talking a little with your uncle, you promptly put on the apron and sit down at the counter with a book to read to pass the time. During the day was rather boring as not many frequent the shop during these early hours of the day. However, while the store was quiet you managed to regain control over your sense, \"What am I going to do, I keep acting like Misaki would...\" you start to panic, thinking back on what could have possibly cause this to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral male customers come in and give you a look over. At first you are rather disgusted but after a while you find yourself liking it. After all, isn't this why you dressed so nicely today in the first place. You begin to question what thoughts were your own and which ones were Misaki's after a while. You needed to find a way to fix this as soon as possible, otherwise you may be stuck thinking like this. As you think this, another urge washes over you \"I need to get back to work, stop getting distracted!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You run down the stairs and out the door to find your uncle already in the van waiting. As well as that you see the rest of your team here, and right off the bat Kamui, the youngest of the group, was already arguing with Kai, who was not interested in dealing with him. Your eyes drift over to the other boy with blue hair, quietly sitting in the van looking at his deck. You don't know what it is but you feel a kind of sister like concern for him and walk over to him, \"Are you nervous?\" you ask in your calm womanly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh, a little bit...\" the boy responds. You put a hand on your hip in a feminine stance and brush your hair out of your face with the other. Looking at the dejected boy you respond with words of encouragement, \"It's okay, we'll do fine!\" you say, putting a hand on his shoulder. You quickly take a seat in the front and direct the your uncle in the direction of the stadium. He wasn't very good at taking directions, but at the very least through this you weren't making it obvious that you weren't suppose to be Misaki. You felt really irritated at him for some reason, you really need to fix something before these urges become a little more permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving at the tournament you get out of the van and begin your walk to the stadium. This particular walk really highlighted how different Misaki's body was to yours. Firstly, they way your body moved was completely different, for some reason you were able to balance perfectly with the heels you were wearing, despite having never worn something like this before. As well as that you needed to take smaller steps as not only was your skirt extremely short, but you needed to keep balance in the heels. It was weird how your hips swayed side to side alluringly, but these kind of movements were really out of your control. The smooth feeling of your legs while you walked was also strangely pleasant, and since the weather was hot, having your legs bare and midriff exposed, it was a lot less stuffy than anything in your usual wardrobe. A cool breeze blows as you reach the stadium and you use your hand to daintily tuck your hair behind your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter the lobby you notice two familiar faces from the TV show. The first was that of the Palemoon user who was Misaki's rival in the show, and the other was the woman known as the \"Empress\". A strange feeling wells up inside you and you suddenly have a strong desire to best them in the tournament, but your thoughts are quickly interrupted as you are ushered away by the your uncle, the manager, to register for the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait you let your mind wonder and as this happens you begin to think about other things.</span></div></div>",

Before even moving you feel that something is off, you feel a little bit different. Ignoring the strange feelings for the moment, you dart your eyes left and right to survey your surroundings. The room looks very organised (more so than your own anyways) and as you look around it appears to belong to a young girl. The stuffed animals on the bed and hair accessories at the vanity tipped you off more than anything. You turn your head slowly to the side to get a better look at where you are when some orange hair falls into your view. \"I don't remember my hair being this long...\" you think to yourself, brushing it aside. You slowly sit up on the bed, the feeling of something brushing the back of your neck confirming that the longer hair you saw was not your imagination. Swinging your legs around you hop off of the bed, strangely finding your legs being just short of touching the ground while you were in a seated position on the side of the bed. While you stand there you notice that you seem to come up shorter against not only the bed, but also the table, chair and other furniture. Hesitantly, you take several small steps towards the vanity, hoping to make sense of what was happening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the mirror of the vanity you are met with a familiar reflection, \"Hey it's Emi from Va-\" you quickly grab your throat shocked at the sweet voice of a little girl that came from your mouth. At the same time you notice the image of Emi in the mirror, copying your every action. Taking a deep breath you take another step towards the mirror and put your hand to your face, watching your new reflection follow you. The girl in the mirror was wearing the pyjama's of a young girl, with orange hair cut at her neck, a little messy from having just woken up in the morning. This young girl was now who you are, you have become Sendou Emi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you stare in shock at your new form, an absentminded thought passes your mind, \"It's a school day today, I better get dressed...\" you quickly move towards the wardrobe and take out the navy blue uniform of the private all-girls school in the neighbourhood. You take off your night clothes, and set it aside neatly. Putting on a pair of panties, a training bra and then slipping into the school uniform that you just pulled out. After this was done you took a brush and started carefully brushing your hair, looking carefully into the mirror to make sure you looked your best. Finally you take the hat that came complete with the uniform and stare into the mirror, now dressed in your uniform. Quickly you realised what just happened \"Woah... I kind of, acted strange just then...\" you say, finally realising that you are starting to act like Emi! Another urge washed over you, \"Ah, I better wake up my Brother or he'll be late for school!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unable to stop yourself you run out of your room, after all you can't just let your big brother Aichi sleep in on a school day. As you run towards Aichi's room you take notice of how foreign your body is. The feeling of your hair brushing against you face was different and not only that, but because of how much smaller you body is, everything around you seems a little bigger and it takes you a while longer to run a distance than in your usual body. As well as that, this was your first experience wearing a skirt and the school uniform gave your now young hairless legs more room to breath. Running towards the room, the feeling of the uniform's skirt swaying around and brushing against your legs was a new feeling, yet strangely felt familiar and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching your brother's you open the door and find him sleeping still. You find yourself sighing as you move towards the blanketed figure and begin shaking him, \"Aichi! Wake up! You're going to be late for school!\" you nag, continuing to shake him. The shape of your brothers body under the sheets begins the squirm, \"Geez, if I have to wake you up every morning, what are you going to do when I'm not there...\" those words of frustration seemed to spill out of your mouth naturally, as if caused by several years of frustration. The blue hair older brother finally managed to wake up. Rubbing his eyes he sits up and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Sorry for making you wake me up all the time Emi...\" he said, drowsily staring at you. \"You really are a good little sister...\" the blue haired boy reached his hand out to you and patted you on the head. At first you wanted to reject this and slap his hand away, but strange feeling within you were actually making you like this. Blushing you spit out your last words to your brother before leaving, \"W-well, breakfast is ready so come downstairs when you're done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally out of the room you find yourself able to think straight again, \"Ah... what's happening to me, I'm acting just like Emi does in the show..\" you shake your head trying to come up with why you were like this when the answer finally comes to you, \"Right, the dream, that device...\" you say, still not use to the high pitched voice you now spoke in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emi, come down and have breakfast!\" says a woman's voice from downstairs. You decide to wait until after breakfast to think up a strategy on how to fix this situation you got yourself into. Running downstairs, you are still distracted by the wrong signals your body was sending you. Being smaller and now wearing female clothing, your muscle memory of your old body was only aiding in confusing you further. Finally reaching downstairs you eat your breakfast promptly and move out the door, of course not forgetting your lunch. As you step out of the door the strange urge begins to affect you again, \"I need to meet up with Erika-chan and go to school\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to maintain control over yourself, \"I-I need to figure out how to stop this though...\"</span></div></div>",

You are in a rather strange room, and funny enough it looked kind of like a dressing room. Your eyes dart around noticing a few things. Something that appears to be a tablet was on the table, likely to see what was on stage considering your location. As well as this you notice many vanities with mirrors on one side of the room as well as a rack filled with white dresses, likely for a costume change. \"How did I ge-\" as you are about to question how you got where you were, your hands grasp your throat in reaction to the strange voice. The voice was definitely not anything like your own voice, in fact it definitely wasn't male. The voice could be described as high pitched, and maybe even cute. Now that it was brought to your attention, you notice a lot of other strange feelings. You look at your hands, dainty and feminine and not anything like your own. You raise your hand a go to your hair, noticing how much longer it definitely is, bringing it to your ears, your notice that your are now wearing earrings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow slightly alarmed at your situation, you jump up from the where you were seated and move swiftly over to the mirror, noticing for the first time that you are shorter than you usually are. You come face to face with the reflection of a young girl. Her hair was orange and had several hair ties with ball ornaments in here hair, and confirming it with your eyes, the girl in the mirror had earrings of a similar design. The body was a lot younger than your old one and was clothed in a pink top and marroon/dark red skirt. Your eyes open in shock, you stare at the image of what you have become. As hard as it was to believe, you've become Rekka from the the idol group Ultra Rare in the show you were just watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still caught surprised, the door opens and a taller girl with blonde hair opens the door. She was dressed in one of the costumes with the same design as the ones you saw on the rack, \"Rekka, you're not dressed yet? Hurry up! We need to be on stage in 5 minutes!\" after delivering her message she leaves you once again alone with your thoughts. As your sit there still in shock, a foreign thought enters your head, \"Geez, Kourin is so pushy... well I better get changed and on stage quickly!\" your body begins to move without your command...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slowly regain consciousness after being out for an undetermined amount of time. You feel a little dazed, barely remembering what you had been doing prior to falling a sleep, as you shift around a little bit in an effort to force yourself out of bet. Your eyes slowly flutter open as you start to survey your surroundings, not recognising the room you were in. Turning your head, several strands of green-ish coloured hair obstruct your vision, which you promptly reach up and brush away with your hand. Your drowsy mind was still trying to play catch up but your hands looked a bit different didn't they? I little smaller and more delicate looking? Not to mention, you didn't recall having green hair let alone it being this long. \"Wh-where...\" you begin to mutter as you force yourself out of the bed you'd apparently been sleeping in, before catching the sound of your voice which sounded very different to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you stand up, your entire body sending your signals completely different to normal. Your now long hair brushed the the back of your neck in an unfamiliar fashion as stand up, off balanced by your rather different centre of gravity. As you look down at yourself you see your body is now donning casual pink dress that clings to your body rather tightly showing of your now rather girlish figure. \"W-what happened!?!\" you exclaimed, panicking a little bit as your voice once again catching you off guard. It sounded less like you were talking and more like someone was dubbing over, a unique experience that you could only really describe like drinking milk and tasting orange juice instead. Wishing to confirm what happened to you, your eyes quickly darted around the room until you found a mirror. You quickly rushed over to see what has happened to you, wishing to ignore the nagging sensations of your long hair and the hem of the dress you now wore fluttering around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it!\" your feminine voice exclaims as you stare at your reflection. Instead of your own form what greeted you was the image of a young high school aged girl. She had long green hair that grew to her shoulders and bright amber coloured eyes, and staring at her face only confirmed how young the body you now wore was. She wore a cute dress with a light pink long sleeve top that conformed tightly to her form, and a long skirt with a darker shade of pink that went down to her knees, a necklace with a pink stone adoring her neck. While she was rather young, her outfit of choice did a good job of showing off the curves she already did posses much to your dismay. Her thin legs were clad in black stockings, and as you look at your new form you can't believe the amount of pink you're wearing. Though, while it may not have suited your old form, it definitely looks good on your new one. \"I'm... Anjou Tokoha?\" you say to yourself, moving around to see if the girl in the mirror moved in the same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs reality sets in, you don't really don't have any idea of how to deal with this situation. You quickly look around the room for any clues that could have lead to your current circumstances. As you look around, you notice a Neonectar deck sitting on the table and decide to pick it up and inspect it. As soon as you do this however, a sharp pain hits your head causing your vision to blur a little bit. Once the pain subsides you recall something, \"That's right, I feel asleep while fixing my deck for the event today...\" you say to yourself, \"or... was I..?\"<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. As it opens an older boy walks in \"Tokoha, I'm leaving for the event now, if you want to come with me. Or are you meeting up with your friends on the way?\" he inquired as I started up at him. In my old body I might have come up to his height but I now had to look up at him, making me more aware of the now petite frame I possessed. I wanted to ask what he was talking about but that aching in my head came back as I answered him.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Onii-chan, I'm still getting ready, I'll see you over there.\" your voice says, almost on autopilot. Seemingly satisfied with the response, the boy nods his head and leaves the room. Your head is a little muddled.

Something about it felt both wrong and right at the same time. You have to find some way to deal with this, but at the same time you feel compelled to go to the event.</span></div></div>",

The room was not much like an ordinary office, it was furnished with what you assumed were rather expensive pieces of furniture and not only that but the room itself looked kind of futuristic, as if out of a future set sci-fi film. After taking a moment to marvel at the room you begin to notice an off feeling. First off it felt as if your head was being weighed down by something, and naturally you make the motions to check what's on your head only to take notice of your hair. It is now extremely long, reaching to your back and was a deep black colour with what looks like some purple streaks. Looking down and raising your arms you now notice the outfit your wearing was quiet different to anything you had seen before. You were wearing a very ornate and colourful kimono like garment with long drooping sleeves. The sleeves were slightly detached at the shoulders, leaving openings that exposed those areas. Around your neck was a necklace like object that also looked like a mirror. As you stood up, you wobbled slightly, noticing you were wearing some sort of highheeled boot like footwear that went all the way up to the thigh. Your thigh was exposed, the end of the kimono cutting off rather short. This was enough to convince you that you were no longer a man, but you searched the room for a mirror to confirm your suspicions. Spotting a large one on the wall you quickly mince over and take a look at your new form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a young woman dressed in clothes influenced by Japanese culture clearly. Your hair did indeed reach all the way tot he back but was tied up with a ribbon at the end. What you thought was weighing you down was a head ornament that was shaped much like the sun which tied the outfit you now wore together quite nicely. \"What happened...?\" you say, trying not to let your gentle feminine voice bother you. Putting a dainty hand to your chin you try to think about what to do when suddenly you here a knocking at the door, \"C-come in!\" she say reactively, to the knock only a second too late to realise your mistake. A women dressed like a secretary walks in, pushes her glasses and addresses you, \"Amaterasu-sama, I have the paperwork you asked for this morning.\" she says, stunning you speechless for a second. How do you react.</span></div></div>",

As you move your head left and right a lock of curly red hair blocks your vision. Reflexively you move your hand up get it out of your way when you notice two things. Firstly, your hair is not that long, and no way was it styled curled like it was. And secondly, the hand the came up to brush the hair away was rather dainty, in fact you bring your hands up to take a closer look and find that you were correct, your hands are not your own and whats more your nails are now grown out and painted red. You quickly stand up from where you were seated and look down on yourself. There are two rather large lumps down sticking out of your chest which you can only assume to be breasts, given the other rather feminine parts of your body you've already examined. You walk over to a mirror on the far side of the locker room in your now heeled shoes, your hips involuntarily swaying back and forth. Looking into the mirror you find that you are no longer yourself, in fact judging from the demon tail, elf like ears and the bat like wings your now possess, you weren't human either. You now had shoulder length red hair with curls and as well as this your body was very much female. In fact had you seem a girl anything like this on the street, you'd probably try and ask her out. The outfit you wore was a cheerleaders uniform, mostly black throughout the design with a loveheart in pink and purple adorning the chest section. The uniform was sure to leave your midriff exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react to what was happening to you, a loud cheer could be heard in the distance. You strangely felt compelled to run towards there, your body making a move already. You reach out a feminine hand and pick up a pair of pom poms before running towards the exit of a tunnel. On the other side is a large football stadium like area with monsterous creatures playing a ball sport which seemed to involve a lot of weaponry. It looked really violent. Strangely enough though, rather than a feeling of disgust towards these large creatures, goblins, elfs etc. you seem attracted to them. Shaking that weird feeling away you run over to the other cheerleaders and take your place. For some reason you know the routine and you begin to join in with the other cheergirls, shouting \"Spike Brothers! GO! FIGHT! WIN!\" in a sexy, feminine voice. It felt weird hearing this voice come out of your throat.</span></div></div>",

Though you weren't exactly sure there was anything that could be as dangerous as a sport that involves a spiked ball, and allows the use of fire arms with no rules in terms of physical violence. Though as these thoughts ran through your mind, you find yourself unable to stop acting like whatever you were suppose to be. Your body was constantly active as you continues to perform cheerleading routines rather naturally. The sensations that ran through your body through your mind into confusion as not only were you not use to the body you were in, but with the way you were moving uncontrollably forced you to face these all at the same time. As you kick your legs and perform as you were suppose to, you could feel the cool air against your bare legs as your purple cheerleading skirt swishes about, while you hate to admit it, it was a rather nice feeling. As you didn't use to wear your hair so long, the feeling of the long red hair ticking the back of your neck as you dance about was also rather foreign to you. And of course you could ignore the rather large, bouncing assets in front of you that were rather thankfully contained by what you were wearing, though unfortunately not enough to not assault you with feelings you weren't yet use to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were distracted by all the strange sensations surrounding your transformation, the game that you were cheering has ended. You breath a sigh of relief in your head, hoping that whatever was compelling you to keep up your act would stop. As soon as you said this however a strange voice echoes through your head, \"Yay, we won~ I better congratulate them properly~\" and as if compelled to obey the voice you find your body moving on it's own you raise you hands to blow them a kiss, \"Mwah~\", it was a strange action but you found yourself liking. \"But, was it really that strange, that's what a cheerleader does right?\" you say out loud quietly. The more you think on it, the less you can remember about your situation as Marilyn's persona starts to now invade your mind.</span></div></div>",
