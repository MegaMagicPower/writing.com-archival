            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You figured you might as well spend the extra time finishing your work. You change out of your sleep attire (a pair of boxers) into new boxers, socks, jeans, t shirt and your white lab coat. Sneaking from your room down to your lab in the basement proved simple enough since the floor was layered in carpet, making a squeak rare. The basement however, did not share this common attribute with most of the house, with its floor consisting of cold concrete. You approached an old wooden workman's table that was pushed up against the wall in the middle of the basement, (aka your \"laboratory\") and begun to get ready to resume your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt nervous and wiped your sweaty palms on the front of your jeans. All your hard work finally appeared to be paying off. You got a bottle of water from the mini fridge and chugged the refreshing beverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t shared the nature of your research with anyone else. Choosing instead to tell curious family members that it was just the startup to building your own computer, which of course was a lie. In reality, you were constructing what would hopefully be the worlds first functioning shrink device<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeasing was something you suffered constantly, from bullies and friends alike. Poking at your strong interest in science, making fun of your ways and somewhat geeky behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kept you going was the strong confidence in that soon, it wouldn't matter. Your invention would win the science fair and make you millions of dollars. You sit on your chair, place your phone down out of the way and begin the finishing touches on the device. You noticed however, that your phones notification light was blinking. You turn it on and see that you had missed a text from your best friend Mitchell. He must have sent it right before you went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats up dude. You almost done that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one exception to nobody knowing what you were truly working on what Mitch. You two had known each other since kindergarten and remained friends all the way to present day. While you had chosen to focus more on studies in your upbringing, Mitch had opted to be a more social creature. Attending parties on the regular, making friends wherever he goes and becoming quite popular at school and the ladies in particular. Sometimes you wondered why he would stay friends with you, but a quick thought about what kind of person Mitch was shut that thought down immediately. You had never known a more loyal person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot back a quick \"almost\" before shutting your phone off and continuing with the final touch on the device. The device resembled that of a tv remote with an antenna poking out from the top acting as the \"barrel to the gun\" so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was finally complete! You opt to test it out on a rat you kept hidden under the desk for this very occasion. You reach under and grab the cage you kept it in and place it on your desk, keeping it in one place with a slice of roast beef before aiming, typing in the size setting to 7 mm, and pressing the red button marked \"S\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noticeable emission that resembled a heat wave focused onto the rat, enveloping it completely and blurring its image to your eye. You notice the rats size has begun to diminish down to about the size of a grain of rice. The waves cease and the rice grain sized rat is left happily chewing on a massive piece of roast beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely contain yourself, just managing to stop yourself from yelling out in complete and utter joy to avoid waking your sleeping family. The next step was to test the growth setting, so you press blue button marked \"G\" and revert the rat to its original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed to be working swimmingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You literally could not wait to get this to school and show it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the device, run upstairs, take a shower, brush your teeth, pack your bag along with the shrink ray and run back downstairs to gorge down a bowl of rice krispies before booking it outside and speed walking down to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to get their early to start setting up your booth in one of the gymnasiums. You arrived at the school and head to the gym. The tables were already set up in rows spanning the length of the gym. You pick a spot near the door. A table sat there all alone, seperate from the others, which suited you well. You wanted to have lots of room for the crowds when they got a whiff of your invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your backpack ontop of it to claim it, then you decide to walk the halls to kill time. After all, the science fair was going to take place after school. You keep the remote in your pocket and exit the gym. You walk past the cafeteria and see some of your friends sitting at one of the tables. They were the ones who get dropped off early because theyre parents had to go to work early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit with them until the first bell rings, then you head to your first class.</span></div></div>",

You both had Math as your first subject and decided to walk in before the second bell rang. At that point you were the only ones in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much,\" he replied. \"Just sitting around my house, probably get the crew to play some Halo. What about you? You down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course Im down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both were standing there talking, the teacher, Mrs. Gray, walked by and said, <br>\r\n\"Good morning guys. I have to run down to the library quickly to make some copies. I'll be back in a moment.\" The two of you watched her leave out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back around to continue your conversation with Nick, and you noticed how giddy you were becoming at the thought of the science fair once you revealed your invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Whats with the look?\", Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look? What look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sweating and your giving off some wild vibes. Whats up with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently you werent very good at hiding excitement. You supposed it was just getting to hard to contain it this long. You had to tell someone before your head blew up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright listen I'll tell you. But you cant tell anyone until the science fair after school. I mean it man, this is big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big can it be? Its just a stupid science fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats just the beginning. Im going to use it to get the word out about my invention! All the people and their phones, it will be all over the world by tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit! If its that awesome let me take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was going to be the first person to lay eyes on the invention of the century! This was the precursor to everything! This was going to be not only Nicks reaction, but everyones! You hoped it would be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great patience you slowly reached into your pocket, hoping to add a layer of suspense, which Nick clearly wasnt going for. So with a quickened pace you pulled the device out and showed it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe of course didnt realize whay it was he was looking at, so you informed him with a brief explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. You're telling me you made a shrink ray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded slowly with anticipation for the moment Nick would freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, thats just a weird remote. You're fucking with me.\"</span></div></div>",

The remote sparks in your hand and emits a bright blinding light that engulfs you and Nick in its rays! You both let out surprised shrieks as your sizes dwindle down to that of ants on the vinyl tile floor with no one around but the two of you as witnesses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your vision cleared, you knew right away what had happened. Though the reason why escaped your knowledge. Somehow, your genius invention had backfired and put you and Nick in place of the desk you had intended to target. Speaking of Nick, you looked over where  you last saw him and spotted him in the distance underneath his own skyscraper sized desk. From the looks of his movements, he was currently in the middle of a mental breakdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The area surrounding you was almost overwhelming as desk legs rose thousands of feet into the air holding their landscape of a desk top above it. There were also pebbles and pieces of dirt detached from shoes of students over the past couple days laying in your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes but you were finally within a comfortable earshot of Nick, who was now backed up against a metal desk leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you gathered up the air in your lungs to call out, large ground shaking thumps began to appear, each one louder than the first.. you slowly turned your head to see two large black tennis shoes crash down near you. You looked up to see the figure of your giant math teacher, Mrs. Gray, back from the library and now looking at the desk you almost shrunk.. but it wasn\u2019t the desk she was looking at, it was the device on top.. the remote!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u201d you said out loud while also looking back at Nick who was frantically waving his arms now trying to get the teachers attention. Without any luck, Nick have you and took a dead sprint towards the giant black tennis shoes and jumped onto a shoe lace.. and you knew you had to as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to the opposite shoe, the one closest to you, and jump on the other shoelace just as Mrs. Gray was about to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From here, you could even hear the slightest peep from his screams, filled with vulgar words from what you could tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut atleast you knew where Nick was,... what was really worrying you was the fact you couldnt see jack shit of the shrink remote! There was no sign of it down here on the floor anywhere! Which could only mean it had landed on the chair or table of your desk, miles above your head, with no way up there but glass smooth steel legs! This whole situation was fucked and should simply not be happening. You tested the thing this morning and it was flawless, so what the hell made it shit the bed like that? It was so ridiculous, you bowed your head in shame, when suddenly you heard the sound of fast approaching footsteps behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt surprised you to see Nick sprinting full force in your direction a few feet away at that point, what didnt surprise you was that you didnt even have time to dodge as the star of the track team blitzed himself straight into your gut, knocking the wind out of you and sending you down on your back with him on top of you. You gasp and choke for air and Nick cuffs his fists around the collar of your shirt, lifting your head closer to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do!?\", he squeeked in pitchy voice. \"The desk you idiot! I thought you were shrinking the desk! Not us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to signal Nick to show you mercy as you tap his shoulder as if this was MMA. Your lungs were still devoid of air as you coughed and wheezed. This seemed to do the trick, as Nick released his grip and stood over you, watching you roll around on the floor. Your suffering must have imbued pity into Nick, because you soon found him helping you to your feet, though not as gently as what would have been appreciated. Once steady on your feet, you take a few moments to catch your breath, and soon you recover, straightnening yourself to meet Nicks eyes with your own, seeing him giving you the evilest look youve even seen on a mug in your life. You raise a defensive hand, signaling him to chill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Nick *cough cough*, just relax. This was not supposed to happen alright. It malfunctioned. But we'll fix this okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fix it!? You fucking better man! This is bullshit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick! We need to get back to the remote. Its gotta be somewhere up there.\", you say, pointing to the sky at your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we supposed to get it if its way up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly man... beats me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I will beat you. Figure it out already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, at the end of Nicks outburst, you hear the ear screaching creak of the classroom door as it opens to allow a horde of ginormous students to enter, each taking booming footsteps on their way to their desks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh no. This isnt good.\", you say in a mousy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\", Nick asks with veins in his forehead. \"They wont see us to make fun of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they could step on us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of your eyes grow wide as you both turn your heads to the first of the approaching students in this row, your friend McKenzie, with her crushing sandal clad feet! You and Nick both scream in terror as you turn to run in the opposite direction, and you look behind your back to see the bottom of the sandal moving fast towards you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of death flood your mind, for you thought you would be flattened beneath the black EVA sole into paste without anybody noticing. But by a miracle, Kenzies foot slams down just a hair behind your ass, sending a shockwave of force out that blasts you and Nick forward onto your bellies! You slide across the floor before coming to a halt just infront of the classrooms back wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lucky you and Nick always sat at the back of the class, or else there would be no way you would be safe right now. Nick was the first one to stand up and he rushes over to help you stand up aswell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You good?\", Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Because I dont want to alarm you, but Kenzie has your damn shrink ray!\", he says, while pointing a shaky finger up at your towering friends hand, which was currently clutching yours and Nicks only chance at salvation!</span></div></div>",

We better examine you now to make sure you are okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe examination is as ordinary as can be except for the fact that you are only a few inches tall and you have an audience. But there is at least one pretty girl in the audience that smiles at you, encouraging you. So you take your shirt off. The doctor's stethoscope is as big as you so they are limited in what they can examine. The doctor instructs you to stand in a petri dish under a microscope while he examines you. He very carefully shines a light in your ear and then later looks down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow comes the more difficult part. He asks you to lower your underwear for a pelvic exam. He tries to feel your balls but his finger is as big as you so the underwear gets in the way. So you finally just ditch them and after he's done, you stand there with your hands on your hips looking at the smiling young girl. You know she's flirting with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Simmons says, \"Okay we can proceed to see just how small this device goes to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of your small size, it is more difficult for Mr. Simmons to target you but before you manage to grab any clothes, you feel the beam and know you're shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Simmons says, \"If I'm reading this right, you are now one tenth of a meter tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and everything is so huge now that you can barely tell what anything is anymore. Even your clothes that are sized for a few inch tall person now look they could cover a football field. You look up at the microscope lens towering above you and notice the doctor is looking down the lens at you. Even magnified under the microscope you only look like you are four millimeters tall. You're a third the size of a pixel. Some rice fell out of your pocket into the petri dish and even though the rice was one twenty fourth it's normal size, each grain was twice as big as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can barely see the pretty girl anymore.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't even keep yourself awake. The vertigo soon became pure nauseousness and you found yourself slowly tipping over as you drifted into sleep. Your gradual return to full consciousness extended over a period of about fifteen minutes. You were staring up at a ceiling that now seemed like it was miles and miles above you. Not that you could even really realize that, because your body and senses felt so exhausted that you could barely stand up straight, let alone move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... my head.\", you grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, weakness was overtaken by returning energy in your body and your senses cleared.

It looked the size of a 4 story building. Upon further inspection you realized this was the shrinking device! It must have fallen on the floor when you used it on yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! It was supposed to shrink with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran over to the device and attempted to scale it in order to reach the buttons, but the sides were all to smooth to climb. If you wanted to return to normal size you would need someone to help you. Your only solace was the side effect you had engineered into the device that caused the targets molecules to become more dense, allowing the subject to take much more damage than a regular person and still be able to push on, but they were by no means invincible. This also made the subject considerably stronger, but no where near extreme levels. You figured that at the very least this would make your situation easier than had you shrunk and remained a weakling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to make sure it actually worked... you figured you had to test it. So very hesitantly, you went down on all fours, and prepared to smack your head against the concrete floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUD*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well that didn't hurt much at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the impact but no lingering feeling of dizziness or pain remained. Now that that question was more or less checked off, you now had to test out your strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? Well... I've always wanted to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip over onto a handstand and proceed to do one handed push ups with ease. Maxing out at 50 before the blood rushing into your head forced you back upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much you could do now except sit around and wait for something to happen. Whether that something was an idea or an event. You sit down and lean up against the white walls of the device and calm yourself down. It wasn't all that bad. Your new found strength and durability could make this whole thing into a fun adventure. There was no rush to even return to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed. You felt a chill. Your eyes snapped open. A way upstairs couldn't come soon enough. It was freezing in this damn basement.You grunted and lifted yourself onto unsteady feet. A large wall of white was behind you. You walked closer to the expanse and touched the wall. It felt like smooth glass. Doesn't matter how strong you were, only Spider Man could climb up this wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything looks so big!\u201d This was still so astounding to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou compared yourself to the device to give yourself a rough guesstimate on your height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must be around an inch tall!\" You exclaimed. \"Good.

And with your new strength and tougness, you felt confident you would be okay so long as you kept your head and didnt do anything too stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inch closer to Jessicas heel, your eyes locked straight ahead, staring at the wall of flesh that took up your entire field of vision. You had to crane your neck far back to be able to see the underside of your step sisters ass. Her being crouched at the moment, meant her thighs and ass loomed in the sky like some sort of alien mothership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your hands on her heel. Her skin was warm and smooth and actually had a fair grip to it. You had no doubts you could climb all the way up to the pockets in her shorts with little effort. You also make sure to remove your shoes and socks so your feet can climb as easily as your hands. Now that you were ready, you proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica didnt know it, and they were definetly more or less invisible to the naked eye, but your tiny eyes could make out small hairs that protruded from her skin, allowing you to grip them and ascend higher easier. You had just reached the upper portion of her calf, and due to her being crouched, her muscle was flexed, making it harder for you to climb. You wanted your grip to remain as soft as possible as to not alert Jessica that you were crawling up her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Jess had begun to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\", you grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a longer trip to her pockets now. But you continue on up her leg as she walks towards the stairs. After scaling the back of her knee you reach her thigh. Thankfully, there was more flesh to grip onto here, but the slight vibrations of her walking caused the thigh to jiggle with each step she took. You hang on tight, noticing Jessica's massive arm swinging past you as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you are able to grab onto the hem on her denim shorts where you hang precariously only by a loose thread.</span></div></div>",

You decide to wait until she reached the top of the steps to make any sort of move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walks through the doorway to the basement and shuts the door behind her. In doing so, she catches the attention of your younger step sister, Anna, who is sitting at the kitchen table with her back towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess?! Ohhh hiiii... I thought you were gone.\", Anna smiles nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here? You have school.\", said Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's eyes trail off, obviously implying that she is cooking up some excuse other than she skipped today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you took this opportunity to clamber around Jessica's thigh to right beneath her crotch, where you reached up and grabbed the seam that ran down it, allowing you to get close to the bottom teeth of the zipper. You brave a leap towards them and manage to hang on. This point was smooth sailing, as all you had to do was simple climb up the teeth, over the tab, and onto the button of her shorts. You figure you could take a short break here so you look over at Anna and listen in anticipation to what she was cooking up to tell her big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\", Jessica asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a half day... no... uh... we all got a spare period for... cuz... our teacher was away and they couldn't get a supply in time. Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica places a hand on her hip and smirks in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im not going to tell mom. But dont make a habit out of this alright? Class is more important than you think dummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah. Did you give Josh that speech too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wondered what Anna meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh? No, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was downstairs wasnt he? I heard him go down there earlier and his bag is still here.\", Anna said, pointing to a packed backpack in the corner of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wasnt down there when I was. If his bag is still here then he cant be far away. You know how he his with school. You should take notes from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ha ha.\", Anna laughs sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on Jessica's shorts, you chuckle. Jess had no idea how close by you really were. You reach underneath Jessica's shirt and grab onto the waistband of her shorts, hoisting yourself up and bringing you just underneath her belly button. You balanced yourself on her waistband, leaning up against her soft tummy and hopping high enough to reach a hand inside her navel and pull yourself inside. At your size, you had to get into the position. You were honestly surprised Jess hadn't felt you yet. You were small but not that small. Then again, you kept your movements quick and controlled the whole way up here. You take a quick breather, while relaxing in the warmth and comfort of the belly button and listening to the gurgles coming from inside the stomach. Her tummy expanded and retracted with each breath she took. You could easily fall asleep in her navel, and perhaps some time, you could give it a shot. As creepy as that sounded.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou hear Jessica saying bye to Anna and exiting the house, suddenly allowing light to seep through the threads of her shirt and giving you a much clearer new look at your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica enters her car and starts to drive off. It isn't long before she is dialing one of her friends she is going with, to tell her shes back on her way and should be there in a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jessica's stillness pretty much guaranteed for the next few hours you decide to...</span></div></div>",

Screaming, you dodge the thumb of this giant dancer and roll down a wrinkle of the fabric only to bump into the city block sized index finger, the skin acting as a wall for you to regain composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, still curious, lifted the shirt from the ground and examined it.. she had seen this shirt before.. on someone? But who? She held it up a little bit higher to see the writing on the shirt to see if that would give her any clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn doing so, you lose your footing, and you are now bouncing off the hanging fabric of your own mountain of a shirt.

All you could see was it had gone past her lips, but you didnt know if she had swallowed it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart felt like it was 100 pounds. Did that seriously just happen? <br>\r\n\"Aw shit.... looks like ive got no choice. Bombs away!\", you yell, letting go of the shirt and beginning your own plummet onto the ginormous, gorgeous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour millimeter size protects you from the worst of gravity's predations, as you land with nothing more than a disorienting thud on the bridge of Megans nose. When you have shaken the dizziness from your head, you register the warm flesh beneath you as soft yet hard enough to maintain a steady grip on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good thing too, as Megan had finished inspecting the mystery shirt, determining it was yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, suddenly felt the urge to leave, if Josh was last seen down here, and now only his clothes were here, the only logical conclusion Megan could come up with at the moment was she just interrupted Josh's private time and he was now hiding from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan cringed as she dropped the shirt in a hurry and turned to speed walk up the stairs, doing her best to suppress a giggle from escaping her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these movements made staying put pretty difficult for you. You had to dig your heels and nails into the skin as much as you could to keep yourself safe from tumbling off. You were not leaving this nose until you were ready, it was too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan reached the top of the stairs and walked out into the kitchen where your mother, Jess and Anna were all eating a small breakfast at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Josh coming? The foods going to get cold.\", said your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ...uhm... hes kind of busy at the moment. You know how he is, always working ehehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegans dry chuckle left Jess wondering what was up, evident by her raised eyebrow, but she wouldnt inquire in front of Joshs mom. Whatever Josh was doing, that was his problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd quite a problem it was. Stranded on Megans nose, your only salavation trapped somewhere inside her body, and everybody completely unaware of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing you could think to do to get started on solving this...</span></div></div>",

Megan has an absolutely beautiful face and you always admired how well she took care of her skin. But now, being this close and on the bridge of her nose, you could see all the minor imperfections.. the pores which were the size of manholes you\u2019d find on the street polluted the nose in all directions. As gross as it was, you used them for gripping. Of course you find it easy being the size of the point of a pencil\u2019s lead. You could see the downward path of the nose as it came to an end in between two fleshy mounds that occasionally flared up.. Megan\u2019s nostrils. Gazing up you see the uphill terrain leading to two giant orbs the size of the Disney\u2019s Epcot ball.. maybe even larger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh focus..\u201d you reconvene. \u201cOk, so either I risk it off the nose to Megan\u2019s mouth to attempt to find a very tiny - nearly \u2018impossible to see\u2019 device which may or may not even still be there and possibly get swallowed.. or I can play it safe and go to Megan\u2019s ear and attempt attention from there.. where I could be pulverized by her finger if I cause any slight irritation..\u201d<br>\r\nYou guess it\u2019s 50/50 either way. May as well explore while being dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin your ascent up the bridge of the nose of your boyhood crush. You never in a million years thought you\u2019d get this close to her. Little by little, pore by pore, you navigated you\u2019re way as Megan began to eat her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last you made it between Megan\u2019s eyes. Even if she crossed them, you were too far between the space for her to see you. Relieved she hasn\u2019t felt irritation from your commute, you rest for a minute while holding onto the micro hairs between her eyes and eyebrows. You already began to formulate a plan to use them in the next step of your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table Jess and Anna were snickering about some form of gossip. Megan didn\u2019t seem to take interest as she was still recovering from the thought of accidentally walking in on Josh.. if that was even what he was doing. \u201cGosh how embarrassing for both of us\u201d She thought. Megan continued to eat her food lost in her own thought.. so lost that even the irritation in her eyebrow was not enough for her to even flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s good news for you. You used the micro hairs to get above Megan\u2019s left eyelid and above that, her her eyelashes. You now found yourself in a forest of brown, neatly trimmed eyebrows. Luckily they were thick enough for you to easily navigate. Terrified of the potential finger, you had made your way inside the barrier of hair and now ducking and climbing over thick hairs. It was a whole new perspective - seeing the world from the eyebrow of a young woman.. but there was really no time to sightsee. The remote was inside her and you and your genius brain had no possible alternate solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally after about 5 minutes of climbing and ducking, you find yourself at the far end of Megan\u2019s eyebrow. You couldn\u2019t see it, but your basic knowledge of human anatomy told you the top of her ear was level with her eyebrow, so all you had to do was grab a hair hanging down from her head and swing around the corner. Luckily Megan\u2019s hair was not in a pony tail and some was in fact hanging down near her left eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting your footing on an eyebrow hair and with a snag of dark brown head hair in your hands, you tested the buoyancy of the hair and determined that it would give you a boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeronimo\u201d you peep out of your mouth and jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan has finished her food. She stands up quickly and stretches, unaware she possibly foiled her tiny passengers plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unexpected G-force:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Phase one was to test the physical capabilities and working functions of your shrinking device.  This was a rousing success, as the test on the rat demonstrated it can shrink and grow exceptionally well.  Now it was time for phase two.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to a closet where you hid a certain object from your mom and brother.  It was a three foot submarine, that you originally purchased from a science store.  It was originally just a very expensive toy.  It had propellers and wings and was capable of flight.  You had taken it upon yourself to build a control panel inside of the cockpit, allowing you to control the sub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother major modification you made to this submarine was you had managed to remotely wire it to the shrink ray.  While the submarine was not able to grow and shrink itself, you had to manually connect it to a slot in the subs control panel, so that you could at least activate and fire the shrink ray from inside of the cockpit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiming the shrink ray at the submarine, you adjust the settings and fire.  The submarine grows to about ten feet in length.  \"Awesome,\" you whisper to yourself.  You anxiously hop in the submarine and shut the door behind you.  Taking your seat in the cockpit, you connect the shrink ray,adjust a few dials and check the fuel.  Full tank.  \"Okay, here we go,\" you say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing the button in front of you, the shrink ray lights up and fires.  The discharging beam engulfs your sub and begins to diminish you in size.  The submarine shrinks from 10 feet long, barely fitting in your basement, to about 1/4 inch long, the size of an ant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to laugh hysterically as you control the now tiny vehicle.  Activating the flight functions, the sub is now flying through the air.  \"I'm so winning the science fair this year,\" you laugh to yourself.  Then you pause and think about that.  \"Fuck that, I'm gonna be rich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fly into the upper level of your house, you realize the window is open.

Realizing there is an opening at the bottom of the door wide enough for you, you fly the sub low and sneak under.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now flying through the metropolis that is your mother's bedroom.

We didnt even have any idea you existed!\", you take a breath and calm yourself. \"Okay just tell me, what are you doing in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I just wanted an adventure if im being honest. God mo... your mother, shes revered as the goddess of all gods. Our people worshipped her ever since we colonized here twenty years ago. And I suppose I wanted to test myself against her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you didnt know any better, you'd believe this all to be some mad fiction spun up by your diseased brain. Hell, youd be less surprised to find yourself waking up out of a deep coma dream than you were to find out an actual diminutive civilization has been settled in your home for longer than you have even been alive! These little bastards had grown up with you and your family and you were none the wiser!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention focused back onto Laylette, who looked nervous and bashful as if she just confessed her most deep guarded secret. Her eyes flickered from you to the ground as she twiddled her thumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okaaaay, so what? You're looking for adventure? I guess I can buy that, its just...\", you take in the immediate surroundings. The sticky floors, the protruding hairs in the walls,  the echo of your voices and the light seeping in from the entrance of the ear.<br>\r\n\"Well, why would you be HERE specifically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange girls response was quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are YOU in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didnt really have an answer. Not one you felt comfortable sharing anyway. After all, shrinking down and entering your mothers ear deliberately  would make you look like a creep, thats why you were planning on not telling anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, dont tell me.\", Laylette said, breaking the silence between the two of you. \"Regardless of what you believe you and your mother are, to us, you are our gods and saviours! My people were nomads before they arrived here. Your family provided us with shelter, food and safety from the dangers of the outdoors. However, when i hear the stories of my ancestors, holding back hordes of ants with nothing but their own furociousness,... I dont know, it just made me feel so incompetent. I thought that by going on my own journey on 'Jennifers' body, and conquering whatever challenges i would come across, then I could prove to myself that I had what it took to finally leave my people and take on the outside world next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice echoed down the cavernous ear canal, you were afraid it would attract the attention of your mom but she appeared to be too occupied by the television to pay attention to whats going on inside her own head, made evident by the sounds of the introduction tune to 'Love Island' playing in the background. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Id say if I were going on an adventure like this, the ear would be my last stop... atleast now that I know how bad it smells in here. Mom really needs to squirt some febreze in this place.\", you joke, expecting a reaction from Laylette who instead, looks at you with a puzzled expression. You give a defeated sigh. \"Anyways, why dont you come with me? Im sure the world would love to meet you and theres plenty of adventures out there even when your regular sized... oh sorry... giant sized, in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying? You want to bring me to your world? Make me a goddess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we're not... whatever... sure, yeah thats what Im saying. Ive never met anyone quite like you. Its your choice but if your goal is to leave your people behind, this is as good as going off into the wilderness of a backyard on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didnt tell her, but you had your own motives for wanting her out of here. Not only would your inventions bring you worldwide scientific acclaim, but the discovery of a miniature species would only further stengthen your mark in the history books as one of the greatest minds of all time! You didnt know how the outside world would react, but you doubted they would run any inhumane experiments on her. After all, Laylette may not exactly be human, but shes not so far off that people would treat her like an animal. You felt confident she would be fine in the long run, but she would need to go with you first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her ponder her decision. \"You have a way to bring me to a gods height?... And bring me back to normal should i choose to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. Its attached to my ride that I left parked on my moms... pillow... what the fuck was I thinking!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaylette steps back in surprise while you continue to curse yourself. Thoughts of self harm in the form of punching yourself in the face flood your mind. You couldnt believe you had had such a complete mental shutdown, as to leave your only source of regaining your height, right next to your giant mother who could crush it flat at any moment! Pillow or not, that sub would never sustain the weight of even her pinky finger! Luckily, your mother hadnt seemed to move around much since your time inside her head, you felt a few shuffles to get herself comfortable in bed and things like that, but nothing too chaotic that would destroy your precious inventions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laylette! Make your chouce because I need to go right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I decided! Ill come with you!\", she exclaimed. She looked very bemused by this whole outburst even as she excitedly announced her decision. You couldnt blame her, but that didnt matter right now. You quickly grabbed her hand and took off in a mad dash back down the way you came towards the exit of your mothers ear canal. Your boots stuck to the floor with each long step, like you were running across syrup, but it did little to slow the two of you down. Ahead, through the circular exit, you could see a section of wallpaper of your mothers bedroom, along with just the edge of a lampshade that provided you with the literal 'light at the end of the tunnel'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you both slow to a jog as you exit the cavernous ear canal and stand just in front of a large wall of cartilage blocking any way to walk forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... the antitragus. It was pretty difficult getting over that on the way in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you getting tired?\", Laylette pokes playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth be told? Yeah, kinda. You dont get to break through science by being a jock you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lucky for you, humites are excellent climbers. Its all in our hands and feet. Theyre like an insects!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaylette holds her hands palm forwards to your face for you to look at. Closely, hidden in the pattern of her fingertips, were small thorn like structures, very much reminding you of a certain scene in a spiderman movie. This just got a whole lot better for you,... real life spidermen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you shoot webs?\", you found yourself asking against your will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you wanted to punch your own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, uhm... Ill climb up to the too of the... whatd you call it...antitragus?... then ill hoist you up from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Laylette approached the wall of flesh and with what looked like no effort at all, scaled it in less than 3 seconds. She layed her belly on the outer side of the cartilage and peered down at you with her hands outstretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just get a running start, get as high up as you can, then Ill grab you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed her instructions and pushed with all your effort to rise as high up the outer ear part as you could. With your hands held high above your head, Laylette grabbed your wrists and helped drag you up to her level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the two of you found yourselves sitting on the precipice of your giant mothers ear  overlooking her room like you were on the Eiffel tower in Paris or something. It was incredible that something that used to be so familiar and mundane, had now filled you with wonderment! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was for sure. You would never pay to sightsee the pyramids, the grand canyon, none of it. That shrink ray could create spectacles of anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you continued to take in the view, when...</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re the one who still controls the shrink ray, and by default, her fate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell should we get to the sub?\u201d you ask, turning to Laylette.  Out of the extremely dark cave that was your mother\u2019s ear, you can finally get a much better look at your humanoid friend.  This \u201chumite\u201d was actually quite stunning.  She was less than half your height and had some peculiar facial features such as her tiny ears, unusually large nose, and eyes which flowed in the dark, but besides that she was very attractive.  She had shoulder length brown hair, and a very toned body, with voluptuous breasts (for her size) and an ass toned from years of climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Laylette, how old are you?\u201d you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell God Josh, I am nineteen years old.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d you thought to yourself, you didn\u2019t expect her to be living in this house since before you were born.  Your train of thought is interrupted when your mother clears her throat.  Normally this couldn\u2019t be anything, but being so small and still partially in her ear, this was extremely loud.  Laylette looked panicked.  \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d you say, pulling you and Laylette out of the ear as the two of you start trekking down Jennifer\u2019s facd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking and talking, you spot the sub.  \u201cThere\u2019s our ride,\u201d you laugh, and grab Laylettes hand.  \u201cSo what\u2019s the first thing you\u2019re gonna do when you\u2019re a goddess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaylette bites her lips and gives you a cute smile.  \u201cI\u2019d like to visit my civilization and terrorize them,\u201d she said with a giggle.  \u201cAlso to mate with you out of gratitude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze in your tracks upon hearing this, but didn\u2019t need to be told twice.  \u201cWell let\u2019s get in then!\u201d you say enthusiastically, helping Laylette into the 1/4 inch sub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing that the sub is only twice the length of your body, it\u2019s a right fit.    Despite Laylette ring very small, there was only one place for Laylette to sit:  on your lap.  She knew this and smiled, purposely wiggling her butt into your crotch.  You try to control it but feel an erection coming on anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, lifting off in three....two....one.\u201d  You and Laylette are now safely in the miniaturized submarine flying in your mother\u2019s room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, where should we go?\u201d you ask your tiny companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know!

You passed out unconscious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up!\" you hear and shoot to your feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....what happened,\" you say in a defensive panic, looking around.  You realize something was wrong.  This tiny girl, who had previously been the size of an instant compared to you, was now lookingnyou in the eye.  \"Wait,\" you say looking around.  The cavern that was your mom's ear seemed much larger than before.  \"What did you do to me?\" you yell at the girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked very nervous.  \"I did nothing.  But the officials, the ones who sent me to be sacrificed, having been tracking my heart rate,\" she said, showing off the device.  \"When they realized you had saved me, they reduced your to our size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words hit you like a brick.  You were one millimeter in height.  One!  The first thought was that you were probably too small to operate your mini sub, let alone get into it.  This was going to take all of your wits to get out of.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say, trying to take this like a champ.  \"what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had a terrified expression.

There was a semi-human civilization of \"humites\" living in your house, who worshipped you, your brother, and your mom gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so small, God Josh?\" she asked, touching your hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to think of the best way to explain what happened.  \"Well, I created a device that shrunk me to the size I was when I found you,\" you say, but then pause.  \"But I think I'm too small to be able to fix this by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaylette can see you are clearly upset.  \"God Josh, I may have an answer for our problems,\" she insists.  You turn your attention to her again. \"What if I can help you get back to this device.  Would it be able to return you to your ro final size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug.  \"It should, but we would need more help than just us getting there.\"  You feeling very dejected right now, having no idea how you get out of this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaylette continued.  \"Suppose we were able to get help though,\" she said before awkwardly pausing.  \"Would you be able to make me your size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her in a confused way.  \"I....I guess so,\" you say.  \"You want to be a giant like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaylette looked like she was about to cry.  \"It might be my only hope for survival.  I'm an outcast who tried to avoid the great sacrifice.  If they ever find me, they'll kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your arm around her.

He simply found your Goddess of a mom unbelievably irrestiable and wanted to make her his own bride.  The thought of having their Goddess as his wife was both a power move and a lustful decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, will you help us?\u201d the general asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re not growing me back, so we both know you\u2019re not growing her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general sits there silently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd another thing, I\u2019m gonna guess you don\u2019t want her small to communicate.

You had called his bluff, and you were absolutely right.  \u201cWhy do you want her, and be honest,\u201d you say, trying to control yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general shrugged.  \u201cWell, it\u2019s quite simple.  Your mother is physically beautiful, and also a Goddess.  Not only do I find her the most admirable female I\u2019ve ever seen, but marrying her would make her and I rulers of our entire kingdom.  You would also be royalty, Josh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this guy seriously trying to bribe you into shrinking your mom?  By saying you could help rule their tiny civilization by all means.  \u201cForget it, not happening.  Kill me if you want, but I\u2019m not shrinking my mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general shifts into a more serious tone.  \u201cJosh, we need you to consider something serious.  We will kill you, and kill Laylette.  But remember, we will figure out your technology eventually, it\u2019s only a matter of time.  Eventually, we will have Goddess Jennifer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words cut deep.  You did not think this was a bluff at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, if you decide to cooperate, we will return you to your original size,\u201d he says.  Your eyes widen upon hearing this.  \u201cYou can be our new God.  This entire kingdom would be yours, and you could also look after the one you call, your mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general was now making a somewhat convincing argument.  If they killed you, they\u2019d probably find a way to shrink your mom anyway.  This was all so much to process.  What do you decide to do....</span></div></div>",

This was reassuring at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter synching the device up to your shrink ray, the table you are on begins to vibrate.

There was a small flash and you were instantly restored to your average teenage height. You then retrieve the now miniature craft you had just been piloting, grasping it firmly in your palm. You take a deep breathe and prepare to enter Jessica\u2019s room. You feel anxious about the potentially intimate conversation you are about to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you sheepishly knock the door and immediately the familiar voice answers \u201ccome in...\u201d.

I\u2019ve been desperate for you to clue me in.... oh my god did you get it working? Have you shrunk anything yet?

She quickly directs you to sit next to her, which of course you oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ve actually shrunk myself.. and a few other things..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou then reveal your miniature sub in the middle of your hand to a squeal of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are a genius Josh!

She didn\u2019t seem at all surprised you had successfully shrunk yourself..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still need to test it\u2019s original purpose, I need to.. well.. explore a um.. person, and was wondering if... um as you always seemed interested.. and um you well...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nonce again she jumped in to save you from your own verbal embarrassment. This time, she places her hand gently on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosh.. did you want to explore.... me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were struggling to hide your excitement and desire now. All you do in response is smile and look deep into her beautiful eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok Josh, to be honest, I\u2019m flattered. This is ground breaking science right?

Booth seats on the left side, dining tables on the middle, and two person window seats on the right.

You leave the sub hovering in position, grab the megaphone, open the door, and face the cavernous ear canal of your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold the megaphone up to your mouth and scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RISE AND SHINE ASSHOLE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch quickly snaps out of his deep sleep and spasms nearly falling out of his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out in a petrified tone, \"What the fuck!?\"<br>\r\nAs for you, due to a severe lack of planning, the chaos of a panicking giant causes a huge gust of wind to knock you backwards back into the sub and sends it spiraling onto a pillow. You got lucky this time, managing to survive that with only a bruised arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mitch was standing out of his bed and had turned on his lamp light on his nightstand. He scanned the room for any intruder but upon seeing no one, believed it to be just the climax of a horrible nightmare. That is until in an instant a flash blinded him and now in the middle of his room was 10 foot alien looking vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had a chance to scream, Mitch saw your face in the cockpit window, which now made him more confused then terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh? What the hell is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exited the sub, and signaled for him to quiet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude relax. Remember the project I've been working on? I got it to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shrink ray? Are you joking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously not man. It works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit. Thats incredible. What are you going to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now just have fun. Later... who knows. Anyways, your coming along. What do you want to do?\"</span></div></div>",

Can we use this to fuck with her?\u201d  Kari was Mitch\u2019s 26-year-old sister.  She lived on her own but was currently staying with Mitch and his parents for the week.  She often gave Mitch shit for just being young.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d be stupid to pass up an opportunity like this.  \u201cSure, if that\u2019s what you wanna do,\u201d you respond.  \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch stopped and thought for a second.  He did not want to hurt his older sister at all, just screw with her and pull a prank on her.  Then an interesting idea popped into Mitch\u2019s mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright dude, we\u2019re really fucking small, so what if we entered her body and screwed with her from the inside?\u201d Mitch pitches to you.  You just stare curiously wondering what he meant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, like we\u2019d film it and send it to her, kinda like the movie Fantastic Voyage or Innerspace.  She\u2019d be so confused but wouldn\u2019t be able to explain it.\u201d  Mitch seemed very proud of his idea.  You had to admit, thenplan wasn\u2019t half bad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright bro, I like it,\u201d you say, and begin to pilot the ship out of Mitch\u2019s room.  You fly down the hallway until you reach the base of the guest bedroom where Kari is staying.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying underneath the door, you and Mitch are both taken aback by the sleeping goddess on her bed.  She is sleeping on top of the covers in nothing but a long t-shirt and pair of panties.  \u201cOh shit,\u201d you whisper to yourself, embarrassed to see that Mitch had caught you staring at his older sister.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get inside,\u201d Mitch says with a laugh.  You do as instructed, and begin to fly lower, looking for the best point of entry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you say, steering the ship lower.  \u201cI\u2019m gonna have us enter her body through her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Kari:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/karimiller/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/karimiller/?hl...</a> ) </span></div></div>",

You can\u2019t help but agree, but then turn your focus back to your steering.  Your tiny vessel begins to descend down the slimy tube that is Kari\u2019s throat.  \u201cHoly shit,\u201d you hear Mitch say, as you pass through a giant sphincter and are now hovering inside Kari\u2019s stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view is a combination of amazing, disgusting, and a little bit terrifying.  Below you is a bubbling lake of yellowish green liquid.  There are chunks of semi digested food just sitting in the liquid.  It looks like a giant mound of chewed hamburger that Kari had for dinner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now what?\u201d you ask, wanting to know how your friend planned on fucking with his older sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crept across Mitch\u2019s face.  \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea,\u201d he laughed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Mitch\u2019s plan? </span></div></div>",

You guide the sub down to your backyard, wanting to land it in the field of grass and explore it like a jungle. On your way down you notice your older sister Jess was sitting on the deck reading a book with a cup of coffee next to her on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't expecting anyone one to be out here this early in the morning but seeing as how it was Jess you weren't very surprised.

You needed a moment before rising to your feet to catch your breath from the absolute adrenaline pumping through you from that experience. A part of you couldn't really believe that you were now so tiny that you can stand on the tip of your mothers toe and still compare it to the length of a basketball court!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you begin to stand up. Once you did, you were back to fighting to catch your breath. Seemingly miles up ahead, was the ginormous face of your relaxing mother, completely unaware to the plight of her tiny son and his tiny friend. Your \"tiny\" mind could hardly comprehend the sheer massive scale that your kind, gentle mother had now become to you. Stepping carefully towards the wall that was the toenail, you hoist yourself on top and look down at the steep slope of the top of her foot below you. There was no sign of Mitch anywhere, so you call out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MITCH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response, just the background chatter of the reality show contestants on the tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE ARE YOU!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he couldn't come to you, you would have to go for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two of you fall down the height of the toe, skidding along it until you hit the slope of your mothers foot and began sliding all the way down to her ankle before coming to a stop.

You had to get Mitch to calm down or you were both done for. As he ran at you yet again, you surveyed your surroundings for anything you could use to help, noticing a stray small hair protruding from flesh to your right. You step closer to the hair while keeping your eyes locked on Mitch. Right as he was about to ram you, you move out of the way, trip him, grab the hair and bend it down over him, using it to keep him pinned to the ground. Mitch struggled but eventually calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You calm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh*... yes.\" You help Mitch back up to his feet. \"I'm sorry man. I just lost it.

You can't help but notice monolithic objects that seem to bear a strong resemblance to the objects in your room. Such as a giant dresser, a desk, ... hold on... what?! You look behind you and your whole field of view is taken up by your bed! That's impossible! You quickly realize that you have been shrunk down to what seemed to you around half an inch tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind races, contemplating your next move but your thoughts are interrupted by a series of rhythmic quakes that seemed to perfectly sync with huge echoing BOOMS! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quakes grow larger and larger almost as if they were growing closer and closer. Suddenly, the monolithic bedroom door suddenly opened to reveal...</span></div></div>",

You in here?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom walks further into your room. The floor is shaking from the footfalls. Being out in the middle of the floor was not a good idea to you. Not wanting to be out in the open and risk getting crushed by this giantess that was coming, but you think you should  get help so you had to take that risk. After all, you had no idea how this happened so you needed an outside opinion and of course protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gonna need her help to get out of this mess. The closer your mother stepped to you, the more you could feel a light gust emitting from the force under her feet. You stare up in open mouthed awe at your enormous mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a dark green cami top shirt, bare feet, had polished red toe nails, blue jeans, brown leather belt and a gold necklace. You of course had no attractive feeling towards your mother at regular size (though you couldn't deny she was gorgeous), but at this size, she was for lack of a better word, breath taking. Your friends had often teased you about how hot she was and how lucky you were to have been birthed... well... you get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had grayish blue eyes, tanned skin, and light brown hair with golden blonde highlights, making not just her... ahem... \"assets\"... attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are completely in shock as she proceeds to walk into your room. Her shoes collided into the ground and created earthquakes as she walked towards you! You start to back away but realize that you were frozen in fear and just sheer awestruck. But your survival instincts kick in soon enough, allowing you to turn around and run for your life. You attempt to yell for her attention, screaming her name, but she doesn't look down! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe how small you are, her pinky toe was taller than you! Finally, your mother stops walking. Seemingly stopping at your bed to pick up the stray socks you left on it. She stopped just in time, as her foot was only a few feet (heh) in front of you, meaning her next step could have very well ended your life, reducing you to a gooey smear on the sole of her foot. You had to crane your neck as far as you could if you wanted to be able to see the full length of your massive mom. Even though she was bent over to pick up your socks, her height still sent shivers down your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were holding back the urge to vomit at the excitement of the situation, but now was no longer the time to stand around. You needed to get her to notice you... but she was so huge... how could you possibly get her help?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The toes reminded you of a lineup of boulders that progressively got larger and larger, but sexier. You couldn't believe how small you were but you couldn't remain on the floor where you have no chance. You approach her pinkie toe and reach your hands up to pull yourself up onto it while your mom puts her hands on her hips in disgust at the condition of the room. Once standing ontop of her toenail, you take a moment to truly take in the fact that you were standing on top of a persons toe. You could see your mothers foot in extreme detail, like a desert plain that stretched onto the denim mountain that was her jean clad legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, it looked like your mom was now making your bed. It being a singles bed, meant she did not have to stretch or walk around to straighten out your sheets. You remembered your past complaints you had brought up with your mother about not having a big enough bed, now being thankful for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>God</b>.\", your mom said with frustration. \"<b>Where is that kid?</b>\"<br>\r\nYour moms voice bellows with a loud, echoing voice from above, like soft thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Mom down here! I'm on your toe, look down!!!\" You scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother of course doesn't hear you, and finishes making your bed before she begins to walk towards the door. Her first step almost caused you to slide off her smooth red toenail, so when her foot was back on the ground, you had to make a mad dash towards her cuticle, grabbing on tight to the small fold of skin, milliseconds before her foot was back in the air for another step.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as you creeped yourself out with your decision, you felt crawling inside your moms pants was the best choice in regards to obtaining your goal. You squatted down and gripped under the cuff of her jeans and lifted, managing to open enough of a space for you to slide under. The light went from bright to dimmed as you entered this new environment, only being illuminated from light that seeped between the threads of your mothers pants. The temperature had seemed to heat up considerably in here making the skin you walked on incredibly warm to the touch, which made you want to curl up into a ball and just sleep. You crawled further upwards until you reached her shin and looked up. The full view of the height of her leg was blocked by her crumpled pants but you could see at least as far up as her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized she had tiny hairs that protruded out of her legs. Thanks to your mothers masterful hygiene standards, these little hairs had been cut pretty much down to the stem, making them harder to hold onto. You closely inspect your mothers skin and find that you could probably dig your fingers into small imperfections or grooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point your mother had started leaving the room, sending you on trip to motion sickness as she thunderously stepped down the hallway. You closed your eyes and held your body tight against her shin in an attempt to relax yourself and fight back the waves of nausea. In a matter of seconds you regained yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time for waiting was done. You made no hesitation and climbed up hair by hair and groove by groove. It was very tiring and challenging but eventually you were at her knee. Your mother had stopped walking at this point and you deduced that she must be in the kitchen making breakfast because you could smell gas from the stove and could hear your sister Anna speaking to your mother about eggs. You didn't have time to focus on that now though. At this area of your mothers pants, they seemed to hug her form more than they did the lower leg portion, making your area more confined which as it turned out wasn't that bad of a thing as you could now press your back against the leg and press your feet against the pants, effectively allowing you to take a breather so long as your mother didn't make any drastic movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow having regained your breath, you continue to climb up her thigh and you soon notice the bottom panty line of your moms thong, you are not distracted by dirty thoughts and you climb over the line, continuing up her crotch and towards her waist. You reach the end of the top of her pants and poke your upper body out from behind the waist line, blinding your eyes with a wave of the outer worlds light for a moment before your eyes adjust, revealing nothing of the outside world but the front of an oven door. It seemed you were right about her cooking breakfast. You hoist yourself over the waistline of the jeans and carefully step onto the buckle of her belt below. You knew there was going to be another long climb ahead of you so you decided to rest there before getting back at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You gaze upwards along your mothers torso. It was the same case as her legs... a long way up. It didn't help either that the bottom of her shirt didn't meet the top of her pants but instead left a 1 inch gap that exposed a portion of her bare belly. You figured you would have to use the hairs that went from her vagina to the bottom of her belly button and then reach for her shirt fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, guess that's the plan.\", you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up on the belt and lift yourself back onto the top of her waistline. Your mothers breathing caused her stomach to move in and out and you watched its movement hoping to match your pace of breath with hers in an effort to keep you calm for the second half of your journey. You grabbed on and climbed up, shortly making it to her belly button. You crawl inside and stand in there for a moment. Your feet sinking into the soft flesh like the comfiest, squishiest mattress in the world. You reach out for the fabric of her shirt ahead of you, grab on and start climbing up the inside of her shirt. In there was similar to the upper part of the leg in regards to how it hugged the form of her body. With each exhale from your mothers lungs her bare abs would press against your back sandwiching you into her shirt before retracting again only to press back into you moments later. This continued for the entire climb up her midsection until you saw the underside of her breast's above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice your arms are starting to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit..., I dont know how much longer i can do this\", you groan as you keep grip on the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you can push on enough to rest on top of your mom's breasts. While the thought made you a bit uncomfortable, you know that they are probably the comfiest things to rest on top of and definitely the safest, at least allowing you a clear view of your surroundings and should your mom lean over, you had a strong hunch she was wearing her necklace since she does almost every day, which would keep you secure. Then again, maybe you should just continue up to her shoulder.</span></div></div>",

Even if that environment just happened to be your mothers giant breasts. Drawing out whatever little strength your tiny body had left, you dig your fingers deep into the seems of the fabric and continue your accent upwards into the opening of the plunging cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the relief of your tired arms, this part of the climb actually felt a lot easier. Light of the outside world flooded in from above making your grips easer to find and the extruding assets gave you plenty of room to manoeuvre within the opening. Your mother even seems to be standing fairly still now, which does strike you as odd as she rarely stays still, maybe she\u2019s watching tv?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you near the neckline of her shirt you purposely and awkwardly veer your climb towards your moms right breast, feeling an uncomfortably pleasant  warmth omitting from her tanned flesh as you approach it. You reach the top of her shirt just where her skin meets the fabric of her neckline. Crossing the horizon finally gives you the view of what you at first think could be the kitchen, it\u2019s hard to see as your eyes adjust to the brightness and everything is so far away to your half inch size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted and a little disoriented, you use the last bit of energy you have to throw your tiny body face first onto the soft and stable skin platform above you, any mental discomfort had now been overruled by the physical comfort your moms boobs had to offer and you allow yourself to sink slightly into her soft skin. You  do quickly flip onto your back because it\u2019s getting a little hard to breathe face down and having your manhood pressing into your mothers chest was not doing the  awkwardness any good, despite the fact it felt kinda nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing yourself to rest for a few gives your brain time to catch up with the situation. If your mom happened to look down now she would probably see you, but she would also probably think you were a bug. This would undoubtedly result it you instantly being squashed or flicked. A cold feeling of dread filled your chest, you had to keep moving, you had to get to her ear! That feeling of dread then intensified and spread when you realise the reason for your mothers static position..</span></div></div>",

However, one advantage to being this small was you could make out imperfections in the surface that you could use as hand and footholds to make the climb easier. And even if you fell, this muck would surely save your life... right? Just so long as you dont land on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to climb and it goes easy enough.

You fell backwards on you ass and looked inside the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw something that didnt belong there, but it wasnt an intruder... it was some kind of weird hybrid of a scuba and space suit,  atleast the helmet was, the actual suit aplear3d to be made of leather and metal. And attached to it, you could see a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up after the spinning ceased, and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Josh,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not familiar with me, but my name is Henry Palmer. I am the head of a secret science division of our government known as Project Pym. A group devoted to exploring the past studies of the renowned scientist Ray Pym, who discovered something he refers to as Pymicles. Weird name, i know.  But the point is that these... Pymicles... have the power to shrink and grow at will, which Ray managed to harvest and control in this suit in secret. When he passed away, he entrusted this suit to me, but i have learned about a plot within my organisation to steal this suit and use it for nefarious purposes.  I had no choice but to dispose of it. Perhaps, im a fool, but i chose to give it to you simply out of a completely random search on facebook that came up from me smashing my hands on a keyboard. Ive done enough peeping into your life to tell your a decent kid, and i trust you'll keep the suit safe should i ever return for it. Dont worry, the upside to this is that they have no way of tracing that suit to you thanks to you being a random boy. I only hope that you dont use it for wrong doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry Palmer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck? Is this a prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss the note aside and study the suit. What kind of prank could this be? It smelled decent so nobody put any shit or anything in there. You picked up the suit and opened the zipper, putting in on and zipping it back up. You then walked to the mirror and looked at your self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... this looks pretty badass actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admired yourself in it. Flexing, posing and playfighting. You did notice that there was some kind of screen on your wrist, like a built in ipad mini. You turned it on, and a plethora of options filled the screen. One that stood out to you was the first one, which had a white siloutte of a person, with a larger black silhouette behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Lets see what this does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press the button and you suddenly found yourself in a free fall through the air. You didnt even have enough tine to process what was going on when you smacked down on solid ground. Not being to beat up, you rise to your feet and look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in your room but... everything was huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit... this thing really does shrink! This is... this is awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make sure that you can grow back and you can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour couldnt keep track of all the things you could do with this.

It also might be a good bonding experience for you and your mom.  After all, you could surprise her and she would probably be flattered at what you\u2019ve done.

Not having any idea what the suits defense capabilities were, you were shocked when a tiny, green beam fired out of the wrist, directly at your mom.  In a matter of seconds your mom had gone from a full-sized, towering goddess, to a pathetic, two-millimeter tall insect, now on the floor of the house she was selling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" you say in amazement.  This suit not only allowed you to use shrinking technology on yourself, it let you use it as a defense against other people.  This was incredible.  Then your thoughts drifted down to your mother.  You had originally wanted to use the suit to pull a prank on her, but this seemed a bit ridiculous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the suit's telescopic feature, you are able to zoom in towards the floor where your mother had been reduced.  The poor woman had been shrunken to your tiny size, but did not have a suit like yours to protect her, let alone any clue as to why she shrunk.  You can't help but chuckle as you see the tiny woman scampering along the floor and going nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the floor, Jennifer had no idea what was going on.  She had simply swatted at a gnat, or at least what she thought was a gnat.  Now she was stuck at the size of a gnat and stranded on the floor of this house.  \"Alright Jennifer, keep calm,\" she said to herself while hyperventilating.  \"Someone will help you, you can get out of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she had been heard, the floor suddenly started to shake as footsteps approached.  \"HEY JENNIFER?\" a booming yet feminine voice called out.  It was Natalie.  The woman was ready to leave the house and wanted to say goodbye to the real estate agent.  \"JENNIFER I'VE GOTTA GO, WE'LL BE BACK SOMETIME SOON TO LOOK AT MORE HOUSES,\" she called out.  Her giant bare feet stopped inches from your shrunken mother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie wait!  Down here!\" your mother screamed pathetically.  \"You have to help me!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie began to leave, but as she turned her foot, what happened?</span></div></div>",

She had no idea why she was shrunken, but was terrified and alone (or so she thought).  She shifted from screaming and sobbing, to trying to calm and reassure herself that everything was alright.  From your suit, you could pick up that she was trying to convince herself she would not be eaten by an insect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then you developed an idea.  You wanted to keep an eye on your mom to ensure nothing bad or dangerous happened to her, but you also wanted to have a bit of fun while she was tiny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting time, you flew into the nearest room of the house, out of sight from your mom.  Growing yourself back to normal size, you change out of your suit and place it in a closet, you could always come back for it later.

It sounds like they\u2019re cooking breakfast, and smells like it\u2019s gonna be bacon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting the settings on the suit, you manage to shrink yourself even further, until you are a mere two millimeters tall.  You fly out underneath your door into the massive, sprawling hallway.  You gain elevation until you are nearly at the ceiling.

They clearly just woke up a little bit ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the looks of it they\u2019re cooking a pretty tasty breakfast.

You start to fly in front of Jessica\u2019s face when you seem to attract her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica\u2019s giant pupil soon focuses on you, and it honestly scares the shit out of you.  \u201cOh crap!\u201d you say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking you\u2019re a bug, Jessica swats at you.

Your vision was swaying and cloudy, so much so that you couldnt recognize where you were right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground was solid like wood it seemed and you could vaguely tell that you were standing in the middle of an open space... did you land on the floor? On the counter top? No that couldnt be it, your vision was slowly clearing which allowed you to inspect further details. You werent on the floor, but you also werent on the counter. Both of those locations were viewable from where you stood, one far above and one far below. The only place you could be at this height was on top of one of the stools by the kitchen island!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands hold your helmeted head in an attempt to regain your senses.

You and him were smacked out of 3,000 feet of open air and you only survived thanks to some miracle protection from this suit, but Brad wasnt armoured up like you! It was very likely he was nothing but a pile of guts on some solid surface right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Brad. Where are you?\", despite the odds, you couldnt help but feel there was a chance he was alive. There were a few spots he couldve landed from where he slipped out of your hands and flew away. Jessica was in the direction. He could have landed somewhere on her! Or her plate of prepared food, the large plate with paper towel laid upon it for the bacon to be placed on... he could have even landed in her coffee mug, but that would just mean you would find a boiled corpse instead of a smashed on. You could only hope if he was in there, that coffee was near cooled enough for Jess to drink and you could get him before he becomes a part of Jessicas balanced breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, Jessica was now tending to both the eggs and bacon due to her finace \"ditching\" and relieving himself of the responsibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.

You told both her and Brad about the noise in the closet, finding the suit, how Jess almost smacked you into oblivion and the suits little malfunction that shrunk Brad.

But from what they just saw, Brad and Jess had no choice but to believe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... this guy just left this suit in your room?

There was no way you were giving this suit up, its way too cool to even think about that, but there did have to be some kind of safety procedure or rules set in place to keep everyone safe. You think about it, and come up with something that meets both sides in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay how about this. I give Mitch a shout and see what kind of adjustments he can make to this to make it safe enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? Mitch is smart but thats in a different league.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave that up to him. Its worth a shot atleast. If theres nothing he can do than we'll turn it in alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... fine. Call him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get ahold of Mitch on the phone and tell him you'll be stopping by and you have something big to show him, being careful not to give away too many details over the phone. Though he sounds confused he says he'll meet you in his garage/lab in five minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the suit off and put it in a duffel bag then tell Jess and Brad you'll be back soon as you head out the door and walk to Mitchs house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a two minute walk you arrive on his property. The garage was pretty big; Mitch, his dad, and some of of their extended family and friends helped them build it behind the house. Mitch and his dad were both braniacs so they shared it for their work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to the garage and let yourself in, then wait for Mitch to turn up. You set the bag on one of the counters and take a seat. It isnt long before Mitch is walking through the door and greeting you with the secret handshake the two of you came up with as kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whats this big secret you were talking about?\", he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Mitch a look of anticipation, pull the bag closer and open it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This right here... this is a suit, and this suit, once you put it on, gives you the ability to shrink, fly, shrink others and so much more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you being serious right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Completely! The thing is though, there was an incident with Brad and now Jess says if you could put in some failsafes she'll let me keep it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch took the suit out and began inspecting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez. This tech is out of this world. Maybe you are telling the truth. Alright let me see what I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next couple of hours, you watch as Mitch tinkers with the suit, explaining that the suit had an onboard computer built in to control its functions, meaning that Mitch could probably upload things like facial recognition programs to limit the number of people who could pilot the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mitch continued working on the suit, there was a knock on the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sat on the opposite side of Mitch, ready to assist with handing over tools as per your usual arrangement when it came to projects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you had your role, (as small as it was), Brad had nothing to keep him occupied, leaving him to be a giddy mess, always bothering Mitch with questions and fidgeting with unused tools like he was a toddler. Maybe that beam you hit him with damaged his brain? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing right now with that circuit thing Mitch?\", asked Brad with his third question in thirty seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sigh)... Its the circuit board for the computer. Im adding in resistors to keep the current under control for the new installations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah gotcha. And whats that cannister thing in the helmet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like the holding tank for the... god what was that absurd name the scientist used Josh... Pymicles?... Yeesh.

Could you hand me the soldering pen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure Mi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!\", Brad blurted out, reaching across Mitch for the gadget, accidently nudging him in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Brad watch it! This is a very delicate process!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humming starts out quiet at first, to quiet to hear over Brads apologies and your rant about how dumb hes acting, but eventually it grows to loud to be ignored. The three of you look down at the suit and see the holding tank has been cracked, and a blue glow is seeping out of the crack along with thousands of tiny spores that have begun attaching themselves to the three living beings in the area!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic, you all start to swat at them like theyre a swarm of deadly bees, but Mitch, in a desperate attempt to halt the spores, slaps a line of duct tape over the crack, which seems to have done the trick in sealing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the spores had seeped into everyones skin, entering their bloodstream.</span></div></div>",

You decide this is the perfect opportunity to get some payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door is barely cracked, but that's more than wide enough for at least a dozen people your size to enter at once.

Ahead is the vast plateau of Anna's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a bit taken aback as you approach. Seeing inanimate objects in otherwise empty rooms at the size of a flea was downright daunting. To see an actual human being, however, was another thing entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna is a living breathing landscape. She's covered mostly by her bedsheets, her body creating rolling hills and valleys under the purple comforter. Her mighty arms and shoulders, tanned a healthy shade of bronze, are exposed by a grey tank top. Charcoal-colored hair is woven into a single braid so long it disappears under the covers. As powerful as she seems, you can't help but chuckle at your step sister's less-than-graceful sleeping position. She's on her belly with her mouth hanging open, allowing thick drool to ooze onto the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prepare to land, descending toward her huge head. \u201cThis is one small step for Josh\u2026\u201d You snicker as your feet touch down on the wide, golden-brown plain of her cheek.

Despite that, you don't know very much about them. The only thing you know is that the thirty something year old couple have a seventeen year old daughter, a ten year old daughter, and a seven year old son. To point this simply, they're just an average family of five. The house looks just like your own, but it looked a little bigger so maybe you could have some fun around their home while shrunken especially since you never seen what the inside looks like. You also heard that they have a swimming pool so maybe you could go take dip if you feel like (and also check if your new suit was waterproof).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to your left which leads to the park that's was not so far from here. The park was large and vast so it could make a pretty neat place to explore. It was a typical park full of whatever you usually find in most parks (playgrounds, sporting fields, lakes etc). You could simply shrink yourself and travel around like you are almost in the middle of a open wilderness as an insect. Speaking of insects, you hope that this suit have some cool weapons to protect you from giant hungry bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to your right, you thought of starting your shrunken journey inside the shopping mall that was somewhere there. The mall has many thing you usually find in other malls such as a food court, a theater, several shops, and many more. It was very huge too; big enough to have two floors. You'll probably have an awesome adventure and have so much fun depending on what part of the mall you are on. There were many choices but you will have get there and choose for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich will it be?</span></div></div>",

But you doubted it. Considering one of the few times you had a run in with this girl she was wearing a sundress speckled with little horses all over it. You would have thought she looked adorable if she wasnt such an annoying neighbour! With her regular tantrums that can be heard from her house to my room like some kind of wailing banshee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet it not be said that you were one to let an opportunity for a little payback pass you by. Perhaps a little good ol'fashioned destruction of property would make you feel a little better. You knew full well thus would more than likely result in another tantrum, but you didnt care. You had a feeling you would enjoy hearing this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your hands together with giddiness and take off like a bullet with a easy enough target to start the mayem with. A happy little marble pony sat peacefully on a shelf above the fancy white headboard of her queen sized bed. You rocketed up to its horsey head and superman kicked hard enough to cause it to rock back and forth. Following its momentum, you waited for it to lean off the shelf, and with a final shove, sent it tumbling to its demise, smashing ots head off the headboard and coming to its final resting place right on the bed pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPieces of marble littered the neatly made bed, and the decapitated horse head landed rough on the floor away from its body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gang of pleasant emotions filled your soul. This was too fun to stop! Without hesitation you continued on your path of destruction!Hovering above her computer desk, growing to full size and smashing it in half with your weight! Raiding her dresser and throwing clothes everywhere before tipping it over! Grabbing a bottle of nail polish and splashing it on her window like a crime scene! Just a few of the many low blows you commited against this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, there was little left to destroy.</span></div></div>",

Her room was in ruins, but you can't help but feel like there's one thing you're missing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your gaze is drawn back to the bed that the broken marble pony statue rested on. It was lavishly decorated; the covers were large and fluffy, and the edges and corners are lined with toys and plushies--more ponies, of course--and the entire thing was in perfect condition, save for the pieces of marble still littered there. Oh, this was <i>perfect</i>! If there was anything you could wreck that would leave a pretty deep cut, it'd definitely be this! You grow back to normal size, and tear the pretty and probably very expensive blanket right off the bed. It has a large, white unicorn with a rainbow-colored mane right on the center of it, with the rest of the bedding being pink. Uncapping another bottle of nail polish, you get to work, haphazardly spreading the pink liquid all over the fantasy creature's body and mane in sloppy, uneven blotches. To add a finishing touch, you dot some polish over the eyes and draw a sharp-toothed smile where the unicorn's muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you grab the trashcan in the corner of the room, and start dumping it out onto the bed and floor, taking care to get the brunt of the waste onto the blanket, still on the ground. Apparently, she was using glitter for something, because boatloads of the stuff were dumped out along with candy wrappers, chip bags, and crappy discarded arts &amp; crafts projects. The carpet was stained with art supplies, and it'd take weeks to get all of the gunk out of there. Not only that, the blanket was completely ruined! She'd be in tears when she comes back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing maniacally to yourself, you make your way back to the hallway. You've run out of stuff to do in the younger sister's room; that last hurrah was pretty much the apex of your rampage; anything else would just be chasing that high. Besides, you were getting kinda bored messing around with her anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, which of your annoying neighbor's rooms should you trash next?</span></div></div>",

Next, you dip your wrist that has the screen put on into the pool to check if it could work underwater. Surprisingly, it does as you turn it on and can see the screen.

You were getting pretty curious of what it is so you swam down and go towards the mysterious object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer and closer, you began to notice that it was circular in shape and you can see some other objects near it that were just as bright. Getting much closer, you realized that it was transparent which housed something inside it along with the other nearby objects. Is this a dome of some kind? Why is it here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally got closer to it, you realized that the dome has some kind of structure that resembled a city whom you thought it was replica of some sort. \"Just how did this dome got here?\" You asked yourself. Wanting to take a close look at this supposed model, you swam further down, planning to get and stand on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on the glass after you got there and look below to get a close look. The city looks highly futuristic and it was very bright with a bunch of neon lights, but how is that possible? It didn't take very long to find the answer when you saw something unexpected from inside the dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the dome, you saw several flying cars soaring across the city and that's not all, you also saw what looks like people from very down below; walking on the streets. You can tell that because the lights helped you see human-like shapes even thought you can't yet see what they look like. You don't believe what you are looking at! This isn't a model; this is a real-life tiny city that was settled on the floor of this swimming pool! It's not just a single city though as you can see other dome cities near it that were all connected to the main one by a series of pipes; it was a large underwater civilization!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you decided to swim to the floor and try to get inside the dome, your head was full of questions. What was this city doing around here? Does your neighbors know about it? And was it always that small or did it got shrunken and placed here for unknown reasons?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to the floor and already you saw a metal double door that leads to the city.

This was definitely something a super hero billionaire would wear.  According to the HUD, the integrity of your suit was at 100% and so was the power. A list bar of other features also appeared in the corner of the visor, but since this wasnt touch screen you had no clue how to open it to view inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... maybe its voice command?...

Gotta move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou deactivated the weapons and flew up and over your house.

A flat grassy area, adjourned with wooden lunch tables (around 6), and a large lively tree that provided shade to a quarter of those benches. From what you could see, some of those benches appeared to be occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pilot the suit down to an overhanging branch on the tree for a closer overlook of the area and find a few familiar figures in your peripherals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a bench bathed in sunlight, smack dab in the middle of the courtyard, you saw your  friends and each others best friends, McKenzie and Sophia, along with other mutual friends, Andrew, Dylan and Cassidy, all seated together and cramming to get homework finished before first period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCareful not to attract any attention, you hover down to the table and pick a moment when none of them are paying attention to the tabletop or the objects on it, to find a spot on the tabletop and land on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, as you buzzed around waiting, you found yourself passing behind Kenzies head as she flipped her long hair to put it into a ponytail, sending thousands of strands of hair your way from below. Each one slams into your puny body like towel whips. If it wasnt for the suits protection, these hairs could very well have pummeled you to death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, though the suits protection worked well for you, it hadnt gone so well for the suit. The thrusters that kept you in the air had started to malfunction! You would need to land before you lost control, and quick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great haste, you direct yourself down to the table and with a rough landing, touch down ontop of Kenzies science textbook just in time for the thrusters to puke out one final gasp of air before dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah shit! Come on!\", your dissapointment was beyond immeasurable. The best thing about this suit aside from its shrinking ability was the flying. If you couldnt get this fixed, it was gonna crush your soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you'll cross that bridge when you come to it. For now, you had to plan on what to do next now that a means for an easy escape was busted.

With her homeroom class being Chemistry, and there being a test scheduled for today, she needed to cram as much knowledge on the subject as she could. Luckily, her friends consisted of absolute brainiacs, which is why she enjoyed studying with them. However, when it came to chemistry, Andrew was top of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Andy?\", she asked. \"Do you know what the atomic number, or whatever, of cardon is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carbon? Yeah its six. I think on page twelve in the text book theres a periodic table that tells you all about all of the elements.\", Andrew glanced down at her textbook, spotting a tiny moving figure on its hard cover. \"But uh, you might want to swat that bug off it first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour posture snapped straight in reaction to what you just heard. As you were just starting walk off the book, you turned around to look back up at the titaness Kenzie, you were met with a sight that filled you to the bones with fear! Her face had a look of minor disgust as she looked down at you. But to you it was like staring at a goddess who was about to snuff out your life like it was nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer penciless hand began to rise off the table and moved above then over you! The sun was blocked by a her hand and the sky above you became a great expanse of flesh that was her palm growing closer and closer as it threatened to flatten you! It was getting so close that you could see her palm in great detail! Which ofcourse meant if you didnt do something so, your time here on earth was nigh on done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you an embarrassingly long time to remember that the suit had built in speakers to enhance the volume of your voice enough that you could be heard. You would have slapped yourself in the forehead if you had the time for it, but Kenzies hand was far to close to waste even a second. You reach your hand up to the chin of the helmet and press a small button. With a low hum, the speakers activate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT WAIT KENZIE STOP!!!\", you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing hand was so close you had to attempt to hold it up yourself as its impossible weight reached your raised hands and buckled your knees under its immense strength before coming to a halt! She stopped? She heard you? You couldnt believe you actually survived! One second late and you would have been made into a pancake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenzies hand retreated slightly but still hovered above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you guys see who said that?\", Kenzie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends collectively agreed that they had no clue. There were other people around at other benches, but that voice sounded like it came from their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we being pranked right now?\", said Dylan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all were surprised once again when the disembodied voice spoke a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hehe... Kenzie? Could you lift your hand away from me please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group all focused their attention to their confused friend, then down to her hovering hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, move your hand.\", urged Sophia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith hesitation, Kenzie moved her hand away from the textbook, only to see nothing but that bug she was about to smush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,... sooooo why did I have to do that?\", she asked as she looked around, hoping to spot the mystery speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, because im kind of standing on your text book and I dont want you to crush me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the giants eyes widened as they all leaned over towards the text book to get a closer look save for Kenzie. A mixture of gasps and \"Holy shits\" rang out as they each came to realize this bug was shaped like a human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\", you said while awkwardly waving your hand in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" Kenzie whispers, her pencil dropping onto her notebook and bouncing of the bindings, ringing in your ear as if she just dropped a ton of bricks on a steel floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mixture of feelings between spine-tingling and breathtaking to see all these giant faces and giant eyes surrounding you with looks of wonderment. If you were being honest, you kind of liked the attention. You could do without Cassidys breath hitting you like waves however... would it kill her to back off a little bit. She wasnt even giving Kenzie any space, with her body pressed against her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Kenzie, she was the first one to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe Josh isnt as hyper as you and just wants to relax after what just happened.

I can help you out with your chemistry test if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenzies faced quickly brightened up at your request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious!? Yes! Thank you thats awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Kenzie happy made you happy that she would gladly allow her shrunken friend to tag along with her. Ofcourse you offered because she is a close friend and you wanted to help, but the big bonus to this was you were going to be up close and personal on an hugely attractive girls body by her choice! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the others bickered and complained that they didnt get their way, you took the few seconds of chaos to admire Kenzies body. Her tanned, tonned body was covered by a line green loose fitting tanktop, that allowed her black bra straps that ran over her shoulders to be in full view. She had three threaded bracelets on one wrist. One had her name designed into it and the others were simply unused hair elastics. You couldnt see her pants now because of the bench, but when you were up on the tree branch you could see she was wearing light grey capris joggers and brown birkenstocks. It was certainly an outfit that complimented her tomboyish personality. But she had the face and body that if she was wearing nothing but a trash bag she would still look gorgeous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interupted by the first bell ringing so loud that your head began to spin,  causing to squat down into the fetal position and block your ears with your forearms. You quickly equipped your helmet back on to help deafen the sound which luckily worked like a charm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody appeared to notice your discomfort between their arguing and the bell, as they all began packing their books back into the bag. Including Kenzie, who politely asked you to hop off her book for a second so she could tuck it into her gym bag. You obliged, then said your goodbyes to the others (aside from Andrew who also had chemistry) as they grumpily walked off to their classes or wherever they needed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back towards Kenzie who at this point was standing up, making her appear even more gigantic than when she was sitting, so much more so that you had to crane your neck in order to see her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out from the benchs seat and hesitantly offer her hand down to you. You thought she must have reservations about a tiny boy being so close to her. Which confused you, as she was the usually the one who had great comfort with her own body,... remembering back to that one time someone was taking about belly buttons and Kenzie without hesitation lifted her shirt to show hers off to anybody who was looking. But... you couldnt exactly blame her for being so nervous. This was undoubtedly a first for both of you. However, with her being the Kenzie you knew, you could bet that she would warm up to it pretty fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenzie patiently waited for you to get on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh? You coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... yeah sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped onto Kenzies finger and walked into the center of her palm. You couldnt help but feel as she raised you up to her shoulder, that the roles have been reversed quite pleasantly, with the hand that threatened to end you not even five minutes ago, was now giving you a comfortable ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle at the thought as you hop from Kenzies hand to her shoulder, and she begins to walk in the school. You sat down on her soft warm flesh next to her black bra strap, blending your dark suit clad body in next to it to avoid any sharp eyes of the other students from spotting you. Once you were settled, you, Kenzie and Andrew all headed off to homeroom chemistry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, despite having a busted flight system, this whole experience was going well for you. Kenzies body heat, combined with the steady rocking from her walk and softness of her skin threatened to lull you to sleep. It was only thanks to your quiet conversation that you didnt embarass yourself by passing out right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you conversed about different ways you could go about this. Ranging from pranking the teacher, copying off others, hiding in Kenzies pocket with her phone and googling the answers, while Andrew simply stared at your tiny form, still in minor disbelief this was really happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... you alright there buddy?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenzie looked down at you then to Andrew with a slight puzzled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Im fine its just... I mean... look at you man. Nobody thought something like this was possible but here you are. You should really count yourself lucky. I would punch a baby for a chance to see what life is like that small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You must really want this huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ofcourse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body wanted something you could provide. The suit did have a ray that could shrink down anything it hits. Your only qualm was Andy wouldnt have this suit to protect him. If he was brought down to your height, you and Kenzie would be his only protection, otherwise hes helpless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You like to have some experience on what's it like to be as small as a bug and mess around with people. You look around to find someone on the courtyard for you to play with. And what do you know, you managed to find three of them; these are the ones you have a grudge on or heavily dislike you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was the rich bitch herself, Hannah. She was with her friend, Marcia and they appear to be talking to each other. Just like many other rich bitches, she is cruel, controlling, and hostile towards others of lower social status. You didn't like her one bit especially ever since she openly insulted and humiliated your girlfriend, Alexis in the past. You wanted to go and teach her a lesson and you have the right equipment to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, there's your homeroom teacher, Ms. Kelly walking across the yard. She really hates you alot because you often goof around in class and was very harsh to you. You tried to tell her that trying to ruin your student's life will not solve anything, but she didn't care. You also want to teach her lesson with your new size as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, there's the school bully, Matthew. He was with two of his lackeys, Jeff and Sasha. The three are currently picking on some wimpy geek boy. He was one of your worst enemy in school and you try to get in trouble him for some time, but he always managed to pretended to be all innocent which causes you get all the blame for it. Thanks to this device, you can finally have the chance to give him a piece of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith three of your enemies, you have to choose one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you go after?</span></div></div>",

You stop right next to Hannah and look up to her from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is known to wear lots of clothes that shows off her body and it's no wonder why so many people around your school really admire her alot. She wears a white midriff-baring top with pink stripes, blue denim shorts that is tied by a white belt with some jewels on it, and a pair of black knee-high boots.

But the letter warned you of the government so you couldn't trust anyone that could have any connection to them. Luckily for you your best friend Mitch is some sort of super genius who's already one of the smartest people in the US. You're lucky you met him in kindergarten or otherwise you wouldn't have met him at all since he finished his education way earlier than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuff the suit into a large bag and drive off to your Mitch's house down the road. The house itself is pretty normal but Mitch has an additional building behind it where he has everything he uses. You're sure he has all the equipment he needs to examine this suit, even if you understand pretty much none of what he's doing in there.<br>\r\nYou park your car nearby and walk up to the front door. You knock on the door how you usually do it, 3 fast knocks followed by a long pause and one last knock. You started to use this to let Mitch's family know it's you because a lot of people started to come here after Mitch got a bit more well-known. The door swings open and Mitch's sister Courtney looks at you with a smile, \"Good morning, Mitch is in his fortress of solitude like usual. I'm going out for a quick jog but Kari is in her room and my mom is in the bathroom if you need anything!\". \"Alright, seeya!\" is all you get to say before she walks past you and begins her morning jog. You walk straight through the house into the backyard and towards Mitch's \"fortress of solitude\". You wave into the camera at the door and it makes a sound signaling that you can open it. After walking up some stairs you reach Mitch's main room of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally you don't come here so early if you don't have anything exciting to tell me or need my help, which one is it today?\" <br>\r\n\"Well Mitch, you're in luck because today it's both! Take a look at this!\" With that you open your bag, pull out the suit and hand it to Mitch.<br>\r\n\"A weird suit? I hope you don't want me to go to some costume party with you again.\"<br>\r\n\"Nope, this is science related this time. This might sound weird but someone dropped this off at my place to hide it from the government and it has the ability to shrink and grow back whoever wears it.\"<br>\r\n\"And you want me to believe that?\"<br>\r\n\"Kinda, but you owe me a huge favor anyway from last week when I got you a six pack of pepsi at 3am.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, this should be entertaining either way. So what do you want me to do with this then?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought you could check it out, do some tests and maybe find some unused potential. You're the smart guy here, you'll figure something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you waited around while Mitch was walking around the buildings and doing a lot of stuff you couldn't understand if you tried. 15 minutes passed until Mitch came back with the suit, but it looked a bit different now. \"So, it seems that you were actually telling me the truth. The suit was already a groundbreaking piece of technology when you arrived, but I think I was able to improve it. You can now...</span></div></div>",

It's brilliant, but it's also quite risky\" said Tiffany, the genius of the six. Everyone looked at her and listened to her idea. \"If all six of us outnumber Josh and began flying around his room, he'll get so distracted by  a bunch of glowing lights that he wouldn't notice the one with the bag and get shrunk. Are you girls interested in this plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairies thought for about a few minutes. It was indeed a risky plan, but what choice do they even have. \"Alright girls, let's go with Tiffany's idea.\" Lucy said as they all make their way to the window of their unaware nemesis.

However, this was yellow in color instead of blue. \"I think I need a close on what the hell this thing even is.\" You thought to youself and plan to catch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached out to grab it, but it dodges your hand and flew away from you.

It immediately flew past you and just as you going to chase it, you saw ANOTHER similar creature in red color standing on your bed; it also flew away once you approached it. Suddenly, you felt something poking the back of your head and saw of course, another one of these ball of lights and it was orange in color. It sways back and forth as if was taunting you to grab it in which you tried, but it dodges your hand. While trying to grab it, a purple ball of light quickly landed on your nose and you atempt to grab it, but ended up hitting your face. You look around your room, seeing a bunch of colorful lights flying all over you. \"Where are these things coming from?!\" You thought to yourself. You were so focused on them that you didn't the same blue orb of light behind you and you suddenly got hit by dust. After coughing a few bit, you began to feel weak as your world slowly went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't took long enough for you to wake up and get your senses back but you immediately can tell that something wasn't right. For starters, your room looked bigger for some reason but not big as in length, it was big as in size. Every stuff in your room were gigantic, hell it would take hours to get all the way to the walls. \"What the hell is this?!\" You yelled \"I'm about a few centimeters tall!\" How could this happen? Were those glowing balls response for this? Speaking of which, you hear some giggles from high above and after that, a series of loud twinkling sounds are heard.

These giants were all humanoid in appearance and all female. Not to mention, they were also all very attractive and beautiful women that all look to be in their 20s. How do these gorgeous girls get in your room in the first place? All you could remember was trying to catch those ball of...wait a minute. You take a good look on all of them and realized that they all have multiple color of skins and wings on their back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairies? GIANT Fairies? This doesn't look so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six of the fairies were all wearing same type of clothes you usually see on humans which was surprising as they might have come from a fairy society that was similar to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one had blue skin and red short hair. She was wearing a black jacket over her lavender jumper dress and a pair of white socks and black shoes; she appears be holding a bag of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one has yellow skin and long orange hair. She was wearing a tight red T-shirt, a very long brown skirt that covered her legs, and a pair of blue sandals; she appears to be less menacing than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third one has green skin and blue hair that was tied up by a ponytail. She wears a short red hoodie that exposes her midriff with grey accents, a matching shorts that also has grey accents, a pair of orange knee-high socks and blue NIKE-like sneakers; she looks alot like an athletic of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth one has red skin and jet black hair. Her attire contains a green tube top that exposes her midriff, a blue mini-skirt, and a pair of golden high-heeled sandals; she absolutely that most beautiful of the six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth one has orange skin and sky-blue bobcut-style hair. She was wearing a gray tank top, an incredibly short jean shorts that exposes almost all of her legs and a pair of black rubber boots; she looks at you with a smile that was bigger than the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sixth and final one has purple skin and short pink hair that was tied up by a headband. She wears glasses, a blue-yellow sweater over her white blouse with a green tie, a short red-orange skirt, a pair of green Scottish-style socks and blue maryjanes; she looks highly intelligent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fairies all look down at you which was making you scared, how did they even make you this small. \"Well well well, you don't look so tough anymore.\" said the blue fairy with a grin. \"And not to mention SOOO cute.\" the orange one chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do to you?</span></div></div>",

You could hear them talking among themselves high above you, sounding like gods in the heavens to your puny ears.  They were wondering why they had just came across a pile of abandoned clothing.. rightfully so, as your cat DJ t-shirt and pair of polka dot boxers definetly wasnt something that was commonly left on the sidewalks around your neighbourhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was not the time to be thinking about these girls thoughts though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... um... guys? I think theres a streaker running around here.\", said one of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god thats disgusting. I swear if he pops out at us im pepper spraying him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... isnt that Joshs shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. That stupid DJ cat. Josh is streaking around his own neighbours?... thats pretty wild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left puzzled. These girls knew you. Obviously you must go to school with them so they must be younger than 20 like you originally thought. Thinking more on it... you always knew you recognized those voices from somewhere. Your pindering is cut off however, as the walls of the shirt starts to crinkle in as if someone just grabbed it. The shirt began to rise and you got lifted up with the fabric as it rose higher and higher into the air. With the shirt draped all around you, you could see nothing past it until suddenly it was spread open, leaving you to find yourself hanging onto the cats pupil on your shirt, and revealing the faces of four girls you knew from school who were now the size of skyscrapers staring back at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfcourse it wasnt you they were looking at, it was the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf these four gigantas, you recognized them as Miriam, Julie, Sydney and Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriam was the one who was holding you and your shirt. An 18 year old girl with caramel skin, shoulder length black hair and brown eyes. Shes wearing a dark blue denim jean jacket, black v-neck undershirt, black spandex pants and brown ankle sandals. A part of you (though terrified) was relieved to see her. She was one of your oldest, closest and... compliacted friends. The two of you had dated before long ago. And though Miriam had moved past it due to her easy going nature, you had a tendency to linger on your feelings, still not being able to shake all your attractions for her. Though you managed to hide them from Alissa. Miriam was what the guys liked to call... thicc. Nice, curvy ass. Thick thighs, and well developed breasts, she was a stunner to be sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Julie. Great to the people she chose to be friends with, an absolute bitch to most everyone else, even friends of friends if she didnt deem them worthy. She was like she got plucked straight out of a high school movie. Captain of the cheerleaders, long blond hair, blue eyes, great rack, great ass. Even her outfit fit her personality trait.. of  being an absolute slut. Tiny blue tanktop with wave patterns that did little to hide the outline of her nipples. An exposed midriff that showed off her toned abs and bellybutton piercing. Short jean shorts with a brown leather belt and black converse shoes. Okay, so maybe its not that whore-ish... you just really didnt get along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney! She was pretty cool. Very athletic so she had an ass to rival that of Julies and an even more perfect rack. However, due to Sydney being alot more reserved than Julie, Sydney didnt get near as \"popular\" with the guys. Her long brown hair was done back into a ponytail, which rested on the back of her red form fitting t-shirt. She also wore faded, lightly distressed jeans and all white converse shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally Taylor. Someone with a massive social media following due to her stunning good looks. Taylor spent most of her time studying in the sun so not only did she have a gorgeous tan to match her gorgeous body, but she was also very intelligent. She too had long brown hair, and again, like the rest, great ass, great rack. However, unlike the reserved Sydney, Taylor had little issue with showing her skinny body off. She was wearing a yellow sundress and gladiator sandals that rose up to just below her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sure felt pretty lucky that these girls found you... now they just have to actually FIND you!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were surprised and motion sick to feel Miriams arm level out to the point that you could stand on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor whatever reason, (maybe because you didnt understand the context behind the arm movement because you werent listening to the conversation Miriam was having), you released your grip on the small arm hair and took this as a instance of good luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\", you said to yourself.\"I dont even have to climb!

Taylor and Sydnee had taken up the task of carrying the clothes this time, and they all began walking down the street to your home, just as you had reached Miriams bracelet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet touched down violently on the wrist accessory, causing your knees to buckle enough that you couldnt stop yourself from dropping off the bracelet, only saved by a reflexive outreach by your hand that managed to grab onto Miriam's bracelet! And now here you were, dangling off your friends wrist like the poor helpless insect you had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters even worse, the constant slow swaying of her arm was causing that motion sickness to build up again. It didnt take long for your guts to expel your lunch out through your mouth, splashing onto Miriams skin, and dripping all the way down about 100 feet (to your size) to her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, can this day get any more demeaning?\", you groaned.</span></div></div>",

Gusts of humid wind nearly blew your tiny, petrified form back into the depths of your shirt. Buffeted by muggy breath, you let out a whimper as you found yourself face-to-snout with a behemoth German shepherd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous beast leaned in closer, maybe an inch away from you. You couldn't get your legs to move as it sniffed at your clothes with a wet, black nose the size of a two car garage. Its mouth hung open enough for a mammoth tongue to bob out. A tongue more than large enough to lap you up. You were sure you were about to be drawn into the dog\u2019s cavernous maw when you heard a booming voice from even farther above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you find, Clover?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpossibly huge, black Nike slides thundered into view. To your relief, \u201cClover\u201d moved aside as her owner crouched to inspect the seemingly abandoned pile of clothes. Skyscraper legs the color of honey were exposed by her athletic shorts. You caught a glimpse of her white crop-top right before the ground was ripped from under you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, wait! Stop!\u201d You shouted in a panic as the giant lifted your shirt. Everything went sideways and you rolled out of the neck. You smacked painfully onto the sidewalk, landing right next to her foot. She\u2019d stood back up to her full, daunting height. The girl, who you guessed by her skin tone was Latina, chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA cat DJ shirt?\u201d You couldn't see past her chest but you could almost hear the smirk on her face. You were about to run back to your pants pocket when a massive shadow appeared overhead. A bucket\u2019s worth of drool fell from the sky, splattering right between your feet. You looked up. Standing between you and your clothes was Clover. The monstrous dog was staring right at you, her head tilted slightly in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately bolted in the opposite direction. You could hear the gigantic German shepherd sniffing after you. Desperate not to be licked up like a bit of kibble, you looked for any place to hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the dog\u2019s owner was standing still, you dashed toward the open front of her sandal. You had to jump to clamber onto its thin sole. Hesitating for a moment, you grimaced at the sight of her massive toes. The fleshy hills shifted as she absentmindedly wiggled them. Even the smallest one was the size of a shed. A deafening bark rang out nearby and you knew you had to bite the bullet. You didn't even risk looking back, pushing into the space between the two largest digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was safer there, you couldn't help but be a little grossed out. You wrinkled your nose at the faint, cheesy smell overpowering her lotion. The warm little nook you were in was noticeably sweaty. Your tiny form was squished by walls of thick skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the hell did you end up small enough to fit between some random girl's toes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having found your deserted clothes, is she going to change her dogwalking plans, maybe call the authorities?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like no.  Your shirt drifts down in front of you, casually discarded by this giantess as if it weren't big enough to cover a small town.  \"Come on, Clover!\" she thunders so far above you, and then she continues walking her dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking means taking steps, and as her sandalled foot launches off you are privileged to witness the toes press down, paling at the undersides with the immense power channelling through them.  There is a grinding noise that only you can hear as those monoliths of powerful skin crush down, and then the whole platform beneath your feet launches into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tilts to an extreme angle, and your breathing transforms to screaming as you scramble to keep hold.  Then you needn't bother as sudden acceleration presses you into the gross black surface.  You are pulled screaming along with the rest of the footwear by the undeniable strength of the goddess, then roll slightly as the wall once more becomes floor and you are plunging downwards once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you plunge, the toes to either side of you rise, exposing their hardened undersides, impossibly tough and just a small part of an ever so much greater whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot makes landfall with explosive impact, moments later the toes crashing down either side of you.  You bounces and slam against both sides like a pinball, battered by the rough skin of this woman.  Bruised, you gasp again, only for the cycle to begin anew with no delay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flurry of steps that she takes is brutal, no respite for the insect between her toes.  Any breakfast you may have had in you deserted your stomach long ago, belched into the void along with any courage you may have had.  This was a stupid idea!  You're going to die, and no one will ever notice!  Why did you ever -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden silence cuts into your very thoughts.  Everything is still, the toes settled in place, their imposing power barely restrained to either side of you.  Blinking, you gaze into what little light penetrates your enclosure, and see the dog dashing off across an endless city of green tower blocks, stomping down patches with careless abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, you might have a moment to collect your thoughts while the dog's owner lets it run free off the leash.  But how to get aid from her?  You'll have to get out from between her toes, and maybe see to climbing up that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crane your neck back, taking in the stretch of flesh of her legs, shifting ever so slightly as she stands restlessly.  That'll be... quite a climb, even is she does remain totally motionless!  Let's hope that she does just that, eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toes have plentiful handholds with the skin cells linked so crudely, and there's no time like the present.</span></div></div>",

At this point I'm closer to Alex's house than mine... but damn... a two minute walk at this size is gonna take an hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only solace at the thought of such a journey was it was early enough on the morning that for the most part, the sidewalks wouldn't be bustling with people. But that didnt mean the bugs werent out looking for food. At this early in the morning, and with the forecast being so hot and humid, the insects out here are going to on a feeding frenzy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear to you that going on your own without protection was pretty much a death sentence. You needed to craft up some weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as choices for materials, there was limited to go off of. All that was available was the aluminum of your pants zipper or whatever you could scrounge up off the ground. First things first, you walk over to your shirt and make yourself a long shirt with a piece you ripped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you went to your zipper and began the grueling task of working the tab out from the fabric one thread at a time until it finally came off. The tab was surpisingly not very heavy to you. It felt just the right weight for a shield. You then walked over to a crack in the sidewalk and pulled out a sliver of shattered concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. You're a regular spartan now Josh.\", you say dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith yet another piece of torn fabric, you fashin a back strap for the shield, then set off on your quest to your girlfriends house.</span></div></div>",
