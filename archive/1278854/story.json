It was the middle of the night. Everyone else was asleep.

She ripped pieces of meat of it and swallowed it without even chewing.<br>\r\nAfter about five-teen minutes all what was left of the hippo was inside her belly. She belched loudly.

As she looked around she didn't recognize any of the trees  or rocks.  There weren't even any other animals around, let alone her family.  She became certain she was somewhere else when she came to the end of the new home which was fenced with a metal fence.  She tried climbing over it, but the barbed wire at the top kept people from sneaking in or out.<br>\r\n   Feeling saddened she secluded herself by a nearby tree and watched the clouds float by, imagining they were her family slowly going further and further away.  Her isolation was broken when an old, ugly lady with too much makeup on came by her cage.  She spoke in a most disturbing voice that Nala could only mean she was her captor now.<br>\r\n   Nala would've growled in fury at her, but after all she had been through she felt fatigue and hunger kick in, keeping her silent.<br>\r\n   \"Oh, you poor dear.  Henry!\" she shouted at a nearby man dressed in a white uniform. \"The poor thing is starving.  Give it something to eat.\"<br>\r\n   \"Yes, mam'\" he responded.<br>\r\n   \"How dare you!  You know to only address me by my last name!\"<br>\r\n   \"Yes, Miss Bumblesbee.\"<br>\r\n   \"That's better.  Now feed the thing a few pieces of steak and then hurry up.  I have so many things to do and you can't be lollygagging all day.\"<br>\r\n   She began marching off leaving Henry and Nala alone.   \"Sorry, girl, she's a witch I know.  I'm actually a veterinarian, but she closed down the animal hospital I worked at.  I was able to get this job here because you came and she needed someone to take care of you.\"<br>\r\n   Nala felt a warmth from the human that was far different from the icy sensation she got from the ugly human earlier.<br>\r\n   \"Let's see what she got you to eat now.\" he said as he pulled out a drumstick almost entirely bare of meat.  \"THE OLD HAG!!!  She has no feelings of others.  She brought you because of a stupid fad to own wild animals and she doesn't even know anything about you.  She thinks she could feed a lioness like yourself.  This couldn't feed an ant.  Probably a little something she had left over after she was eating last night.\"<br>\r\n   Henry looked over at the little lioness and saw her larger than normal stomach, which gave off a soft growl.<br>\r\n   \"Hmm,  you look like a big eat too and I bet you haven't eaten since before you were captured.

After two months, she'd gone from immobile, to merely chubby, and while this was good for her health, it was less so for her attitude, losing the weight she'd prised so much had made her moody and depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after three months, an exit from the room appeared in what had been a dead end until now. With nothing else to, she decided to explore it. She was only a few steps through the new hole when there was a bang her, and she turned to see the hole closed, blocking her off from her temporary home. For a few moments, she pawed vainly at the blockage, before turning to examine the new world in which she was trapped.</span></div></div>",

In that time, and with nothing else to do, she explored the enclosure. It was easily five or six times as big as her last one had been, but far less lush. In addition, the people keeping her put the food up on poles and trees rather than just feeding her hand-to-mouth, so even more time passed before she was thin enough to climb up for a decent meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree months passed before Nala was finally deemed healthy enough to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala was just relaxing under a tree, having taken the third morsel of the day when she felt a sting in her shoulder.

Unfortunately, every plan she came up with required overwhelming him first, and there was no way to do that in her current state, so she had to lose some weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days that followed were in a sense even harder, Nala had to both lose weight and keep her plan secret from Epesi.

It wasn't only cramped for him, but even if he didn't get a sprained ankle it was impossible to even exercise under the massive lioness.  He spent most of his time lying on the ground trying to get comfortable.  Whenever meals came Nala moved to hide Epesi from view so that Henry didn't see he was stuck under her and each meal after she ate her fill then pushed his face into the meat.  He then was forcively munched down the meat until he was full, but Nala was never satisfied with even a scrap of meat left, let alone several complete steaks.  She forced him to eat it and left him with an overstuffed stomach.  The first couple of days didn't reveal any change, but by the end of the week Epesi had a bulging gut that went down to his ankles if he could've ever stood up.  It was also at this point that he discovered his added girth had given him enough room to pop out from under Nala and to his freedom.  His ankle was also much better and he was ready to run again.<br>\r\n\"Nice try Nala, but your plan didn't work as well as you wanted.\"<br>\r\n\"Think again.

Each day it yells for more and once you give into it you might not be able to escape it and with the food we eat here gain weight is no problem.\"<br>\r\nEpesi didn't say another word and ran off.  He didn't want to believe what she said.  He looked at himself and saw his fattened body.  His larger paunch and meatier legs.  Looking in a lake he saw his neck had layers as well.  He was disgusted at this and hated Nala for it.  He was ready to run, but suddenly...</span></div></div>",

What Nala had said had never occured to him before, and even though his brain sought to reject it, he knew he had to consider what she'd said.

Now that he was incouraged to rest and relax, the little cheetah wasn't so little any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder one of the trees in the inclosure sat two bloated once wild cats, Epsi and Nala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, Epsi was quite obese, now he was truely massive and weighed more than a morbidly obese full grown cheetah.  His belly oozed out two feet to each side and pushed the cheetah's bloated front legs off the ground.  The skin was stretched along the belly to the point that it distorted the spots.  Epsi even began to form a very meaty chest that pushed the white tuff of fur on his chest into his face.  A large roll of fat replaced the cheetah's neck and pushed his large grape fruit sized cheeks up, making his short muzzle even shorter.  Epsi's large rear even covered his rear paws and stretched over a foot to each side.  It also started to swallow his tail, that was as thick was as a human fore arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to him was Nala, who now looked more like a gigantic blob of yellow pudding.  Her stomach was now eight feet wide and pushed under all four legs, which were covered in two feet of flab, making her completly immobile.  Nala's back rose up above her head and was pushing her ears down.  Her head was even sinking into her fat neck a little, giving her a cushon that completly surrounded her head.  Her even meatyer chest, about the size of two large bean bags filled with water, also made for more cushoning.  Although her butt swallowed up half of her tail, it was still poking out, it was even a half a foot wide, making the small tuff of fur on the end look miniscule in side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the continuous feeding was fun and all, the two cubs were becoming board.<br>\r\n\"Nala, it's been a week sense I decided to get fat like you\" Epsi said \"and I can understand why you want to get fat, but after you get to a point there isn't much anything else to do.\"<br>\r\n\"You do have a point\" Nala replied, \"but there must be somthing we can do.\"</span></div></div>",

Ordinarily they would have got up and wandered over to their bowls were Henry put food in from outside, but since theyve long lost theyre ability to move the carer saw no danger in just walking in anddumping the steak in front of them and, if need be, hand feed them when they couldn't reach the steak's on the floor past their pillowing flab. It wasn't even remotly dangerous since they also associated Henry with dinner and to bite him might mean no more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile's had certainly grown. 10 steaks each piled right in front of them, glistening with fat and looking all to irresistable. Too both of them this time. Henry had barely put them down before the two cat's started devouring them like they were air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the corner he'd backed himself into Matu watched in a sort of morbid fascination as the two obese cats gorged themselves on more meat than he'd seen any lion or cheetah eat at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry watched the two for several seconds with a sort of guilty look before turning back to the door, he left for but a few moments before bringing in a third load of food. Causing the young wild pig to gape a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tower food was placed in front of him, no where near as big as the other two but it was not limited to meat. Root's berry's, and other thing's he'd been eating before he was captured where laid in front of him as well as the five steak's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know what you'd be eating this time of year so I gave you a bit of everything.\" Henry said with a smile, as if this animal could understand him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interupted by a sort of growling a mewling sound. Both animal and man turned and looked at the source of the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpsei and Nala had finished their meat.....sorta. They had reached the limit that either could reach on their own, Epsei couln't reach the last two and Nala the last four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatu looked at them curiously as they struggled against their fat futily to reach their breakfast, they tried pawing themselves foward but their limbs just bounced back into their same unmovable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I better go feed them. Bye\" Henry said before going over to hand feed the carnivore's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatu watched wide as the human picked up the steaks and held them up to the big cat's mouth's and let them eat right out of his hand's. They even licked his hand's desperatly for what was left on them and his only response was to laugh slightly at the ticklish sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry stood up, pulling a sanitary wie out and giving his slobber cover hand's a clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. See you at lunch.\" He said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatu watched the human go before turning back to Nala and Epsei. Those to had every oppertunity to bite the human but didn't. Instead they actually begged him to feed them, they couldn't even reach those hunks of meat inch's away from them. That's when he saw clearly what they were.They're feet didn't even touch the ground, they could hardly eat by themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were.....helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he dug into his first steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh he was going to enjoy this.</span></div></div>",

Clearly to scared to sleep should Epsei or Nala decide he was a 'midnight snack'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" Epsei whispered. The warthog just pushed back further against the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away.\" Said Matu nervously. \"I won't be eaten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpsei rolled his eyes. It was time to straighten this mess out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Matu, we already told you, we can barely move a few steps, heck Nala can't move at all! And I'm gonna be the same way before long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatu didn't relax for a second. \"Yeah right. My Ma saw my Pa get killed by a Lion. Pa managed to butt it over a cliff, it was almost dead when Pa found it at the bottom but it still break his neck with its one good paw. Cat's aint never helpless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpsei stared at the young Warthog for a second before coming to a decision. \"You don't believe me? See for yourself.\" With that Epsei gave a pained grunt and began to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatu dashed to another corner as he saw the cheetah rise. Shouting all the way. \"I KNEW IT! I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU....Eat...me?\" His cry's dulled as he got a good look of the now standing Epsei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on the cheetah's face was one of pure concentration, if he had no fur you'd see the skin was red and flushed like a bodybuilder after lifting a bar bell overhead. Matu could see the blubber that despite Epsei standing up still pooled on the floor, Not to mention Epsei's feet (the only barely visible part of his legs left past the overhanging fat) were shaking and buckling under the strain. The weight was simply to much for the young cheetah to bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he stepped foward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatu swore he never saw so much happen at once. Every inch of Epsei's fat jiggled from the slight movement of the step like someone was violently shaking it, it pulled him in every direction possible and actually caused him a little pain as the fat hanging over his face from his back and sides slapped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he collapsed with a huge thud on the habitat floor, out of breath and sweating like he ran across the savanha and back...twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala stirred in her sleep but did not awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpsei, still breathing hard looked up at Matu who now had a stupified exprssion on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do *wheeze* believe *gasp* your safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatu was still astonished. \"Wha...? Wh, what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpsei smirked. \"The same thing that happened to her.\" He said indicating Nala. He yawned as his eye's drooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mumbled out the last words \"And the same thing that's gonna happen to you.\" With that he was out for the count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatu's eyes widened in horrwe.

Even now he still wasn't sure about it, but he'd gone ahead with his plan anyway, and he was showing the results. The cheetah's belly was hanging down almost to his ankle and was twice or more times as wide as it had been, and nor was that the only change, for his neck had developed rolls which were all of thewm now wider than his head, even though that was not hanging with fat as well. his legs had grown considerably as well, his hips and shoulders almost as wide as his belly, and splayed out from its pressure and their size, and even his tail was now twice as wide as it had been, hanging limp against muscles now too weak to lift its weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala, watching from afar, wondered what had happened to Epesi, was his apparently newfound appreciation of weight natural, or part of a cunning plot.

When finally came to, he tried to move. When he tried to move, he couldn't. He strained to get at least even one toe to touch the ground, but couldn't. He tried to get off the thing he was laying on, but couldn't. 'What happened?' he thought to himself. He looked down to find he was laying on a big furry soft thing that wasn't letting him get off it. Then he realized what it was. \"OH MY GOD!!\" he blurted out. This woke Nala (who had still been sleeping), and she looked over to see Epesi rolling back and forth on his huge gut trying to move but hopelessly failing. She waddled over to him (she hadn't exactly become immobile yet) and smirked. \"What did you think was going to come from eating all those steaks?\"<br>\r\n\"You're lucky you can still move! How is that anyways?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I think your lucky. Besides, if you didn't want to gain weight, why did you start eating so much?\"<br>\r\n\"I wanted to be able to tell you that being fat sucks and you wouldn't be able to argue back since I knew what it was like.\"<br>\r\n\"And look where it got you. Just except it. You're never going to he thin again.\"<br>\r\n\"I WILL!\"<br>\r\n\"yeah right you can't even move, how are you going to exercise?\"<br>\r\nEpesi wanted to reply, but couldn't think of anything to say. He watched as Nala waddle away to eat breakfast. He felt his stomach growl, and admittedly he was hungry (more like starving), but he go to eat it. He would have moaned or something to get Henry's attention, but Henry was long gone and hadn't seen Epesi and he knew Nala wouldn't help him, so he had to sit there for the rest of the day. \"At least not eating will help me to slim down.\" He sat there for the rest of the day and all night which felt like a year. Next morning he was still there and moaning in hunger. Nala felt bad for him so she brought him a steak (she still wasn't immobile yet but it did take her a while).<br>\r\n\"Why are you bringing me this?\" asked Epesi as he began eating.<br>\r\n\"I couldn't just sit by and watch you starve to death.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" he managed to get out while he finished off the steak.<br>\r\n\"By the way, how badly do you want to lose weight?\"<br>\r\n\"More than anything in the world!\"<br>\r\nNala thought about this for a moment. She really wanted to be fat and Epesi didn't. She knew how much he wanted to be able to move on his own. She thought of an idea that would help both of them.<br>\r\n\"How bought this,\" she began, \"I bring you some food until you're thin enough to move. Then I'll help you lose weight by eating the food you don't want. That way I'll get fatter and you'll get thinner.\"<br>\r\n\"But It will take forever for me to be able to move again. And even then I'll only be able to make a slow waddle type thing.\"<br>\r\n\"Then we'll just have to rely on you eating less for the most part.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then, but there has to be a catch. You wouldn't just start helping me out of pity.\"<br>\r\n\"The catch is that you stop bugging me about being fat. I like it so don't ruin it for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay. Hey, could you bring me another steak?\"<br>\r\n\"Why? I thought you wanted to lose weight.\"<br>\r\n\"I do, it's just that I haven't eaten in a whole day except for that steak you gave me, so I'm still pretty hungry.\"<br>\r\n\"All right.\"<br>\r\nSo Nala brought Epesi another steak and then after he ate it, she pushed him (with some difficulty) over to where Henry left the food. The next day...</span></div></div>",

With nothing to do in the small enclosure she could do nothing but eat and grow fatter and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now a full grown lioness, and would have been the queen of pride rock with her best friend Simba as her husband by now, but suffice to say even if this mountainous feline would somehow get back to Pride rock her new attitude and appearance would make her the least likely candidate to be anything but a useless fleshy lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the average weight of a full grown female lion is just under 300lbs, which is enough for a human to be classed as quite fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell now you know that fact then consider this, Nala weighed enough to make another female Lion classed 'morbidly obese' look skeletal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly flowed out in every direction by more than several feet and took up significant space in the habitat and pushed her up from the ground several feet, enough that Henry had to reach up to hand feed her. Her legs were so packed with fat that she couldn't wiggle her toes even if her leg's werent covered from thigh to paw by overhanging fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail was as thick as a human torso and less than half visible since her back fat was also doing the same thing to it that it was doing to her legs, heck she could barely see since it was also hanging over her face...and to the sides...and her head was perpetually rested on her fantastically distended belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had to guess her weight, you wouldn't be able to of course but to say she was about a ton would be a good guess.....if she didn't pass that mark a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day the lady of the house ordered Henry to increase the amount he was feeding Nala, to witch he reluctantly complied.

The results of which pleased both females human and feline immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's coming along quite well...\" She looked at the ground next to her. \"Don't you agree Dipsy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the dog could have shuddered at the name she would have, but gave a simple yap at her owners question. Not that it meant anything but it pleased the woman non the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dipsy', or diane as was her real name was a medium sized poodle who was another product of her owner's fascination with extreme weight. Not to the degree of Nala in terms of proportion though. She could still still up and when her owner allowed her to walk she could do so with a reasonable waddle as he stomach only brushed the floor when it was moving from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at Nala's cage with some 'morbid' fascination. \"At least that fat lump took that stupid humans attention of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated what that aging biddy was doing to her, she remembered being the fastest dog in her litter before she was taken by Madame and feed no less than 4 meals a day. She wasn't even allowed to walk about unless unnoticed, a servent always carried her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again Diane was also somewhat jealous of Nala, ho could that fat feline actually be enjoying this. No one enjoyed what that monster woman was putting them through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfredo the parrot was annoyed that he could no longer fly, or even fit into the cage what he had so love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came as quite a shock to herr when Richard the pet mouse begged for no more cheese, then rolled to the other side of his cage using his perfectly spherical shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda the Calico had given up when the cooks commented that her stomach dragging across the floor kept the floor clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe less said about the master of the house the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet this Lioness was visibly delighted with her obscene girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I need to know why' thought Diane.

I'm the maddams' pet poodle. I want to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n\"Ask away. I'm not going anywhere.\" Nala replied, and gave a shake to herself, causing her <br>\r\nflab and blubber to jiggle all the more. She even tried shaking her tail but couldn't, her tail <br>\r\nwould only shake if she shook her entire body.<br>\r\nDiane gasped at the sight, she had never seen anyone so fat before. \"Tell me, why do you <br>\r\nenjoy being fed and delight in getting fatter?\"<br>\r\nBecause of her fat face and fat face cheeks the size of large beachballs, Nala could <br>\r\nonly manage a small grin. \"Its really a secret of mine but I'll tell it to you anyway. <br>\r\nIts the pleasure of feeling my body growing bigger and fatter, I have a gluttony for food <br>\r\nand a desire to never stop. And I have a fondness for the human that feeds me. Like <br>\r\na relationship. Not a love relationship, like a close friendship.\"<br>\r\nDiane couldn't help but be stunned at Nala's words but she did ask. \"You like the <br>\r\nhuman called Henry?\"<br>\r\nNala tried to nod, which sent her fat face cheeks and many neck rolls into a wobbling <br>\r\nand rippling motion. The neck rolls making wavy motions like ocean waves. \"Yes, <br>\r\nI do...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The workers got to work on taking down the chain link fence that was around Nala's fat lioness blob body. If one had to guess, someone might say the ever-feeding and fattening lioness was currently at or around twenty to thirty tons of soft, doughy and malleable mass of fat flabby rolls, blubber and lard. And it seems that Nala thoroughly enjoyed all of it in pleasure, even especially when Henry would feed her and give her body massages. Once the workers got the chain link fencing removed, they shocking watched as Nala's contained malleable flab of a lioness body flowed out from it and jiggled, wobbled and undulated as if she was a jello mold of her own. Her rolls flopped and slapped against each other, giving Nala great pleasure which the lioness blob roar-moaned from. Once her fat settled into place, she was pressing up against other chain link fences of other enclosures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workers there had to get a heavy-duty hundred ton crane, get the thick straps under and around Nala, lifting her out of her once used enclosure. Henry looked on in amazement at the amount of flabby fat rolls that hung, spilled off of her and what rolls of flab was still pooling out on the ground. So they had to lift her somewhat higher that none of her flabby rolls were touching the ground. And as they held Nala's lioness blob mass of a body and took her to the new location, she jiggled easily all the more and all over her lioness blob body. They could hear the roar-moans that Nala was making in pure pleasure. Fortunately for Nala, the madame of the mansion had ordered one of her scientists men to make a formula serum for Nala that would always keep her a hundred percent healthy no matter how much weight she gains. But as a side effect, she gain more fat rapidly than she used to. Henry had reluctantly gave Nala the formula serum back half a year ago. Once the crane had brought Nala to her new area enclosure, much more of a savannah land of her own but still with high concrete and chain link fencing surrounding it, the crane set her down on the grassy ground. And Nala had been placed at the very center of the new area. So Nala had more space and room to grow bigger and fatter in for miles around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting that done, they got the thick straps removed from Nala, then Henry had to wait for the food to arrive from the mansion. When the food did get there, the lady madame surprised Henry with hundreds of large tanker semi trucks, all pulled up and backed up so the rear's of the cylinders tanks was facing Nala's front. But unfortunately for Henry, he had to climb up the lioness blob's many rolls just to get up to the cavern of neck rolls that her fat head blob had sunken back into, with her back fat higher up making Nala appear like a large hill from afar, with other bulges and leg rolls at her sides, with her paws deeply sunk into them and a mass of tail rolls with her tail tuft also deeply sunk in it, between her rump cheeks. From inside the cavern where her fat head blob rested, both chin rolls and thick bloated and widening face cheeks flowed out, pouring down her front, on top of her lower neck rolls, down her fat chest. The chin rolls pushed her face cheeks farther apart as they went down, widening to spill and pool out in a widening radius out in front of her like liquid lava. All of Nala's flabby fat rolls seemed to ripple and jiggle constantly in slow motion but would do more so if she tried to move a body part or someone was giving her body massages. Her wide bloating face cheeks laying on either side of her mass of pooling chin rolls on the ground, looking like inflating blimps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resigned sigh, Henry begun to get to work on feeding Nala. Well knowing that they had switched from just hand feeding Nala to vats with hoses just to get the lioness blob's hunger fed. It lastly all day, of course. During the night was the only time Nala allowed herself rest from feeding, only to start up again the next day. But she wasn't fed at a fast rate, currently Nala's feeding required a medium and gallons setting.</span></div></div>",

At first, this made Diane concerned for Nala, despite not knowing her well enough. \"I'm wondering if Henry moved her? He did look worried about that poor girl.\" Diane thought, speculating on such a theory, as she remembered the subtle look on Henry's face, despite not fully understanding Human language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of the male Human, Henry was inside a large large trailer made specifically for carrying large animals. Currently, he was looking back at the obese blob of a lioness that was Nala, as her corpulent bulky frame jiggled ever so slightly within the moving trailer, which was pulled by a Dodge Ram 1500 truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they were both inside a trailer being pulled down the highway, Henry was surprised that the sound of car engines and howling wind wasn't enough to wake her up, as he then just noticed something odd while looking at the immobile Nala; she had this giddy happy-looking smile on her plump lioness snout, her fat cheeks making said smile more pronoun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? That's odd. Why is she smiling like that? Lions don't actually smile....do they?\" Henry thought to himself, obviously showing signs of fatigue from the months of planning and conspiring behind the fat Noblewoman's back, both to fully eradicate any evidence that would have him incarcerated for poaching, and to liberate the corpulent lioness from becoming a gigantic blob of fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, during the many amount of times he spent with her, Henry began to notice something.....odd, about Nala's behavior toward him, almost as if she was actually falling in love with him. \"Okay Henry, you might be losing it here. I mean, a lioness falling in love with a human? Unless she was a girl who was cursed to become a lioness, there's no way that could happen.\" Henry thought, obviously skeptic about the whole concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, Henry remembered how many times Nala would show a great deal of loving affection towards him, which varied from Nala wrapping her pudgy forepaws around him in a big hug, to nuzzling him on the face with her chubby cheeks, to even giving the human multiple licks on the face and hands, since she could still the sweet meaty juices on his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he promised himself to help Nala, but for some weird reason, Henry couldn't help but admit that the obese lioness did look adorable with all of that fat on her, as he slowly approached and gently scratched the top of Nala's head and thought, \"Though you seem to be enjoying yourself, having all of that inside of you. *Sigh* If only I can somehow understand what you're saying....maybe then I can ask you why you seem to love being fat so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the fatigue began to set in, Henry let out a yawn, indicating how tired he was. With nowhere else to sleep in the trailer, Henry slowly began to lay down on Nala's fat rotund body, feeling how soft it was in combination with her fur. From there, Henry simply closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

However, the one thing that Nala became quickly aware of was the female human's fat bulky form, being carried by what appears to be some sort of heavy-duty floating platform hovering just a few inches above the ground.  She had long blonde hair put into theses swirling curls, with bright blue eyes, and fair but slightly pale Caucasian skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn physical appearance, the female human must be weighing a total of 1,000 pounds, about half the weight of the corpulent lioness.

She should enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rolled forward two big wheeled carts of the hippo meat food, of course the meat did also have fat on it too, but to Nala it looked irresistable and she could probably <br>\r\nglutton on the hippo meat all day. Her stomach size had too, increased along with her fat body blob size. And the two maid servants wheeled in a total of ten food carts to let Henry feed the fat lioness blob. They could actually hear her stomach growling hungrily through the thick fat of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod of thanks, Henry began his task of feeding Nala the big slabs of hippo meat, which Nala took in with well practiced gluttony. Henry still had to reach up to hand feed her though, not that he minded. It took an hour before the first food cart was emptied and Henry switched to the second. It wasn't that Nala ate fast but the fact that she didn't bother to chew her food and instead just swallowed each slab of meat down to get it where it was needed. Yet, Henry was still reluctant to excessively feed her so much like he'd done back at Miss Bumblebee's mansion. However, a part of Henry's mind began to think how much more adorable Nala would be with more fat on her. And the way she licked at his hand sent pleasant shivers down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to hand it to you, Henry. You really know how to pick a female. Anyway, I also wanted to tell you that I've found a way for you to be able to communicate with your fat lioness. Its a lion language communication device that I made. To tell you the truth, I've also got my own fat lioness blob out in the backyard. She must be a bigger blob than your lioness. Because she's a literal mountainous blob of flab and rolls, so much so, that I've had to make automated mechanical feeder arms for my lioness. I've also got several live cams set up that show various areas of her body, including a close up view of her fat blob of her head which is back deep in her mass of neck rolls. You gotta see them after you're done. Then I'll give you your lion language communication device.\" The immobile young woman explained while she watched Henry feed Nala the big slabs of hippo meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nod from Henry showed that he listened, but didn't stop from feeding Nala one bit though he took his time. Letting his lioness fat blob enjoy the meal. The feeding of hippo meat slabs took most of the day until the evening when the sun was starting to set on the horizon. All ten food carts were now empty, Nala got her fill for the day as was now sleeping off her gluttony induced meal while the food she ate digested noisily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry wiped the sweat off from his forehead and let the two maid servants take away the empty food carts. At least he now had time to explore the area inside the mansion and also the back yard. But a huge fat lioness blob the size of a mountain was hard to believe. \"Okay. I'll take you up on that viewing of your lioness. But a lioness so fat that she's the size of a mountain is hard to imagine let alone believe.\" He said as he and the immobile young woman went through the mansion towards the Viewing Room with live cam monitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, Henry, you will be surprised and shocked. This is the real deal. I'm not joking at all. You will certainly be amazed by her shere size. I just hope your lioness will become as much of a glutton as my lioness.\" The immobile young woman rode of her floating platform, giggling, her own fat wobbling and jiggling.</span></div></div>",

The other fat lioness blob's rolls and entire body jiggling and undulating like a large jello gelitan mold. Slowly, the other lioness blob was lowered to the floor, her fat that was sagging downward spread outwards around her then the platform was removed out from underneath her. Her rolls and body jiggling and wobbling for a good hour. Though much fatter, Nala could slightly see the other fat lioness blob's fat head, even her head was a blob of flabby rolls and was sunken back into the ringing mass of rolls that was her neck, making her fat head look like it was back in a deep cavern several feet, while her face wide and fat bloated cheeks and chin rolls flowed out from that large cavern of neck rolls, spilled out from the entrance and spilled down the other's fat flabby front to spill and pool like a small pool of liquid lava out in front, her wide bloated face cheeks flowed out on both sides of the other lioness blob's chin rolls. Her sides were wider than Nala's, legs fatter and more packed with rolls on both fore and hind legs, her back seemed like it was piled high, half way to the ceiling with bulges and rolls, her tail was nothing but a mound of rolls piled on top of each other while the other lioness blob's rump cheeks bloated out like two twin elephants behind her. \"Why hello, my names Sajala.\" she spoke out from the deep cavern of neck rolls. \"Welcome to the Feeding Mansion.\" Sajala chuckled, causing the blob mound of her entire body to jiggle and wobble like a jello gelitan mod of her own, rolls undulating as they slapped flopped against each other. \"As you may have guessed, my curret beautiful weight is at an incredible 8,500 pounds. And I love it, all of it. You can bet that I'm not going to stop either. Oh, yes, I'm going to get fatter and fatter, every day.\" The four and a half ton lioness blob paused as she was fed by a human feeder of the mansion, eating rather gluttonously on the fatty slabs of hippo and whale meat, though the feeder has to climb up and crawl into the neck roll cavern just to get to Sajala's fat blob head.<br>\r\nNala watched in fasination and growing interest, as she also wanted to get fatter too as a deep rumbling and growling came from her own belly, her belly fat billowing and jiggling from her larger stomach's rumbling. It caused Nala to cry out for more food. Then came Henry with food of the same what Sajala was being fed and he proceeded to feed Nala as well. And she took it greedily as a food glutton would. Her flabby fat jiggling and swaying on her head and on her neck rolls as Nala was fed and ate. This was something like what she had dreamed about, constantly being fed, eating during the day then getting much more fatter during the night as her large stomach digested all the delicious food she had eaten each day. Perhaps now she could live her dream. But as she get bigger, she would need a more constant way of being fed during the day, perhaps like Sajala had been doing. Cause she really needed, wanted to catch up and maybe perhaps get bigger and fatter than even Sajala was.<br>\r\nBoth lionesses ate their fill of food until it was night after the sun had set, their bellies full and waiting for them to go to sleep to digest all the food they had eaten. Nala spoke up first. \"Nice to meet you, Sajala. So your fatter than me, but just wait, I'm going to catch up soon. My name's Nala.\" She said as she did her best to settle down for the night on the floor. Both of their feeder's the other human and Henry left to maybe sleep or go talk to catch up on things. \"I've a dream to become the fattest lioness in the world. So I guess we could call this a Feeding Competition?\" Nala asked, licking the fatty juices off her fat muzzle and what she could reach of her face fat bloated face cheeks. Her tongue had gotten wider and longer as a result of her gaining.<br>\r\n\"My my, a dream you have indeed, Nala. But yes, it can be Feeding Competition. I think I'd enjoy it. By the way, there is a scientist human here that is working on a lion language communication device so our feeder's can understand our language and we understand their's. Plus he is working on a rapid weight gain serum, at first it was for me.....now I think he'll include you too. So just think, we'll be able to gain weight faster during the day.\" Sajala licked the fatty meat juices off her fat muzzle, nearest chin rolls, neck rolls and face cheeks as well.<br>\r\n\"Alright, let the Competition begin tomorrow. Wow, so I could finally tell my human caretaker my love for fat, food and desire to get fatter. And the rapid gaining serum sounds like it'd be a wonderful help to getting fatter.\" Nala commented, licking over her nearest chin rolls and neck rolls, trying to get all the fatty juices she could.<br>\r\n\"Yes, a great help. They may have to end up moving us outside so we don't damage the house if we get any fatter. And they may have to start feeding you with a hose and giant vat too like they had been with me ever since my fat head sunk back into my own mass of neck rolls. Heh, but that was my own doing. Perhaps you should try it out, if you want to catch up to me that is.\" Sajala smirked best she could, as she gave Nala a suggestion. \"Anyway, good to meet you. Good night.\" Sajala said, thinking just how much fatter she'll be by tomorrow.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, goodnight Sajala.\" Nala said, thinking of the pleasure of being fed by a hose and giant vat all day as well as the result of getting fatter like Sajala. But like Sajala, Nala too fell asleep so her and Sajala's stomach's could digest all the food they ate today. She just wished Henry would love her more like the affection Nala had been giving him. What they needed what that lion language communication device, then that boarder could be finally crossed.<br>\r\nBoth lioness blobs slept while their stomach's loudly digested the mass of food that had been consumed, their bodies jiggling and wobbling slightly from their stomach's digestion movements. Seems even the slightest movements will get their bodies in a jello gelitan mold motion. With smiles of pleasure and delight upon their fat faces.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a lurch, the feel of being slightly lifted made Nala gasp out in surprise. The moving making her fat lioness blob body jiggle wildly, her flabby rolls slapping and <br>\r\nflopping against each other, her body wobbling like a jello gelitan mold. She felt herself being moved out of the large trailer interior backwards and outside outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now set her over in the center.\" A voice called out. It sounded like her human caretaker Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the mobile large trailer now, Nala could barely see a vast wide open grassy plain like a savannah. This had to be another place to keep her. And yet, <br>\r\nshe could make out high walls of some sort in the far distance. There was also a source of water, a small lake nearby, big enough for a herd of hippos to be in.<br>\r\nOn the platform, even her flabby furred fat oozed and spilled over the sides, front and back and hung down to a foot off the ground, the flabby flesh jiggling and <br>\r\nswaying with both the movement of her being moved and her own body movements. But oh, she wished they'd hurry up cause she is hungry again, very hungry.<br>\r\nThe moving of the seven ton lioness blob of fat took an hour until the moving stopped and she was lowered back to the solid ground which caused her sagging <br>\r\nflab to at first bunch up then spread out as the platform was slowly removed out from under her. That slow movement did cause her a good deal of pleasure, <br>\r\nshe was greatful to feel her fat firmly laying on the ground again. Her entire fat lioness blob body jiggled, undulated and wobbled for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we'll make good use of this larger encloser. Its the size of ten football fields. Plenty enough room.\" Henry spoke up, walking up to her. <br>\r\n\"Alright, now I hear that your hungry again.\" Wishing again that he could understand the lioness's own language somehow and if she understood him. <br>\r\n\"But this time I've got a surprise for you. Something that will let you feed constantly all day, taking breaks as you want, especially all during nights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala could only reply by opening her fat plump muzzle, ready to be fed, actually by any means possible. The fat of her muzzle jiggling too, her round <br>\r\nbulged face cheeks wobbling and bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if your so needing of food...\" Henry lifted up a clear long hose that was as thick as a fire hose up to her opened muzzle and placed it into her muzzle, <br>\r\nmaking sure the nozzle went all the way in. \"...then I won't disappoint.\" With that, he moved away to set the panel control for Nala's type of feeding, actually <br>\r\nhaving it sence when she was hungry and automatically give her food, but having it take breaks in her feeding for Nala to gradually get used to this new <br>\r\nkind of feeding. Breaks at night for her to sleep. While the food itself in question is of a pasty hippo fatty meat and whale fat mixed together. But for dessert, <br>\r\nhe'd have it automatically switch to giving Nala a flow of passion fruit jello gelitan in hopes that the lioness blob would enjoy the passion fruit but in a different <br>\r\nform as a dessert. So without any further time wasting, he turned on the giant vat which was massive itself at a whopping container able to hold three <br>\r\nmillion tons of food. In fact, the giant vat itself was right outside of the high wall where they had brought Nala in with the large semi truck and trailer with its <br>\r\nlong clear hose going from Nala's fat muzzle, down her fat front and all the way on the ground to where it was outside of the encloser. There was a whirring <br>\r\nsound and the pasty food of hippo fat and whale fat being pumped through the hose at a medium speed in a gallons of amount, then into the hungry Nala's <br>\r\nawaiting mouth, the paste filled her round face cheeks until Henry heard Nala gulping loudly. Like she was all willing to feed in this way, to feed her gluttony <br>\r\nand desire to get far more fatter from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry watched the lioness blob feeding, hearing the loud gulping sounds coming from her and the jiggling motions her entire fat body was making as she <br>\r\nfed on the fatty food flowing through the clear hose and into her. It was hard to say if her stomach was still at its regular size or it had grown bigger also <br>\r\nto accomedate her hunger but Henry was watching to make sure that he had set the vat's control panel right and accurately. But as he watched, was it <br>\r\nhim or was she already getting fatter as she ate?</span></div></div>",

She got to her feet, though she felt it take a bit more effort than normal.  When she opemed her eyes she could see her gut wasn't as large as it had been before her nap, but now it wasn't crammed with food.  Instead it had a new layer of fat added thanks to the fat gazelle she got from Scar.  Taking a moment to look the rest of herself over in a puddle she could see that the rest of her was thickening out too.  She could even see a slight roundness in her face.  She did her best not to look pleased, but she could hardly believe how beautifully fat she was becoming and so fast at that.  She could hardly await her next meal as it was already being divided between the other lions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nala reached the food she looked at her portions with disgust on her face.  There was such a meager amount that she could eat through it without satiating her hunger that increased the more she looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, dear,\" Sarafina said as she approached her daughter. \"The hunt didn't go so well today, but we managed to find enough food for everyone.  I made sure to get you a larger chunk since you didn't eat earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala thanked her mother for thinking about her and began eating her food.  When she finished she looked at the remains of the catch, but it had already been picked clean.  Nala had no choice, but to wait until she got a chance to get away.  She figured those other gazelles were still with Scar and just the thought that they could all be hers made her mouth water.  Time passed as everyone finished their meals and eventually turned in.  Soon Nala saw her mother do the same and once she was certain it was clear, she snuck away and made a v line to Scar's place.  She didn't care about the dangers of wandering off alone or what might happen if she was found missing and the consequences that were sure to come.  All she wanted to do was eat and eat and eat and grow fatter and fatter.</span></div></div>",

She hadn't put much thought into it, but she was easily eating an overwhelming amount of food that an adult lioness would end up being sick to her stomach after consuming and she had continued to eat.

She could only devise that Scar had awoken already and brought her breakfast.  She figured that as long as she appeared to be asleep she could make a run for the cave entrance.  With that she leapt to her feet.  With her meal digested her stomach had shrunk, though a considerable amount of fat was added to her body rounding it out, but there was no time to look at herself.  However, as fast as she got to her feet she came to a halt seeing that not only was she not where she fell asleep, but in a pit much to steep to climb and piled with tons of meat.  To make matters worse, Scar was staring down at her with some hyenas at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see your stomach settle by the way you can move.  I guess that means you're ready to eat now.  Don't worry about the amount of food in there... I can always send my hyenas out for more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala knew this pasted the board line between helpful and psychotic quite some time ago and she had to put a stop to this.  \"Why are you so obsessed with fattening me up?\" she growled.  \"Sure I wanted to get fat, but not this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar chuckled at her words already prepared with a response. \"My dear, you will undoubtedly be the queen of the Pridelands one day won't you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.  I've never really put too much thought in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, even so, as your royal subjects we must obeys your orders and fulfill your desires.  Please forgive us, but we only do this to make you happy.  We do not wish you any harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala didn't want to believe Scar's words anymore, but as things were she couldn't get out of this mess.  She could only wait for someone to rescue her, but with Scar's cleverness it could be a long stay.  Still, the food did look good and she was feeling famished.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nala didn't have much of a choice of whether or not she could leave the cave anymore.  All she had was the choice to eat and with an empty belly that made the answer simple.  She ate slowly, afraid of the Hyenas above.  They let out wicked cackles that made her wonder if they were about to attack her or if they were trying to simply scare her.  Whatever the reason they didn't so much as lay a paw on her.  In time they wander around a bit, getting bored with her just staring at them.  They didn't even need to watch her as escape was already impossible.  With them gone she went back to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs day turned to night or night to day, since Nala quickly lost track of time in the cave, Nala wondered what her family was doing.  Were they looking for her or had Scar already tricked them with some sort of lie.  Whatever the case, Nala never felt so alone.  She eventually grew tired and decided to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke, she quickly remembered her situation and paced around her pit of a home, checking to see if the hyenas were still about.  They were, though most were lazing around, bored.  Nala had always been taught to be fearful of the beasts, but after being at their mercy for so long and not being harmed she felt somewhat relaxed around them.  She even lost some of her fear and hate for her uncle since he did seem to go through all the trouble to get all this food for her.  As Nala's mind raced through all this information, she realized she was hungry again and started eating again, but before long she found she had just about run out.  Nala knew Scar told her she could ask for more, but was he being serious.  She nervously tried to get one of the hyena's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mr. Hyena.\" she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a Mr.\" replied the hyena Nala was trying to talk to who was apparently a female. \"My name is Gina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Gina.\" Nala said.  Nala was surprised by how friendly she acted towards her.  If the circumstances were different they could've become friends.  It seemed even possible that they could become friends even now.  \"Uh, I'm almost out of food and Scar said I could ask for more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More food?\" replied Gina.  \"Don't worry, a few of the others went out earlier.  They should be back soon.  We figured you might need more soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala became excited by her words and replied with a loud, \"Thank You!\"  Her voice echoed through the cave.  Nala felt embarrassed and the hyenas all gave their usual chuckled that seemed less sinister to Nala and more like a heartful laugh to her ears.  Nala was actually beginning to like it in the cave like it was a second home and though it was dark, she felt her future was going to be bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays passed and became weeks and then months as Nala spent her time eating, sleeping, and having chats with Gina and the other hyenas.  Her schedual of doing those things was whenever she felt like it since a normal schedual by what time of day it was didn't apply to her sunless life.  She had grown very fat through her meals and lack of exercise.  The feedings grew even more intense as well.  They had to fill the pit up with so much food to satisfy Nala eventually that they buried her alive.  They'd all laugh hysterically upon seeing her like that and Nala had grown to love their laugh.  She even developed a laugh of her own, but it sounded so wierd it made the hyenas laugh even more.  When Scar made his daily visits to see Nala or at least how big she was, Nala was just as friendly with him as with all the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is my little princess\" he would always begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked Nala over, her gut had made her lose ground clearance a while ago.  Her feet  were coverd by flab.  Her tail a thick sausage and much shorter because of her obese rump that had comsumed most of it.  The hyenas laughed at her past attempts to try and wag it.  Her chins had doubled then tripled before she lost count of them.  her face was much rounded, swollen with fat.  If it wasn't talking to the hyenas or eating, it was resting on her bed of chins.  Nala was practically a ball of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt eventually became a problem keeping her in the pit, however, as her home was becoming too snuck.  It took a lot of work, but after tying vines to Nala and filling the pit with water, they managed to get her out.  From there, she was able to see more of the cave, but it was still just a whole lot of dark.  Still, it felt like she was moving into a new home, closer to her friends, which was true since she got to eat with them now.  They even enjoyed feeding her themselves, trying to see if they could even get Nala full.  Nala always won of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala loved it there and could never imagine living anywhere else.</span></div></div>",

She doubted any less lioness would swear off anything larger than a leg of a gazzelle after an experience like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My you sure live to eat.\" remarked Scar in his casual voice that ignored everything that just transpired. \"Of course I figured you'd have a little room left over so I got you your favorate, some zebra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala's eyes bulged as a whole zebra was brought in.

Her stomach strained to contain all the food the young lioness was stuffing into it, but Nala couldn't feel the pain. Every bit of her attention was focused on the pleasure of consumption. A heard of elephants could have stampeded by and she would not have noticed, so caught up was she in her own little world of gluttony. As she ate, her poor stomach ballooned further and further until it lifted her legs off of the ground, spreading them as though she was lying on some large animal instead of her own gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised to find, eventually, that there was no more zebra in front of her. Once she'd eaten herself into temporary immobility, Scar had (unbeknownst to Nala, of course) commanded his hyenas to constantly push the remaining meat up to her so all she had to do was open her mouth and there was another bite of flesh waiting for her. Thus is was that she didn't even realize her lack of mobility until after she'd realized that she had eaten the whole zebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even then, she didn't seem overly concerned with her lack of mobility. She just craned her neck back and forth as best she could, looking for more to eat. Scar was impressed. He had hoped that his little speech would inspire the cub, but he hadn't expected her to do this well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, my dear?\" he asked smoothly. When there was no answer, he padded around to where he could see Nala's head. The young lioness had fallen fast asleep. When the hyenas saw what was going on, they went to get more meat, to continue force-feeding Nala, but Scar held up a paw. \"There will be no need for that any more, I think.

She was hungry again, but not ravenously so: She hadn't finished digesting her huge meal. Nala groaned and lifted herself to her feet. It was a difficult task, and for a moment she remembered how she'd immobilized herself the night before and thought in a panic that she wouldn't be able to get up at all. But no, she eventually managed to get herself up on all fours, though it took longer than she was used to. Since she hadn't fully digested her last meal, her belly still hung low and heavy between her legs, which messed up her center of gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, unused to her new weight, Nala waddled toward the mouth of the den. As she walked, she absently wondered what it would be like to have a belly like this all the time, not just when it was full of food. She was initially unhappy with the idea, since moving her colossal stomach was such a pain, but she thought back to the night before and how food had just kept appearing in her mouth. If she could find a way to live like that all the time, semi-mobility wouldn't be so bad, especially since it would allow her to eat as much as she desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Scar bounded into the mouth of the den, standing between the bloated young lioness and freedom. Nala shrank back instinctively, but didn't know why. After all, Scar had been nothing but helpful to her. Even the force-feeding had been in Nala's best interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just where do you think you're going, young lady?\" Scar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going home,\" Nala replied. \"My mom and dad will worry about me if I'm gone too long. Y-you're not going to try to stop me, are you?\" In her present condition (not to mention the fact that she was still only a cub), there was no way she would be able to overpower a full-grown lion. But Scar's thin mouth broke into a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, my dear. After the way you proved yourself last night, you're free to go whenever you want.\" As if to prove his point, he slithered out of her way, leaving her with a clear view of the den entrance. \"I just thought you might like some breakfast before you go, to sustain you through the long journey back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Scar's signal, two hyenas dragged an antelope carcass out where Nala could see--and, more importantly, smell--it. In spite of how full she still was, the young lioness found herself salivating at the thought of eating more, but she was already dangerously low on mobility. If she ate the whole antelope (and she knew that if she started, she would eat the whole thing), she could be stuck here while she digested.</span></div></div>",

As before, Nala quickly lost what little mobility she had, and it was up to the hyenas to make sure she was still able to feed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe antelope carcass disappeared quickly, and when it was gone, Nala was immobilized but so drunk off the fantastic feeling of stuffing herself that she didn't realize it. She tried to push herself toward the exit on paws that only barely reached the ground, but didn't make much progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her struggle, Scar said, \"Come now, Nala. That tiny antelope couldn't have filled you up. Have a bit more, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyenas dragged a zebra up to her, and after that it was automatic. Nala had flipped her eating switch when she'd taken the first bite of the antelope, and now she couldn't have stopped if she wanted to. Not that she <i>did</i> want to: Eating beyond all rational limit was a euphoric sensation to her, and she would stop only when she couldn't force down another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, that point was midway through the zebra and, just as had happened the night before, she fell asleep as soon as her body realized that she wasn't able to eat any more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One morning (or was it afternoon? Time was an indistinct blur delineated only by alternating periods of food and sleep), Nala awoke groggily only to find that Scar was nowhere to be found. She looked around as best she could with her rather limited field of vision; she called out for the lion and even for the hyenas. Nothing. For once, she was apparently all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't happy about that. Her immense stomach, so used to being constantly fed, grumbled in protest that Nala had been up a full minute and yet it wasn't getting any food. The lioness was inclined to agree with her gut. She rather enjoyed being able to eat to her capacity and beyond without actually having to move, and the fact that she could find neither any of her helpers nor anything to munch on until they got back distressed her greatly. Scar could have at least left something in front of her to tide her over if he knew he was going to be gone for such an extended period of time--though, in truth, it had barely been any time at all since Nala had woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lioness had long since become truly and permanently immobile, so all she could do was stew atop her huge stomach and wait for Scar or his lackeys to return. For the first time in... well, in she didn't know how long, Nala wished she could move under her own power. Immobility was fantastic--when there was someone around to feed her. As the seconds ticked by and no friendly face appeared with food, she began to get seriously (if irrationally) worried that she was going to starve to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden, she heard something outside the cave. It sounded like someone trying to be sneaky, which was odd. The only people she ever saw were Scar and his hyenas, and none of them would have felt the need to creep around. That meant it was a stranger. Nala obviously couldn't hide herself, so she settled for closing her eyes and tucking her plump head  as far back into her monstrously fat body as it would go. She could hear the intruder enter, and she held her breath, hoping that whoever it was would mistake her for a rock or something, but the interloper padded straight up to her and pressed their nose into her flank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure subsided after a moment, and she heard the intruder breath, \"What in the world?\" It had been a while since she'd heard it, but Nala would know that voice anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba?\" she asked, daring to raise her head. The young lion moved wonderingly into her field of vision and indeed, it was Simba, who was staring up at her with huge, round eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nala!?\" he exclaimed. \"What happened to you? You...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba tried to dash out of the den as quickly as he could while still keeping his eyes on Nala, so he didn't notice when Scar appeared in the mouth of the den; he slammed right into the older lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, what do we have here?\" Scar said, picking the cub up with his forepaws. \"The little prince! Good afternoon, Simba! What brings you to my humble abode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to go find some food for Nala,\" Simba answered meekly. He hadn't been doing anything wrong, exactly, but no matter how gorgeous Nala had become since he'd last seen her, the cub (being a cub) was a little embarrassed to be so obviously smitten. Heck, right up until he'd seen Nala in all of her glory, Simba had been convinced that all girls had fleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happily, the young lady won't have to rely on your hunting skills,\" the older lion said silkily. The insult went right over Simba's head, because at that moment, a cackle of hyenas dragged in what looked to be a freshly-killed zebra. Simba saw how Nala's eyes lit up at the sight of food, and against his better instincts, he wished that she would look at <i>him</i> like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can I stay while you eat?\" Simba asked, but Nala's face was already buried in her meal, and she didn't look up at the sound of Simba's voice. \"Nala?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her eat,\" Scar admonished. \"You can stay if you'd like, as long as you don't bother Nala.\" That was fine with Simba, so he sat down and watched Nala stuff herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...incredible. As massive as she was for her age, Nala was still much smaller than a full-grown zebra, and yet she ate like the carcass was just a light snack, stuffing down what must have been several times her body weight in meat. As she ate, her already-sizable flanks ballooned visibly, until Simba was afraid that she would pop like a bubble--and that was with nearly a third of the zebra left! His romantic fascination was now matched by a morbid one, as he waited for her to explode. He wanted to cry out for her to stop, but he remembered what Scar had told him and so held his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, she <i>didn't</i> stop. Simba understood how Nala had blossomed from a scrawny cub to an immobile beauty in just a few weeks, if she ate like this every day. He noticed that the hyenas who had brought in the zebra made sure that Nala had to move as little as possible to get another bite, and deep down, he envied them. He wanted to be the one right up close to the gorging lioness. He saw her fat toes curl as she continued binging, and realized all of a sudden that the noises she was making as she ate weren't from the pain of her overstuffed belly, but from pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she had finished the whole zebra. She looked around blinkingly, as if she was coming out of a trance. Simba opened his mouth to tell her how amazing that was, but Scar cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any more food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course,\" Scar replied, and motioned for the hyenas to bring in the next course. Simba's eyes bulged. It was an eland, and it was, if anything, bigger than the zebra had been. Mouth agape, he looked at Nala, but she didn't seem at all worried about the danger of consuming such a large animal. She just watched the hyenas drag it toward her, a contented, almost sleepy smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't eat that whole thing!\" Simba cried. \"You'll explode!\" Scar looked at the cub sharply, a hint of a snarl on his lips. The dark-furred lion had worked hard to get Nala to her current state, and if Mufasa's son thought that he was going to shake her out of it, he had another thing coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Scar underestimated how much Nala <i>wanted</i> to keep eating. At Simba's outburst, she looked over at the cub as though registering his presence for the first time. She opened her mouth and said...</span></div></div>",

Scar bit back a snicker, but Nala just smiled. \"I'm serious. Then you'll see how much I can eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes!\" Simba said hurriedly. God, he wanted nothing else. \"What do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure that the eland is always by my mouth. I can't exactly run around to find more of it.\" For emphasis, she slapped her massive flank with one thick, useless paw. Even as stuffed as she was, it jiggled a little, and Simba was mesmerized by the hypnotic motion of fat under fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for him to do anything else, Nala dug in. Hurriedly, Simba darted over to the carcass, ready to move it closer to Nala as she needed it. Even when he was this close, Nala didn't seem to really see him, or at least she didn't acknowledge his presence. Instead, she buried her fat face in the carcass and ate like she was starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba had some trouble moving the eland, which was of course much bigger than he was. At one point, Nala actually ran out of meat within reach, and she looked up with a strangled cry, worried that she'd finished the whole thing already. Simba hurriedly, and with a burst of strength, pushed the remaining carcass back up to her, and she resumed eating like nothing had happened. Keeping the meat close to her got easier as she ate, since there was less meat to push, but Simba was still slow and clumsy at it because he was so fascinated by watching her eat and grow. As before, she didn't seem concerned with the seeming impossibility of eating so much. She just kept glutting herself as though every bite was her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the most beautiful thing Simba had ever seen. Her stomach expanded bit by bit as she ate until she was bigger than the remaining meat. She scarfed that down too; Simba fed her the last few bites, which were too low to the ground for the massive lioness to reach, himself, and was disappointed that there was nothing left for her to eat. Nala's eyes were glazed over from her massive display of gluttony, and she still didn't seem to notice him. He pressed himself up against her taut side, imagining the vast quantities of meat it contained all turned to soft, pliable fat. The thought of making Nala even bigger thrilled him in a way that made the cub a little uncomfortable.</span></div></div>",

I'm fine,\" Nala said dazedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we were fortunate enough to take down another eland,\" Scar replied, eying his massively engorged charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, feed it to her!\" Simba said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the prince of the Pride Lands! Of course I'm sure! And what's more, you have to do what I say!\" Simba said as authoritatively as he could manage. The hyenas laughed uproariously at his attempt to command them, but Scar held up a paw to silence them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you command, Simba,\" he said silkily, with a little bow. It galled him to pretend like Simba had any authority over anything, but if the little brat wanted to overfeed Nala, so be it. Let the cub be the bad guy. It would only drive Nala closer to Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, this animal was bigger than the last one had been--twice the size of the other eland, in fact--but far from the apprehension Simba had felt last time, the hugeness of the animal excited him. There was no way he would be able to move this carcass himself, so he commanded the hyenas to resume feeding her. They obeyed, but only (unbeknownst to Simba) after Scar nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can eat this,\" Nala groaned as the new meat was pushed up against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can,\" Simba urged. \"You can eat anything!\" Nala nodded groggily and started to eat again, but she was going far too slowly for Simba's taste. \"If she can't eat, force her,\" Simba said. The illicitness of forcing this huge glutton to eat more than even <i>she</i> wanted only made the whole thing more exciting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter surreptitiously checking with Scar again, the hyenas did as Simba commanded them. They stuffed hunk after hunk of meat into Nala's mouth, and she swallowed mechanically, in too much of a stupor to do much else. Simba was no longer sure if the noises she was making were from pleasure, pain or some combination of the two. But it didn't matter. She was expanding, growing ever larger, and Simba was pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last of the second eland disappeared into Nala's enormously overstuffed gut. The young lioness lay motionless on top of her mountainous stomach, panting and groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you two alone,\" Scar said with a smirk. When Nala realized what had happened, all her ire would be directed at Simba, not at him.</span></div></div>",

Nala probably knew her limits (then again, from looking at her, maybe she didn't...), and he hadn't meant to seriously harm her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala groaned. \"Scar did that to me once,\" she said thickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did what?\" Simba said, not comprehending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Force-fed me. It was a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...?\" Simba wasn't sure where this was going. He was apprehensive that she was going to yell at him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really scary when he did it. I thought I was going to die.\" She paused, running her paws up and down as much of her colossal paunch as she could reach. \"It wasn't so scary when you did it. I know you'd never hurt me, and I like that you're helping me eat more than I could on my own. I really do want to get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba looked her over. \"Are you saying that you're not fat now?\" he asked incredulously. \"I mean--don't take that the wrong way. I really like you like this, but, um--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I know what you mean,\" she said, laughing. \"And I guess I am pretty fat. But I love to eat, and I love how it feels when my stomach's distended. You gave me that feeling better than I've ever been able to do it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, if you want to feed me like that every day, I'd like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Simba jumped at the chance to do something so pleasurable all the time. Their time together quickly settled into a routine: Nala would eat as much as she could on her own, and then Simba would force her to eat more, always at least as much as she'd consumed \"willingly.\" Sometimes she'd cry or beg him to stop, but he knew better than to listen to her pleas, and afterwards, she would always reassure him that he'd done the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of her greatly increased food intake, Nala's weight skyrocketed. It was impossible to tell how much of that was food weight, since Nala was always at least full and usually stuffed far past that point, but she was definitely the biggest lion Simba had ever seen. The pair soon grew into young adult lions, Simba growing strong from his constant hefting of Nala's massive meals, and Nala, well, Nala grew very, very fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been immobile since before Simba had found her, of course, but now she was almost completely round. Her paws had completely vanished, buried beneath the rolls of her fat legs, and her legs themselves were partially obscured by the rest of her. But her crowning glory was her stomach, which pushed her up off the ground til her head would have been even with a small human's. It flowed out from beneath her, making her as wide as she was tall. And Simba loved her for it.</span></div></div>",

Your mother and I have been worried sick ab--\" The lion stopped mid-censure as he took in his daughter's new, rounder form. \"What happened to you?\" he demanded. \"Did you eat an elephant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Nala said, hoping that he wouldn't ask about too many other animals. She curled into herself, trying to make herself look smaller so her dad would go easy on her, but there wasn't much she could do about her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait until your mother sees what's happened to you,\" her father said, bounding over her and out of the cave. \"Don't go anywhere, you!\" he added over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala didn't want to go anywhere. She was miserable. She had expected her parents to be happy to have her home, but all her dad seemed to care about was her weight. Like it was any of his business if she liked to eat! Nala's stomach growled, since she hadn't eaten anything all day. Dismally, she hoped that she wasted away to nothing before her parents got back; it would serve them right if she died of starvation. It didn't occur to her that she was maybe overreacting a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't manage to die before her parents returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness, dear, you were right!\" her mother, Sarafina, said as she looked Nala over. \"Well, we'll just have to make sure she eats right from now on.\" Seeing the horror on Nala's face, she added, \"Oh, don't worry, Nala! We don't intend to starve you! Here, I brought you some dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped part of a zebra leg in front of the chubby cub. For any normal lion of Nala's age, it would have been a perfectly satisfying meal, but after her revelatory binge with Simba's uncle, Nala had grown to desire bigger and better things. She finished the meat quickly and felt like she hadn't eaten anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have some more?\" Nala asked sweetly, putting on her saddest, most innocent expression. Unfortunately, Sarafina saw right through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Nala. That was more than enough meat for a cub like you. If you don't watch your eating, how are you going to lose that extra weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I don't want to lose the weight,</i> Nala thought sullenly, but she didn't say as much out loud.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nala felt that her only option was to go back to Scar, apologize for leaving, and hope that he let her stay. She couldn't go to any of her friends at Pride Rock, partly because she didn't know how they'd react to her new weight, but mostly because they'd almost certainly turn her in to her parents, and she couldn't have that. Her bitterness toward them had only grown since she'd set out, and (aside from hunger, of course), the impetus driving her forward was the thought of punishing her parents for trying to starve her to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she was wasting away to practically nothing, Nala found she had an easier time getting back to Scar's den than she had going home. It was probably just anticipation that made her feet light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar was sunning himself outside his den when he heard Nala's approach. His thin lips twisted into a smile. He'd almost given up hope that the cub would return to him. It had been nearly a week, and he was seriously beginning to worry that all his work had been for nothing. But no, his faith in Nala was completely justified. He closed his eyes as she approached, pretending to sleep so she wouldn't know that he had been watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nudged the side of his head, and he opened his eyes and yawned theatrically. \"Nala!\" he exclaimed with faux-surprise. \"I wasn't expecting to see you back so soon! How are things back home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents tried to starve me!\" she replied bitterly. Scar had to suppress another smile. He couldn't have asked for a more perfect response. Nala was obviously in an emotionally unstable state, and he could use that to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as I wasn't expecting you, I don't have any food for you at the moment, but if you'd care to wait, I can send the hyenas out to catch something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala nodded. She guessed she could survive a little longer if she definitely got to eat something soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two lions waited for the hyenas to get back with Nala's meal, Scar asked the cub more probing questions about what her visit with her parents had been like, stoking the fires of the young lioness' anger at the people who had refused to let her eat what she wanted. He could tell that he was getting under her skin from the way she began to pace agitatedly. He fought down a wicked laugh. The pudgy little cub was so manipulable that it was almost charming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Scar's hunters returned with a pair of antelope, and Nala dug in gratefully. She ate as though nothing else mattered in the world, happy for the first time since...well, since she'd left Scar's den the last time. Yet even the warm pleasure of eating was tinged with bitterness. As she ate, Nala couldn't help but think about her parents, and how they had wanted to deny her this, her chief joy in life. Well, she would show <i>them</i>. Now she was with someone who accepted her appreciation for food, and who supported her desire to gain weight. She wished Scar had been her father instead of that jerk who tried to stop her from eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala was so busy thinking angry thoughts that she didn't realize just how much she was eating. She couldn't feel how full she was, so she made her way easily through both of the antelopes, though her recently-starved belly wasn't used to even that much meat. It felt great to have a distended, hanging stomach again. She almost wished her parents could see her now, just so she could taunt them with how much happier she was without them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scar kept Nala both contented and hidden for the next couple weeks. He worried that her parents would come searching for her, and his mental manipulation of the cub was a delicate task. He couldn't afford any interruptions. All through that time, he kept Nala stuffed full, presenting her with increasingly huge amounts of food whenever she asked for some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the constant pampering, Nala had fattened up quite a bit. Her walk had a very pronounced waddle to it--when she bothered to walk at all, which was infrequently--and her gut reached to the ground when she was standing up, not that she spent a lot of time standing, either. Her big stomach oozed out from between her legs when she was sitting; her legs themselves had thickened to the point where they were nearly as big as his own; her neck had nearly disappeared, replaced with rolls of chins that impeded her ability to move her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar made sure to spoil her as much as he could, catering to her every whim and doing things for her whenever he could. As a result, she became more demanding, less shy and polite about her food requests. He also regularly reminded her of the charmed life she lived with him, as compared to the way her parents wanted her to waste away. He wanted her unshakable loyalty, and he couldn't have her retaining any affection toward the idiots who had birthed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala, for her part, needed very little convincing to come around to Scar's point of view. Her new life was paradise, and the better it became, the worse her home seemed in comparison. She liked having her every desire fulfilled as soon as she expressed it. And what she mostly desired, of course, was food. She ate almost constantly, hopelessly addicted to the feeling of a distended, overfull stomach. Soon, the two antelope she'd devoured the first day were little more than an appetizer: As she gained weight and stomach capacity, she needed more and more food to get to that blissful bloated state that was her preferred mode of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, her portions stopped growing. \"What's this supposed to be?\" she demanded, after being presented with the same amount of food she'd eaten the day before. Irrationally, she found herself growing angry at Scar. Was he really better than her parents if two hartebeests a day was all the food he would give her? Two weeks ago, she would have been grateful for any large quantity of food, but Scar had spoiled her well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize, my dear. My hyenas, tragically marginalized as they are, have a limited hunting range. The best hunting ground belongs to the other lions; the hyenas can't set foot there, thanks to king Mufasa.\" Scar said his brother's name with real venom, which resonated with Nala's own bitterness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish <i>you</i> were king,\" she grumbled as she ate her meager meal. Scar smiled wanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I do as well, Nala. But Mufasa is king, and Simba will be king after him. I'm barely a speck in the line of succession.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba. It had been a long time since Nala thought about her friend. She missed him, a bit, but he was an important part of the pride and, as Scar had told her over and over, the pride, like her parents, would hate her for her healthy appetite and try to starve her again. Nala had a little trouble believing that of Simba, but then again, the other cub had never said anything <i>positive</i> about her since she'd started gaining weight. He would be just like all the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Mufasa and Simba would just disappear!\" she said angrily. It wasn't fair that they should be able to do whatever they want while she was barely getting anything to eat. Scar's grin stretched wide, displaying his sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" he said, his voice chastising. \"You'd get rid of your best friend just so you could eat whatever you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe censure in Scar's voice only strengthened Nala's resolve. It was an idle wish, and she didn't really think it through. Simba and Mufasa were abstract quantities to her at the moment, whereas her personal fulfillment was the most important thing in the world. If she had been face to face with her friend, she might have thought differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said determinedly.</span></div></div>",

It had been uncomfortable enough when he'd put her on the spot a moment ago. He didn't need to compound the unpleasantness by talking about stupid hypothetical situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll just have to redouble our efforts, I suppose. Will you be all right by yourself here if we go off hunting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala wanted to say that she was afraid she would starve, but she desperately needed more food. If that meant she had to wait here while Scar and the hyenas killed something...she'd have to be okay with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am. Get going!\" she snapped. Scar was still smiling at her, which seemed incongruous, given what a brat she knew she was being. But he didn't say anything else, just turned and left the den, leaving Nala alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were torture. The hyenas were good hunters, and she was convinced that they'd come back with something. At the same time, she wasn't used to going so long without eating, and her gut let her know that it wasn't happy about not being constantly filled. She felt terrible, but there was nothing she could do about it. There wasn't even anybody around for her to yell at about how they should be feeding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all Mufasa's fault. The hyenas weren't bad people; there was no reason to bar them from hunting in the same places that lions could hunt. In her hunger and anger, Nala felt that the king had made that rule specifically to make her life worse. Just like her parents and their stupid rules about how much she could eat! Scar was right: all the other lions were exactly the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala's ruminations were cut short by Scar's return. To the young lioness' delight, the hyenas behind him were bringing in four wildebeest carcasses. The bodies looked strange, almost like they had been squashed to death, but Nala wasn't in a position to be picky. They were food, and that was all she cared about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in, my dear,\" Scar said as the hyenas piled the carcasses in front of her. \"There's plenty more where that came from.\" Nala was awash in gratitude for the dark-furred lion. He'd come through for her, despite all the challenges involved in getting so much food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore into the first wildebeest. It was softer than she was used to her meat being, but that made it easier to swallow, so she certainly wasn't complaining. There must have been nearly a ton of meat there, more than Nala had eaten at one time since coming back to Scar, but she was usually kept totally full. Today, she hadn't eaten in hours, so she had more room to spare in her stomach. The young lioness moaned orgiastically as she ate. She could feel her stomach getting bigger than it had ever been before, immobilizing her by lifting her thick legs off the ground. She was still a young cub, but she was so bloated and monstrously obese that she was nearly half as tall as Scar, and probably at least as heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, such a big meal would leave Nala nearly comatose, but something--the stress of the day, perhaps--kept her wits clear this time. She didn't feel sleepy at all. Heck, she didn't even feel full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you had more food,\" she said. \"Bring it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar smiled. \"As you wish, my dear. But we could only carry this many animals at a time, so we'll have to go back to get more. I'm afraid that means that you'll have to stay here by yourself again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" Nala said. If there was more food already killed, she wouldn't have to wait for them to hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and one more thing, Nala,\" Scar said, turning around just as he was about to leave the cave. Nala wanted to scream at him to go get her food and stop dawdling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she said instead, still sounding very impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you see Simba, please tell me when I get back. I'm worried about the poor boy.\" Nala couldn't work up the energy to care about what had happened to make Scar worry about his nephew. She just wanted him to go bring back more wildebeest or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" she said. With that, Scar bounded away, the hyenas following behind him.</span></div></div>",

Even if she had been mobile, she wouldn't have had the energy nor the desire to go out to him. At one point in her life, she would have wanted nothing more than to bound over to her friend, but now she wasn't interested unless he was hiding a hippo or something. She felt that it wouldn't be too bothersome to call out to him, though. Perhaps having someone to talk to would make the wait more bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba!\" The young lion had already been heading toward Scar's den, but he quickened his pace when he heard his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nala?\" he asked, surprised. Though she'd disappeared a couple weeks prior, she was still just about the last person he expected to meet here. He vaguely wondered how she had gotten so fat in such a short time, but he had more pressing issues on his mind. He paced restlessly in a circle around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" she asked. That simple question made tears form in the corners of Simba's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I killed my dad!\" he sobbed. Perhaps he shouldn't have been telling her, but he was in no state to think things through. \"I w-was in the gorge, and there was a wildebeest stampede, and my dad saved me, b-but...\" he trailed off, crying. Nala was somewhat sympathetic to his distress, but her chief thought was that now she knew what was up with the squashed wildebeest: they'd been trampled to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means you're the king now, doesn't it?\" she asked cautiously. Perhaps Mufasa's death could be good luck for her. If Simba became king and she could convince Simba to let the hyenas hunt in the Pridelands, then all her food-supply troubles would be over. But Simba just looked at her like he couldn't believe she'd just said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you think about that right now?\" he demanded. \"My father is <i>dead</i> because of me! And meanwhile, you've been hiding out here turning yourself into a disgusting blob! I shouldn't be surprised that you're thinking about this totally selfishly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala was taken aback by the vehemence of his response. \"I'm sorry,\" she said quietly, her head hanging as low as it could go. \"I didn't mean it like that.\" Well, yes she had, but she hadn't meant for him to get all worked up about it. He rubbed his eyes with a forepaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too,\" he said. \"I'm just--this is really hard for me. I shouldn't take it out on you.\" Nala noticed that he didn't actually take back the bit about her being disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you doing here?\" she asked, in an attempt to change the subject. \"If it had been me and my dad, I guess I would have gone home.\" She was trying to sympathize with her, but all she thought about when she thought about her own father was how he had unfairly restricted her eating habits, so that was a bit of a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-after I...well, after, I saw Scar, and he told me to come here so we could talk about what happened. Do you know if he'll be back soon?\" If he was going back to the gorge to get more wildebeest, probably not, Nala thought. That was at least half an hour's walk from here (<i>without</i> the added weight of Nala's food), and Simba had only missed his uncle by about ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Nala replied hesitantly. \"In an hour or so, maybe.\" Simba looked up at her with wide, wet eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think I can wait that long. What do you think, Nala? Do you think I should go home?\"</span></div></div>",

So she shook her head vehemently, which cased her whole body to wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she said quietly. \"I mean, if it was my father, it wouldn't be a big deal, but your dad was the best king the Pridelands ever had.\" She didn't believe anything of the sort, of course, but she needed to sell this to Simba. \"You need to get out of here before anyone realizes what happens. Can you imagine what everyone will say when they find out that you killed Mufasa? You'll be shunned. It's better to strike out on your own now and save yourself all that pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think so?\" Simba asked, obviously about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Simba nodded despondently and started making his way out of the den. \"But Simba? Be careful out there, okay? Just because you have to leave the pride doesn't mean you should do anything stupid.\" He nodded again, but didn't give her any other acknowledgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nala watched his small form recede in the distance, she felt a pang of guilt. She had just told her best friend to leave everything he'd ever known, all so she could eat a little more. But, she rationalized, it wasn't as though she could go chase him down and stop him, and he was probably too far away to hear if she yelled. Besides, had her advice really been so bad? If the pride had been willing to try and starve her just because she ate a little more than most lions, what would they do to the cub who killed their king? No, she hadn't just sent him off for selfish reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her intellectual conviction that she hadn't done anything wrong, Nala was still grappling with her guilty conscious when Scar returned. She was relieved to see the lion, and even more relieved to see that Scar had brought another four trampled wildebeest with him. Hopefully, a good stuffing would put her back in her right mind. But when the food was put in front of her, she hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Nala?\" Scar asked, sounding concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba came by here,\" she said glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he killed Mufasa!\" she blurted. \"And he was going to wait for you, but you weren't coming back for a long time, so he asked me what I thought he should do, and I said he should run away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite a bit to take in,\" Scar said, blinking, \"but I think you made a good choice, Nala. The other lions would hate him forever if they knew what happened. Better to let them think he died with his father, and let him live a shame-free life elsewhere.\" Scar's words relieved Nala immensely. He was a smart lion; if he thought she did the right thing, then she had nothing to worry about. She bent her head to begin eating, but then raised it again. She had one more niggling suspicion that she wanted to put to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't...\" Nala paused, trying to think of the least crazy-sounding way to put it. \"You didn't send Simba here on purpose to see what I'd tell him, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar was shocked, but he managed to keep his composure. He hadn't expected his little glutton to be so sharp!</span></div></div>",

It was simply lucky that her choice also happened to benefit her. But when she noticed her thoughts drifting from the bombshell Scar had just dropped to the smell of the meat sitting in front of her, realization hit so hard that no amount of denial could wash it away. She didn't care about Simba nearly as much as she cared about eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was worse was that the realization didn't bother her. Her former friend had had the gall to call <i>her</i> disgusting after killing his own father! Eating, on the other hand, had never brought her anything but happiness. Maybe what she had done was objectively wrong. But it had been the right thing to do to increase her own pleasure, and after weeks of pampered hedonism, that was enough for her. And the only person who had never tried to stop her eating, the only person who'd never been anything but supportive of her gain...was Scar. Without the food he brought her, she would never have been able to gain so much weight so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe supposed that she loved him, as much as she loved anything that wasn't eating. She was eternally grateful to him, at least, and to her adolescent mind, it was more or less the same thing. Sure, he was kind of underhanded, and he could be pretty scary, but he'd never done anything \"bad\" that wasn't in Nala's best interest. And, as he had pointed out, she was just the same as him, when one got right down to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said decisively. \"I would love to be your queen. Can I eat now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, darling,\" Scar replied, pleased. \"I'd like nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala felt his eyes on her as she buried her face in the fresh pile of meat, but it didn't bother her. Letting him admire her was the least she could do after all he'd done for her, both in terms of food and of personal revelations. She had never really thought about the moral ramifications of her eating, but it was clear to her now that if she wanted to keep going down her current path (and there was nothing she wanted more), she would have to give up most of the semblance of a normal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, the thought that she was doing something that most people would classify as \"bad\" made gluttony all the better. She was eating more than she ever had before, and was probably in real danger of overdoing it, but she didn't care. Her already-mountainous stomach strained to contain all the food she consumed as she continued to gorge herself at a ferocious pace. The four wildebeest disappeared surprisingly quickly, given how much she had already eaten that day.</span></div></div>",

The hyenas didn't move; they just looked up at her, stunned. \"You heard me,\" Nala snapped. \"Bring me more food.\" They nodded and disappeared from her line of vision, only to return a moment later with more wildebeest carcasses. So, Scar had been lying about having to make a long journey, as well. She was miffed that he had withheld food from her, but if she had been in his position, she would have done the same thing, she supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, even her prodigious stomach was having some trouble containing all the food she was consuming, but she pressed on regardless, slowing down but never stopping. After everything that had happened that day, this was more than a meal to her: it was an act of defiance. If she was going to be Scar's queen, she had to kill off any remaining doubts that might be lingering in her mind, and with her limited life experience, she could think of no better way to do that than to glut herself until she couldn't think any more. Stuffing herself past the point where even she felt like she'd had enough was the ultimate selfish, decadent act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer taut, straining stomach pushed her further and further off the ground until she was taller than Scar. She had visible difficulty forcing down the last few mouthfuls, but she was a practiced overeater, so she managed all right. Once there was no more meat in front of her, Nala took stock of her situation. She'd never eaten so much at once before; the combined weight of all the wildebeest had to have been more than that hippo. Once she digested the massive amount of food she had eaten, she would certainly be wider than she was tall, and she personally doubted that she would ever walk again, not least because she intended to keep herself fed this level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, she couldn't completely stop feeling bad about Simba. Guilt ate away at her, leaving her feeling hollow. Well, she knew how to deal with a hollow feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More!\" she cried urgently. \"And keep it coming until I tell you to stop!\" The hyenas obeyed reluctantly. Nala looked over at where Scar lay watching her, silently daring him to tell her to stop. But he only gave her a slow, approving nod. He really was the perfect lion for her, she realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar watched with interest as his new queen resumed her attempt to drown her better nature in food. Dozens of wildebeest had died during the stampede, so he had no shortage of new meat for her, but the process she was going through fascinated him. He himself had never been burdened with much of a conscious, but Nala had been a perfectly ordinary--if unusually glutinous--cub when he had started feeding her, and through weeks of hard work, he'd brought her to this point, where she was trying to kill her own conscience to be more worthy of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala, of course, wasn't privy to any of Scar's private thoughts. Somewhere after she lost track of exactly how many wildebeest she had consumed, something snapped inside her mind. All conscious thought drained away, replaced by a feeling of glutted bliss. She stopped eating mid-wildebeest; she had thought that there was no greater pleasure to be had in life than eating past fullness, but this mindless, orgiastic state was so far beyond that that no amount of eating could improve it.</span></div></div>",

Oh, sure, it still felt great, but it was an addicting feeling. Whenever she dipped below a certain threshold of overfullness, guilt over everything she'd done to get to this point would assault her, and to her addled mind, the guilt seemed worse every time it reoccurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer queendom was thus much like her initial couple of weeks with Scar. Instead of the lion keeping her over-satiated for some nefarious purpose, though, the young queen was doing it to herself in order to preserve what she thought of as her sanity. She only barely registered the change when she and Scar moved into Mufasa's old den (and she definitely could not have said how she was moved there), and she never knew what was going on around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, she never knew what was going on <i>inside</i> her. She had to stuff herself continuously to maintain the drugged state she so preferred, but she was so preoccupied with not having to think about the choices she'd made that she didn't even realize what her food intake was doing to her body. Forget spherical, Nala was nearly pyramidal, with her huge gut flowing out beneath her. \"Distended\" quickly became her stomach's normal mode of existence, and once that was normal, absolutely monstrous further distension wasn't a big deal. Nala was nearly as big as a hippo, and though, as she'd grown into an adult lioness, her body had gotten quite a bit longer, there was no way it could have kept pace with her gluttony. Fat collected in thick sheets all over her body, until she couldn't even move her tail, but most of the nutrients she consumed went to increasing her stomach capacity, since her body had long ago realized that that was its best bet for not exploding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, her eating capacity increased quickly, and, of course, she never just ate to capacity. What had once made her mind-breakingly overfull soon just made her full, and \"just full\" was nowhere near good enough.</span></div></div>",

He himself had never had much use for eating, seeing it more as an annoying necessity than a pleasure. Still, he was impressed by Nala's willingness to completely give her life over to fulfilling (and more than fulfilling) her most basic desires, without a thought for the rest of the world. It was a shame that she was far too heavy to ever have cubs; Scar would have loved to bring more lions just like her into the world. Her hugely fattened body definitely didn't hurt his opinion of her, either. When he'd first started fattening her up, more than a year ago now, he had expected that she would quickly become ugly as she gained weight, but that hadn't happened at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other paw, though, he had groomed her to be his companion, not just a pretty object. The rest of the pride didn't like him much, and the feeling was definitely mutual. Therefore, he didn't have anyone to talk to besides the hyenas, and hyenas were dumb as rocks. He'd put so much work into making Nala just like him. He loved her for her unbridled gluttony, but he couldn't have it completely overtake the wonderful personality he'd worked so hard to shape. So he plotted about what was the best way to bring his queen back to reality.</span></div></div>",

He certainly didn't want to starve her, and he knew that he would have to walk a very fine line between getting her head out of the clouds and making her resent her the same way she resented her parents. It took him a few days, but eventually he came up with a plan that he thought would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar always attended to his kingly duties in the same open area where Nala was, to show the pride that he was a powerful and prosperous enough ruler to keep such an obese mate. To set his plan into action, he let her food run out while he was hearing testimony from a lioness who was accused of abandoning the pride's cubs in a dangerous situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nala couldn't find any food, she looked around in something like a panic, making eye contact with her mate for the first time in weeks. \"Scar!\" she cried desperately, feeling the guilt creep in at the edges of her mind. \"I need more food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a moment, darling,\" he said dismissively. \"I'm right in the middle of some very important business.\" Nala moaned impatiently. In all the time since she'd become the queen, this had never happened before. \"If you would help me deliberate, I'm sure the process would go more quickly.\" She acquiesced petulantly, and he explained the situation to her, then sent the other lioness out of the room so they could talk it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala couldn't understand why Scar was making her get involved in the pride's stupid politics. He knew how uncomfortable she got when she wasn't eating. But then she saw the wicked smirk on his face, and she realized what he wanted from her. Scar was a cruel lion (never to her, of course, but she doubted if he valued anyone besides the two of them), and he liked it when she was cruel as well. But despite her best intentions, she always felt awful afterward, which in turn made her few lucid moments so much worse.</span></div></div>",

Let the hyenas have her.\" Inwardly, Nala was quaking, but her distress subsided a bit when she saw her mate's smile widen. If he was happy, it was worth a little extra guilt. It wasn't as though she cared about the lioness, or had any moral objections to punishing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar purred and nuzzled Nala's huge gut affectionately. She was a little startled: he wasn't the most demonstratively affectionate mate in the world, and she wasn't even sure that he found her physically attractive. Oh, he <i>said</i> he did, but she had long suspected that that was just so she didn't feel like she was somehow letting him down by continuing to gain weight. But he certainly seemed pleased with her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that that is an excellent idea, my queen,\" he whispered in his silkiest voice.

She had ordered a young adult lion beaten for some infraction, but the usual guilt didn't hit her like a charging elephant. She held her breath, waiting for it to descend, but it never did. Her mate was whispering sweet nothings to her, hyenas were piling more food in front of her, and Nala was content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was more than content, in fact. She felt great! Out of habit, she started eating again, and was surprised at just how flavorful the meat was when she wasn't trying to stuff it down as fast as possible. She'd forgotten how good it felt to just eat with no specific goal in mind; it was ecstasy. She moaned with pleasure, which caused her whole body to jiggle, every useless inch of her. To an observer, the ripples that moved along her vast form would have looked like savannah grass rippling in the wind. Nala was actually a little surprised by how huge she'd gotten, and she wished she had managed to get over that whole \"conscience\" thing a lot sooner. One downside of eating herself comatose all the time was that she hadn't been able to appreciate her growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd grown it had. Her limbs and tail had all but vanished beneath huge rolls of fat, making her whole body more or less one continuous blob. Underneath that fat, her legs more closely resembled puddles than usable limbs, being spreading masses of fat that had long ago atrophied into uselessness even as they continued to increase in bulk. Her stomach pushed her up so her \"shoulders\" (as much as any part of her monstrously obese body could be considered a shoulder) were more than three times as high as Scar's, and she was of course much, much wider, a veritable ocean of oozing, corpulent flesh, of which she could barely move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to her, all of a sudden, that she would never walk again. That had been true for some time, of course, and she'd suspected as much for even longer, but at this moment, while taking stock of her massive body, she knew that she had passed the point of no return. She was nothing but a burden now, consuming and consuming and never giving anything back. The thought thrilled her endlessly, sent her into paroxysms of delight that would have had her thrashing if she had been able to move. Nala thought back to when she'd told Simba to run away, the first serious step she'd taken toward her current state. She wanted to slap the stupid cub she had been back then for ever having second thoughts. She'd grown into a debauched, gluttonous tyrant (as well as a mountain of a lioness), and she was incapable of imagining a better life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, well, maybe it could get a little better. \"Scar?\" she said questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm beautiful?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that her mate loved her for her mind, for her long-sought (if only recently achieved) remorseless cruelty, for her nearly perfect selfishness. But he rarely said anything about her body, and when he did, it was all irritatingly vague. Nala had worked hard to become what she was, physically as well as a mentally--though there could be no denying that it had been highly enjoyable work, for the most part--and she wanted to know that Scar loved the whole package. The question seemed to shock him. She wasn't used to catching him off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed on. \"I'm serious. I know how you feel about my personality, but I want to know what you think of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body thrills me,\" he replied, without even a moment's pause. \"It's a physical manifestation of everything I love about your mind, a testament to everything you've done and sacrificed and become to get this far. And it's beautiful, too. When you were a cub, I feared that I would find you disgusting as you put on weight, and that I would just have to pretend once you became my queen, but you've only grown lovelier.\" There was no hint of an edge to his voice, no audible cues that he was working any kind of an angle. Nala didn't think she'd heard him speak so candidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really plan all this out that far in advance?\" she said wonderingly. Scar laughed at that, and licked her closest roll affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nala, my love, I've been planning some form of 'all this' since the very first time you ate with me, though I admit that I didn't seriously start considering it until you left and came back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And why's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because once you abandoned your family for purely hedonistic reasons, I was confident that you could make it the rest of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just look at me now,\" Nala said with a smile. \"You've absolutely ruined me.\"</span></div></div>",

No one knew where she was anymore ever since she left pride rock just to escape from her overbearing mother, Sarafina. Whom Nala has always fought with especially when it came to her sudden interest in the enticing aroma of food, they had always been at wits end with each other, so much so that it finally boiled over with the two causing Nala to run away. Scar had just been at the right place at the right time to scoop up his little slave to enact is plans for her. Nala couldn\u2019t eat any more she felt like she was going to burst from all the meat that was shoved into her mouth, sure she was once the eating queen, her body was once at the peak of eating capabilities, obesity was like an old friend to her as all the delicious aromas that came from the meats that entered her gullet were all she had as company when Nala was being encouraged by a more leaniant Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar looked quite disappointed with his little pet due to her inability to finish this delectable antelope he had caught for his pet, she was only a quarter a way through of the animal. Looking as if she was about to vomit all the food that was forced into her gullet, it was way to much or her tiny frame to endure only a quarter or so of the antelope was able to fit into her stomach before scar felt he had no other choice but to stop forcing her to eat or be expected to start from the beginning of making her eat. \u201cso little has gone into you my dear it is such a disgrace to say the least, my you would have this for breakfast the last time we met, I guess I was just too soft on you, that is going to change\u201d scar chuckled, like a snake he circled his prey waiting to strike at the right time, she was still as feisty as ever, even struggling the best she could from her captor.

Scar looked at Nala as with such glee across his face, his project which he was creating was going be one of his greatest achievement, Nala was afraid of what was going to become of her under the care of Scar. The tears began to flow again as she struggled to mouth words, she tried to ask her master something, fighting the tears Nala said \u201cwhy are you doing this I don\u2019t want to be fat anymore I want my mother\u201d she finally choked out to say. With so much malice in his voice it was like venom to the touch \u201cyou don\u2019t get it my dear your mine and your gonna grow either you like it or not.\u201d All she could do was lay there and sob herself to sleep while her master circled her with a grin upon his face, he had so many plans for Nala, she was going to be his masterpiece and all it took was meat.</span></div></div>",

Scar has always wanted to do something that was clearly unheard of when it came to the pride lands, he wanted to fatten up someone just to serve his own hidden pleasures. He always liked the feeling of the plumper lionesses like their were more sustenance to them that the one who had to always be kept thin and fit to do the hunting for the pride lands, the only flaw that came to the larger lionesses is that they were heavier than scar so it was impossible for him to make them listen to him when they could always beat him in a brawl for dominance. This is why Nala was perfect for him her small stature was easy to dominant under his iron clad will. Nala was looking for any opening she could the impending doom that was felt in the air was almost sufficient her, almost as much as her overstuffed stomach made it hard to move for her, all the meat that has been unceremoniously stuffed to the gills by a vicious Scar, the brutality that she just suffered feared her to no ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar was indeed a vicious lion to deal with his pride is one thing that made him such a problem for Nala to deal with, she was still so full it was hard for her to even breath she had never felt this full in a long time it has been months since her last visit to scar\u2019s den. All she could do at this time was just to curl up and lie on the cold rock, tears coming from her eyes as she looked for a way to escape from this hell that was brought upon her from a lion she thought was her only friend that actually understood her hidden desires. Nala couldn\u2019t fathom why scar would want to keep a cub like her by his side, being a lion of his stature and presence he could court any lioness he wanted, yet he chose Nala. She couldn\u2019t think of this right now she had to escape from his grasp, she just felt quite exhausted from the trials she had put herself in from just running away from her parents and all that she has known of the pride lands, to almost starving to death in the months she had lived in that cave behind of the waterfall away from prying eyes, and now she had to deal with this sadistic lion who kept her on a short leash to be fed until she pukes. Her life was a wretched one at that, she knew if she wanted to survive her ordeals that scar had placed upon her, she had to escape his iron clasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar was quite pleased with what he was creating when it came to Nala, sure she was quite the unruly girl when it came to her feeding but in time he knew that it will subside and Nala will know her place as his play thing. He wasn\u2019t fattening her up for her own choices, no it was all for him to make her into the perfect Princess for his takeover of the Pride lands. The hyenas had just returned from their hunt of a couple more antelopes from the vast savanna area that accumulated into the kingdom of the pride lands. The leader of the Hyenas, Shenzi bowed to the will of her master for she knew that none of the hyenas had the strength or conviction to usurp control from scar. Banzai and ed were dragging the fresh kill of an antelope in front of their master, meekly Shenzi asked timidly to the copper colored lion \u201cwhat do you want us to do with this antelope Boss?\u201d gleefully he looked over the fresh kill that was going to be stuffed into his slave so she could become bigger and bigger, \u201cwell start feeding it to the bratty Princess\u201d he ordered his lackeys, not even realizing that Nala was slowly but surely trying to escape, her body was so much heavier than she expected. Scar could only chuckle at this feeble attempt to escape.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nala spied a somewhat familiar-looking expanse of reddish skin just out of the way of the entrance. She gasped and sprinted over to it as fast as her legs would carry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer instincts were spot-on: It was a fully-grown hippopotamus, bigger than the one Scar had fed her what now felt like years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this...is it all for me?\" she asked, awed by the prospect of this much food after being denied for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like,\" Sarafina answered. Nala hesitated just long enough to thank and nuzzle her mother, and then she dove at the hippo like the ravenous lion she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may not have lost any weight during her weeks of dieting, but the lack of food had definitely stunted Nala's appetite. She was barely a quarter of the way through the hippo when--horror of horrors--she found herself getting full. Her stomach had puffed out to where it had been before she started dieting, though since she was taller, that meant it was even a little bigger than it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala looked behind her. Sarafina was still laying there, forepaws folded, watching her daughter binge. Nala knew that her mother wouldn't be upset if she stopped eating (since Sarafina wanted her to form her own eating habits, not to glut herself past the point of comfort), but stopping now still felt like a sign of weakness. Dammit, she'd eaten this much when she was just a tiny cub! Surely she could manage it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to recall what Scar's words to her had been that fateful night. <i>...Once you free yourself of what you believe is the maximum amount you can eat...</i> Scar had been right before, hadn't he? So this was nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeterminedly, and after a lingering glance at her mother (who just watched silently, a faint smile on her face), Nala dug back into the hippo. It was rough going at first (and she remembered belatedly that the hyenas had had to force-feed her the hippo the first time, to her extreme discomfort), but she persevered. She would show her mother how she really ate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Nala got back into her groove, and eating became easier. As before, the pleasure she derived from gluttony eventually overcame the pain of being far too full. Her pace quickened: As much as she wanted to savor the flavor of the first real meal she'd had in ages, her primary concern was eating as much as possible, and in her slightly food-addled head, that meant eating as <i>fast</i> as possible. She scarfed down huge chunks of the hippo and barely bothering to chew. Past a certain point, the distension of her stomach itself, as well as the act of filling it, became pleasurable to her. She remembered, back in Scar's den, wondering what it would be like to have a low-hanging belly. Well, she was far past that now. Her massive stomach lifted all four of her paws off the ground, and the thought that she had once again eaten herself into at least temporary immobility sent a thrill through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all good things must end, and eventually Nala swallowed the last of the hippo meat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next month, Nala settled into her new lifestyle. She never got to eat quite to the level of the apology hippo (for the simple reason that the pride usually didn't have that much extra food), but she was certainly eating more than most cubs her age. Sarafina, despite her own misgivings about Nala's gain, always made a point of bringing home extra food for her gluttonous daughter. The exact amount of food varied, but Nala always ate it all gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lioness porked out noticeably over the course of the month. Her belly hung down nearly to her knees, even when it wasn't full of food, and the extra girth forced her to adopt a slow, bow-legged walk. Nala wasn't a big fan of walking, since it burned precious energy, but Sarafina insisted that she get at least a little exercise. Nala's mother was hoping that this was a phase that Nala would eventually grow out of, and when that happened, she didn't want her baby girl to have any trouble because of a flirtation with overeating. On the other paw, if Nala <i>didn't</i> decide to stop this nonsense, Sarafina knew that she would become immobilized sooner or later, and she was determined that it would happen later rather than sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Nala griped but did what Sarafina wanted. A little walking was a small price to pay for her mother letting her gain. The cub was becoming a little dissatisfied with the amount of food she was being given, but she didn't know what she could do about it. It wasn't like Sarafina was trying to secretly make her lose weight; she still got pretty consistently-sized meals. It was just that the same amount of food just wasn't filling her up like it used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her was completely thrilled about that. It meant that she was gaining well and increasing her capacity. But the rest of her just wanted more food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Nala awoke from a nap to see the carcass of a female kudu lying by the entrance of her family's den. She ran over to it, hoping that Sarafina had brought it for her, but her mother was nowhere to be found. That was odd. Sarafina usually stuck around to make sure Nala knew what meat was hers, and, come to think of it, she always brought her kills into the den, <i>and</i> she woke Nala when she had something to give her. So this probably wasn't from her mom, then.</span></div></div>",

The kudu wasn't too huge, only about 400 pounds, but Nala was ecstatic about getting even that much. She ate it quickly and without much difficulty, aside from the difficulty of moving to get the last of the meat when she'd already eaten so much. The meal didn't quite immobilize her, but her rounded stomach was definitely dragging on the ground by the time she was done. Content despite not having eaten to her full potential, Nala drifted back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, her mother woke her up for dinner. Sarafina must have noticed Nala's distended stomach, but didn't comment on it.

More carcasses showed up on her denstep, at first a couple times a week, but gradually the frequency of the extra food increased to nearly daily. It always appeared when she wasn't paying attention, and never when her parents were around. She didn't have a clue who was sending it, but then, she didn't really care. Whoever it was, they were a really good person to keep feeding her like this, and if they wanted to stay all secretive about their identity, she wasn't about to ruin their game by trying to figure them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her delight, the size of the animals increased quickly, until her mysterious friend was left a cape buffalo outside her den. That meant that Nala soon had no choice but to eat out in the open, since it would have been impossible for her to move an animal weighing nearly a ton. At first the public gluttony embarrassed her, but not many people were around, and anyway, by the time she saw her first buffalo, she was well past caring about what the rest of the pride thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still mobile, but only barely, and dragging her fat self to the buffalo was hard work. Good thing there were nearly 2000 pounds of meat there to help her get her strength back! Eating it wasn't too hard, thanks to her nearly limitless capacity, and it was the best, biggest meal she'd had in ages. Once again, her expanding stomach lifted her off her feet. She moaned with pleasure at her temporary immobility and increased her eating speed. She was so excited to reach true immobility that she could hardly stand it. No more walks with her mother, no more having to do things for herself...all she would be able to do would be eat and sleep. It sounded like heaven.</span></div></div>",

Sarafina said something about how the two of them really must go on a walk that afternoon, so as soon as she left, Nala settled down for a nap, partly to conserve her energy, and partly to give her mysterious benefactor time to leave her a more substantive meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up, it didn't look like there was anything waiting for her at the mouth of the cave, but she waddled over just in case. Sure enough, tucked away where she wouldn't have been able to see it was...a dik-dik, one of the stupid little pygmy antelopes that warned away better game with its obnoxious clicking. Nala ate it in a few mouthfuls, and wondered what the heck had happened. <i>No</i> food would have been less of a disappointment than this tiny thing. But then, much to her surprise, she saw a tommie, a gazelle not much bigger than the dik-dik she'd just eaten, lying several meters away from where she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, she made her ponderous way over to it. No one was anywhere near it, and the pride usually didn't just leave food lying in the middle of the living area. Figuring that she might as well not let it go to waste, she downed it as well. It was hardly more satisfying than the dik-dik had been. But there was an aardvark a few meters further on, and then an impala, and then a warthog (don't worry, no one important!). By the time she'd stumbled down to the oryx carcass that was beyond the warthog, she was well out of Pride Rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she chowed down on the oryx, she felt her paws leave the ground. Her belly had hung lower and lower as she made her way though each successive animal, but this was the first time that day that she had immobilized herself. Immobility was still a fantastic feeling, and ordinarily, she would be thrilled if she managed to get this much to eat, but she suspected that there were more animals further on, and it would be a shame if she wasn't able to get to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when she finished off the oryx, Nala could see another carcass lying just out of easy sight range. She couldn't tell exactly what it was, but even though she was stuffed full, she knew she wanted to eat it.</span></div></div>",

The several animals she had eaten already that day, combined with the still-not-completely-digested buffalo of the previous day, had swelled her gut to the point where she had no chance of walking until she digested. That annoyed her. Who knew how long it would take until she digested enough to be mobile again? She could see more food lying in the grass down a gentle slope, and she wanted to eat it <i>now</i>, not in a day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she noticed that her next course <i>was</i> slightly downhill from her current position, she got an idea. With her big stomach, she was more or less circular, so maybe she could <i>roll</i> down to the carcass. With a grunt, she started rocking back and fourth, trying to push herself to the point where her body would start going downhill from its own momentum. Finally, she managed to flip herself over, and after a moment of pain from having all that weight pressing down on her spine, she was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer journey was more of a continuous flop than a true roll, since she wasn't quite as round as she imagined herself to be. It was a very uncomfortable way to travel: More than once, she ended up with her face pressed against the dry soil. Eventually, though, she thudded to a stop, head-first, against something big and solid. Nala's squashed nose could tell that it was meat, and though she couldn't quite identify the animal, she didn't care. She was stuck, unable to move her head out of the dead animal's flank. And, of course, there was only one way to free herself: eat her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a bit dizzy from the trip, but she fought down the feeling. After all, she was stopped pretty solidly now, and there was work to be done. She tore into the carcass like it was her first meal of the day, disregarding the hundreds of pounds of meat she had already eaten. It went down a treat, and her stomach expanded more and more to fit it all in. Nala wasn't worried about her increasing immobility, though: she knew how to keep moving if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she <i>didn't</i> count on was the hill she was on getting steeper. As soon as she swallowed the last of the wildebeest (for that's what it had turned out to be), she started rolling again.</span></div></div>",

She came to a stop with another faceplant into the side of a dead animal, obviously a zebra this time. It took her a little longer to get over her dizziness this time, since she had been rolling faster, but once she felt a little better, she ate the zebra with the same determination she'd eaten all the other animals. She didn't even wonder how she was going to get back home, in fact, she didn't even think about her home. All she could think about was the meat in front of her and getting as much of it inside her as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the zebra was finished, she kept rolling into more animals, each a little larger than the last. When she came to a cape buffalo, less than a full day after the last one, she had already eaten more than two tons of food in the past twenty-four hours, and she was getting to the point where eating was starting to be painful. Not that she stopped eating when it started hurting, of course. She had trained her stomach better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the weird thing was that, unlike when she had eaten the hippos, the pain didn't actually feel bad. In fact, as she worked her way through the buffalo, she found, more and more, that the terrible distention of her gut thrilled her in a way she wasn't used to. She moaned and panted and ate faster, either trying to make the feeling go away or make it stronger. The more she overstuffed herself, the more it built, like there was a roaring furnace inside her. It made her feel strangely light and empty even as she was as full as she'd ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, the next animal she ran into was actually a hippopotamus. Such a huge beast would have been a challenge for her on an empty stomach, but with the furnace roaring inside her, she felt that she could handle anything. The strange pleasure-pain continued to grow in her mountainous gut until she didn't think she could take it any more. Desperately, she increased her pace. Her useless little limbs scrabbled against her huge stomach, trying to reach the food to shovel it in even faster. For the first time ever, she wished she <i>was</i> being force-fed: she imagined that other people working in concert could feed her a lot faster than she could eat on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at the furious pace she was going, the hippo took her a long time. It was as heavy as all her previous courses combined, and eating it took her well into the night. Her senses blurred together after a while, until there was only that white-hot furnace feeling and the desperate, keening need to consume and consume and consume. When she finally swallowed the last bite, she exploded--or, at least, that was what it felt like. All the tension that had been building as she gorged herself came to a searing crescendo and then released. It was all a bit too much for Nala. She passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had been unconscious for several minutes, figures came out of the darkness and dragged her away.</span></div></div>",

Her memories of the previous day were hazy, but she vaguely thought that she had already eaten the hippo. Oh, well. There was no point in letting good food go to waste, so she started eating again. At first, her pace was slow: She was already pretty full, after all, and she absolutely loved the taste of hippo. Soon, though, the strange, fevered excitement of the night before overtook her once again, and her eating sped up until she was wolfing down the hippo as fast as she possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still wasn't enough. She whined as she ate, desperate for more, faster. Unlike the previous night, however, when she had had to resort to some interesting contortions to reach her food, something kept the remaining meat pressed right up against her face, so she needed only the minimum of movement to continue gorging. When she finished the hippo, she experienced the same blissful feeling of relief and then passed out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Nala, two humans watched her from the other side of a one-way mirror.

It was less ethically sticky than testing on humans, but still questionable enough that they'd been forced to move their research to this unpeopled land, far from the prying eyes of animal rights groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had wanted to weigh the female cub upon her arrival, but it was impossible to tell what was permanent weight and what was food weight. Healthy weight for an adult female lion was about 350 pounds, and their subject was more than twice that heavy, not to mention only a year old. Even if it was mostly food weight, the female cub was clearly an outlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir next task, before they could start doing any serious studies of her, was to find out exactly how much the cub could eat. She did not yet seem to realize that she was no longer in the wild, and the scientists preferred to keep it that way until they discovered her capacity, lest her habits change from the realization that she was in a new environment. However, they didn't exactly have many more huge African mammals laying around, so they were forced to improvise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSynthetic meat was a fairly new development, and the stuff wasn't quite up to the standards of human food yet, but it was easy to make, and they doubted that the lioness would know the difference. While she was passed out, they put together massive piles of the stuff, covered it in something that was as close to the physical composition of hippopotamus skin, and moved the \"hippos\" into another chamber in their facility, one that had a scale built into the floor. They (or, more accurately, their assistants) moved the female cub into the scaled room, and then kept her knocked out until she had digested all the food that had been in her system. She was much smaller when she wasn't stuffed to the brim. Her heavy paws just brushed the dirt-covered floor, but her belly surged around them. By the scientists' calculations, she was about 200 pounds, not as big as a full-grown lion, but still several times heavier than a cub her age should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey let her wake up within easy reach of the first \"hippo.\" Each pile of synthetic meat weighed precisely three short tons, so it would be a simple operation to find out how much the cub packed away. She attacked the first \"hippo\" like she hadn't eaten in days (and from the scientists' time observing her in the wild, this was probably the first time her stomach had been completely empty in over a month). To their relief, the cub did not appear to notice that the meat wasn't what it appeared to be. She quickly immobilized herself, but they had been prepared for that: As in the last room, several cunningly-concealed mechanical arms pushed more food toward her constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala didn't know where she was. She'd woken up ravenously hungry, and had had what looked like a hippo lying right in front of her face, but it smelled and tasted wrong. Oh, well, she thought. At least it was food. She didn't know how she'd digested that string of animals so fast, but her stomach was screaming at her to eat, and she was never one to disobey her stomach. The meat wasn't bad, just strange, and there was a lot of it, which was the most important thing. It came to her like it knew what she was thinking, which was good news, because she was barely a third of the way through the fake-hippo when she could no longer move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previous day's binge had stretched her stomach out to the point where a hippo (or a weird thing the size of a hippo) wasn't a huge ordeal, so she finished it happily...only to find another of the same thing right behind it. Oh, she must have died and gone to heaven!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat weird pleasure-pain feeling she'd been having recently hit her when she was in the middle of the second hippo-thing, and she redoubled her pace. Two hippos <i>was</i> a lot of food, even for her, but the burning emptiness in her chest kept her as hungry as she had been when she woke up. The third fake-hippo disappeared into her increasingly massive stomach, and she was midway through the fourth when her vision exploded into stars and she had to stop eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe researchers were stunned. The female cub had managed to ingest nearly ten tons of meat. Even based on their previous observation of her, they hadn't expected such huge numbers.</span></div></div>",

While they continued to dress their synthetic meat up as hippos, they stopped hiding the apparatuses that moved the meat around. But even without having to hide what they were doing, feeding the female cub was becoming more difficult as she grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey needn't have bothered hiding anything. Nala soon noticed that she was clearly not on the savannah any more, but, just as when she had noticed that the \"hippos\" weren't what they appeared to be, she didn't care as long as the mysterious food kept coming, which it did, in a seemingly endless supply. Nala happily spent every waking moment glutting herself, and as a result, her weight skyrocketed. Since she ate to her capacity every day, she quickly became too fat to move under her own power. Even then, she never wanted for food. However the strange, cold things that moved her food about worked, she was grateful that they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't their fault that she eventually started having trouble eating fast enough. No matter how quickly food was put in front of her, it took time for her to bite and chew and swallow. The burning, insatiable feeling had become a reality: Nala was becoming physically unable to consume the amount of food it took to fill her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one morning, instead of waking up to a hippo-thing sitting in front of her, Nala found that the big room was empty, but there was a snake in her mouth, one made of the same cold, gray stuff as everything else in this place. A couple minutes after she awoke, she suddenly found that her mouth was full of the meat she'd grown used to, flowing slowly out of the snake. She swallowed, surprised, only to find another mouthful in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was...weird. She tried to squirm away, but was so hugely obese that she could only barely move her head. She didn't like this metal snake.</span></div></div>",

She sucked desperately on the end of the snake, trying to make the meat come faster, but it didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the glass, the scientists noticed that their subject was having trouble with the feeding tube. At first, they assumed that she didn't like how it felt, but after one of them noticed the increased pressure on the tube, they realized the truth. Since they couldn't very well alter the thing while the female cub was using it, they piped sleeping gas into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nala awoke, she found, much to her displeasure, that the gray snake was still in her mouth. Just like before, it filled her mouth with meat, but too slowly to be of any real use. Having nothing else that she could do, since the room was otherwise empty and it wasn't as though she could just get up and leave, she started sucking on it again. To her surprise, the flow seemed to increase marginally. She swallowed the new mouthful of meat and sucked harder, and her mouth filled up slightly quicker. She kept it up until the meat was coming as fast as she could swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, on a whim, she sucked even harder. Now, the force of the flow itself was pushing meat down her throat, without her having to do anything. Once she overcame her gag reflex (which wasn't too hard, since her body was used to absurd quantities of food), she was free to enjoy the sensation of being stuffed without even having to go to the minimal effort of chewing and swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, but she'd missed the feeling of being stuffed tight. This weird snake was finally allowing her to satiate her monstrous hunger again. She had no way of knowing how much she was consuming, but it was obviously going down faster than if she'd been eating normally.</span></div></div>",

Nala was feeling somewhat regretful of her choice, thinking that if she chose to eat on her own she could at least feed herself at a slower pace than how the hyenas are feeding her. She then looked at her overstuffed belly which was starting to surprise her from who enormous it had become. Bring the zebra closer to the ball of cub took a while and Scar was watching them and waiting for them to hurry up, giving Nala the opportunity to feel her girth. She felt her sides which started to sag from compressing onto the ground. Her pudgy love-handles had a slightly stiff yet gooey consistency. She tried to feel more but her arms couldn't reach out any farther than about a good ten inches from the middle. She then went to her belly which felt different; rubbing her stomach was as if she was rubbing a huge smooth rock with fur on it, but a rock wouldn't have felt the soothing relaxation she felt. With little time left before the stuffing, she tried to see if she could reach her paws to the top of her belly. She raised her back for more length and stretched as much as she could but was out of reach by a few inches. Laying back on the ground she noticed the pangs began to lessen and with a grin of encouragement started to wonder how much more she could eat and stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, someone looks excited for her next meal.\" proclaimed Scar. Nala could now get a better look at the Zebra she would have crammed inside of her. The smell from the carcass was the freshest she had ever scented, and seeing all that meat on the big animal got her a little more excited. She could detect pain in the near future but also a new and bigger gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hyena ripped a piece of meat and brought it over to Nala, who opened her smile very wide and accepted the food. She chewed a few times before the meat was practically mush; the surprising tenderness and delicious flavor made her want to keep chewing and savoring the taste, but another piece hovering above made her swallow. On and on the stuffing continued as did the growth of the cub's belly. About a third of the zebra was devoured and not a single bit on determination left the fat greedy Nala. Occasionally she'd look at her progress, always satisfied with the extension she saw. More and more stuffing ensued with much more joy than pain felt in her stomach, which now seem like a hill that could be found somewhere in the Prideland. Eventually the zebra was finished and the extremely overstuffed, round, fat cub laid there feeling bliss and very very full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She and Simba were ecstatic at the thought of having a cub together, as well as an heir to Simba's throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince a lion's pregnancy lasts for about twelve months, Nala knew she had plenty of time to prepare for the impending arrival of her little one.  Besides, other than gathering parenting advice from the other lionesses, all she really had to do was make Simba's and her part of the den cub-friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarabi and the other lionesses kept encouraging Nala to rest and take it easy.  When they all went out on hunts for the pride, they told Nala to stay in the den and rest or relax at the waterhole, which often meant being entertained by Timon and Pumbaa.  Nala had to admit, she felt pretty tired during the early months, and she was grateful to be able to get the extra sleep she needed than have to use up all her energy hunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lionesses would return from a successful hunt, Simba and the rest of the males all had their fill, as was to be expected.  However, afterwards, the lionesses would then let Nala have her turn at the meat-filled carcasses, making sure the young queen had plenty of good, fresh meat to fill her stomach and ensure the cub growing in her belly would be healthy and strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this pattern continued week after week, it was easy for Nala to get used to such prime treatment, and she admittedly got a bit lazy.  Lying down or sleeping all day long, and then being pressed to gorge herself on delicious gazelle, antelope, or zebra, quickly began to show itself on Nala's formerly very lean frame.  However, being pregnant, it was hard to tell if the slowly growing roundness to her belly was due to excess calories or the cub beginning to make itself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nala's pregnancy progressed,...</span></div></div>",

Her mind, mouth, and stomach were focused on eating, her gluttonous desire to eat more took over. There was no pain from the gut-swelling that her eating was causing, and if there were she'd be too busying devouring food to notice; all that there was was pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating two more zebras and working on the fifth, Nala had lost complete contact from the ground with the exception of her  massive belly.

I ate (pant)... so much (pant)... already (pant)...\" She continued to pant to regain her normal breathing pattern. \"I was just so hungry, and you worked so hard to get it all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba chuckled at Nala's attempt to create excuses for her eating habits. \"It's okay, it's alright,\" Simba reassured, \"You should eat as much as it takes to fill up your appetite.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Nala replied, \"I just didn't know you would get so much...\" <i>More excuses, hahaha</i> Simba thought to himself. Nala's eyes slowly began to close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But hey, you're still hungry aren't you?\" said Simba almost as if he was begging her to still be hungry. Nala took a brief moment to think and nodded making Simba grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't reach the zebras, I'm too-\" she paused. Simba walked up to her and said \"Hey, it's alright. It's good to get your fill, however you want it.\" For a few seconds they smiled at each other. Simba then brought the remaining zebras closer to Nala and piled them up to match her level of reach. She looked back at Simba who gave a reassuring nod. She looked back at the zebra in front of her: still as fresh as when it was hunted down. She resumed her feasting at a slow pace and chowed down on the fattest parts. She gobbled up whatever could fit in her mouth with a little extra to stuff in. The taste of the fresh meat brought her out of her sleepiness and back at a fast pace. She moaned in pleasure and swallowed alluringly difficult mouthfuls of food. Simba watched her consume half of the zebra in less than ten minutes. He gazed at her cheeks as they where crammed with overwhelming amounts of meat then watch it travel down her throat and add onto the other contents of her stomach; it truly was an intriguing sight to behold. She finished the zebra, leaving five more remaining to be eaten. Simba helped to remove the remains of the eaten zebra as not to disturb Nala's gluttonous dining. She wanted more, more, more to eat, more to stuff herself, more to make her stomach grow, and Simba's encouragement made her want to have more than ever before. Scarfing down on the 8th zebra released great pleasure from over-indulgence as Simba could see watching in awe. She chewed and moaned and chewed and moaned and swallowed all in satisfaction. Her gut swelled trying to make room for the increasing amount of food and for more that was to come. She went on to complete the 9th and 10th zebra, her stomach ballooned into a furry fleshy ball twice the height of simba on all fours and almost as wide as his length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala completed the zebra and was back at where she was, over stuffed and out of reach of the remaining zebras. Taking note of this, Simba took the liberty of lifting a zebra up to her mouth. He needed to stand on his two back legs and use her stomach as support. Nala didn't know what to think of Simba's encouragement and help, all she knew was that she was hungry and very happy for this schmorgesborg and she continued to eat and eat and eat. Around half way through her the 11th zebra she was eating now, she started feeling a little more pain than before. She still felt a lot of the pleasures from overeating and being extremely stuffed, but her stomach began to come up to its limit. She wanted to eat but started to consider quiting now. Simba looked into Nala's eyes and could see the pain she was feeling. Nala looked back into Simba's eyes; they looked at each other for a moment as if they have created a special bond in Nala's gluttonus actions. She regained the encouragement to keep going. Eating through the pressures on her stomach she munched on bigger mouthfuls. Her jaw and throat became sore but Nala proceeded to fill her unquenchable desire to eat. Finally she finished number eleven and waited for Simba to bring up number twelve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strains on Nala\u2019s stomach were climbing onto the verge of being unbearable. She looked down on her stomach and was amazed at how much she has grown in so little time. Her gut pushed her high above the ground and it was until now she realized she had lost mobility many zebras ago. Simba brought up the 12th and final zebra there was to offer. Her desires and encouragement once again motivated her to continue to glut. Her appetite and bites were grew even bigger. Her mouth was full of so much meaty goodness she began to swallow in parts instead of the whole thing. It took more determination and brought a more complex mixture of pleasure and pain than anything before in her life, but she managed to finish the last zebra.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a flavor bananza as their juices mixed creating entirely new flavor sensations that made her ravenous for more.  She scooped up large quantites and began chowing them down like Timon had never seen and made his mouth begin to water.  When Kiara ate the last slimy slug, leaving the bottom of the log bear she laid on her back and patted her bloated belly.  She was kind of surprised at a few things.  First was, she was surprised at the bulge those tasty bugs put on her stomach and Timon explained that just like with their taste they can be quite fattening if you eat too many.  The other thing was that she was hardly filled up from that course.

The three scarfed all the bugs in sight, stuffing their faces, filling their stomachs, and belching like pigs (though Pumba was a pig in the first place).<br>\r\nWhat surprised Kiara the most about this though was how fast she was digesting the bugs.  It caused her to fatten up faster than usual a little bit, but it was hardly noticable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch sooner than Timon and Pumba would've liked they all got up and searched for the next log.  It continued like this for some time, but with each log choc full of bugs Kiara got more than her fair share while Timon and Pumba were getting overstuffed from so many bugs and not enough time to digest.  It was their tenth log that they reached when the two of them had had it and left Kiara to eat the log herself.<br>\r\n\"You know, there's a thing called too much of a good thing and I think we've reached it.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Bugs are pretty tastey after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay.  You don't have to.  Now let's get some more eats I'm ready for around round.\"  She licked some bug goop off her paws and let out another belch.  By now it was getting quite noticable her weight gain.  Her gut hung down about three inches lower now and her rear was noticably chubbier.  Her limbs were thicker too.<br>\r\n\"We're done... for today... you go... ahead.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" she said as she ran off.\"<br>\r\n\"Weren't we supposed to keep an eye on her?\" asked Pumba.<br>\r\n\"What's the worst that could happen?

She -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dared me!\" Kiara said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop your quibbling. Come on, Kiara. If you're that hungry I'll take you home and give you a proper meal.\" With that Sarafina picked up Kiara by the scruff of her neck, carrying her back towards Pride Rock in the distance. \"Bye boys!\" She mumbled around Kiara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Sarafina! Bye Kiara!\" Pumbaa called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to tell your dad what good guardians we were!\" said Timon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarafina snorted. \"Good guardians indeed.

You're not going to tell dad... are you?\" She swallowed, gazing down at her distended stomach as she was carried along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell him you should be given a proper meal. You're a growing lioness. Simba didn't know the hunger that we all felt when Scar was in charge, but I'll be cursed before I let a growing girl like you go hungry with all the food we have available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara frowned.

They called you fat? Don't mind them, Kiara. They're just worry warts. You'll grow out of it. After all, I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara frowned. She didn't know what Grandmother Sarafina looked like when she was younger, but now that she was a royal and other lionesses did her hunting, Mum said, Grandmother had gotten quite large herself. Kiara didn't mind though. It made for better cuddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun started to dip below the horizon they Sarafina put Kiara down in her personal den - the one awarded to Sarafina for being the queen's mother. Kiara was tired from all that running around after bugs with a full stomach and so sat on her haunches as Sarafina moved to the back of the little cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you got there, grandmother?\" Kiara said. As the wafting smell of fresh meat washed over her, she felt her ears prick up and a smile spread across her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilderbeast that the hunting party left for me this morning. Care to shar it with me?\" she said as she dragged it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara's eyes watered. Bugs were nice, but there was nothing like biting into real meat. Now that the grass was long with the rains it was quite a fatty specimen too, and she nodded her head eagerly as Sarafina dragged it in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat all you like, dear. I won't criticise you for having an appetite,\" Grandmother said, smiling gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks Gramma,\" Kiara said, looking up with a grin at her grandmother's gentle face, before ripping out a huge chunk of the meat and swallowing it as quickly as she could. \"You're the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome around here any time, little one,\" Sarafina said, a little sadly. \"I don't get much company these days, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Kiara said, swallowing again. \"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarafina waved it off dismissively. \"Oh... you know. Nala's busy with the hunts, Sarabi's busy with this and that. I suppose I should just get out more myself but... maybe I'm a bit of a private person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come and visit you,\" Kiara said, getting up and giving her grandmother a hug about the neck. \"Especially if you provide food like this! Should I come back tomorrow night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please do!\" Sarafina said, and her delight was obvious. \"But go on, finish your meal for tonight. Have as much as you like. You're going to be a strong lioness one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Grandmother,\" Kiara said. \"Thank you very much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kiara ate as the sun set. Any lion or lioness worth their salt could at until their belly was shaped like a bit round ball, but Kiara was even better than the average lioness. She ate and ate and ate until she couldn't possibly eat fit in any more, and when it came time to leave, she found she could hardly take a breath, her body was so full of food! Instead she told Grandmother Sarafina she was too scared to walk home in the dark, and so the plump old lioness dutifully carried her up to the entrance of the great den. Kiara said her goodbyes, then waddled inside, being careful not to step on anyone in the near darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiara!\" her mother said, waking up, and Kiara froze. Could mother see how round she was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timon and Pumbaa told me you went with Sarafina. What have you two been up to?\"</span></div></div>",

We left you some dinner by the way. It's in your corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara felt like she was going to be sick. She waddled over, being especially careful, but then as the smell reached her nostrils it wasn't so bad. Still she was too full for now. She would wait a few hours, and eat it at night, after she had digested some of Sarafina's meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mum. Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, little one,\" Nala said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara lay down to go to sleep, but lying on her bloated belly was too hard.

Father was out too, no doubt doing his kingly duty - whatever that was - and so Kiara was left alone. Other lionesses were around but they didn't speak to her much, just in case they said something to upset the royal daughter, she suspected. Sometimes she thought she caught them laughing at her because she was fat, but she couldn't prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, her stomach was much smaller today, having digested two dinners and a day-full of worm eating over the night.

Overall she had gained a layer of fat.<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, what are my parents going to say?

How was your day?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I had a real good time with grandma. Can I see her again tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course you can! If it's fine with her. You must be hungry, I saved you some big chunks of a gazelle we ate earlier. You can have all you like, we're not hungry anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks mom!\" Kiara wasn't really sure if she was hungry after all she had eaten that day, but she decided to be nice to her mother and eat up. She quickly finished the remains of the gazelle and fell asleep with a full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext morning...</span></div></div>",

Thank you!\"<br>\r\n\"Well it you liked it, why is there still so much left?\" Sarafina said teasingly.<br>\r\n\"I'm only a cub, I can't eat as much as adults...\" <br>\r\n\"Go on, you can't be full yet!

Standing up was getting more and more difficult each day since she didn't get any exercise and her muscles didn't get accustomed to her new weight.

Plus, after three days of trying to diet, she didn't notice any change in her weight.

She wasn't surprised when Sarafina brought her more food as soon as she finished the wildebeest. It was a huge cape buffalo, and Kiara started on it without a second thought. The past couple days had proved that she could eat more than she thought she could without really hurting herself, so why shouldn't she eat as much as she could?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lioness was so preoccupied with stuffing herself silly that she barely noticed the physical effect that stuffing was having. Her ballooning stomach pushed the rest of her further and further off the ground until she was nearly her grandmother's height. It had almost no jiggle to it; she was far too full for that, and none of the food she'd eaten since coming back to Sarafina's den had had enough time to turn to fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara thought she finished the buffalo, but it was hard to be sure: As soon as she scooped up what she thought was the last bite, there was more meat there, as though it had appeared magically. Her mind screamed at her to keep eating, so she did. As for her stomach, it must have given up protesting the way it was being treated, because Kiara couldn't feel any pain from it any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued on for...well, Kiara wasn't too sure. She'd figured out that whenever she got too full, she fell asleep, but she didn't know how long she was out for each time. What she did know was that food was always readily available, and for a while, that was enough for her. She forgot all about the diet she was supposed to have been on, much preferring to gorge herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, she became dissatisfied. Oh, not with the food, of course. It was still as good and pleasant as ever, and she was still eating herself into a coma on a regular basis. But she never even really got to talk to her grandmother any more, and she missed her parents and Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma?\" she said between mouthfuls--she didn't care quite enough to stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarafina rushed over to her. \"Yes, dear? Is there anything I can get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine,\" Kiara replied, continuing to stuff herself. \"I was just wondering if you'd heard from my mom or anything. She must be worried about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lioness stiffened at that. \"Your mother and I just had a talk about you,\" she said carefully. \"And she said it would be all right if you stayed with me for a while longer. I get so lonely out here by myself, and your mother agreed that it would be good for you to keep me company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, grandma. I really feel like I should be going home...\" Kiara said guiltily before tearing off another chunk of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I'm more than happy to keep feeding you, and I'm not sure that the same can be said for your mother.\"</span></div></div>",

As a result, she didn't fully know how well her \"gain weight on purpose\" plan was succeeding. Her stomach, which had been big when she'd arrived, was truly a sight to behold now, constantly growing from the huge feasts Kiara forced into it. It lifted her legs outward until she could only touch the ground with her toes if she strained them downward, and at the rate she was going, it wouldn't be long before they lost ground contact altogether. Her back fat was beginning to encroach on them from the top, and the limbs themselves were fast becoming toneless and flabby, just repositories for all the fat she was gaining instead of a viable means of locomotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of this blissful existence, Kiara was shocked to see Nala stride into the den.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother!\" Nala called angrily. \"Do you have any idea where K--\" at that moment, she noticed her daughter. \"Kiara!\" she hissed. \"I've been looking everywhere for you!\"</span></div></div>",

This wasn't as much food as grandma Sarafina would have given her, but she figured her mother was still sort of adjusting, so it was better not to press her too hard.

Along with him was Zazu who won't be getting a speaking line, two unimportant lion advisories who won't be getting speaking lines, and Timon and Pumba because they're the most marketable characters and always have to be around in Lion King related stuff, even if they aren't important and won't get a speaking line. Anyway, plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nala approached her husband and spoke. \"Simba? There's something I'd like to talk with you about.\" she glanced at the little cabinet of unimportant characters I mentioned, before waving a paw at them. \"in relative privacy?\"   Simba looked over to the group, then back at Nala. \"Alright.\" he said, before leading her out of their field of hearing. \"What did you want to talk about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's Kiara.\" Nala said, \"I don't think she's healthy and sh-\" when she was cut off mid sentence by Simba. \"Oh, Nala,\" he said, \"didn't you just have a discussion with Sarafina about letting her eat what she wants?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but ...wait, you weren't there for that and I didn't tell you, how did y-?\" she was cut off by Simba again. \"I'm the king, I know things. Anyway, what were you gonna say?\" Nala blinked, before continuing. \"Well...yes, I did say she could eat what she wants, but Simba, it's getting ridiculous. She kept asking for more and more and now she's swollen like a tick, I'm afraid if she keeps eating, she'll explode or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Simba blinked, before chuckling, and shaking his head, which served to make Nala even angrier. \"Oh, Nala, come on now. There's no way it's as bad as you're making it out to b-\" Now it was Nala's turn to cut Simba off. \"Oh yeah? Well, listen to this, it's getting to her head. Just earlier, I was feeding her, she went through more than five different animals Simba, finished them completely on her own. And she kept asking for more! When I finally called her out, she said she was doing it on purpose, to see how long it'd take me to snap! That's not good behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Simba seemed to consider this new information, before saying \"Well, it sounds to me like she was putting you through a test.\" Nala looked incredulously at Simba. \"Well? Yes, of course she was. And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Simba said, with a smile. \"That's a wise decision, something a ruler would do.\" Nala was about to say something, but Simba went on. \"When a new law or allowance is decreed, for example, Kiara can eat as much as she wants, it's sensible to see how far the people are going to go to follow it. See who's loyal, who's a good, valuable member of the pride, see?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala blinked. \"I...suppose, so,\" she admitted. \"And,\" Simba said, \"you don't want to fail a test like that, right?\" Nala blinked again. \"Simba, I won't be a doormat for my own something-thousand pound daughter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Nala, \" said Simba again. \"Don't think of it as submitting, think of it as asserting your dominance, proving her wrong about you, she expects you to give up.

She passed by the area where Kiara was, and snuck around behind her. She glanced at Kiara as she did, noting the gigantic rotund mass that was her belly, and her thick, flabby useless back limbs almost swallowed up by her huge blubbery rump. Nala sighed silently, before continuing on into the area where the pride kept the food they'd hunted. She looked around for something...suitable, for Kiara. She knew it'd have to be big, if not to satisfy the gluttonous cub so that Nala would have an excuse for being gone so long. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Her eyes fell on a particular prize. She wondered of it would be ok to take it...but figured eh, who's gonna get mad at her? She took the massive animal, and slowly brought it out to Kiara, dropping it in front of her. \"There you go, darling,\" Nala said with a smile. \"Eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kiara's jaw dropped into the first of her five chins, as she stared in disbelief at the full grown elephant in front of her. \"I-is this...is this all for me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why, of course it is.\" Nala said. \"I wanted to apologize for my little outburst, so I got you something a bit more filling than I was before. Eat all you want, unless... You're not hungry?\" Nala said, in an almost challenging tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, of course I am! Thanks mom, this is great!\" Kiara said delightedly, before digging into the pachedyrm, devouring fatty meat-chunk after fatty meat-chunk, her belly swelling more and more.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Of course, she had been full a minute ago, stuffed in fact. But that was before Nala brought out the elephant. She'd never eaten one and had it all to herself before. The prospect excited her. So, even though she was already stuffed to the point she felt she may burst, she forced herself to gorge more, and more, and more, polishing off the elephant at an alarming speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But, as she went on, she became worried. Had she finally bit off more than she could chew? Had it been a freaking stupid idea to try and eat an elephant, right after all that meat she shoved down her gullet not too long ago? Probably. We'll see, won't we?</span></div></div>",

Kiara's belly was absurdly gigantic, full and taut like a drum, due to all she recently consumed. As she laid on top of it, it lifted her twelve feet off of the ground. It was thirteen feet wide. She'd just about doubled in size. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     Atop the monstrous belly was the rest of Kiara's body, every inch of her covered in rolls upon rolls of soft, heavy fat. Her limbs were barely recognizable blobs, dozens of rings of flab, the only reason her little paws hadn't been swallowed by her own fat limbs was because they themselves had been swollen with fat too, not so little anymore, they were slightly larger than the size of elephant feet. Her back paws seemed notedly even bigger than her forepaws, maybe that was because her gargantuan, rotund buttocks, each one much larger than Nala herself, were so heavy their sheer weight pushed down on her back legs, and forced hundreds of pounds of adipose back into her thighs, calves, and fat, fat, fat back paws. Her paw pads were bloated and had lost any callouses exercising had given them, since she hadn't done it in so long, and they were soft to the touch. Her toes had swollen with so much fat they were constantly spread, and she could barely wiggle them if she tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Her tail would've resembled her limbs, a thick, barely recognizable blob of fat rings, had it not been mostly hidden by being pressed between her massive rump and her dozens of rolls of back fat. Between the fat all over her butt, love handles, and chest, as well as her monumental gut, her limbs had been forced into a spread eagle position. Her belly pushed her fat chest resting on it up into her eleventh chin. Speaking of which, her face was just barely poking out of the fat-cavern caused by her multitude of chins, dozen neck rolls, and huge globular cheeks. It seemed like even Kiara's muzzle had some extra padding, and at the center of it all was her panting, salivating maw. The mouth that picked completely clean the immense elephant skeleton in front of Nala, and forced every last speck of meat down Kiara's gullet, into her eager belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After a good minute or two of staring slackjawed at the spectacle before her, Nala snapped out of it when she saw Kiara fruitlessly wobbling her limbs, wiggling her bloated toes, sending the entirety of her body (excluding her still taut stomach) jiggling furiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...more...\" Kiara said. Nala gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More food....you said as much as I wanted . I gotta eat...eat more food....\" Kiarasaid hungrily, wiggling her toes and jiggling her body as she spoke, it seemed feeding her only fed her gluttony too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment more of staring at Kiara, helplessly trapped in her own fat, moving as much as she could only to wiggle her engorged toes, in a desperate attempt to somehow get more food, so she could be fed and eat and continue growing , Nala said...</span></div></div>",

It took a moment of looking at all the bulging rolls of flab pressing against each other to identify the thirty seven chins and enormous soft cheeks, squished in the middle of a monster truck tire of neck fat that marked where her head was. Almost hidden by the fat was her face, her line of sight was filled with her flab and it took a notable amount of effort for her to open her mouth, due to the sheer amount of fat weighing down and pressing against every part of her body. Almost more effort than the lazy mountain of flesh of a cub was willing to exert, if it weren't for how hungry she was, and just how much she absolutely <i> needed </i> to eat. Once Kiara opened her mouth, the first thing to escape it was a long, low belch, which became the exact word Nala was hoping not to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>BBBRRRRRRRRUUUURRAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRPPP...</i></b>...mmm...mmo ooorree...\" Kiara then began taking deep breaths, panting and wheezing, her entire body wobbling and jiggling, sweat pooling in between her rolls of blubber, and drops running down her monumental sphere of a belly. She tried to wiggle her toes, every singular toe engorged with so much fat that it was larger than the entire paw of a full grown lion. But her feet were so uselessly swollen she could just barely flex them. She tried to rub herself with her forepaws for some relief, but the only thing she could touch were the squishy rolls of flab surrounding her paws that were once her wrists, and even this was too much exercise for the hedonistic young lioness, as it caused her to pant even harder, sticking her tongue out, tasting the salty sweat pouring down her rolls made her hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nala sighed and rolled her eyes. \"You look like you're getting tired.

Eat.....\" Kiara muttered as she feast on one of the hippos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala watched as her blob of a daughter feast on the prey. It seems that no matter how much she ate or how full she was, Kiara continue to eat. As she finishes the first hippo down to the bone, she goes for the second one as she does the same. Her stomach gurgled and sloshed from digesting her previous meals. It was working overtime with the more food that Kiara was eating. It stretched up more and more from eating more of the meat. It would only get bigger. After finishing the second hippo, she went for the third. Just like the last two, she wouldn't stop until it was done to the bone. Once the third hippo's meat was all in her belly. The last thing left was the rhino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the rhino was tougher meat than hippo. It also wasn't as fatty. But it didn't stop Kiara from wanting to devour the whole thing. Ripping out big chucks from the rhino and sometimes shallowing the pieces instead of chewing them. Kiara still watched in awe on how her daughter can still eat. She just hoped that she would be done for real once she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long time of feasting, nothing was left but the bones of the three hippos and rhino. It was all inside Kiara's massive mountain of a belly, slowly being converted into fat. Kiara layed on her back, being careful not to be covered by her fat. The sheer size of Kiara was unbelievable. She was more of a fat blob than a cub now. Her rounded overstuffed belly was bigger than three elephants put together and had many folds. Her back paws weren't visible at all, due to the fact her flab covered them. Kiara panted really heavily and her eyes looked really drowsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo....... stuuuuuffed.

The plus side, it looked like Kiara was gonna be asleep for the rest of the day. The negative side however, when she wakes up, she will most likely digested everything and have an empty stomach. Which meant she would want even more food. Just to fill her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiara's eating is getting out of control.\" Nala thought. \"I have to do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala lefted Kiara to sleep and decided to go talk to....</span></div></div>",

Nala continued to go on the hunts, and remained as fit as ever because of it. Meanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara was (with <i>incredible</i> difficulty) moved out of the cave through a back entrance and placed in a much larger space underneath Pride Rock. Originally intended to act as a room for storing food due to it's low temperature, it was quickly overtaken by Kiara's corpulence. Speaking of her corpulence, Kiara's stomach now had the interesting property of finding a way to digest almost all food she had eaten in the span of only a few hours. Having only just awoken, she was as tall as three adult lions and as wide as a giraffe is tall and then some. Her body, head, and rear were the only things that could truly be distinguished, her limbs and tail having been overtaken by the fat piled upon the areas mentioned previously. Forty-two chins could just barely be counted and her face was only just visible thanks to the size of her cheeks, which were now large enough to fit an adult zebra inside whole. Her rear was the size of a rhinoceros; her ample chest forcing her head up. Her back fat threatened to devour her whole if it weren't for the fat piled upon her stomach, rear, and neck. Roll after roll flowed down her sides and pooled onto the floor as though liquid- but that was just speaking about her when she <i>hadn't</i> eaten; when her stomach was <i>empty</i>. Only moments after she awoke, her stomach let out a growl loud enough to make her lioness servant's ears ring. For the next five and a half hours, they kept her feeding until she had eaten so much she was now as <i>tall</i> as a giraffe when sitting on her stomach. Her entire body had managed to pack on weight already, and the sound of an unnaturally rapid digestion process could be heard when one pressed their head against her ballooned stomach. Speaking of, her stomach jut out from below her, in comparison, tiny form, sticking out sideways the height of now two giraffes. Her breathing was heavy, oddly enough not from difficulty doing so but from pleasure and satisfaction in her action. She called out,<br>\r\n\"More... f-food... please...\" and the servants went back to the prey pile, giving each other worried glances.. They returned, working together carrying an elephant: not even snack to her at this point. The elephant was devoured in moments, her form expanding farther and father. She just needed to eat more, it just felt good, felt right, she needed more, more, more, <i>more</i>, <i>more</i>, <b><i>more</i></b>, <b><i>more</i></b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more hours of eating ensued, only <i>three</i> spent digesting. Something supernatural was at work here, but Kiara couldn't care less, if she would ever even realize it. When she awoke, she found herself now as tall as two rhinoceroses, as wide as two giraffes are tall, and with seventy-six chins obscured by their sheer number- and also with a <i>completely empty stomach</i>. She had eaten ten elephants, far, <i>far</i> more than that even, and yet here she was, her stomach growling even louder than before, now with more room to hold yet more food. The servant's came, and she feasted yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack atop Pride Rock, Nala was eating an especially overweight Gazelle beside the essential throne room, Simba smiling at her. He was amazed the hunters were able to catch so much food. Apparently the prey was moving much more slowly, slowed down by their own increased mass. Simba almost wished he was a hunter so he could enjoy hunting his own kill, but he brushed the thought away, remembering his duties as king. Simba was repeatedly distracted by his queen's rump and fattier form shaking as she ate. She now sported a second chin, and was definable as nothing else but fat- but that is not to say she wasn't still fit. Her muscles had not atrophied in the slightest and her limbs were mostly spared from her weight gain thanks to her continued exercise. She was muscular, strong enough that Simba consistently lost wrestling matches with her. This was not helped by the fact that her stomach and tail-end were now much larger. She was bigger in every way: muscle, fat- even confidence, and she showed no signs of stopping there. All of this, Simba loved. He loved that his mate was happy, he loved she was bigger, and he, to his own surprise, loved that she was stronger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings progressed like this for the next...</span></div></div>",

Greenery is still spreading all over the Pridelands and animals are still getting quite fat. Even already large animals, like hippos and elephants. Some lions, like Nala, have also added more to their frames. Nala now spotted a third chin and had a belly that touched the ground. But even with the extra fatness, she still had quite muscular legs due to her still being active. This, however, could not be said about Kiara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing day and each passing meal, Kiara had only gotten fatter beyond belief. She had grown so incredibly fat, they had to move her out of the large space underneath Pride Rock before she outgrew it and got stuck. Kiara's stomach was now a symbol of her unending gluttony. Whether it was eating antelopes, rhinos, hippos, and even elephants, the prey all got churned up in the princess's stomach and later became part of her massive girth. With every meal, her stomach got bigger and with and with each meal digested, her stomach had room for more. Kiara now had a countless amount of chins. It was somewhere over a hundred. Her face could barely be seen due to the abnormally large cheeks that could each hold an elephant, her rear was bigger than any mammal description. Her high had to be at least 4 giraffes tall and she was several times as wide as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer emptied stomach let out a large growl that nearly woke up everyone on Pride Rock. The servants already knew what that meant. I was time to fetch food for the hungry princess. If it wasn't for all the prey getting fatter, Kiara may have eaten a good chunk of the population. Her eating habits never changed. If anything, they had multiplied. It was the same as before. Eat a massive meal until full, sleep a bit, digest within hours, and eat again. And again, and again, and again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimes still goes on.</span></div></div>",

Trees grew big and boldly while carrying luscious fruit. Because of this, it was no surprise that most of the animals were 2, 3, 4, or even 5 times their normal weight. Birds, zebras, gazelles, even already huge mammals like hippos and elephants were fatter than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only real mammal that didn't gain much was Simba. He stayed fit for his kingly duties and only at what he needed. Nala was still very obese from extra helpings she been having. Yet. She only gained a bit more than before. She was still very mobile. Just.... not as mobile as she used to be. Her massive belly touching the ground is a main part of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other lionesses weren't fat. However, with all the hunting they have been doing, they each had quite a bit of muscle. Which was needed for the prey they have been hauling in. Not for them, but their gluttonous princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub was more if a blob of lion blubber that lion. The bigger and fatter she got, the more her appetite.

Rafiki took his time as he looked over the impossibly fat cub of a Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nala had gone to see and bring Rafiki back to Pride Rock, during that time all the meat that Kiara had eaten had completely digested, resulting in fattening Kiara even bigger. Now she was the fat blob size of an actual hot air balloon. There wasn't an inch of Kiara that didn't have rolls of wobbly and jiggly flab, cause the rolls fully covered and encompassed Kiara's entire body. On her fat masses of rolls that were Kiara's legs, only her fat blobs of her paws were stuck out. Her fleshy mound of pancaked rolls that was her tail lay between her hills of bulgy domes of rump cheeks and her many packed rolls of back fat that also bulged upwards in flabby rolls in a dome like shape. In front, her mass of neck rolls spread out to the far ends of her bulgy fat shoulders, up her back fat like stairs going up half way up her back fat and down to spill out on the ground in front of her front chest fat, her chin rolls flowed down from a cavern like tunnel and down her neck rolls to spill out on the ground and ooze out widely like liquid lava a good ten feet out in front of the fat blob of Princess. Also bulging out from the fat cavern tunnel poured out fat and wide bloated face cheeks and flowed down in arcs on both sides in front of her to spill out on the ground like thick and long party balloons of fat that was as far out as her chin rolls. Deep inside the fat cavern tunnel of neck rolls, one could barely make out the fat roll layered and covered mass of the Princess's fat blob head since her fat head was also ten feet deep back in her own mass of fat neck rolls, cause after two feet it got dark inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala gasped after she got done looking what had become of her daughter. \"Rafiki, this isn't right. We got to do something to get her back to her regular weight.\" she talked as quietly as she could as to not wake the sleeping blob Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRafiki hummed in thought before nodding solemly. \"I can do something, it'll be tricky. But I can do it. If you want your daughter to be back to her regular self, then you'd <br>\r\nhave to take what is burdening her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala look shocked with wide eyes. \"Take her weight? But that's huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRafiki shrugged. \"If you want what's best for you daughter. That would mean also taking her hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala thought for a moment, before sighing. \"You know I'd do anything for her, anything for Kiara to be her regular cub weight again. But can you do something for me? I'd like to always be healthy no matter how fat and big I get. And for my body to have no limits. Also for my stomach to quickly digest the food I eat only to fat. I also want to be young again, a young adult one year of age lioness.\" Nala giggled and looked over the blob of her daughter. \"I always wondered what it would be like to be fat and eat and get fatter. So I might as well go all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRafiki grinned and nodded. \"Those things I can make so. All I have to do it cast the spell. The taking weight would be instant and you'll be that size, as well as have her hunger. Then you'll have all those things you said.\"</span></div></div>",

Kiara was still happy to chat with her mother, but she wasn't much concerned over the physical properties of anything other than food. Since coming home, she had continued with the lifestyle she'd gotten used to at Grandma Sarafina's. That meant eating nearly constantly, and <i>that</i> meant becoming very fat indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara had been more or less immobile when Nala had brought her back, but now her paws couldn't even touch the ground, resting instead on a thick layer of her own fat that was growing thicker by the day. The paws themselves were buried beneath the fat rolls of legs too fat and weak to have held her up even if they could have made contact with the ground. Her neck was a mass of chins, and her whole fat body jiggled whenever she made the slightest movement--which mostly involved biting and chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, Kiara was in heaven. Why would she notice that her mother was gaining a little weight when her own gain was so much more pleasurable to focus on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala realized this after a while, and was in fact a bit shocked by it. How could Kiara be so oblivious? Thinking about Kiara's situation made Nala consider her own. She'd gained a good bit of weight, after all.</span></div></div>",

How the heck could she lose weight when she couldn't even stand up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly half an hour of exhausting attempts to move her hugely fattened form, Simba wandered into the room where Nala was laying.

She didn\u2019t know even if they would accept her offer, she headed to the elephant graveyard to meet with them. She could only hope that her plan would come to fruition.</span></div></div>",

The other hyenas weren\u2019t too keen on this arrangement that they had with Sarafina, but the leader of the group a hyena a female hyena named Ghana quelled the doubt that had swelled within her ranks with a fearsome growl from the bottom of her soul. Ghana knew that with their many ranks and that their past treachery of helping Scar Kill and overthrow the past king Mufasa, they had no allies to speak of and with the scraps they were getting now it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say that they would be halved by the year end. Ghana grinned a wicked smile to Sarafina \u201cwe will accept your proposal and cub nap your little one, but I have to ask why do you want us to take her away from her loving family anyways, sure her brother has given us trouble but Kiara has never given us hyenas trouble in the past, so why do you want us to take her?\u201d inquisitive about the situation of why Sarafina wanted to have the young future queen to herself, it just didn\u2019t make much sense to Ghana at the moment. Sarafina started to blush very subtly as the question that the hyena was prying at was embarrassing to admit to anyone, it was a very strange set of circumstances in which Sarafina enjoyed feeding Kiara and making her fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell you see miss, I actually love feeding my granddaughter and seeing her being helpless, the pure domination of her is the main reason why I want you to cub nap her and so we can force her to until she is nothing more than my pet\u201d such determination in Sarafina\u2019s eyes how could Ghana say no to the aging lioness. \u201cFine we will capture her but I hope you can keep up your end of our little arrangement and get enough food for the five of us and your little pet project\u201d Ghana scoffed at Sarafina believing that the lioness wouldn\u2019t be able to ensure that there would be enough meat for all of them to eat well, thinking that if this woman would double cross them Ghana was prepared to hold the young princess for ransom if it came to that, but that would be for if and only the time came for that. Making their way to the pride lands unnoticed was something that wasn\u2019t easy, there were so many scouts out at night, all who were loyal to Simba and his family. Even if it was the middle of the night it wasn\u2019t so easy to get on top of pride rock without someone noticing the five-man group who came to here for one very special reason, Ghana and her team begun their ascent to the top of pride rock where more than likely a sleeping cub would be surrounded by her parents and brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sneaking into the den where the royal family slept, making sure to not make any noise to be heard by adult lions, closer and closer the hyenas got to their target, this was no easy feat to do as the gaunt looking cub was in dead center of the den, her parents surrounded her and her brother. Ghana hoped that luck was on her side as she inched closer to the cub clasping her jaws on the nape of Kiara\u2019s neck to lift the young girl out of the den, delicate as Ghana could be in a situation like this, she begun to leave the den with Kiara confident that she had done it without any type of immediate repercussions. Escaping the pride lands with the cub in her mouth Ghana begun to walk back to her employer\u2019s den \u201cSo uhh boss when are we gonna ransom this cub off to it\u2019s parents, like you said we were going to do?\u201d one of the hyena\u2019s asked looking at the snoozing cub not even noticeing that her surroundings has changed. Ghana couldn\u2019t say anything to her underling with the child in her mouth, placing the girl down gently Ghana begun to express herself to her underling. \u201cIf this old lion doesn\u2019t give us food like she promised, then we will ransom this princess, until then we follow through with our orders.\u201d Somewhat disgruntle about the kind of orders she was given by Ghana the hyena could only bit her tounge about this issue until the time would come</span></div></div>",

Kiara tried her best to escape from this cave as best she could yet it was looking more and more like a pit than a cave, Kiara was never a great climber always liking to be close to the ground as much as possible for her fear of heights were severe enough that the higher she got the more nervous the once proud lioness would get. In the shadows of the cavern the Sarafina looked at her granddaughter as she feverishly tried to escape from her trap, Sarafina could only chuckle at the failed attempts made from Kiara, seeing all the meat that she had accumulated from begging from other lions could only make Sarafina smile as she couldn\u2019t wait to start feeding her pet. At first Sarafina felt conflicted on what she was doing, to her own flesh and blood yet at the same time she wanted this more than anything else, feeling like this about fat was foreign to her but she was so enthralled by the thought of making Kiara so big that she would be able to lie on her granddaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Keeping to the shadows for now Sarafina begun to lead her hired help to start to greet their new prisoner, They didn\u2019t want to question the reason why their boss wanted to fatten up this cub so badly but the leader of the other Hyenas didn\u2019t want to question it as long as the lion fed them and they had some place to lay their head at night they were happy to be of service, Ghana knew that without the help that this lioness gave them they would have to become exiled like the lions who lived in the outlands, scrounging around for the littlest taste of meat, all they need to do is be good soldiers and force this cub to become too big to move. \u201cgo meet out little prisoner, Ghana\u201d Sarafina chuckled as her new accomplice begun to move towards Kiara chuckling to herself as she knew what was going to happen to the unexpecting cub, Ghana was followed by two other hyenas who were dragging a freshly killed Zebra towards Kiara who was scared about what was going to happen to her. Seeing the hyenas come out of the shadows with a zebra in toe with their leader only raised more questions for Kiara as she thought that she was Kidnapped to be used as like a ransom for the pride lands stock pile of food that was kept in an icy cavern near the mountains of the gorilla King, meekly the cub asked her captors \u201cwhat do you want with me, Please let me go home I\u2019m not good to you here\u201d  Ghana could only chuckle at how terrible the young girl\u2019s bargaining was it was laughably terrible on how she tried to wiggle her way out of her current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think you really understand my dear, you\u2019re not here because we want anything from the pride lands or that so-called king who thinks we are nothing more than vermin, you\u2019re here cause out employer wants you to be their new pet, so eat and welcome to your new home, if you try to escape or resist there will be consequences, for now, you have one hour to eat this zebra before we start feeding it to you ourselves,\u201d Ghana stated to the terrified Lion, Kiara didn\u2019t even know what was going on there was just so much to process. All Kiara knew is that she didn\u2019t want to go back on her own downward spiral of feeding into her gluttony she had finally seen the error of her ways thanks to her mother\u2019s help, knowing that no one would respect a queen that wouldn\u2019t be able to move on their own. Turning her nose up to the zebra that was offered to her by the leader Hyenas was a poor move but one that Kiara would make every time the offer was made. \u201cI\u2019m not going back to being fat, it was foolish then and now it\u2019s foolish now\u201d Kiara stated determined not to revert back to her past habits. This was all Ghana needed to hear, she at least wanted to give the girl a chance to be good for her new master before being forceful. \u201cYou two bring the Zebra over there we need to make sure this girl knows her place as a little eating machine\u201d the Hyena smirked can\u2019t wait to shove every morsel into this stuck up cub.</span></div></div>",

In disbelief to how much food that was given to the hyenas for their plan thank to the work each of them thought that if they just took the food and ran they could support themselves for a while, it wasn\u2019t like that Ghana wasn\u2019t thinking about it but she didn\u2019t know what her employer would do to her pack though if she refused her demands it was quite the conundrum. Kiara still afraid of the new area where she was at looked around with a feverish pace, her eyes darting around the den looking for any way that she could escape anything that would give her a way out was her top priority not knowing what was going to become of her if she stuck around with these hyenas was what scared her the most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou two start feeding are little guest already our poss wouldn\u2019t be happy to come back and she is still as thin as a rail don\u2019t you think\u201d Ghana snickered ordering her underlings was no problem for the leader of the hyenas it with an evil grin plastered across her face Ghana peered straight into her little friends very sou, even Kiara could feel the danger she was in. Stepping backward as fast as she could without letting the hyena get a sniff of her fear Kiara knew she had to get out but how was the question she needed to answer there wasn\u2019t much the cub could do being surrounded by five or six female hyenas wasn\u2019t ideal for Kiara to say the least with them surrounding the little cub Kiara could only think about what they were going to do to her it. Not knowing who employed these hyenas in the first place was what infuriated the princess the most it more than what her fear was doing to her mental health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you going to due to me I\u2019m not much of a meal anymore since I lost all the weight so I don\u2019t think you would want to eat me\u201d The little princess thinking that bartering with these hyenas was in her best interest as not seeing any other way she could get out of this, not knowing what else to do all Kiara could do was shrink herself into a corner hoping that they will leave her alone. The leader began to circle the poor little cub looking at Kiara from every possible angle looking to see if there was something that was so very special about her that Sarafina was on the warpath to make Kiara and immobile blob once again. Nothing could be done about her situation Kiara thought to herself there were just too many enemies for the young cub to tackle upon herself, not knowing what to do about her situation all Kiara thought to was to sob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease just let me go I won\u2019t tell anybody what you're doing here\u201d the little cub begun to beg, hoping that this would be her release of whatever Ghana and her minions were planning to do, eyes darted to each of the hyenas in fear that they were planning something. Wiping away her tears seemed to be ineffective in turn this only made her captors chuckle at Kiara\u2019s distress. Ghana ordering her minions to go to the pile of various animal carcasses that were provided by their employer grabbing legs of Zebras and Ibexes between their teeth trying not to salivate themselves from the meat that they had in their mouths, even they knew that Ghana wouldn\u2019t allow them to devour the meat when they had a job to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHehehe\u2026 don\u2019t worry dear princess I promise that your going to be well fed\u201d Ghana with all the venom in her words circled the little cub, Pouncing on Kiara Ghana held the princess down a wide grin upon the hyena\u2019s face while the others encircled the two of them, chuckling the with various kinds of Savannah animals entrapped in their maws. Closer and closer each of them got to Kiara, the cub tried to struggle against her captors with no avail tears forming in her eyes as she didn\u2019t see any way to get always from the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead feed our little guest already, I\u2019m getting tired of pinning her down she does know how to struggle alright I guess it's just something royalty knows how to do after all\u201d Ghana just chuckled, moving her paw forcing Kiara's mouth open gleefully nudging her little helpers near the cub. Not much effort was used as the first slab of meat slid down the throat of Kiara, forced to chew the meat or suffocate from it. Slowly Kiara began to chew it, tears running down her face knowing that there was more food to come and there was no way she could escape the situation that she found herself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStruggle all you want but there is nothing you can do\u201d Ghana chuckled, her minions knew what they needed to do shoving more and more meats into the little cub's maw forcing Kiara to swallow. The meat hit her stomach with a thunk, Kiara couldn\u2019t deny that the taste of zebra was the best from the ibex she was used to that her parents forced her to eat to be the athletic lioness she once was before she hid away from her parents and stayed with her overbearing grandmother, who was taking away her choice to be thin Kiara begun to wonder.</span></div></div>",

Staggering the cub began to get up, \u201cow my head, what happened to me\u201d Kiara though trying to make sense of what happened to her she didn\u2019t know where she was although looking around the area she could see it was one place her mother and father always warned her to be very cautious of, the Outlands. Fearing the reason she got here Kiara begun to quickly look around the area where she was eyes darting around, looking at where she was it seemed to be a big system of tunnels and caves someplace that she had never seen before, all of it was foreign to her \u201cyou don\u2019t know where you are do you princess\u201d a voice chimed in, Kiara didn\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t sense the presence of whoever was stalking her at this moment. Kiara didn\u2019t know how to feel about this person who casually lurked up behind her in such a manner, even though Kiara was being taught by one of the best hunters in the Pridelands this other creature was so stealthy that she Kiara couldn\u2019t even recognize what type of creature it was, the person hopped down from the ledge in which she was laying down from, seeing clearly that it was an older lion who was peering at her a massive grin upon her face, vicious with the smirk on her face caused Kiara to shrink in her place not knowing what this lioness would want with her she knew it had to be nothing good that was a given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to have the princess of the Pridelands in my humble abode, I am your host of the little soiree I have brought you here as a plaything for my daughter to have fun with\u201d the lioness stated cackling while saying it, this lion was someone Kiara knew quite well it was someone who her father had disdain for as she was one person who had relations with her great-uncle scar years her name being Zira a lioness who was as ruthless as scar once was, always thinking that she was meant to be the queen of the Pridelands and someone who couldn\u2019t be reduced to being exiled to the Outlands. Kiara was just scared at what was going to happen to her there was no way she could defend against the might that was Zira she was as tough as she was Cynical all the young cub could think of what to do was to run, dashing past Zira in a burst of speed to overtake the larger body of Zira, not thinking about how she was going to escape the cave Kiara only Knew that she had to get out of there as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh we are playing this game are we young princess, well I\u2019m up for a chase just be ready to lose\u201d getting ready to chase Kiara Zira said just she darted for the young cub, like someone who was out on the prowl, catching up to Kiara quite easily her long legs and body made the distance between them seem like nothing at all. Quickly Zira was able to catch up with her prize it was mere child\u2019s play to someone of her speed and grace, easily she caught up with Kiara grasping the Princess\u2019 nape with her maw, dragging her away deeper into the caverns that littered the area in which they stood. Deeper they went into the cave system the more Kiara struggled to get away from this woman she didn\u2019t know what the lioness wanted with her but Kiara didn\u2019t want to stick around to find out what that was, shifting her weight to an fro she thought that this would dislodge her from the mouth of Zira a feeble attempt to get away from the menacing Lion was good then no attempt. \u201cStttahp strwggling\u201d Zira spoke slurred in her words thanks to Kiara\u2019s wriggling, thinking she could get loose from the mighty grasp of Zira was just a dream by this point, her captor just clamped down harder on Kiara\u2019s nape making sure that she couldn\u2019t break free from the hold Zira had on her.

It all seemed useless to try to escape from her current situation, \"please just let me go, I won't tell daddy I was her\" Kiara blubbered, \u201cyomfr nammft leawving\u201d Zira slurred her words still trying to speak with a mouth full of fur in her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Zira was grateful that their stop was coming up fast. The area was a wide open area, a skylight was in the center shining down sun from the outside, cliffs peppered around the area but none seemed to reach to the skylight, it seemed like it was the nicest cave she had seen in the Outlands. Being dropped from the mouth of Zira was a relief for Kiara as she didn\u2019t want to be in the mouth of this vile woman any more than she had to be, scared to move from the spot lions looked at the scared cub like she was a meal for them to devour in one gulp, \u201cVitani your present is her\u201d Zira yelled trying to get the attention of her daughter as she could not see her among the other Outlanders that were around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping down from one of the cliffs was a Brownish lioness, she looked to be around the same age as Kiara, her piercing blue eyes looked through Kiara and maybe even through her, \u201cI thought you said you were going to make her big for my party\u201d frowned the lion, Kiara didn\u2019t know what she meant by that but seeing Vitani circling her like a vulture made Kiara very uneasy for whatever she meant by big, Kiara didn\u2019t want to know what she meant she just had to leave. Edging away from Vitani\u2019s circling it was uncomfortable, to say the least, Zira didn\u2019t even bother to look at Kiara anymore it was as the Lioness said Kiara was a present for Vitani\u2019s birthday. \u201cI thought you could make her yours all by your self, you don\u2019t want her to imprint on me would you my dear daughter\u201d Zira coyly pointed out to her daughter, I will bring the meat for your little project in a while but you too get to know each other, oh and my dear princess don\u2019t try to escape this is your home now and my daughter is your mistress, don\u2019t think about running I will only catch you and there will be consequences that you won\u2019t like\u201d Zira put it a blunt as she could for the girl that there wasn\u2019t any escape she was Vitani\u2019s and she was going to be here forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara\u2019s mind raced with what was going to happen to her, tears began for form in the corners of her eyes she just wanted to go home and forget that this day had even happened in the first place, \u201cwe are going to have so much fun when mom comes back down worry little princess you will love being mine and only mine\u201d her new mistress stated as she nuzzled up against Kiara\u2019s body, feeling every nook and cranny of the slim princess\u2019s body was her main objective, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to fatten you up, you may not like it but I will make you love it\u201d the cub thought a grin plastered upon her face, she was already loving the present her mother had delivered to her. Vitani went back to her spot where she usually laid about, waiting so patiently for her mother to return was the worst thing about her present but it was going to worth the wait she as the fun could really begin then.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was scared being in an area that she didn\u2019t even recognize as a part of the Outlands the den was kind of pretty in a strange way the open skylight and watering hole in center made it look so serene, but this wasn\u2019t a time to daydream about the beauty of the area she needed to get far away from these lions as fast as she can before this demented cub had her way with her.\u201dDon\u2019t worry my dear princess if you\u2019re a good girl and obey your master then you will have a good time living here with us, but if your bad and don\u2019t listen to me, well then we are going to have a problem\u201d Vitani slyly stated circling her pet like the predator she was born to be. Kiara didn\u2019t know what to do with this girl who looked like her like prey to be hunted and not as an equal, the way Vitani looked at Kiara only made her more uncomfortable in the situation she was in, She needed to get away from her no matter the cost but Kiara wondered if she could even get away from Vitani in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease just let me go I don\u2019t want to cause any trouble I won\u2019t tell my father any of this\u201d Kiara repeated herself hoping to find some glimmer of humanity in this lion cub, it was a long shot but at this moment Kiara needed any kind of edge that she could find. Anger rose to the surface of Vitani\u2019s face when Kiara talked about being let go from her current situation it was something that Vitani wasn\u2019t just going to allow her new play toy to walk away from the situation she found herself in, pouncing upon Kiara in a rough manner that throws the terrified cub to the ground asserting to Kiara that Vitani was in control. Looking up to the sky seeing all the birds flying overhead only made Kiara feel the weight of her situation was direr than she originally thought it to be. \u201cyou seem to be understanding that your mine and mine alone no one is going to save you or come for you\u201d Vitani chuckled, not even noticing that her mother had returned from her hunt with a prize that made Vitani look twice at what it was, food for the Outlands was something that wasn\u2019t very abundance sometimes, Vitani though she would have to feed Kiara some grubs before she could really fatten her up. \u201cI thought you could use a gazelle for your pet my dear daughter\u201d don\u2019t waste it now it was hard to track down, but I\u2019m sure it will be worth it\u201d Zira chuckles looking at her daughter pinning Kiara to the ground in triumph could only make a mother proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vitani didn\u2019t even have to move from her position of pinning the princess to enact her plans for the lithe cub, tearing off meat from the gazelle to feed to her pet, Kiara eyes grew wider seeing the large piece of meet that the demented cub was holding in her teeth inching closer to Kiara mouth. Struggling to get away from the Vitani became an uphill battle seeing that the Outlander had to be tougher than the princess to even survive her mother\u2019s wrath, it was futile to get away from her as the loving lioness the smell of the meat from the gazelle was intoxicating, trying to keep her wits of her situation was hard to do, the meat shoved into her mouth was delicious to say the least not even knowing where her mother would find such a delectable morsel was something that wasn\u2019t her concern. Looking at Vitani ripping off another piece of meat from the plump gazelle to feed to Kiara the princess thought what was going to befall her in the care of Vitani. This Gazelle could easily feed a full-grown lion, why was it being fed to Kiara if food from them was so scarce, these questions swirled in her head as another piece was shoved down her throat without warning causing Kiara to choke, coughing struggling to breathe Kiara, wondered if Vitani was just trying to kill Kiara by making her choke on the gazelle instead of feeding it to her.   </span></div></div>",

Being a little cub also meant that she couldn\u2019t eat that much food as she was too small to be able to in the first place this was something that the Outlander cub didn\u2019t ever see as a problem for she had a grand scheme in her head of what she was going to do with her present. This was kept from Kiara as Vitani didn\u2019t want any of her plans to be ruined by loose lips, the bones of the gazelle were shoved in the corner of the cave system where the Outlanders decided to place the pride land princess into. Looking around for some more meat to shove into the already very full Kiara proved futile as her mother had only given Vitani a little meat not wanting Vitani to break her new toy a little too soon this was the only reasoning the little cub could think of why only one gazelle was brought to the spot where Kiara was placed in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cKeep an eye on her I have to go and get more food for my pet I can\u2019t believe that Gazelle didn\u2019t last as long as I thought, its such a pain\u201d Vitani announced her intentions to gather more food from the pit wasn\u2019t just for Kiara to know where her new master was going, no this was for the other creatures whose eyes gleamed around the caver where Kiara was placed ever since she was placed in this cave she had always felt like she wasn\u2019t alone with Vitani. The familiar chuckle echoed from the confines of the base of the Outlanders. Kiara knew that familiar laugh was from hyenas, it was an animal she was always told by her father to avoid due to their Conniving nature that they had shown Simba when he was a cub himself. Closer and closer these animals circled Kiara intimidating the little cub with their immense size. Eyes darting from corner to corner trying to see an opening to get always from these hyenas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cyou still don\u2019t get it do you, poor girl your no longer free to do as you please your just another toy for Miss Vitani to play with and boy does she have plans for you\u201d one of the hyena\u2019s chuckled out taking a pay to rub against the lithe form that Kiara had gained from always hunting with her mother and Keeping up with the other cubs that lived in the pride lands, she didn\u2019t really know what these hyena\u2019s wanted from her but there isn\u2019t much she could do escape seemed to be off the table, there just wasn\u2019t anywhere she could run it just seemed so very hopeless to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMiss Vitani Has many more things to feed you before you are even close to being ready for her part, I mean she has many plans for you since your not even a cub anymore your just a pig\u201d the leader of the hyenas taunted her more, they all were female and could be shown to be lead by Vitani herself, it made Kiara think that the rabid dogs were telling the truth and that she had no hope for whatever the outlander had planned for her was going to come into fruition even if she did try to escape. The clouds of doubt circled in her head as Kiara though of a way out of this situation sobbing when there wasn\u2019t anything around that even looked like it would be a way for her to escape. Stomach still bloated with delectable meat of a gazelle still sat comfortably in her stomach not moving an inch acting like a rock in her stomach, just weighted down by the pure size of how much she was forced to eat a little while ago made the situation she was in even more hopeless than what was previously thought by anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah when  miss Vitani get done with feeding you, you wont look like a cub anymore just a blob of flesh\u201d another hyena chimed into the conversation she was having with Kiara putting fear into the cub of what was going to happen to her when Vitani returned from where ever she had gone to get more food for her pet, no way to get away from five fully grown hyenas who seemingly work for the little monster that was Vitani it all just seemed hopeless for the once princess of the Pridelands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cKiara was once the princess of all the land, pampered and loved by all she knew, now she was nothing more than a toy for the princess of the Outlands to play with. Fed with all kinds of meats might be a chore, being fattened against her will Kiara the princess will try to fight but we all know that the outlands princess always does what she does and gets what she wants, what do you think will break first the poor Pridelands princess\u2019 mind or her waist, no one know but its always fun to see\u201d the hyenas sung in the most annoying sing-song voice only got on the little cubs nerves more and more, not knowing what to do as Kiara was very much outnumbered. Was it true about what they were saying was she brought her to be toyed with and fattened, the feeding that she had just had to endure was just a highlight of what was to come was resting heavily on Kiara\u2019s mind she knew that she couldn\u2019t stay here as her mother and father would be worried, Kiara had to get out.</span></div></div>",

Nearby, two large creatures were talking, though she couldn't make out what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know we could get into real trouble for this,\" one man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How,\" the other man asked, \"we've been okayed by both governments and the FDA.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean that,\" the first man said, \"I mean, this is some lioness's cub, what if she comes searching, brings the entire pride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it was wandering around lost,\" the second man said, \"lions don't do that unless the cubs have been chased out, ergo, they don't want her anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the formula's safe is it,\" the first man asked, \"if she drinks too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a dilute mix,\" the second man said, \"there ought to be no way she'll drink too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ought to...\" the first man began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" the second man said, \" now lets get things ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara then found herself removed from the cage, and carrier into another part of the cave and put into another, smaller cave. When the princess had recovered a bit more she decided to explore her new quarters. Not that there was much to explore, her enclosure was a wooden, well, 'pit' came to mind, it was only about 10 by 20 lengths in size, and the only fixtures seemed to be a pile of straw in one corner and a bowl filled with some sort of thick, off-white liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling peckish, Kiara tasted the liquid, which turned out to be bland, but manageable. Of course, the princess wasn't to know that the liquid, as well as being quite rich, also a had a special chemical formula to make it more appealing over time, and so, about half an hour later, the lion cub found herself returning to the bowl. This time the liquid tasted much better, the chemical having taken effect, as so she drank until her stomach was achingly tight, before she retreated to the the straw to sleep her meal off.</span></div></div>",

Of course, this was quickly exhausted, her craws barely marked the wood of her enclosure, and she soon picked up a splinter, which, while she removed it easily enough disuaded her from any more escape attempts.

Unfortunately for the female cub, her stomach had become more and more forceful as the week went on, and this combined with her lack of space had had a big effect on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKIara could no longer be called chubby, or reasonably even fat, she was now officially obese. her body was almost ball shaped with her newly gained weight, or egg shaped if you chose to count in her head and neck, the second now wider than the first and beginning to develop rolls. Her legs were affected as well, their layers of padding forming rolls over her joints, and pressing against her belly, forcing her to develop a splayed posture whenever she stood up. Even her tail hadn't escaped, hanging limp down her rump, simply too heavy to lift any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that lazy beast Todd,\" the human growled, sitting in front of the monitor watching the cub in her now daydreaming phase.

Sarabi gave in to her hunger and snapped at it; Shenzi let it go, but smirked. \"I hope your belly has a lot of room, Sarabi...you'll need it. Before Sarabi could answer, the next chunk f meat was shoved int her maw; it was too big to spit out, and she was too hungry anyway. Shenzi watched as Sarabi was fed...after a while, Sarabi had slipped from starving, to sated, to sick, and truly had to be force fed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause in the food, Sarabi belched. \"oeeergghh...so stuffed...ohhh...I...Ijust can't eat any more...\" Saabi felt like she was about to burst, and her belly was almost a sphere, nearly a metre in diameter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurts, doesn't it?\" said Shenzi, having approached her.

The first is that if we were to feed you any further right now, you would burst open. Your belly would explode like a bomb. You would be dead in seconds. And as such, you wouldn't be capable of feeling pain anymore! And we can't have that, now can we?\" \"Sadistic lowlife...\" Sarabi thought in her mind, increasingly wanting to tear Shenzi's throat out, but frustrated at how she was unable to move at all, save for breathing, due to her already obese self having now gotten all the fatter, while also having lost even more muscle than before. She was literally immobilized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what's the second reason, Shenzi?\" asked one of the hyenas. \"The second reason is that I'm hungry now, ironically enough! And I'll take that meat, thank you! Stuff my belly!\" \"But Shenzi, you're already sort of plump!\" said another hyena, this one being Banzai. \"If you stuff yourself, you could end up just as fat as the lioness lump lying down there, or worse!\" \"Right now, I don't care one way or the other, because I'm hungry! FEED ME!\" Shenzi exploded with the last two words, and the hyenas obliged. Although Sarabi was relieved she would be granted a temporary rest from this torturous force-feeding, she knew the hyenas on her limbs were not intending to get off at all, and even if they did, she could not possibly get up. She was trapped here, and would be unless some of her pride came to her rescue, which was quite unlikely. \"Thank God for small favors, but I'm still in a very dangerous, and possibly life-threatening, situation!\" Sarabi thought to herself. \"Why did I have to become so fat and lethargic? It's like I've got a target painted on me now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, one hyena after the other handed Shenzi meat, and she kept on gorging herself with it. It looked as though Shenzi would never finish stuffing herself, even as her initially merely plump, pregnant looking belly was getting bigger and bigger, and, as if that weren't enough, the rest of her body was expanding with fat, too, even if not as much as her paunch, which had gotten a head start, was. By the time Shenzi finally finished binging and stuffing her belly, she was twice as fat as Sarabi had been before getting force-fed, though not quite on par with Sarabi's current state of corpulence. After letting out a long, loud belch, Shenzi patted her new, mountain-like belly and said: \"My God, that was good. So, how much weight have I put on?\" \"Well, you aren't on par with lard lioness,\" Banzai replied in a derogatory reference to Sarabi, \"but you are comparable. Still, I don't think should should be unable to move, like she is.\" All the hyenas could not believe how fast Shenzi had fateened herself up in a matter of time with just one meal. At least, what she considered a meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they got over it enough to think straight again, Shenzi turned to Sarabi and said: \"Okay, porky prisoner, what to do with you now?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut before anyone could do anything else, or even think anything else, who should show up but... </span></div></div>",

But he looked into her eyes again, and saw a vulnerability there - perhaps she just wanted some attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he wandered over and obliged, running his claws lightly over her quivering gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm no, push harder you silly male!\" she said, slapping his paw, and Majiti grimaced, trying to contain his anger. He pushed hard into her lovely, soft fat until he felt some resistance, then rubbed up and down, sending her blubber rolling this way and that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thaat's better, oh Majiti, that's so good! Why didn't you tell me you were so good at this?\" She said, looking up and smiling beautifully amongst the many rolls of fat on her face and neck. The fat on her body rolled up between her chubby forelegs and pushed up against her chin, making the rolls there even deeper. She looked so cute that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajiti couldn't help it, he smiled back, and foolishly he said, \"I live to serve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi reached out her chubby arms, and Majiti stepped forward, as surprised as anything to recieve a great big, smothering hug from her. It felt nice, of course, laying on top of all her fat (much better than the other way around), and soon he did his best to hug her back, patting her, feeling her fat undulate against his skinny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first bit of affection she had shown him, and he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My you are skinny,\" she said, rubbing his hands up and down his back, then pushed him away. \"Quick!

I'm such big, fat slob!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajiti looked down into her sad face, only then realising, he hadn't told her he preferred her this way!

When nothing else was said, Majiti turned his attention back to the meat. It felt really good to get a decent portion of food for once. As Majiti wasn't used to being proper fed, he didn't really eat much before he was full. It felt satisfactory. Again, Majiti thought of Shenzi, who could eat herself so bloated she would just lie on her back and whimper for hours. He doubted food could ever get so satisfactory to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had finished eating he turned back to Shenzi who looked at him with inviting eyes. She signalized for Majiti to come and lay down on top of her. She was laying on her back, her fat belly was spreading out on her sides.

Shenzi couldn't help but blush a little at that. She was so glad to have a mate who would love her, no matter how obese and flabby she was, and who she could trust and love back. Now she regretted her initial refusal to let him eat more than ever, and once he'd finished his meal and was satisfied for the time being, she said: \"Oh, Majiti, I'm so sorry for how I've acted.\" Majiti was very surprised to hear Shenzi apologizing, but he smiled kindly as she continued: \"If only I'd realized how perfect you really were sooner. Can you forgive me?\" \"I certainly can.\" he said. \"Good to know. I love you.\" she said. \"Though maybe you still need some meat...\" \"No, I'm good for now.\" he said. \"However, I found something in this particular kill.\" \"What?\" asked Shenzi. Majiti explained: \"It's a gem. A magical one, by the looks of it, and you know what?\" \"What?\" asked Shenzi. \"I not only love you anyway, but I actually prefer you this way. I've come to realize, additionally, that the fatter you are, the more gorgeous you become.\" \"You prefer me this way, and think my being fat makes me attractive?!\" Shenzi exclaimed, excited and elated all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Majiti said. \"Which is why I'm going to use this gem to make you fatter than ever, and it will be done so in a way that makes sure you continue to fatten up nonstop, though the magical properties will see to it you can still breathe and such, and won't have any health problems or heart attacks or anything like that. You'll be permanently immune to and exempt from them, no matter how much blubber piles on. You'll be able to move, too. I wouldn't want to incapaciate or injure you, after all. But you'll be fatter and fatter by the second, all the same! You'll be my beloved mountain of a blubbery beauty.\" \"Now, just a minute...\" Shenzi began. As much as she loved him and was flattered to hear he loved her as a big, fat bitch, she was already fatter than a hippo! She wouldn't want to get even a bit fatter. But Majiti worked his magic, literally, and Shenzi could only watch as the gem did its work and she got fatter and fatter by the second. Soon enough, she was twice as fat as she'd been before, then three times as fat, then four, then five. By the time she was six times fatter, Majiti suddenly stopped to consider that this could cause the ground beneath them to crumble and their home to break. So he did a wave of the gem and put a stop to the sequence, then threw it away. All else worked as he said it would, though, and Shenzi was easily six times fatter than she was before. \"My God, you are so beautiful...\" Majiti gaped as he looked at the unbelievably fat Shenzi. Shenzi was full of disbelief, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was to happen next?   </span></div></div>",

And that is likely a mile all around.\" Majiti explained.<br>\r\n\"Darn it, I'm going outside.\" Shenzi felt her body get used to her new size, and like a lumbering elephant and hippo, she waddled heavily out of the cave and outside. Shenzi barely was able to fit through the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn anger at being yelled at by her, he searched for the magic gem and picked it up. \"Well Shenzi, I'll get you to like being fat and continue to fatten rapidly nonstop, like both a desire and lust to be fatter and fatter. I hope it has a massive effect on your hunger too, to become a constant feeding gluttonous hyena blob.\" And that said, he chased outside to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was a day when the new Queen Nala occasionally planned to meet up to talk about the current hunting and food shares betwen the pride and her hyena clan. As soon as Nala got into the elephant graveyard, she gasped and blinked when she saw the newly fattened blob female hyena. \"Shenzi, is that you?\"<br>\r\nShenzi blinked and forgot about the meeting time. \"Erf, Nala...

All she could manage was to make the pile of flab that was rapidly overtaking her to slosh and wobble furiously, her rump rounding out and protruding further and further up and out in the air, bouncing and swaying as she pumped her legs. She stretched her back legs as far as she could, wiggling her thick squishy paws in a desperate attempt to get a foothold on the ground. However all she could do was press them into the backmost part of her own gut, she felt the flab squishing up between her soft toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Help! Help! Banzai, somebody! Ed!

She could feel her chins wobble as she yelled, it felt like a new one of those was developing every minute, as she gradually ascended on her own pillow of flab, which spread out in all directions like a viscous liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head swam.

She knew she must be the size of a hippopotamus by now, drowning in her own sea of flab. Her rump was gargantuan, like two slightly sagging spherical mountains erupting from the homogeneous blob that she'd largely become. About six feet tall, and thirteen feet wide, it dominated much of her mass, completely covering her tail, spilling on to her back rolls, and engulfing her legs to the point of almost nothing but her soft, round, engorged, wriggling toes and pillowy soles were out in open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sighed, panic subsiding to confusion, annoyance, and some vague sense of enjoyment (after all who could be entirely upset with an ass like that?).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Great.

It continued to rise and rise until it was up to head level with Shenzi, and with her new body shape she wouldn't be able to do anything to keep herself above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her the two scientists had been watching this whole procces and tried to find a way to stop it.<br>\r\n1. \"We have to stop the flow!\"<br>\r\n2. \"I know, I know!\"<br>\r\n1. \"Can't you just turn it off?\"<br>\r\n2. \"No, that stupid hyena must have damaged the autofiller sensor.\"<br>\r\n1. \"Can't we just cut out the power?\"<br>\r\n2. \"Not in this state. The level of food is so high right now, that it will drown her regardless.\"<br>\r\n1. \"There must be something we can do!\"<br>\r\n2. \"Like what?\"<br>\r\n1. \"How about opening up the floor?\"<br>\r\n2. \"Are you crazy!? Doing that would send the hyena down with the food into the drains, that would send her out into the wild again!\"<br>\r\n1. \"We can't just let her die!?\"<br>\r\n2. \"Would you rater lose our test subject, and have to explain to the boss?\"<br>\r\n1. \"We could catch her again, at her size she can't make it far.\"<br>\r\n2. \"...Alright do it, but if this fails I'm going to make sure you get all the blame.\"<br>\r\n1. \"And I will take it if that happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the one scientist pulled a switch that made the floor open up under Shenzi. Before she knew it she and all the food was floating around in what looked like a fast paced underground river. Still being addicted to eating it Shenzi did her best in trying to swallow down as much of the now more liquefied food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Shenzi reached an exit to the cave and saw something she hadn't been seeing for a while. The moon shining down at her with it's strong nightlight. Getting used to seeing real light again Shenzi took and swam her obese body to the nearest sand bank. Getting up and strating to walk Shenzi had first now felt just how much her body had changed during this time. Her legs had a really hard time just holding her weight up, and walking turned out to be a real shore, and running was right out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven through her brain was still under the controll of eating the food, Shenzi still managed to think \"Eat. food. somewhere. else.\" and was now making her way away from that strange place that had been having her as it's prisoner. Throughout the night she walked for hours until she found a good place to hide from predators that would like to take advantages of a lonly and fat prey as herself. Inside a small hole in the ground that was covered up by some bushes Shenzi finally took the chance to close her eyes and get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what had to be the greatest sleep she's ever had Shenzi wakes up and starts to look around her surroundings. She really wanted to see if she could point out where she was, and in that way quickly get back to her home and friends. Looking around Shenzi had to face the hard fact that she was completely lost, and if she didn't find anything that could help her she would be lost forever. In the distance she suddenly saw something that looked familiar. It looked like some kind of animal that wasn't a prey. It looked like something she had seen previously, and she made her way to try and get closer to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got her heavy body closer and shouted at the thing to get it's attention, Shenzi could see as she got closer that the creature in question is...</span></div></div>",

It didn't look like there was any way of getting in or out of it.\" Both Banzai and Ed looked more and more scared of what kind of weird place's Shenzi had seen. \"And before I knew it there was a sudden small round hole in one of the walls where food started to come out of.\" \"Food?!\" Banzai said surprised over hearing the magic word. \"Yes.\" Shenzi replied, \"Do you mean like Zebra's and Gazelle's and Hippo's?\" Banzai asked curious while Ed just started drooling by the thought of all the foods. \"No, more like some kind of already chewed up food.\" Shenzi answered. \"It didn't look very appetizing at first, but as soon as I took and started to taste it, it felt wonderful, and I found myself not being able to stop eating it.\" \"We can clearly see that.\" Banzai said in a snarky remark making Ed laught a little. \"But soon I found the whole place starting to become filled with the food, and it was more then I could possibly chow down. I almost drowned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last sentance made both Banzai and Ed silence for a moment. \"You mean you could have drowned in food?\" Banzai asked. Shenzi replied with a simple \"Yes.\" \"Wow.\" Banzai said, \"I would never have guesed that would have been the way for you to go.\" \"Neither did I, but luckily things didn't end like that.\" Shenzi said. \"Yeah, how did you manage to survive?\" Banzai asked with Ed also showing huge interest. \"Just like how the food suddenly apperaed out of a wall, I could feel the ground under me disappear.\" Shenzi explained. \"So food can come out of the walls and the ground can suddenly disappear? This place really sound weird.\" Banzai said a s both he and Eds minds felt blown by this strange place Shenzi was describing. \"But what happen then?\" \"Then I could feel myself suddenly be swiming for my life in a wild river, with no hopes of surviving.\" Shenzi said as she saw both her friends being on their sets about how it would end. \"But then I suddenly saw the light at the end of the tunnel...\" \"No! Don't walk into the light!\" Banzai suddenly shouted. \"Not that light you fool.\" Shenzi said irritated, \"The light of the moon. I was suddenly outside in the wide open savannah once again. I got myself up on land again and searched for a good place to sleep during the night and found that place.\" She said and pointed in the direction of where the bushes where laying. \"And once the day arrived I took and searched for someone that could help me, and found you.\"</span></div></div>",

A second and third attempts were no more successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never make it,\" Pendeza replied as he watched Shenzi struggle, \"heck, 'I' barely made it, so you'll stand no chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Shenzi said, deciding to heed Pendeza's words for now, \"but tell me one thing, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a control freak,\" Pendeza replied, \"and I happen to like my ladies bigger, so this solves both things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By leaving me to die down here,\" Shenzi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I won't let you starve,\" Pendeza replied, disappearing from sight for a moment, before appearing at the side of the canyon, much closer, \"in fact, here's a little appetiser, eat up,\" and dropping the gazelle carcass almost on top of Shenzi, \"eat up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi want to refuse the meal, to slim down and get out of here, and get revenge, but all too soon her new-found hunger kicked in and she fell to eating, which was followed by a digestion-laden nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up, Shenzi couldn't remember where she was for a moment, then the memories came flooding back, and she curse silently at Pendeza, who seemed to have disappear for now, and tried to decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

There were some people who hated and despised the help that the lion guard provided for other animals it was something that one particular clan of hyenas would always clash with the guard with as they always had a knack of getting in their way when it came to schemes that they had cooked up to get either more food, more land, or sometimes something obscure. Janja was their leader of this ragtag group, wanting nothing more than to terrorize the pride lands for his own selfish reasons he alone stalked the pride lands for ways to disrupt the peace that has been built around pride rock. \u201cIf the lion guard wasn\u2019t around then I could get the idiots together and take over this miserable piece of land, they are always there meddling in things they have no right to be in\u201d He thought to himself stalking around the hippo\u2019s territory deep in thought of what to do with his recent failures that were caused by Kion and his lion guard, \u201cthey are just too strong as a group I don\u2019t know what I can do with my clan  to destroy this unity they have with each other.\u201d  Stalking around the area Janja saw something zoom by him that was always familiar to him, it was Fuli she had such grace and speed that zipping across the miles of plains was no sweat to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Mrs. Hippo some fresh Junta fruit from the antelope herding area, hope this will help your foot\u201d Fuli cheerfully dropping the fruit by the Hippo\u2019s feet, what the two didn\u2019t realize was there was a third party who was listening into their conversations as they were having it Janja was wondering why Fuli was around this part of the area and why she wasn\u2019t around the other members of the lion guard it was perplexing to the hyena. \u201cI wish I could be as fast as you, my dear I could have just gotten the fruit my self with your speed, look at you your so lean\u201d Mrs. Hippo said egging on the conversation complementing the young cheetah on how fit and limber she was, blushing at all the complements she was getting from the hippo she knew that she had to excuse herself before she became to big for her britches, \u201cI mean I\u2019m fine with myself but it I was a couple of hundred pounds lighter I could be quick to instead I lumber around slower than a snail thanks to all this fat\u201d the woman carried on to say not even realizing she was saying as things just came out of her mouth without any provocations from Fuli. \u201cWell I got to go now, thanks for the chat Mrs. Hippo\u201d Fuli stated before speeding of too somewhere in the Pride lands to help other people out with problems before finally returning to the lion Guard, the conniving hyena Janja had gotten out of his hiding spot to scope out the area, see if anyone who he deemed to be his enemy was still in the area, \u201clooks like the coast is clear for the moment, but that Hippo just gave me an idea that could work to help me take over this pathetic place\u201d that will have the fastest one become the slowest, looks like I\u2019m going to need those chumps to help me out with this plan, hope they can pull it off since they aren\u2019t the brightest when it comes to this kind of stuff\u201d Janja said making his way back to the out lands to meet with all the others of his little group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuli began to make her rounds around the edge of the pride lands, the last of her rounds before she could finally go back to the den of the lion guard, \u201cseems as iff all was safe here\u201d Fuli said looking around for any disturbances that would be around, there wasn\u2019t much around this area as most she could see was many rocks and dried sand, \u201cguess that does it for looking for someone to help\u201d Fuli stated looking forward to going back to the lion guard den, making her way back wasn\u2019t going to be hard as she begun to make her way toward that way. \u201cOh no please help me\u201d someone yelled hoping someone to hear them, Fuli didn\u2019t exactly know who this person was but they needed help and she was there to provide this help, Fuli rushed over as fast as she could to find out who was asking for help and why they were so distraught over whatever was holding them there. Closer and closer Fuli got to the source of the yells for help, scanning the area for anything that would seem to be out of the ordinary to her the young cheetah finally found the source of the sounds of help, it was what seemed to be some kind of bird it, \u201care you hurt, I\u2019m here to help\u201d Fuli stated proudly standing a distance away from whatever kind of bird this way. The closer she got to the bird the more she begun to realize that this wasn\u2019t a bird that she had seen before as it seemed almost like it was made of straw, before she could see the rest of this bird that cried for help something or someone had knocked her out not even knowing what happened with the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwaking from her slumber that was induced by some one there wasn\u2019t anything around her to stick out where exactly she was, \u201chow did I get myself into this\u201d she wondered circling this large cave that Fuli found herself in, not even knowing how to get out all the young cub thought of was to start climbing out pf this unknown place, \u201cI cant let you do that my dear Fuli, my associates made a great effort to get you here\u201d a smug hyena stated looking at his prize as she tried to climb the ledge. \u201cJanja I thought you would pull something like this, my friends will come to get me\u201d Fuli hissed at her captor with hatred of this plan he had cooked up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry my dear I will take good care of you\u201d Janja stated as\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rocks seemed too steep for some one of her size and stature to climb it was too narrow and slippery for some one who was built for speed to maneuver through, it would seem though the hyenas that looked up to Janja as their leader didn\u2019t have any trouble getting in and out of the massive cave system that they called home, she didn\u2019t know how and idiot like Janja got the upper hand on her but it was all said and done she just now needed to escape from Janja clan\u2019s grasp, all eyes were on Fuli, it was enough to make her skin crawl with how many Hyenas looked at her like she was a meal waiting to be devoured, \u201cnow that we have you the lion guard will fall into place, but we all have an idea to make you less likely to run away, and hey I\u2019m sure you love what we all have plans for your I know the ladies will love to pamper you\u201d Janja chuckled moving away from the high cliff that he and his goons occupied, Fuli just wondered how an idiot like Janja could outwit her in such a way that there was nothing that she could see that could be exploited for her own benefit. \u201cI have to get out of here and tell Kion about how smart Janja has been with this plan, we need to be ready for his new clever demeanor\u201d Fuli though eyes darted around the cave the light that shown from the skylight that led to the outside of the system of winding passages seemed to be her best bet for the moment. Beginning the long and arduous climb to the top was starting to look like it was no small feat for her to complete the rocks were very smooth, Fuli had a hard time getting up them with every new foothold she acquired she lost three it begun to look like this was a losing battle for Fuli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, boss shouldn\u2019t we like stop her from climbing up, if she uh succeeds then Kion will come and beat us again\u201d Nne asked his usual dumb worried smirk set upon his face unflinching like it was stuck there, \u201cNaw, she will never get up here its hard enough for us hyenas to climb that rock wall no way a cheetah could its too slippery for her\u201d Janja retorted to his underling with confidence that he was making the right decision when it came to his statement, there was just something that seemed like he was aware of that Fuli wasn\u2019t and it annoyed her to no end, \u201coh it looks like the ladies are back with your first meal of many\u201d he chuckled, moving away from the cliff-side away from the view of Fuli. Sliding down the rocks it seemed futile for her to try this way, hearing something was coming through the cave system that was behind her the smell of it was of various meats all from all around the Serengeti. Fuli was confused by this as knowing how the hyena's usually only thought of themselves especially Janja and his clans there had to be at least a dozen different kinds of carcass being pulled by some hyenas on a makeshift cart all this meat made Fuli wondering what Janja actually had up his sleeve when it came to dealing with Fuli seeing all the meat being presented to her only made her wondering more about the intention of her captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning the girls begun to pounce upon Fuli, with no context of what was happening to her Fuli began to struggle to get free from the grips of the two or three hyenas that pinned her down, the sounds of the rest ripping pieces off of the various meats could be heard from the corner where the carcasses were placed, \u201coh I get it they just didn\u2019t want me to eat their food as it was them who captured all the food in the first place, I wouldn\u2019t have eaten it anyways I already had lunch before Janja\u2019s scheme got me into this situation anyways\u201d Fuli though trying to rationalize the reason why she was being held down by these girls. \u201cdon\u2019t worry it will be all over soon\u201d one of them chuckled, what did this mean exactly Fuli wondered not knowing that her question would be answered soon. Like a conga line of food all the hyena\u2019s begun to line line up food in mouth to be fed into her mouth, seeing this strange line up only made the young cheetah fearful about what was going to happen to her, struggling to get free from her captors seemed impossible but she had to try it was her only way. Not knowing if her plan would even work all she knew is that she didn\u2019t want any part of what these hyenae were thinking about what they were going to do to her, even if it was going to be a feeble attempt Fuli would do anything to escape.</span></div></div>",

Mouths full of bits of meat from the carcass that they had just captured, glaring with intent at Fuli only made the cub that more comfortable, the smell of blood wafted through the cave, the glares the female hyenas were giving her only made Fuli more uncomfortable about the situation she found herself in. Janja just looked down at his clan circling the Cheetah, like a pair of vultures ready to strike they were all in position to enact the marvelous plan that he had running through his head, sure he knew that it was going to take more than what he had at the moment to fully realize it, but this was something he was willing to sacrifice to put this snobby cheetah in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHope you enjoy your first meal of many, Fuli\u201d chuckled Janja in his typical hyena fashion, giving a nod to what seemed like the leader of all the females that were stuck in the pit with Fuli, wicked grin plastered on the leader\u2019s face, she chuckled stated coyly \u201chave fun girls make sure she is very well fed.\u201d Before Fuli could get a word in edge wise meat was being shoved into her gaping maw, taken aback by the brutal shoving that the female hyenas started Fuli scared at what they were doing begun to struggle to be released from her confinement of being on the ground. Breathing began to become a struggle her saliva mixed with the chunks of meat shoved into her mouth made a thick like gravy substance, Fuli had two options either she swallow the meat or die from choking to death on the meat. With a hard filled \u201cGulp\u201d sound coming from her only made the hyenas laugh that annoying laugh that they always murmured from their lips, laughing at how Fuli struggled to eat the meat that was in her mouth it was hilarious to them, this was only to continue for Fuli there wasn\u2019t going to be any kind of escape for the young cheetah this was all she was going to know if Janja had anything to say about her current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One after another more hyenas ripped off pieces of meat from the dead gazelle only for it end up in Fuli\u2019s stomach, she tried to resist their constant feedings, closing her mouth in defiance of whatever Janja had planned for her seemed like the only way she could stop the barrage her stomach was getting. Already bloated from meat that was forced into her stomach there was no way she could eat any more food, that was just something that the hyenas just ignored as meat was always near Fuli\u2019s mouth to be shoved in without warning, Fuli wondered if Janja was trying to murder her by making her explode, if this was the case then Fuli wasn\u2019t going to go down fighting it. She always like to be alone scouting the area for the lion guard but this time it really bit her in the butt, all she could do was be as tight-lipped as she could be, struggling back and forth did nothing to alleviate her current situation \u201cjust give up my dear your not escape, just accept our hospitality and enjoy your self\u201d the female hyena said circling Fuli looking at her at every angle enjoying the new bloated look that Fuli was having. Tears began to mist from the cheetah\u2019s eyes she didn\u2019t know if the lion guard would come for her all she knew was it was becoming more and more difficult for her to keep her mouth shut, the hyenas slowly but surely begun to open her mouth for more meat to be shoved down her throat by a patiently waiting chuckling hyena to finish her mission given to her by Janja. </span></div></div>",
