He was wearing a long, white robe with long sleeves and a silver chain with a cross around his neck, which he thought was really cool because it also made him look a little bit like a priest. He almost wished he could wear the robe a little longer but he knew he had to remove it as soon as mass was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is what Joshua looks like:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/images/item_id/1915613-Joshua-Almighty\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/images/item_...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the people started leaving the sanctuary, Josh walked into the bathroom to change when he saw a bright light before him. Then, another boy materialized before him, wearing a brown robe with a rope tied around his waist. The boy was short, he looked around 10 years old and had black hair and he began to speak to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Josh. I see you like to be the altar boy. That's very good. I'm going to give you my powers for one cosmic day.\" the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Who are you?\" Josh asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s a cosmic day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come to worship me during mass every Sunday. From now on, people will come to mass and they will worship you instead!\" the boy responded. \u201cA cosmic day can be anywhere from five minutes to a hundred years!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Josh replied. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am God, but you will be God from now on, while I sleep for one cosmic day.\" the boy said, as he placed his hands on Josh's shoulders. \"You will now have all my knowledge, all my wisdom and all my powers. You're in charge of the universe, Josh. Everything you say will happen. Every one of your commands will be carried out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy with black hair disappeared, leaving Josh alone in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was 10 years old, he had blond hair and blue eyes and he was 5 feet tall. He was God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh walked out of the bathroom, he saw Father Williams, who lead the mass just a few minutes before. The Father asked Josh if he could take off his robe and place it in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, I would like to keep my robe a little longer than today...\" Josh sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Williams suddenly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Josh. Keep the robe as long as you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was astonished. The priest had never allowed that before! Josh then walked around and talked to people, suddenly knowing the names of every single person who was there, even the visitors!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Josh waved goodbye to the priest and the group of people talking to him, he thought to himself, \"How do I know everyone's names like that? I've never met any of these people before!! If that boy that appeared to me really is God...\" Walking down the path from the church to the sidewalk, he looked for something to test out, to see if he really did have those powers.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the parking lot, he recognized Mrs. Reynolds slowly walking out to her car. Josh liked Mrs. Reynolds a lot; she was a sweet old lady who lived four doors down from his family, and would come over once a week to chat with Josh's mom, usually bringing cookies or some other baked goods. His mother had once explained to him, \"Mr. Reynolds passed away about the time you were born, and Mrs. Reynolds didn't have any other family, so she decided to adopt the entire block as her family.\" Every day she would visit four or five houses to check in and catch up on what was going on, and she seemed to show real interest in everyone's lives, never gossiping or talking about people behind their backs, but always remembering even the smallest detail of what someone had told her. Even with all that, she still found a way come to church three times a week, always attentive and reverent. As far as Josh was concerned, she was a saint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Josh,\" Mrs. Reynolds called out as he started walking beside her. \"Excellent service today, as always. You looked especially smart and handsome in your robe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed a little, happy for the compliment. \"Thanks, Mrs. Reynolds,\" he said. \"It was great to see ya at church today. I'm glad you enjoyed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glowed as her wrinkly cheeks it up in a smile. \"Oh, I've gotten enough enjoyment out of life as it is. I just love seeing the Creator express himself through young people like you. He has a plan and a purpose for you, even if you don't know what that is yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Josh thought, \"she is more right with that than she knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said goodbye and walked over to her car, Josh's smile began to fade. The old car looked like it had seen better days. The right fender was mangled and falling off, and the headlight above it had been smashed in. \"Gee,\" Josh thought, \"she deserves better than that.\" His eyes lit up as he realized something. \"And I can give it to her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened the door, Josh quickly kneeled down and placed his hand on the twisted piece of metal. As he did so, he suddenly saw the world change around him in a flash. The sky darkened and the church had disappeared. He quickly realized he was experiencing a vision, as he couldn't turn his head in either direction. Mrs. Reynolds's car was now parked in the driveway in front of her house. Josh watched in horror as two teenagers walked up to the car holding a baseball bat. Snickering, they swung the bat back and hit the headlight, sending shards of glass flying. Again and again they banged it, until the fender was bent completely out of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh snapped back to reality, a new sense of determination on his face. He focused on the fender, and as he did so, he felt a slight tingling sensation flow through it. As he watched, wide-eyed, the fender straightened back out and became whole again, affixing itself back to the rest of the car. The glass in the headlight reappeared, after a few seconds looking as good as new.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled. \"That's much better.\" As Mrs. Reynolds started the engine, he quickly stood up and stepped back. He saw the headlights come on, and after a few seconds, the window rolled down and Mrs. Reynolds stuck her head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that right headlight working now?\" When Josh nodded, Mrs. Reynolds laughed. \"It's been out for nearly a year, and now it suddenly starts working again! God does provide, if you're patient enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled and waved as she drove off. \"He sure does,\" he said aloud, as he thought about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Josh breathed deeply, taking in the warm spring air, he noticed a boy around his own age sitting on one of the benches in a small grassy area between the church entrance and the parking lot. The boy was a scrawny, short kid, several inches shorter than than Josh, with red hair, pale skin, and lots and lots of freckles. He didn't remember ever having seen this boy before, at church or anywhere else, but the name Caleb suddenly appeared in his mind. \"There's that omniscience at work again,\" he smiled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked closer to the boy, but was overcome with a sudden feeling of despair, sadness, and inner turmoil. He glanced over at Caleb, who was looking down at the ground as he swung his feet back and forth below the bench. \"Something is troubling this boy a great deal,\" Josh realized. He decided to go investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the bench, he stood in front of Caleb. \"Hi,\" he said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-haired boy avoided eye contact with Josh, still looking down at his feet. \"Hey,\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat down on the bench next to him. \"I've never seen you at church before. Are you new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy turned slightly away from Josh, apparently unwilling to talk to a stranger. Josh breathed in slightly, closing his eyes. He could tell the boy was in pain, but how could he find out more about him and help if he didn't speak? Then he remembered the vision of Mrs. Reynolds's car being vandalized. \"I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked for a way to touch the boy without being too obvious. Stretching and reaching out his hand casually along the top of the bench, Josh brushed it against the side of Caleb's shoulder. Instantly, he saw a flash, and then stood inside a plainly decorated bedroom in what looked to be a small, neglected house. Caleb was lying face-down on the bed, crying softly into his pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door flung open, a dirty, unshaven man coming into the room. Josh could detect a strong smell of alcohol coming from the man, and he staggered up to the bed, obviously very drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whatddya doin' cryin' there like a--a BABY!\" The unpleasant man sneered at Caleb. \"Just like yer stupid mother. Dontcha two apreshate whatcha I do fer you? I's work my hands to the millbone fer ya slobs, and this is the thanks I getch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb jumped off of the bed, his face red and streaked with tears, an incredible, passionate anger building. \"Don't you dare talk about my mom that way, you drunk!\" He clenched his hand into a fist, pulling it back and swinging it at the man's stomach. It hit with a soft thud, knocking him back but only momentarily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drunk man's sneer became a mean-spirited grin. He lunged for Caleb, grabbing his shirt collar with one hand and slapping the boy in the face with the other. \"Howdja like that, you li'l ingrate!\" He hit Caleb again, throwing him back down on the bed. \"That's whadja git for talkin' back to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb glared up at the man looming above him, still fiercely defiant despite the beating he had just received. \"I wish my mom had never met you! I wish... I wish...\" His voice trailed off as he started tearing up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh noticed that Caleb was looking down at a framed photograph on his bedside table of a handsome, well-built man dressed in a Marine Corps uniform. Sitting in front of the photo was a small medal on a ribbon. that Josh quickly identified as a Purple Heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chortle escaped from the man's lips as he saw what the boy was looking at. \"Your daddy? He's sleepin' ina shallow grave in Afg-- Afgani-(hic)-stan. Wishin's not gonna bring 'em back! Stupid kid.\" He continued to laugh as he walked out of the room down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blinked, and he was back in front of the church. He looked over at Caleb, nearly in tears after seeing the boy's incredibly sad past. \"What can I even possibly do for you, Caleb...\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't really intend for the boy to hear him, but Caleb turned around, a shocked look on his face. \"H-how do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took a deep breath and tried to smile. \"It's a long story, I guess. I can tell you if you want. Let's just say I want to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me? With what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked straight into his eyes, seeing and feeling the hurt in Caleb's soul but also knowing there was a strong-minded and intelligent young man yearning to break free. He made up his mind. \"I'm gonna you become happy again, Caleb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean?\" Caleb looked at Josh uneasily, definitely apprehensive but with a flicker of faith and hope in his eyes. Josh remembered the passage that Father Williams read that very morning where Jesus said faith the size of a mustard seed could move mountains. \"Well, I don't think I need to go <i>that</i> far,\" Josh thought, \"but I think I know what I need to do...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh did not want to alter the time-space continuum by changing the course of history. A smart young boy keen to detail, Josh remembered this fact when his older brother Tom was talking about it at home one day. So, Josh knew what he had to do. Instead of bringing Caleb's father back to life, just as the other God did with Jesus, Josh decided to alter Caleb's genetic structure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have made a decision. I know how I am going to help you,\" explained Josh, standing up. \"Can you please stand up, Caleb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...sure.\" Caleb got up slowly. Then, Josh closed his eyes and stuck his hand out towards Caleb, but not yet touching him. All of a sudden, Caleb was levitating, floating two feet above the ground. He noticed that Josh was concentrating all of his brain power on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Caleb noticed a wonderful sensation pulsating through his bones, muscles, and veins. A bright, blue light began to shine around him, glowing like the moon. The sensation became much more noticeable as it spread throughout his entire body. At first, he thought it was nothing. But then, something amazing started to happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb felt incredibly strange and happy simultaneously. He glanced down. His legs began to vibrate. His bones erupted with a sharp but soothing pain as they got longer. They got so long that they reached the ground below, making him a whopping 6'4\" tall, which is very tall for a ten year-old. With the newly added growth, his abdomen got longer making him appear very skinny, which was all about to change soon. Then, his feet cramped. They grew out if his shoes, shooting out quickly, tearing his one pair of dress shoes. They quickly surpassed the single digits range and stopped growing at size 14 feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, the tingling sensation moved upwards towards his legs. His legs began to expand with newly formed muscle. His calf muscles quadrupled in size, making them as big as softballs. His quads also quadrupled in size, resembling thick sheets of metal. His shorts, due to his increased height, went a quarter of his way to his knees, but luckily, his boxers grew with him. His legs resembled those of professional cyclists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation kept moving up. His torso became larger to support the body that was about to come. The gut of his belly seemed to melt away. Replacing his flab was an 8-pack of abs, hard as steel. They were so chiseled and effect that they looked as if they were cut by Michaelangelo on a block of marble for a statue. Then, his chest began to widen, forming a little chasm between his nipples. His pectorals began to inflate like large water balloons, but they weren't squishy. They were as hard as rock. They became so large that they obstructed his view of Josh who was supposedly standing in front of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb became incredibly excited, but the deed was not done just yet. His back and arms had yet to be developed. His shoulders widened so that they were the same distance away as his legs so as to balance his body. His back became incredibly toned and muscular, similar to those of professional bodybuilders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part of his body to be changed were his biceps. Before being changed, they were very short and thin. But, when the blue glow and the tingling sensation reached his arms, they began to expand. His biceps became so big that they resembled giant boulders, capable of crushing someone's head if it came between them. Caleb's hands then doubled in size, becoming larger than a basketball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Josh slightly changed the appearance of Caleb's face. Josh erased some of Caleb's freckles with the waving of his hand as well as got rid of all the acne. He then gave Caleb a chiseled chin and left everything else alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the transformation, the blue glow vanished. Caleb was given full control over his bodily movements. He was now able to jump high into the air, lift trucks with ease, and run with incredible speed and agility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb took a few steps back and looked down at Josh. Josh looked up to his new muscular friend and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! This is so freaking cool!\" Called bellowed. His voice had gotten considerable deeper due to the added testosterone in his system. He bent down on one knee and shook hands with Josh. Caleb's hand was so much bigger than Josh's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem, my gargantuan friend. I hope you put these muscle to good use. I know that you re pure of heart and will do just that,\" replied Josh with a calm voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb then...</span></div></div>",

Josh, WAIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stopped and calmly turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hulking boy then wrapped his giant, muscular arms around Josh, completely enveloping the smaller boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Josh...\" Caleb said, as tears rolled from his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Caleb pulled back, and stared at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... God?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Josh replied quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh... Do you have a younger brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Josh replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm bigger than you, but... Can I... Can I be your brother?\" Caleb sobbed. \"I love mom, but... I can't bear to go home anymore... I can't live with my stepfather anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Come with me to my house first...\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh snapped his fingers and him and Caleb appeared standing before Josh's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josh opened then door and allowed Caleb inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's mother was home from working at the clothing store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom... This is Caleb! Can he stay over at our house for awhile?\" he asked his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Josh... No problem...\" his mother, Julie, replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh and Caleb walked into Josh's bedroom where Josh immediately changed then closet into a second, even larger bedroom with a bed, a desk, closet space and another bathroom! There was a dresser filled with clothes which fit Caleb as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josh looked up at Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to be my big bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Caleb smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... From now on... You're my brother... FOR REAL!\" Josh ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb changed again. His face began to resemble a little bit like that of Josh. The only difference was that Caleb was just over a foot taller than Josh. But his face, eyes and hair resembled Josh's face, hair and eyes now. They looked like brothers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Your name is now Caleb Handy!\" Josh grinned. \"You're my big bro... Even though I'm also 10 years-old! But you're much bigger than me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, little bro!\" Caleb cheered, as he hugged his little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you guys! Come and eat!\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mom!\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, mom!\" Caleb added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy to have a BIG BRO like you!\" Josh smiled, looking up at his hulking brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just wondered what to do next...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would solve the problem, but Josh wondered if Caleb's life would be any better that way. The media attention a 6 foot 6 inch tall 10 year old would get would probably hurt Caleb more than help him. Josh, seeing Caleb's soul, could tell the boy didn't like a tremendous amount of attention. Also, Caleb might not take to his newfound enormous body well. The power could possibly destroy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking him 18 would require a lot of fiddling with the timeline. Josh could fiddle with the timeline as much as he wanted to. But would it solve the problem and not make even bigger problems? He'd loose his dad later on in life and it would affect him differently. If he lost his dad at 13 as opposed to 5, Caleb might turn to drugs. He'd have a place of his own, but he'd be a drugie. Josh knew that wouldn't help at all. It was trading one evil for another, and the other would be Caleb's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left a third option: Bringing Caleb's dad back from the dead... or actually making it so he wouldn't die in the first place. That'd be easiest; not that it mattered. But now that Josh thought about it, it was the best thing for Caleb. Josh nodded to himself. He'd bring back Caleb's dad from the dead. Josh thought of how he'd do it and then did it. It wasn't anything glamorous or crazy like a column of lightning, but the mountain had been moved by the faith in Caleb's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Josh answered Caleb. Josh pointed across the street, \"That's what I mean,\" he said with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short redhead looked in the direction Josh indicated and saw something wonderful. Walking across the street was a man dressed in GI military cloths with a backpack over his shoulder. He was the man Josh had seen in Caleb's memory. He was well over 6 feet tall and had red hair like his son. Even in adulthood, he had freckles on his face. Caleb's face lit up as bright as the sun. He looked at Josh in awe before running forth. \"Daddy!!\" Caleb cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's dad caught his 10-year-old son in a loving embrace long overdue. \"Caleb!\" he said, \"I'm home, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How, daddy?\" asked Caleb. The young boy looked up at his towering father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, son,\" said Caleb's dad, \"what matters now is I'm back.\" Josh knew. Caleb's dad had been captured instead of killed. The military had listed him as KIA because no terror organization had come forth claiming him in their possession and they never found his remains, taking it that they'd been buried under the sand. Caleb's dad eventually escaped and returned to the States, but word hadn't gotten to Caleb or his mother... until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about... Marty?\" asked Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been arrested, son,\" answered the tall red haired man, \"We won't be bothered by him anymore and I have more good news! I've bought a nice little house in town, much better then where you're living now. The military's discharged me and an old high school friend of mine hired me. We'll be together, Caleb, my son, a real family again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb smiled brightly at this. Josh could feel the overwhelming joy coming from Caleb. It made Josh feel happy that he did something wonderful for someone. He smiled as he watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't introduce me to your friend,\" said the man suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Caleb, \"this is... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh,\" said Josh. He shook the man's hand and caught a glimpse of the man's life. He was a good man and a good dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Josh,\" said the man with a kind smile. He turned to Caleb, \"Ready to head back to the house, Caleb? Your mom doesn't have too much to move, but it is a good lot.\"</span></div></div>",

You wanna get out of hauling all the stuff from the old house to the new one.\" He laughed kindly and hugged his son endearingly. Josh knew there was more to it than that, Caleb wanted to get to the bottom of this strange occurence. \"Alright. There's not that much stuff, we'll manage. Go ahead and play with your friend, but be home for dinner. I'm taking you two out, you deserve it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, daddy!\" cried Caleb as he hugged his father once more, \"I'm so happy you're not dead. You've always been the best daddy in the world. I love you daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, son,\" said the red haired man. After a while, he left for Caleb's house to help Caleb's mom with the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Caleb's father had gone, Caleb turned finally to Josh. He wasn't doubtful or angry or suspicious. He was in awe. \"You did that, didn't you, Josh?\" asked Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did do that,\" replied Josh honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... how?\" asked Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh approached the next sentance carefully. He wasn't sure how Caleb would take this... \"Well, basically,\" said Josh, \"I've been given the powers of God for a Cosmic Day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Excuse me?\" asked Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't want to say that he was God. Josh thought that sounded really selfish to be perfectly honest. He wanted to tell the absolute truth and he did as far as he was concerned. \"God gave me His powers to use for a Cosmic Day,\" repeated Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you joshin' me, Josh?\" asked Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't help but giggle at this for a moment. \"No, I'm telling the truth. You believed in me, Caleb. You believed just a little that I could help you and I did, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb looked at Josh, his mouth agap. There was no room for doubt about it. Caleb had seen his father's body and grave when he'd died. None of that was a joke or pretend because they couldn't find his father's real body. This was it, the real deal. Josh had really made it so Caleb's father had never died. \"Oh wow,\" said Caleb, \"that's truly amazing, Josh! Thank you for helping me. It was truly wonderful, what you did. I'm honestly eternally grateful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Caleb. It was my pleasure. I'm glad you're healing and I'm glad I made you happy again,\" said Josh with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish there was something I could do in return, though,\" said Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just seeing you happy is enough for me,\" said Josh honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'd like to do more,\" said Caleb. He sat on the bench again and thought deeply. Josh could see Caleb's great deep mind at work, his essence so pensive and calm. \"I know!\" said the little redhead as he jumped up. \"Let's be friends, Josh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled. It'd be nice to have a friend. \"That'd be awesome, Caleb!\" he said with a smile. Caleb grinned. \"And I'm going to go even further. Caleb, I'm going to make you an archangel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Angel?\" asked Caleb excitedly, \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for the Cosmic Day; as long as I barrow God's powers. You have a good heart and a good soul, Caleb, I trust that you'll be an awesome right hand man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'll do my best!\" said Caleb determinedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled at this. \"Alright... here it goes...\" And he did it. Again nothing over-the-top like a bolt of lightning. \"There, you're my Archangel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb looked up at Josh and then looked at the pair of white feathery wings on his shoulders. He'd gained some omnipotence and knew that he could choose who saw or didn't see his wings. Right now only Josh and Caleb could see Caleb's wings. \"Wow...\" he said, \"imagine that, Caleb, the scrawny little redhead, an Archangel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're much more than a scrawny little redhead, Caleb,\" said Josh, \"Don't deny your worth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb looked up at Josh. \"That means a lot to me, thank you,\" he said, his voice calm and pensive for a ten-year-old. His voice picked up and his eyes lit up once more as he said, \"So, what are we gonna do now? We've got the whole afternoon!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all happened in a split second. The two giants known as Titan and Jason, began to shrink at a alarming speed. Their height finally stopped at 5 feet 9 inches, which Josh knew to be the average height for the  typical male. Josh, stopping both Titan and Jason\u2019s movements, took a long look at his handiwork, and quite frankly, did not like what he saw. Despite their height Titan and Jason still where quite muscular, this would not stand. Josh wanted them to feel what it was like to be helpless, to be in the position of the weak and powerless, so with great merriment Josh decreed that the two bullies would lose their strength, they would lose their athletic bodies, and as if by magic both Titan and Jason became as skinny as a rail, and as thin as a dinner mint. Josh Smiled as he looked at the two boys who once ruled the neighborhood using nothing but their unstoppable might. Those days were over, Titan and Jason where nothing more than regular kids, regular kids that were still apart of the football team, the wrestling team, plus weights of course. Josh knew that without their muscle, without their height, both Titan and Jason would not be able to keep up with their sports. In the end the sports that Titan and Jason loved so much would be nothing but hell for both of the boys. To make matters worse, or better in Josh\u2019s case, both Titan and Jason had a football game today. Josh would make time to see it of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh snapping his fingers unfreezes both Titan and Jason, who where still looking at Josh with menacing eyes. It appeared to josh that the two boy did not yet realize their new predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Titan says, looking at Josh with eyes as wide as the church doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you get bigger?\u201d Titan asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan and Jason look at Josh with a great amount of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Jason screams as he looks at Titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Titan screams as he looks at Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan what happened to you?!\u201d Jason yells as he continues to stare at Titan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? Do what happened to you?!\u201d Titan yells staring at Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh roles his eyes \ud83d\udc40. Titan and Jason where not the smartest boys around. Josh knew that he was going to have to give them a little push in the right direction. Josh conjures up a 5ft puddle of crystal clear water \ud83d\udca7 a few feet behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys should probably look at your reflections.\u201d Josh says as he takes a step to his right, revealing the 5ft puddle in all of its glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys without wasting anymore time sprint over to the puddle that shined when the suns rays stirred its watery surface. Titan and Jason get down on their knees as they gaze into the water, looking at their reflections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude what happened to us?\u201d Titan asked as he let a few whimpers escape his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know man, we look so weak and helpless.\u201d Jason says as he rubs his thin arms, and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan and Jason\u2019s heart started to break as they looked at their reflections without pause or rest. They, who where once handsome, and had every teenage girl drooling over them, now had average looks, no different than josh\u2019s looks. Titan and Jason, no longer able to bear their shame shut their eyes tight, as tears run down their cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walks over to the teary eyed boys, feeling a little bad for the plight he had created for them, but deep down Josh knew that he had made the right decision, Titan and Jason we\u2019re getting everything they deserved, and josh wanted both of the bullies to know exactly that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm afraid that tears are not going to solve anything.\u201d Josh says as he stand a few feet away from the weeping boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys stop crying as they both look at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you know, you bastard?\u201d Jason says with anger in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know a lot, I\u2019m the one who did this to you after all.\u201d Josh says with a little smirk \ud83d\ude0f. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY, you did this to use?\u201d Titan says with surprise evident in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I did.\u201d Josh says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you little, Change us back now!\u201d Titan says as he stands up on his feet and rushes towards Josh with his right fist in the air, ready to punch \ud83e\udd1c his target. Little did he know who that fist was being directed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh seeing the fist flying right towards his face, stands as still as a statue, with a bored look on his face. Josh wasn\u2019t a fighter, the amount of fights that he had been in, in his whole entire life, he could count on one hand, therefor josh was a little surprised that he wasn\u2019t scared even a little, it was almost like he had been in this situations before. Titans fist moved very slowly, as it made its way towards Josh. Josh with blinding speed catches the fist with his right hand, and holds it tightly, as if it were priceless treasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go of me twerp.\u201d Titan says as he pulls and pulls, trying to break away from Josh's iron clad grip, that seemed to keep on getting tighter and tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming man!\u201d Jason yells as he runs towards Josh, ready to attack with his fool force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stares at Jason with eyes as cold as ice, and as sharp like daggers. Jason stops moving once again, not because Josh had paralyzed him, it because he was to afraid to move. Jason felt cold and empty, as he stared into Josh\u2019s eyes. Jason wasn\u2019t the only one who felt this overwhelming force. Titan could also feel it, his body not being able to stop shaking as he looked at Josh, like he was looking at a monster, a monster born from evil. Titan and Jason for a brief moment could have sworn that they saw a skeleton behind them, breathing down their necks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018\u2018Am I going to die\u2019\u2019 the two boy thought as they looked at Josh with fear in their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs josh stared at the two boys, he did not know that for a split nano second his eyes had glowed a crimson red, a crimson red like blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh soon realizes that the boys had stopped moving and soon starts to relax, as he lets go of Titans hand. Upon releasing Titans hand, Titan falls to the ground, his eyes still locked on Josh. Jacob remained standing, even though it took all of his strength to do so<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what you guys deserve, don\u2019t ever forget you guys did this to yourself.\u201d Josh says as he starts to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait please their has to be something that we can do to return to our regular forms.\u201d Titan pleads as he gets on his knees as if he were going to beg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stops walking as he thinks about Titans words. Josh had grown up believing that people can change for the better. God doesn\u2019t forsake people, god sure as hell didn\u2019t forsake him, so did he have a right to forsake other people. Josh turns around and looks at Titan and Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What does Josh decide?) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh finally understood the meaning to those words as he looked the two bullies, known as Titan and Jason, in the eyes, eyes that revealed a whole entire story, to all those able to read them. A story of fear, anger, embarrassment, and yet hope, all of these feelings were made evident to Josh, and yet none of these emotions satisfied him, none of these emotions were what he was looking for. Yet Josh couldn\u2019t help his own feeling, emanating within him. He might in the future come to regret his decision, but still he wanted to give the two bullies a chance. Josh was a god fearing man after all, and wasn\u2019t this what god expected when it came to his children? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright I\u2019ll give you another chance.\u201d Josh says with a small smile, that manages to put both Titan and Jason at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Josh.\u201d Titan says, still on his knees, but with happiness bows his head in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea thank you josh, we\u2019ll do anything you ask of us, but please turn us back to normal.\u201d Jason say following Titans lead as he gets on his knees and bowing his head in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll turn you back to normal, but only if you both manage to pass my test.\u201d Josh says with a perky attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTest, what test?\u201d Titan asks with a determination, you never thought you would see from someone like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both boys listen carefully not wanting to miss even one word that came out of your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe test is simple, just prove to me that you both have changed for the better. Do this and I\u2019ll restore you both to your original forms.\u201d Josh says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys after hearing your condition, stare at each other for a few seconds before their eyes shift back to you with excitement fueling their sense of purpose, and a mutual goal giving them both the courage to move forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk that should be easy.\u201d Titans says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea very easy.\u201d Jason follows suite as he voices his own opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys merely saw this test as something to do, in order to pass the time. They didn\u2019t see it as a obstacle, but a steady path, that could be easily traversed. Only Josh knew better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo just tell us what we have to do in order to prove that we are changed people, in your eyes.\u201d Titans says with both hands on his head as he stares at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh closes his eyes in disappointment, it was just as he had expected. Both Titan and Jason didn\u2019t truly understand what this test was about, and yet josh still believed that they could succeed.  It if they were to succeed they would have to do so alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you know what you need to do Titan.\u201d Josh says with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking.\u201d Titan says, feeling a little worried. Jason shaking his head in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook you two, this is not new stuff. It is written down in books, scrolls, and even stone tablets. What I require from the both of you is not something hard or impossible, but something necessary.\u201d Josh says with a serious tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Josh can you at least give us a hint?\u201d Titan asks, the little bit of hope he had disappearing away, like water down a drain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, you boys are on your own. Do not disappoint me.\u201d Josh says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds josh was covered by a blinding white light that made both Titan and Jason turn away to shield their eyes from the lights harmful raise. The light like a ghost vanishes into thin air, and Titan and Jason soon realize that Josh along with the light is now no where to be found. Titan and Jason couldn\u2019t even begin to understand the phenomenon that had happened right in front of their eyes, but they didn\u2019t concern themselves with the supernatural occurrence. They had a test to pass, and a football game that was about to start in a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the boys know that josh had teleported himself on top of the school building, looking down on them like a bird of prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew that he was doing the right thing, giving both Titan and Jason a chance. Josh truly believed that everyone had the right to have the chance to change for the better, and right now he was giving the two most feared bullies in the neighborhood to do exactly that. Deep down josh wished he could say that, helping the two bullies change for the better was the only reason he decided to give them another chance. But to bad the truth was never that simple or easy. Josh thought back to the time he had engaged both Titan and Jason in a quick fight, grabbing Titans hand with ease, stopping Jason with nothing but a glare powerful enough to scare the most dangerous animal, and of course how all of this came so natural to him, like he had done it a thousand times before. Josh thought about all of these factors that had transpired between him and the two bullies, and quite frankly he was scared, scared not of fighting, or of putting those bullies in their place, but of his powers. Josh thinking back to when he had given Jason his death glare. Josh at that moment had felt it, something dark, something evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be possible, these powers come from god, and god is pure good. Isn\u2019t he?\u201d Josh asks a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Later at night) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Titan and Jason are inside the boys locker room, getting ready to play their football game. Both where still scrawny little kids, their teammates towering over them made that self evident. To both of the boys surprise no one had looked at them funny, nor where any of their teammates or even friends shocked to find both Titan and Jason shrunk to such weak and pathetic forms (thanks to Josh of course), instead everyone treated both Titan and Jason as if they where normal. But their was a new major difference. Titan and Jason where now the punching bags of the whole team, each of their teammates bullying them in one way or another. Titans and Jason had never been so humiliated in their whole entire lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe football game had finally started. It was the Black Hawks vs the Lion Backs, each school doing everything necessary to win. Josh sitting on the stands with hundreds of other parents and students watch as the seemingly bad game becomes worse. The Black Hawks that represented Josh\u2019s school were losing by a extreme large margin. They where down by 20 points and it was all because of two people. Titans and Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitans and Jason where making a mess out on the field. They kept on Dropping the Ball \ud83c\udfc8, getting passes intercepted by the other team, getting tackled very quickly, and even missing passes that were quite easy to make. Titans and Jason where the worse players that many people had Seen, and many people where left asking \u201cwhy hasn\u2019t the coach taken them out yet.\u201d The answer to this question was simple. Josh was manipulating events behind the scenes, making it so that both Titan and Jason got a lot of playing time to embarrass themselves. Josh hated to admit it but he was having fun making a fool out of the two bullies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now the forth Quarter of the foot ball game, and every one knew who the winner was going to be. The Black Hawks had only scored 5 points the whole game. To say that everyone was pissed was a understatement. Josh looking out onto the filled see\u2019s Titan with the ball running down the field with all of his strength, Jason right beside him for support. Josh had to hand it to the two boys, they had courage and spunk, to bad that wasn\u2019t what josh was looking for. The crowd cheered as Titan miraculously made his way down the field, he was so  Close to a  touchdown, not like it would change anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBang!\u201d Titans and Jason are tackled down to the ground by huge football players who completely dwarfed them in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd soon goes quit as everyone\u2019s hopes are completely crushed. Josh couldn\u2019t  help but wonder what Titan and Jason where thinking, so he decided to use his powers to read their minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan: \u201cI cant believe that this is happening to me, how could I fill so weak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: \u201cOh man I\u2019m so embarrassed, how am I supposed to show my face around school now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wasn\u2019t surprised to see how both of the bullies where only thinking about themselves, and it made Him a little angry to see how little they had changed. But then something happened, something that surprised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan: \u201cI wonder is this how, the people we messed with felt when we were picking on them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: \u201cDid I inflict this exact pain on other people?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Josh\u2019s surprise both titans and Jason\u2019s thoughts started to shift towards other people. Josh looking into the minds of both Titan and Josh could see images, images of the people both Titan and Jason had bullied over the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan: \u201cTo every person I\u2019ve bullied.....\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: \u201cTo every last person I\u2019ve hurt......\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan/Jason: \u201cIM SORRY.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had his mouth wide open, in surprise and shock.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh with content closes his eyes, and with a small smile on his face, nods his head in acceptance. The test had been passed, and both Titan and Jason had become better people because of their profound  realization. It wasn\u2019t all about them, other people no matter how small, no matter how weak, mattered, and now that they finally understood that, their was no longer any reason to torture them any further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh concentrates on both boys, wishing from the deepest depths of his heart that everything changed would be restored. Josh\u2019s eyes flutter open to reveal the golden glow that they both produced with great intensity. Powerful waves of golden energy envelope the whole field, covering every single person in a warm yet powerful embrace. Josh, the focal point of this other worldly phenomena look at both Titan and Jason with pride and joy, and let\u2019s out a small whisper as soft as a spring breeze, that echoes in the minds of both of the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue both Titan and Jason returned to their old  muscular selfs. The golden energy as well as Josh had completely disappeared with out a trace. Titan and Jason lying on the ground, look up at the night sky \ud83c\udf0c. The game was over their team had suffered a unbearable loss that would haunt the boys for the rest of their lives, and yet both boys felt content. Without a doubt they would remember this test and of course Josh as well who was their judge \ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2696\ufe0f,  jury, and yet their last hope. Soon both boys got up from off the grassy ground and started to walk towards the boys locker rooms to change and reflect on their past actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTitan.\u201d Jason says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea?\u201d Titans asks looking at Jason, who refused to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re assholes.\u201d Jason says bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea.\u201d Titans says with a little laugh \ud83d\ude02. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTitan.\u201d Jason says again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea?\u201d Titans responds, this time reverting his gaze away from Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to change.\u201d Jason says with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea.... me to buddy.\u201d Titans says as I\u2019d he where making a oath to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys shined with determination as they walked off the field to join their fellow teammates in the locker rooms. Little did both boys realize that they where being watched by Josh who was floating right above the Football field. Josh thought about the test he has subjected both Titan and Jason to. Deep down Josh wasn\u2019t sure if he was doing the right thing, but seeing the results reassured him that maybe he had made the right call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess it is time to go home and get some rest.\u201d Josh says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost  immediately after finishing his sentence, josh is covered by a blinding white light, and disappears from above the football field and reappears inside his room. Josh lived in a two story house, that had three bedrooms, and two bathrooms, one up stares and one down stares. Josh lived here with his single mother who\u2019s name was Bethany Strange, who was not home at the moment. Bethany was working late tonight and therefore at the moment Josh had the entire house to himself. Their where two bedrooms up stairs. Josh\u2019s room was the room closet to the bathroom, while the other room remained empty. Bethany\u2019s room was downstairs right next to the stair case, with the door completely closed. Bethany always had a habit of closing her doors when ever she left the house. To this day Josh never understood why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh in his room hops on top of his bed, with both of his hands folded behind his head. Josh lost in thought stares at the ceiling. Josh couldn\u2019t believe how strange today had been. Today was the day that Josh had essentially become god. But their was still one lingering question that plagued Josh\u2019s mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d Josh thought out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question would continue to echo inside of Josh\u2019s head, until he finally fell asleep \ud83d\ude34. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Miles away in a open field, covered in lush grass) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was dark, and was filled with a myriad of stars \u2728. The sound of crickets, and the chirping of birds filled the air, as if they were singing to celebrate this lovely night that the full moon eliminated from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe singing abruptly stops and the whole falls under a ghostly silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground begins to rumble. The wind scatters in all directions, blowing through the grass lands, and through the many trees that stood in the distance, with strength that seemed to only increase as time passed. The night sky soon begins to brighten as something falls from the very heavens. Something on fire \ud83d\udd25 as if it where a miniature sun. If one where to see it, they would confuse it as some kind of meteor that was about to make contact with the earth. It was no meteor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive shockwave envelops the whole grassy area, uplifting the ground destroying countless trees, and turning any living animal to ash. Smoke and dust filled the air, making it almost impossible to see anything. Soon the smoke and dust vanish to reveal a sight most would believe impossible. The field that was once covered in grass was now completely destroyed, the very ground was singed as if it had been incinerated by a super powerful flame thrower. Their where hardly any threes still standing, and those that where still upright had no leafs left on their branches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the field rested a massive crater that covered a large majority of the field. In the middle stood a women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women had long red hair tied in a ponytail, that came down to her legs. The women had flawless white skin that glistened in the moonlight. The women also had azure blue eyes that made her look almost other worldly. The women wore battle armor that made her look like a Amazonian warrior. The women had sliver battle gauntlets that covered her arms, silver chest armor, sliver shin guards that came up to her knees leaving the rest of her legs bare, on top of the women\u2019s head was a sliver head band with a strange branding the rested in the middle, and at her side rested a sword with a golden hilt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women steps out of the crater and after doing so stand completely still, like a beautiful statue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to begin my mission.\u201d The women finally says after a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod I will find you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A voice that sent a chill down his spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Josh asks confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ASKED DID IT FEEL GOOD?\u201d The mysterious voice asks again with even more intensity than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looking around his dark surroundings could not see any signs of life, their was only a ever expanding darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid what feel good?\u201d Josh asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDID OT FEEL GOOD TO PUNISH THOSE MERE MORTALS.\u201d The voice says with a sign of happiness in its tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn\u2019t know what to say, where was this voice coming from and why did this voice make him feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it didn\u2019t feel good.\u201d Josh said with certainty in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH COME NOW DON\u2019T LIE, DIDNT IT FEEL GREAT TO PUT THOSE BULLYS IN THEIR PLACE, LIKE SOME KIND OF GOD.\u201d The voice once again speaks from the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I did what I had to do because it was right, in the name of god it was the right thing to do. I gave those bully\u2019s the chance to change their ways, to do good, because if I am a god, I wish to be a benevolent god.\u201d Josh says with a serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn\u2019t know who this voice emanated from but he would not let it change him, he stood his ground holding true to his ideals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU SPEAK WITH SUCH PRETTY WORDS, TO BAD THEY ARE WORDS HIDDEN IN LIES AND DECEIT.\u201d The voice says in mockery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it who are you, stop hiding in the shadows and face me!\u201d Josh shouts in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU WISH FOR ME TO REVEAL MYSELF, WELL ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS ASK.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole area becomes deathly quite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this to your liking?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turns around and sees something that completely shocks him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour, your me....\u201d josh says as he stares at a complete copy of himself, except this copy had a few changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe copy had pure black hair, unlike Josh\u2019s hair which was blond. The copies eyes where pitch black and it\u2019s skin was as white as snow. The copy wore delinquent black close which looked very awkward to Josh seeing as to how he was looking at his own copy wearing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m you.\u201d The copy says with a wicked smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf your god then I would be your anti- god.\u201d The copy says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk first of all I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a god, second of all what\u2019s a anti-god?\u201d Josh asks curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not important, what is important is that you better get used to your station in life, and you better get used to it quickly.\u201d The copy says turning his back from you, walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you really?\u201d Josh asks not trusting this copy, even for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will soon see little god when the time comes you will soon see, until then you need to be prepared. Their coming for you.\u201d The copy says with that creepy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s coming for........\u201d josh stops talking as his surrounding begin to shake rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?!\u201d Josh asks feeling startled \ud83d\ude2e. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like it\u2019s time for you to go.\u201d The copy says staring at josh with its dark eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning josh begins to fall into the abyss. Josh looking up sees his dark copy above him, getting further and further away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cContinue to survive my other self, survive until your body becomes.......\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh could no longer hear the copy as he grew further and further away from him. Soon the copy faded away in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh opens is eyes, staring at a ceiling that the suns rays illuminated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was all a dream.\u201d Josh says feeling a little relief. \u201cNothing but a dream.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gets out of bed and with a snap of his fingers a white t-shirt, and black jean pants appear on his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas it just a dream though?\u201d Josh asks himself thinking back to what had happened a few minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn\u2019t help but think that, that so called dream was a precursor of thing yet to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to get out of here.\u201d Josh says to himself <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing but a thought josh teleports to the neighborhood park. It was early in the morning so not a lot of people were at the park at the moment. Josh walks down a path that went straight through the park. Josh walks down the path thinking of his life, the powers he welded, and the dream he had last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did he mean when he said the they were coming?\u201d Josh asks no one in particular, thinking about the warnings his clone gave him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s coming?\u201d Josh asks very confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh still walking through the park sees something that breaks him out of his train of thought. Josh sees Titan and Jason cleaning Mrs. Reynolds car \ud83d\ude98. The car that was pretty beat up was now looking much better. Mrs. Reynolds was looking at the two boys with a smile on her face as she sits down on a wooden bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiles as he stares at the two old bullies with a sense of pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did the right thing.\u201d Josh thinks to himself as he thinks back to the dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did not feel good about what I did but it was still necessary.\u201d Josh thinks continue if his walk through the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!!!!!\u201d a huge explosion erupts throughout the park as something lands from the sky, lands right in front of Josh. Trees and chunks of rock and dirt go flying through the sky as the shock wave of the explosion throws Josh off his feet. Black smoke and dirt make it almost impossible for anyone to see anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the world is happening.\u201d Josh says looking at the explosion right before his eyes as a radiant light appear in the Epicenter. Josh's head was filled with questions, what was happening now? The only good thing right now was that their was no one around the area currently but that would soon change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passes the black smoke ant the wild dirt begins to disappear, and the light  soon begins to weaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh soon sees something in the middle of the explosion a women with red long hair that was in a ponytail. The women wore silver battle armor with a sword at her side. The women stood inside of a deep crater and as time passes her gaze shifts towards you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!!!!\u201d The women shouts with rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand on your two feet and begin to back away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrepare yourself devil, justice is here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god what now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know who this women was but you hope she wasn\u2019t going to be the one who takes your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To bad today was the day that, that would all change for Josh as a women with long red hair and sparkling sliver armor pointed a sword right at his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth the women was so beautiful to Josh, that Josh had almost forgot about the sword pointed right at his neck. Josh looking at the women see\u2019s that she had the most beautiful white skin that he had ever seen. The women\u2019s  hair was in a pony tail and was the longest hair that Josh had ever seen, for it went down all the way to her knees. The women smelled like a dozen flowers and gave off a welcoming aura that made people want to get close to her. Josh was no different as he took a step forward, walking right into the tip of the women\u2019s sword. Josh, feeling the cold tip of fine steel snaps out of his day dreaming, and looks at the sword with panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE, excuse me ma\u2019am.\u201d Josh says, making sure to be as polite as he possibly to the crazy women with the weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me, what have I done to deserve such treatment?\u201d Josh asks putting both. Hands up defensively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looking at the women sees her squint her eyes in suspicion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not try to deceive me fiend!\u201d The women yells with eyes filled with pure hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThou are obviously a demon sent to the world of men to spread your vile and deceit!\u201d The women says as she swings her sword towards Josh's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh quickly ducks down, dodging the sword and jumps back to gain distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease ma\u2019am calm yourself.\u201d Josh says trying to calm the women down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn\u2019t know what the lady meant when she said that he was a demon, nor did Josh know why the women was speaking so strangely but he knew he would find out soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThou is quick, but I am quicker demon!\u201d The women says as she speeds at Josh with blinding speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh only had a few seconds to react as the sword arch\u2019s towards his face. Josh quickly jumps in the air, just barely missing the silver sword, which makes contact with the hard ground. Josh floats in the air as a shock wave pushes against his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirt fills the air and the wind blows fiercely all around the area. It doesn\u2019t take long for the dust and dirt to clear and the wind to start to return to normal. Josh who\u2019s vision, no longer obstructed by the flying rubble sees the ground totally decimated, and the sword that caused all of the destruction didn\u2019t even have a little scratch on it. Josh knew at that moment that this women wasn\u2019t some kind of cause play person, no she was dead serious. She wanted to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThou has some skill.\u201d The women says with a small smile on her face as she looks at Josh with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave I, found a worthy opponent?\u201d The girl asks walking towards Josh who still floats in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoever you are, I ask that you please stop this.\u201d Josh says with worry in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease walk away, and remember that he who lives by the sword will die by the sword.\u201d Josh says hoping to stop a fight before it began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuoting the words of our lord, thou truly are foolish for a demon.\u201d The women says with a serious tone in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease we don\u2019t have to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold your tongue vile thing!!!\u201d The women screams cutting Josh off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExpect the judgement of thy lord, and perish into the light.\u201d The women says pointing her blade at Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh and the strange women look at each other for a few minutes and without warning, both move with lightning Speed. The women flys towards Josh, sword in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe destroyed, devil!\u201d The women yells as she swings her sword at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh seeing the attack coming creates a blue energy force field that stops the sword in its tracks. The wind once again rages all around these two super powered beings as they fight each other. The women continues to attack Josh\u2019s force field, each attack getting stronger and stronger. Josh having enough of the assault puts up and spreads his right hand towards the women, still safe inside the forcefield. The women lost in her constant attacks soon fills a powerful force push her towards the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoom!\u201d The women falling to the ground creates a small crater. The women wasn\u2019t down for long, as she stands up with hardly any scratches on her body. Both Josh and the women wast no time as they fly towards each other at blinding speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!!!\u201d Visible shock waves emanate all around the two warriors as they clash with one another. The ground was torn apart, trees were ripped from the ground and people took cover as if they were in the middle of a war zone, all of this from a women and boy fighting with one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh held tightly to both of the women\u2019s hand, Josh couldn\u2019t help but look into the women\u2019s azure blue eyes, that seemed to shine with power. He didn\u2019t want this fight, he didn\u2019t ask for it, but deep down he knew it couldn\u2019t continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh feels the energy inside his body grow stronger. It rushes through his vanes, making him feel invincible. Josh\u2019s blue eyes turn bright gold as he looks at his opponent who seemed to be looking at him with complete shock. Josh still holding both of the women\u2019s hands pulls with Herculean strength, and without effort spins the women around in circles (picture Gokus dragon throw). Josh soon lets go and the women goes flying through a dozen trees, snapping them in half and making a huge trench in the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh lands in the middle of the park and slowly looks around. The park was ruined people were hurt. All of this was caused because of him and that women\u2019s foolishness. Josh walks towards the women who was still laying on the ground. Josh had questions, like who was she, why did she attack him, why did she call him demon, and would she go out on a date with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood before the women, who was still laying on the ground. The women looked like she had seen better days, her red hair was no longer in a ponytail and looked a mess, with leaves and twigs inside it. Her skin was a little bruised and something was dripping from her small cuts, something shining with a golden luster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looking at her for a few second soon offers her a hand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d Josh asks hoping to be done with this fight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women looks at the hand as if it were a strange species of animal, and with a long sigh accepts Josh\u2019s gesture of good Will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooo, are we done fighting?\u201d Josh asks completely ready for an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Thou have bested me in mortal combat, and I ask for thy forgiveness.\u201d The women says bowing her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looks at the women in shock, was it really over just like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN, no problem.\u201d Josh says with an awkward laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooo, you mind telling me what you are?\u201d Josh asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew that this women couldn\u2019t be human, he would have to be a idiot to think other wise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women looks at Josh with eyes that could pierce the soul, it kind of made Josh a little uncomfortable. The women soon closes her eyes, Josh almost thought that the women wouldn\u2019t answer his question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an angel of the lord.\u201dThe women says looking at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The two men just laughed it off, until Titan stopped and started walking towards him, flexing his arms and cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just remained very calm. Little did Titan and Jason realize that they had threatened the most powerful boy in the entire universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I command Titan and Jason to shrink to six inches and to lose all their muscles!\" Josh said calmly, but loud enough for the two to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason! Did you hear THAT?\" Titan laughed loudly. \"The kid thinks we're gonna shr--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Both Titan and Jason felt an odd feeling like pins-and-needles, which raged through their bodies from head to toe! Then, just as the omnipotent boy had commanded, the two football jocks began to SHRINK! They looked at each other and realized that the hallway, the lockers, and the doors to the classrooms appeared to be getting bigger and BIGGER! And it was happening very QUICKLY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TITAN! Does everything appear to be growing for you???\" Jason gasped, as the big jock dwindled down to 5 ft 7 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! DUDE! What the HELL!!!\" Titan gasped, as he continued to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men were just under 4 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made it even MORE frightening, was the fact that TO THEM, Joshua appeared to be growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Titan... the k-k-kid is g-g-g-growing!\" Jason stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh! No wayyyyyy! NOOOOOO!\" Titan shouted, as he dwindled to 3 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more seconds had passed, and both football jocks had shrunk to 2 feet... 1 foot... 11 inches... 8 inches... Finally stopping at exactly 6 inches in height! Luckily, Josh allowed their clothing to shrink with them, so they weren't naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Titan! The lockers... The doors... Everything seems so... GIGANTIC!\" Jason said with a trembling voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they heard a sound... a squeaking of rubber soles over the hard, tiled floor... Then, staring before them, Jason and Titan saw a pair of GIGANTIC, ENORMOUS TENNIS SHOES!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Titan craned their necks and saw a GIANT... It was a HUMAN BEING, who was looking down at them! He was as tall as a skyscraper! His legs were long and thick and muscular, like huge pillars. The giant was as big as an office building!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jason and Titan being only 6 inches tall, that made Josh seem like a ten-story building to them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long, thick legs suddenly bent forward, as the giant squatted down. A large hand appeared before the tiny football players, with his giant palm pointing face-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET ON MY HAND!\" the giant commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan and Jason stepped on the large hand, as the hand then rose up while the huge giant straightened out. As the jocks looked on in complete fear, they saw that Josh looked down on them and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... You guys won't bully anybody like this!\" the giant grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE! GROW US BACK!!\" Titan shouted. \"PLEASE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh... Yeah.... You guys were gonna send ME to the Moon, huh?\" Josh laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOO! IT WAS A JOKE!!!\" Titan screamed. \"PLEASE FORGIVE ME!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... Good!\" Josh grinned. \"Because I'll shrink you guys every time I see you bullying someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOO! PLEASE!!!!!\" Both Jason and Titan dropped to their knees as they sat on the palm of Josh's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Josh sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh squatted down and placed his hand on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan and Jason quickly hopped off his hand, when Josh took three steps back. Then, the two jocks were overcome by that pins-and-needles sensation again, indicating that they were growing back to their original sizes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten seconds, Titan grew from 6 inches back to 7 foot 6 inches, and Jason grew from 6 inches to 7 foot 3 inches in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! We're normal! We're back to normal!\" Jason cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man! That must have been a bad dream!\" Titan said, looking around and realizing that everything looked normal again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was leaning against the same wall, at the same spot, with his arms folded before his chest, and staring at the two jocks with the same smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did... Did we just shrink down to six inches and grow back to normal... Or... was it all just a really BAD dream?\" Titan wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it was a bad dream...\" Jason grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Titan asked his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah... I guess we had to teach this kid a lesson, huh?\" Titan said, as he pointed his finger at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... I dunno, man... Leave the kid alone!\" Jason warned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw... I think the kid needs to be taught a lesson in respect!\" Titan said, as he started to march his way over to where Josh was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Titan... I wouldn't mess with that kid!\" Jason shouted. \"There is something weird about him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Titan didn't hear him. He kept on walking closer to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't move. Josh didn't even flinch. Why should he? He was the most powerful kid in the history of all mankind. NOBODY could hurt Joshua. NOBODY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Titan came within three feet of Josh, he was overcome by that pins-and-needles sensation again! This made Titan stop in his tracks! Titan immediatly began to SHRINK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Titan was standing before the giant boy... This time, how small did Joshua make him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He took his backpack and left it in his locker, before heading into the room where the school library was located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh searched and found a book to read for his English class and he quietly sat down on a table in the corner to read, when another boy came over and sat down on the chair next to him. The boy pulled a book out of his bag and set it down next to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh...\" the boy whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" Josh whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hiding...\" the boy replied. Josh knew him. His name was Liam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon has been bugging me the whole time. The big ox is a total pest! He wants my lunch money and... Oh no!\" Liam gasped, as the boy hopped off his chair and hid under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was slightly bigger than Josh, but not by much. Brandon was tall and a little more muscular than him. Now, Liam was a bit of a wimp, and Josh knew that. Josh could give Liam a little more courage and make him face Brandon, but that wouldn't be such a good idea since they were in a library. Josh realized that he needed to intimidate Brandon a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to grow a foot taller and gain thirty pounds of muscle...\" Josh whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was only five feet tall, but he was now growing bigger and taller! His legs sprouted and his arms, his chest and his torso began to swell with muscle all over! His pecs filled out his shirt, and his biceps became more defined. Josh now had abs! His quads filled out his shorts and mighty calves ballooned from the back of his legs. Lastly, the young God was now six feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked around the room with and angry snarl. Then, he wandered over to where Josh was sitting, not realizing that Liam was hiding under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Josh! have you seen Liam?\" Brandon sneered. \"I need to talk to him... Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssssshhhh!\"Josh hissed. \"This is a library! Be quiet, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon reached over and grabbed Josh's shirt and pulled it towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you hush me, pipsqueak!\" Brandon growled. \"I'm bigger than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josh moved his chair back so he could stand up. He got to his feet and rose to his full height, making him stand six feet tall, and four inches taller than Brandon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying, pipsqueak?\" Josh grinned, looking down at Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaahh!\" Brandon gasped, looking up at the bigger and more muscular version of Joshua!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon quickly backed off, let go of Josh's shirt, and ran out of the library. He felt VERY intimidated by Josh right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssssst! Liam!\" Josh whispered. \"He's gone now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam crawled out from under the table and gasped at the sight of Josh, who was a whole foot taller than he was before, plus he now had thirty pounds of muscle added to his frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh! Look at you! You're TALL!\" Liam gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... I forgot to shrink back...\" Josh whispered to himself. Then, he decided to make it \"normal\" for him to be 6 feet tall, so nobody would question why he was so tall. That way, he could shrink back to 5 feet later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Josh! I knew that a big guy like you could scare off a bully like Brandon!\" Liam grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh... No problem, dude! I'm no bully. I hate bullies!\" Josh laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh and Liam sat down on their chairs and continued reading their books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened for another twenty minutes, until...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was a tall, muscular man with short brown hair; one no one would want to see angry.

She was a petite woman with doll like features, wearing a long and flowing white dress. \"I share your pain, being away from you, my love.\" sadly, she said. \"However, know this... a day in heaven is a thousand years on Earth so in about an hour, Heaven's time, we will all be having a family reunion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to hold you now!\" sobbing, Tom replied. \"Colby and I miss you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah lightly touched Tom's cheek and he touched her hand in return as she added, \"I know that is a long time for you to wait but it will not be long for me, be happy in that respect.\" stroking Tom's hair, she said. \"Keep a picture of me by your bed, tell Colby to do the same, and I will visit you both in your dreams.\" she then gave Josh a grateful smile and said, \"I have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sarah took a step back and vanished. Tom, still crying, turned to Josh and was surprised to find that he was holding two framed pictures of his wife. \"How...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do listen to your prayers, Tom Stone.\" his voice still echoing, he said. \"I may not answer directly but I do listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it could, Tom's jaw would have hit the floor as he took the two pictures into his shaking hands. \"You are....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Josh vanished and reappeared where Tom could not see him and watched, teary eyed as Tom left the church, hugging the pictures of his late wife. <i>*It feels good to reach out to those in need, doesn't it?*</i> echoing in his mind, a voice asked. <i>*We are all able to do this, if only we try.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled. \"Even with giving me his power, He is still watching over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy changing the life of another for the better, Josh had changed himself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Josh do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He treasured the ability to teleport everywhere and he used it every chance he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then walked into the kitchen where his mother was preparing supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, do you mind if I hang out at Ethan\u2019s house for a while this afternoon?\" he asked his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother didn't mind it, which was the expected answer, and so he finished his lunch and walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Josh had gotten outside, he heard the sounds of several animals. There was a raccoon, a cat, and the chirping of a bird in a tree. Josh looked up and spotted the bird, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, come to me!\" Josh said to the bird, but somehow, the other animals instantly recognized who Josh was. They realized right away that Josh was God and their creator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird leaped off the branch and flew over to Josh, neatly landing on his shoulder. The raccoon and the cat also came up to Josh, and they rubbed up against Josh's legs. A few minutes later, a stray dog came walking by, and came up to Josh, and started licking Josh's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you guys know who I am huh?\" Josh grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Josh continued on his way, and the animals just remained standing, although they just watched him from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh reached Ethan's house, he rang the doorbell and Ethan opened up. Right away, Ethan's cat and dog came up to Josh and rubbed up against his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then went up to Ethan's bedroom, where the two boys played video games together. They played a few games on the Xbox, and Josh beat Ethan easy at everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ethan took Josh to the large bird cage out in the back of the house, all four birds flocked over to Josh and sat on Josh's shoulders. Ethan was just astonished and he couldn't understand why all the animals liked Josh so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ethan's mother came home, and she started talking to the boys when she entered the bedroom. She just finished telling them that she had come back from church.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, Josh! Thanks for coming over!\" Mrs. Jones said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mrs. Jones. You just came from church, right?\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I heard your prayer for Mr. Jones. I'm sorry to hear he's sick with the flu. But, don't worry. He'll get better today!\" Josh said to Ethan's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat moment, Ethan's father was cured and he was no longer sick with the flu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's mother was astonished. She just stared at Josh with a shocked look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh... How could you have heard my prayers? I mean, I was praying these things in church to God!\" Ethan's mother wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear everyone's prayers. I am God.\" Josh replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ethan and his mom stared at the boy in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her husband came out of the room, feeling completely cured from the flu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Mr. Jones isn't sick anymore!\" Josh smiled. \"I answered your prayer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" both parents said, as they embraced Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was happy Josh came over, and Ethan couldn't believe it. His best friend from school, who came over to play video games with him, was God!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan couldn't wait to tell his friends at school about Josh. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

NOW!\" Josh grinned, as Ethan looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryce closed his eyes and groaned loudly as every muscle in his skinny body suddenly inflated like crazy! Suddenly, one-hundred pounds was being added and evenly distributed among all the muscles in the boy's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis calves inflated like big balloons while his quads, glutes and hamstrings all bulged with incredible form and muscle definition that bodybuilders crave, showing every curve and vein. Thick teardrops of layered muscle formed on the legs above the knees, while ropes and layers and cords of thick muscle covered the thickened and widened quads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the boy's abdominal muscles turned into tiled washboards while his pectorals grew into thick, round spheres of big, round bricks of steel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoulders widened, supported underneath by wide lats, as delts and traps formed everywhere. His arms grew into pythons of muscle, showing off biceps and triceps, big and hard and round, so that the boy now had the strength to lift tremendous weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when the growth spurt stopped, Bryce opened his eyes and realized that he was a hulking muscle boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh waved his hand and made all his clothes fit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryce was wearing his shorts and a tank top, which allowed his bulging biceps to show for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!

Josh began to like the attention very much, and he also took extra note to the other kids around him, including those he had never paid notice to before. Now he knew all their names, and everything about their lives, their families... everything. The skinny, nerdy looking girl in glasses named Alice caught his attention first. He smiled and waved his hand... her glasses disappeared and she got perfect 20x20 vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy called Anders, who had a severe overbite, suddenly found his jaw and teeth were perfectly normal. \"Everyone go to class, I know I'm God but you still have to learn.\" Josh shouted out to all the kids. When they did as he said, he decided to reward them (while also having fun himself). He concentrated and all the boys in the school yard, 10 and 11 years olds... felt their pre-teen cocks grow an extra inch and their balls expand slightly. However he stopped short of sending them through puberty early. And for all the girls, he gave every one of them a pair of budding breasts, so that when they grew older... they would all have a decent pair of either C or D-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it like?\" Ethan asked, walking up to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being God? Its... normal, actually, and yet at the same time comforting to be an all powerful omnipotent entity with limitless intelligence.\" Josh replied, smiling at his friend as he crossed his arms. \"But even a God has to have fun now and then...\" Josh then smirked, glancing down at Ethan's crotch. \"Congratulations Ethan, you're an early bloomer.\" He said, and Ethan immediately started moaning as his already slightly larger dick began hardening and growing an extra two inches in length.... taking it to just over six inches. His nuts also swelled and began churning with cum as he raced through puberty in seconds. In one intense moment Ethan felt his balls send a torrent of jizz up through his cock and into his pants... where it then dissipated. His first orgasm was amazing, and the effects lasted a bit longer than a usual one thanks to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody said God had to behave himself completely.\" Josh ordained to Ethan. His words however echoed throughout the entire school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, there's Ms Sanderson.\" Ethan suddenly pointed at his English Literature teacher, whom he was not exactly fond of. Sure she was pretty, only 25 years old, but she could also be a bitch to her students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give her a break, her father was mean to her when she was little.\" Josh told Ethan. That didn't mean Karen Sanderson was going to escape untouched for all the times she'd given her students grief. Josh suddenly teleported in front of the teacher, startling her. \"For causing mental anguish to children in the past, you are hereby judged and punished appropriately by God.\" Josh stated, waving his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Sanderson gasped and looked down as she felt her boobs shrinking, from her usual D-cups down to an A-cup, the same size as all the girls in school now. Difference was... hers wouldn't grow again unless God commanded it. \"Now go to class, and repent.\" Josh told the teacher, who remained silent, lowered her head and did as she was told, even as Josh made her redundant bra disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome Josh!\" Ethan smirked, running up to his all-powerful friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything I do is awesome Ethan.\" Josh smiled warmly, and instantly Ethan and Josh teleported to a classroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh continued walking through the school hallways, as Ethan stayed in the classroom to take his lesson. It was a lesson that now definitely had its perks since Miss Davidson, his teacher, now sported a pair of whopping F-cup breasts courtesy of Josh. A boost to her ass effectively balanced her out and gave her the curviest figure of the all the teachers in the school... so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh levitated past another classroom (figuring walking was too mundane), he saw Mr Higgins swamped by student's paperwork. He had to be on his fifth cup of coffee and his shirt was open with his tie loosened. With a wave of Josh's hand, all the paperwork go marked up and filed, disappearing from the desk, much to the teacher's astonishment and shock. Feeling sorry for Mr Higgins, Josh also took several years of age off the man, rejuvenating him from 53 to 45 years of age. To please his wife, Josh also made Mr Higgin's penis pulsate and grow a couple of inches, its girth also increased slightly as did his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Josh moved on, helping others with his Godly powers. The next in line was the school librarian, Ms Spencer, age 40. She was an attractive woman, but the years were catching up to her now. And she'd just gone through a messy divorce with custody of her 12-year old son going to her ex-husband. Peering into the woman's mind, Josh discovered she hadn't had sex in six months. \"Enjoy!\" Josh said, again waving his hand. Ms Spencer let out a moan and dropped the books she was holding as her pussy exploded in the most amazing orgasm she'd ever had. She fell in a heap on the floor and writhed, continually moaning as the orgasm lasted several minutes... soaking her panties in fluid... which then evaporated, leaving her underwear dry and clean. Josh had also given custody of her son over to her, overruling the ruling of a court that was inferior to God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his saunter through the hallways continued, the paintwork and decor brightened as he past by, leaving the school looking more welcoming. Potted plants even appeared, along with wall decorations such as priceless artworks. Spotting a pair of 11-year old students in a hallway kissing and giggling, Josh immediately knew their names, Ryan Phillips and Louisa Caldwell. \"Shouldn't you two be in class?\" Josh asked, his arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... we were only kissing, I really like Louisa and I like touching her face.\" Ryan said, causing Lousia to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can touch it in class right?\" Josh suggested, acting quite mature (most of the time) now that he was God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have different classes.\" Louisa pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smirked. \"Easily solved.\" He said, waving his hand and swapping them into each other's bodies. \"Now Ryan, you can touch Louisa's face in class as much as you like while you're studying. And Louisa... you can touch whatever you like most about Josh.\" He smirked, glancing down at her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... this is weird.\" Louisa gasped, looking down at her male body. It got weirder when Josh focused on Louisa's new crotch and caused Ryan's cock to harden and his balls to start churning with cum. He found it amusing to send Ryan's body through puberty while Louisa was the one inside it. She let out a moan as her pants were tented by her hard on, and then she shot her load in her pants. Meanwhile, a stunned Ryan just looked on while patting down his new body. They were then both instantly teleported to their classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, young love.\" Josh snickered, as he levitated down the hallway further.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Josh came across a 10-year old girl who had been cornered by three other girls, it was obvious what was happening, a good old fashioned bullying. Josh would not condone or approve of such behavior in HIS school. Of course... all schools all over the world were his schools, and all populated by his children. This girl's name was Lucy, and her three tormentors... Josh knew there names but they were of little import.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have some courage, and a few other things.\" Josh smiled, waving his hand once more. Lucy suddenly grunted a little as she felt her clothes growing tighter, then it was obvious to her that her muscles were growing... expanding, and she gained a three inch boost in height too, putting her above her three bullies. Josh didn't give the girl too much muscle, just enough to make her intimidating. He also boosted her self confidence and gave her karate skills. \"Shove off.\" The newly confident Lucy pushed the lead girl bullying her, Megan, knocking her to the ground. Josh then turned his attention to the three bullies too, and their long, feminine hair shrank into their scalps, leaving them bald. That was their punishment, though their hair would start regrowing again naturally, they'd just have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Josh.\" Lucy nodded gratefully in passing, knowing it was him who had helped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for thanks.\" Josh smiled, and with another quick focus 10-year old Lucy rapidly developed a healthy pair of C-cup breasts that stretched her shirt even more than it already was due to her muscular physique. After another nod and a smile, Lucy went to class, and Josh continued on his way down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next teacher he came across was Mr Rooks, the Geography teacher, and he was in the middle of dressing down a female student for texting on her phone in class. In Josh's eyes, he was being a little too harsh in the way he was talking to Tina. He gave the teacher something else to focus on. Mr Rooks winced as his cock twitched... instantly becoming erect and shooting a stream of cum into his briefs. He moaned as he orgasmed in the hallway, and the girl, Tina just grimaced and ran back off to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince things were now running smoothly at this his local school, Josh teleported himself to the nearby high school, where the students were all 15 or 16 years old. He knew there's be many misbehaving students here, and maybe a few teachers too. He would have to see as he moved around it. The first person who caught his attention was a teacher in fact, named Jennifer Raulson, 36, she was having a cigarette outside on her break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No smoking in school.\" Josh said to the woman as he approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? Who the hell are you kid?\" The woman responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm God!\" Josh stated, pointing at the teacher. Her cigarette vanished from her fingers and she couldn't believe it. \"You're too young to smoke.\" Josh smirked, then whittling the woman down to a 14-year old girl. The woman was stunned as she shrank in her clothes... which then changed into a school uniform. Josh also made it so her home life changed as well, her husband was now her father. Though now the school was a teacher short, so Josh picked a schoolgirl at random and added several years onto her age, turning her into a stunning 24 year old with the necessary intelligence and knowledge to teacher the Science class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, Josh passed through the wall of the high school and went inside.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A 16-year old dweeb named Norman suddenly gained an extra four inches to his cock... making him the biggest in school (at nine inches), and his balls swelled to the size of tennis balls... creating a massive bulge in his slacks and getting the disbelieving stares of the girls who saw it... and a few jealous boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 15-year old cheerleader named Sandy was next, as Josh pointed at her... her nipples stiffened and lengthened to an inch long... poking through her halter top. She gasped and looked down, suddenly turning red in embarrassment. Her arousal increased when her pussy sensitivity also increased, and it was all she could do to not rub her vagina through her skirt right there in the hallway. She scurried off to the girls toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother boy, part of a gang of three, was wolf whistling at a sexy Latina student named Maria.\" Woowee, Maria, let me touch that fine ass.\" The boy shouted, using his hands to trace a female figure in the air. Josh acted quickly, and the boy, Mike, grunted as his pants started filling out in back due to his expanding ass flesh. Maria was shocked as she felt her own ass shrink into a more manly one, but her shock was mostly drowned out by amusement when she saw Mike's discomfort... as well as the juicy Latina ass now filling his jeans. Maria thought she'd actually be better off with Mike's ass, however the swap had happened. She hated being stared at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Josh went on his merry way, invisible to everyone. A 16 year old boy talking on his phone suddenly moaned out loud as he got an erection and jizzed in his pants in the space of 5 seconds. Another cheerleader, dressed in her uniform, suddenly had her breasts inflate from a perky C-cup to a big jiggly E-cup. She squealed as her cheerleader top ripped down the sides because of her expanded boob flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParticularly satisfying for Josh, even as God, was a muscular jock named Tom who was hitting on several girls one after another. \"Cheating is a sin.\" Josh shook his head, holding up his hand. The jock suddenly frowned and started reaching for his crotch as his cock and balls shrank into those of an infant boy. His muscles also rapidly deflated until he was left with a skinny frame, and it was then that Josh made him lose control of his bladder too, and he pissed his boxers before running off to the boys toilets to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Satisfying!</i> Josh nodded, starting to like changing/swapping people just for the hell of it rather than helping them. And who would judge him anyway... he was GOD!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then Josh smiled ' History is not so hard. Let me give you a few pointers and strategy in studying about World War I.' Then he began. Josh slowed time down greatly that he was able to teach Misty a month worth of History in 30 minutes. They even had time to drink the Coke and chat briefly about school for a few minutes too. But Misty was unaware of anything unusual. History was being much easier now for her. Misty would have no trouble getting an A now if she kept up her studies. After another 15 minutes, Josh said 'Well, it is about time for me to go home now. It is going to get dark soon'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty walked Josh to the front door.

He made the whole team refreshed and regained their confidence.  Also Josh liked Misty's heart and attitude. He made her as good as an all-star NBA player. While the final decision  was up to the team and their attitude, victory was likely now in the second half but not guaranteed. It just depended on what happened after Josh's team transformation.

A spider web!\" she screamed, as she started pulling it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe became even more fearful when she noticed a large spider walking towards her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AArrrhh!!!\" she yelled at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!

Instantly, her torso, her chest, and her legs bulged with amazing muscle! Tina grew several inches taller and gained numerous pounds of muscle in an instant, all thanks to Josh! Then, Tina turned to face the spider and took a deep breath... Then she froze the spider in place right there as she blew on it with her mighty breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira quickly broke free from the spider web and Tina gently took her by the hand and helped her break free from the web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Josh asked Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...

He heard each one of them in his mind, as they originated from all over the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he heard the three that he wanted to focus on. It came from a high school student who was frequently bullied in school. The student hung out with his friend, who was also a nerd. So, Josh snapped his fingers and teleported to the school in England, appearing at the school. He was completely invisible so nobody could see him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul was walking down the hallway with Simon, his best friend. Paul was the 15-year-old who had said the prayer just as he walked into the schoolyard. He was often bullied for being so skinny, short and smart. Simon was the same way, but he was a little taller. Simon had just started lifting weights in the gym, but he wasn\u2019t muscular at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMate, I wish we knew someone who could protect us from the bigger dudes!\u201d Paul grumbled. \u201cI have too much homework to waste my time in a gym!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh right\u2026 I just started lifting weights, mate\u2026\u201d Simon sighed. \u201cIt will take me at least three years before I see any significant gains!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should just pay the big guys to leave us alone?\u201d Paul grumbled. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll get the money from!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was about to respond when they walked past the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026. I need to use the toilet, mate\u2026. Give me a minute!\u201d Simon said as he walked into the boy\u2019s bathroom. He had no idea that Josh had caused his bladder to fill up quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, the tall but skinny boy used the stall real quick before he came out to the sink to wash his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he stood there, ready to dry his hands under the hand dryer, he was overcome by a powerful, tingling sensation which coursed all through his slender body. Then, without warning, his every muscle on his muscle started to inflate, all at the same time! Within seconds, Simon morphed from a tall, skinny kid to a very athletic young man as his arms bulged, his chest inflated, and his torso widened. His quads widened considerably, and his calves bulged into soccer balls. Luckily, thanks to Josh\u2019s powers, his clothing and his shoes grew along with him as his muscles expanded rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was all over, Simon remained standing there, glancing at his reflection in the mirror. His jaw dropped open when he realized how he had changed. Gone was the tall, skinny guy. In his place was now a big, athletic, teenage bodybuilder with thick pecs and vein-covered biceps, quads and calves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Simon gasped as he posed and turned sideways, flexing his arms. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. It was as if he had been working out in the gym for years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door to the bathroom opened. It was Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo, Simon! Are you coming, mate?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I\u2019m here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon joined Paul and the two boys walked back to class. Nobody had said anything about Simon\u2019s weird growth spurt. It was as if he had always been that way. And, Josh just looked on from a distance, smiling quietly, before he teleported back to his bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he looked over, his   cat jumped on top of him, and couldn't stop licking his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What   is it, Munchie? Do you need more food? More water in your bowl?\" he   said, as he looked over at the two empty bowls on the floor. He felt so   nice and comfortable, he just didn't feel like getting up. \"Oh man...  I  wish Munchie's bowls were filled already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen,   when Josh looked up, suddenly, a fresh serving of cat food magically   appeared in the bowl, and the other bowl was filled to the rim with   fresh drinking water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh   finally got up and walked over to the kitchen where his mother had  just  finished carrying several bags of groceries from the car into the  house  and set them on the kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? What are all these books?\" Josh said, as he saw a stack of books on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those   are Bibles and lesson books. There is a midweek church service with   Father William\" his mother explained. \"Would you want to go to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Josh replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could   you help put the groceries away while I change?\" his mom asked, as she   walked towards her bedroom, leaving Josh alone in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...   I wish all these groceries were neatly put away in the fridge and   cupboards already...\" Josh sighed. Instantly, all the bags of groceries   had disappeared and everything was neatly stored away in the  cupboards,  in the pantry, and in the fridge, just as Josh had  commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That   was so cool!\" Josh grinned, as he began to grasp the extent of his   powers, as Munchie continued to walk right in front of him, rubbing her   fur against his legs. \"What is it, huh? You haven't left me alone all   day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then,  his mother came out of the bedroom and signaled to Josh that she was  ready to go to church. Josh got in the car, and his mom got behind the  wheel. Moments later, they were on their way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen  they arrived at the church, people were just getting ready for service.  Josh sat all the way in the front row, when Father William came up and  lead the congregation in an opening prayer. As he completed the prayer  and everyone said Amen, Josh said to himself \"I heard your prayers!\"  just loud enough for the priest to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe  priest then gave a short lesson before a girl lead the group with a few  songs before a closing prayer, where at the end, Josh repeated the same  thing out loud. The priest looked up and wondered why Josh said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when the service was over, the priest walked up to the entrance near the back of the hall. When Josh came out, he looked down on the boy and asked him \"Why did you give such an unusual response after the prayer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... I heard all your prayers!\" Josh shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only God can hear all our prayers, my boy!\" the priest answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... \" Josh whispered. \"I am God...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? My boy... How can you say that?\" Father William asked the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear your prayers! ALL of them! You prayed for Mrs. James this morning and Deacon Johanson this afternoon and Mr. Burns, who was sick and also you prayed with Father Jenkins just before the service!\" Josh said with a grin on his face. \"I heard all of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... my... God...\" Father William said, as he stepped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me!\" Josh grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Josh... You... You're my Lord, my God...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh just loved Sunday evenings. He could pretty much do whatever he wanted. He went to church in the morning, where he served as the altar boy during the mass. Then, he had lunch after the mass, and afterwards he would hang out with friends or else he would just watch TV or play video games at home. His mom would often work at the clothing store in the shopping mall, so he would frequently be home alone. His best friend, Ethan, wasn't always home either, so it all depended on what was going on and who was available to hang out with him if he was alone or not after mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting rather cloudy outside and Josh still had some homework left to do math class, so he wandered over to his desk and sat down at his chair. He turned on his laptop and pulled up the website for his elementary school, where he saw that he needed to finish up some work on some math problems. He finally got his book out of his backpack and started writing in his notebook, when something caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis little goldfish, Sharky, was constantly swimming over to one side of the small fishbowl, facing Josh. The bowl was placed near the edge of the desk, and Josh usually saw Sharky swimming around in the small bowl. This time, however, the little fish appeared to be hovering around the same area, facing the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Didn't I feed you this morning?\" Joshua wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took the small plastic jar with fish food, containing dry flakes with food, and sprinkled some of it into the water. Little Sharky swam to the surface and ate some of it, before descending down to about halfway into the bowl, so it could stare at the human being who sitting in front of him. Obviously to the fish, it was looking out over the LORD who sat before him, and it was eager to worship its God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh did another row of math problems, until he was finished. Then he put down his pen and closed his notebook, when he realized that his fish was still looking straight at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? You look so sad in the little bowl...\" Josh sighed. \"I bet you'd be a lot happier if your bowl were twice as big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the glass bowl GREW until it was exactly TWICE as big as before! Just as Josh had suggested! Not only that, but the bowl magically filled up to the rim with water, providing twice as much room for little Sharky as before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharky swam around the larger bowl twice, circling around the glass, before coming back to the side facing Josh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Josh gasped, as he got up from his chair! \"Waiiiiiittt a minute.... How... What... This is weird! REALLY, really weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood there for a moment and stared at the larger fish bowl, which sat on his desk. He stepped back, not knowing what to think of the strange, magical transformation which had just taken place. Did HE just do that? What had just taken place? What happened? How did he do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh took another step back, he bumped into his chair, and fell backwards! His chair suddenly grew longer and wider, morphing into a large, comfortable recliner chair, which broke his fall! For a moment, Josh lay there, which his back in the super-comfortable recliner chair, which had replaced his small office chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange chair freaked him out again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whhaaaaaahh!\" Where did that chair come from??\" Josh exclaimed, as he leaped from the chair and got back on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he took another step back, and bumped into the edge of his bed. Once again, the boy lost his balance, and fell with his back on his small bed. But, his bed was no longer just an ordinary bed. His bed suddenly morphed into a King-sized giant waterbed, which suddenly began to make sloshing noises due to the water splashing against the inner lining of the bed. Josh's body rocked up-and-down like a boat on the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whooaaa! This is comfortable!!\" he grinned, as he lay on his huge waterbed, which was covered with silk sheets and covers, along with ten big, fluffy pillows everywhere! \"This bed is made for a King!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bounced around his huge, super-comfortable bed for a few minutes, until he got tired of it. Then, he decided to crawl to the edge, so he could get off. He walked back to his desk, where he looked at his large fishbowl once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom is gonna FREAK when she sees this huge fishbowl! It needs to shrink back to how it was before!\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large fishbowl did exactly that: It shrunk back to the original size! Unfortunately, the large bowl was filled with fresh water, so when it shrunk, the excess water began to spill out over the upper edge of the bowl, spilling all over the edge of the desk and on to the hardwood floor of Josh's bedroom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh NO!\" Josh gasped, when he saw the water spill all over the floor. \"No, no, no, Nooo! Mom is gonna KILL me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a large puddle of water on the floor, and water all over his desk as well. He let out a deep sigh, just thinking about all the work he had to do cleaning it up by hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this mess!\" he groaned. \"All this water on my desk and on the floor... All this needs to be cleaned up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in an instant, the water was GONE! The water on the floor had disappeared! And the surface of his desk was bone dry! Everything was cleaned up, like the accident had never happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA!\" Josh gasped, as he saw how his entire room had changed within just a few minutes. His chair had changed, his bed had become a waterbed, and he had made the fishbowl grow into twice its size and back! \"OH MY GOD!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOMMM!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash of lightning and loud rumble of thunder had startled the boy. Then, as he walked to the window, he realized that a storm was raging outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I was thinking about going outside, and it had to rain!\" Josh grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what does Josh do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything that had happened had occurred after that strange encounter. Did that mean he was really God?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea filled him with excitement as he began to think about what to do next. He was suddenly snapped out of his thoughts by the sound of pouring rain on his window. Josh realized that with the power of God, he could do anything, including stopping the rain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh lifted his hand up towards the window. \"Rain, I command you to stop!\" he said, feeling a bit foolish while doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the stormy clouds immediately turned back into their usual white color and the rain cleared up. The clouds parted and gave way to the sun, which shone down on the earth with radiant warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, giddy with excitement at his first intentional use of his almighty power. Remembering his original intention, Josh put on some fresh clothes and bounded down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that storm really cleared up fast!\" his mom remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it sure did! I'm going to go outside,\" Josh said, slipping on his sneakers before dashing outside, being careful not to slip on the driveway made smooth by the fresh water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked down the street, seeing people begin to come outside and talk to one another about the strange disappearance of the storm. Josh walked by them with a smile on his face, thinking about how wonderful life could be with god powers.</span></div></div>",

There, he spotted the side wall of the old wooden building where a hole in the wall alerted Josh to the possibility that the hive was hidden inside of the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Kate came back with her mother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh! Thank you for helping Katie!\" her mother said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're welcome!\" Josh replied. \"But, I guess we need to get rid of the beehive before any other kids get stung by bees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate found a small piece of wood on the ground, which she picked up and brought it to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this help?\" she asked the young God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, it will!\" Josh grinned. \"Just set that on the ground over here, near the wall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate set the small piece of wood on the ground, just as Josh requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Josh said out loud. \"I want the piece of wood to turn into a two-by-two-foot mesh box with a cover on one side!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Josh commanded, the small piece of wood grew bigger and bigger, turning into the outer edges of a six-sided square box, measuring exactly two-feet wide, two-feet tall and two-feet deep. The top side of the box had hinges so it could open. Each side of the box was completely covered in mesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cover opened up from the top of the empty box, which was just under the small hole in the wooden wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a beehive inside of that wall!\" Josh stated. \"So.... I want ALL the bees to come out and fly into my box!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How can you...\" Kate wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a swarm of bees came out of the hole and flew straight into the box! Once every single bee was inside of the box, the lid magically closed and sealed the box shut, trapping the bees inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I need a container for the honey!\" Josh smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plastic container materialized in his hands, which was empty. The lid came off the container as the honey flowed from the hole on the beehive and flowed straight into the container, which Josh was holding in his hands. After about a minute or so, the box had completely filled up with raw honey when Josh closed the lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go! Here's some honey for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh! How did you DO THAT????\" Kate gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just turned towards Kate and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trust in God, Katie! he commands things to do his will!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you just commanded the bees to go into the box!\" the little girl observed. \"Only God can do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... You have a good point, Katie!\" Josh chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU must be... God!\" Kate replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I hear your beautiful prayers every night, Katie!\" Josh smiled as he squatted down. \"Your daddy will get a new job next week! Your grandma has been sick last week but she'll get better. And your mom will be getting a raise at her job soon! I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That is wonderful!\" Kate's mother exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, God!\" Kate replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Josh for now, okay?\" Josh said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Josh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kate and her mom walked off with the honey while Josh teleported the bees to a beekeeper's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to walk down the street...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So Josh turned on the radio for more updates. The weathermen there were saying that it was expected to last another few days unless something miraculous happens. At that moment, Josh knew the best solution was to get rid of the blizzard. The blizzard was going on for too long. People did need to get out and get food or to work. Those without heat or shelter were even more affected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh pointed at the sky toward where the blizzard was happening.  GO AWAY, PEACE BE STILL.  Within a few minutes, the heavy snowing stopped. And the sun slowly started to come out in that area. The weathermen excitedly were commenting on the sudden changes in the weather. Some called it LUCK, some called it Random Weather Pattern,  but a few called it Providence or God's Timing, Josh smiled, knowing that the people there will have it better now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then decided to wait until perhaps tomorrow to do anything else <b>major </b>with his powers. The next couple of days were just ordinary days. Then the following day, he got an email from the parish from the Father asking Josh if he can help being the alter boy that afternoon mass. The EMail continued saying that another boy named Earl would be helping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh responded ' Sure.  I will be there.'  Josh decided to transport his robes back to the parish. The robe was all clean and winkle-free. Josh did not want to attract attention walking to the church while wearing the robe. Josh was a half of a block away where he saw Earl being pinning against a wall by two older boys. The other boys were not hurting Earl, but just taunting him. The other boys were not that bad of bullies. But still they did enjoy intimidating Earl, calling him a religious freak and a goody two shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl tried to remain calm and polite ' Please let me through. The teasing have been going on long enough.' But they just laughed at Earl.  Josh did sense that they were going to leave in 15 minutes but that would put much pressure on Earl to be at the parish on time. Josh sighed, knowing that he had to do something.</span></div></div>",

His status for the next game still was uncertain because of his minor neck injury. The day before, the doctors even wanted to check Sam for any concession problems the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam soon was jogging nearby the Catholic Church where he noticed a young boy being pinning against the wall. He frowned at what he saw. Sam did not like bullies and felt that he had to stop them somehow. He also knew the coach of the Football detest any of his players for fighting.  The coach warned them that any fighting is subject to being kicked off the team. Yet Sam decided to talk to them first. Maybe his presence will be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh did notice the football player jogging up to Ben and Charles.  Sam stood behind them, saying in a low tone, <b>' Okay, I think that you had enough fun. Let the young man go.' <br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nBen turned around and saw Sam and knew whom Sam was. But Ben said ' Go away; besides you are not Catholic but Methodist' But Sam said <b>' It does not matter. Let him go or else.'  </b>  Ben laughed, saying, ' If you try to fight us, Coach may just kick you off the team.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam backed up, wondering what he should do. Then he made his decision. Sam grabbed Ben by the collar and lifted him up. But that was all. Sam did say 'Do you want me to throw you and Charles over there by the bushes? Or will you let Earl, if that is his name, go NOW.' Sam did shake Ben a couple of times. Meanwhile Charles pushed Earl on the ground. Earl was dizzy when he fell on the concrete. Charles slyly took his camera phone out and filmed Sam picking up Ben and shaking him.  Then Charles uploaded it to YouTube where the coach eventually will find out in a couple of days.. But he said nothing to Sam. Charles titled the YouTube clip Bully picks up Victim and shakes him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles did say  '' Okay, we will scram out of here.  Come on Ben, let's go. We can't fight a football player.'  Charles whispered what he filmed on his camera phone to Ben.  Ben grinned then they both left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam held out his hand to help Earl up and asked if he was OK. Earl nodded that he was okay. Then both of them walked up to Josh. They all introduced each other to Sam.  Josh knew that Sam did something brave to help Earl. But Josh did not want Sam into trouble with the coach.  He also did a private medical scan on Sam's neck and brain. Josh realized that the neck problem was minor and would be healed in a week.. However the concession on his brain was worse that expected. The worst of it would not take affect until 2 years later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl said to Sam ' I know that you are not Catholic but it is OK to visit our parish if you wish.'  Sam replied ' I might but I might feel a bit uncomfortable...even though I like the organ playing some of the classic hymns as  'How Great Thou Art'.  Earl then said  \" I am not trying to force to go. That's OK. But I will to tell you Thanks again, from those bullies. I hope that you would not get into trouble. I will vouch for you if the coach hear of it.'   Suddenly there was a sound of thunder.  Then Sam said ' Well, maybe I will stay a short time. I do not want to get caught in the rain.'  So Earl, Josh, and Sam entered the parish.  Sam took a seat near the back where most visitors stay.  Meanwhile Josh knew what should be done <b>first</b>.</span></div></div>",

Almost three-hundred people were frozen, all at the same time, except Joshua. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love this!\" Joshua grinned, as he walked down the silent congregation filled with people who had stopped moving. He walked over to the pew where Sam was seated, and he touched Sam's shoulder with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, you're a good man! I want your concussions to be gone! I also want your neck to be healed. Right now!\" Josh whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's hand glowed a bright blue light, which flowed into Sam's neck and head, instantly healing him of his injuries and his ailments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josh stepped back and concentrated on Charles' cell phone, which contained the video which Ben was going to upload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh held out his hand, and the cell phone magically appeared in his hand, out of nowhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then tapped the screen on the iPhone, and found the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to be deleted!\" Josh spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video suddenly disappeared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Josh willed for the phone to appear in Charles' pocket, but without the video. And, if the video was ever posted on the Internet at all, then any and all copies of it would vanish instantly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just grinned as he looked out over the congregation as he whispered his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfreeze!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone started moving like nothing had happened. Nobody would ever suspect that the altar boy had actually caused time to stop for three minutes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mass was about to start and Josh was feeling much better now. Not to mention, Sam's neck was no longer bothering him!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her martial arts were fair for someone her age. But Josh did not want to worry Erin yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now Josh made another version of him, one who is a Junior in High School that was just transferred there two weeks ago. Josh decided to give his older self a different first name.- <b>Amos</b>.  Josh felt that having two Josh might be suspicious. But he decided that Amos's middle name would be Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmos entered the practice field after meeting with the Coach in his office. Coach Hanes was impressed with Amos.  Hanes was reading the report from the other school. Hanes was saying ' So I noticed that you played backup guard in your first two year at Andrew Jackson High School in Tennessee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmos Josh replied \" Yes Sir! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach continued 'And your grades are good too.. 3.4 GPA, Great! And you find time to volunteer at a local food bank in the summer.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach also said ' Let now do some drills here with my assistant coach. Fortunately your last High School coach had similar strategies like me in training the Offense Line. We really need help on the Left Guard position. Our former starting Left Guard had to be let go from the team...personal problems with the team.  Our backup James Baccus is okay but need work on getting a little bit stronger. But he is a good kid'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh went through the drills and impressed the coach. Josh was at near the ultimate size and height for a Left Guard. But Josh did not want to outshine Sam the Center.  Coach Hanes was impressed with Amos Josh's skills. Soon he handed Amos the playbook and told him to study it. because there is a chance that he might play in the next game when the backup need to rest. He continued ' I just need to file the proper paperwork so you, Amos, can be on our team. Welcome to our team.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the coach saw Sam running the track.  The coach blew his whistle and said to Sam ' Hey,Sam, stop running for now. You need the rest.' So Sam stopped running and trotted up to the Coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Coach said ' Let me introduce you to Amos. He just joined our team. He is going to be playing Left Guard.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSam and Amos Josh shook hands.   Before the coach left, the coach said ' By the way, Sam, thank you for defending Earl yesterday. Don't worry, I do not consider that to be fighting. I saw it on YouTube. There was an unfair edited version of it too but I think that nobody believed the edited version. Congrats again, Sam. Please work together, Sam. Be sure the team will accept Amos.' Then the coach left to file his paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled ' I do not know how the coach know about Earl so quickly on YouTube..the true version. But welcome to our team. Is there something in the playbook too hard to understand right now. I could help you on that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmos Josh smiled ' It is a bit early to know that now but I still could use the practice.' Sam smiled ' Looks like you are in great shape. My neck is okay now. The doctor cleared it. I am eager to play hopefully for this game. Let's start practicing.' </span></div></div>",

During the prayer, the altar boys were on their knees, just like the rest of the congregation, while the pastor was leading the prayers. Finally, the pastor paused in order to allow the people to give their own intentions, in silence of course. Josh was kneeling up front, at the altar, and he was hearing the prayers from all the members who were present in the sanctuary at that moment. In fact, a smile appeared on his face, especially since he heard the prayers of the kids as well. He even started glowing a little bit, although he was unaware of it at that moment, but several members of the congregation did notice it, including the young kids and the elderly. One of the children who noticed the faint blue glow around Josh's body during the moment of prayer was Erin, the girl who stopped the bullying before mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the mass was over, she walked up to Josh, who was standing in the lounge area since he had to carry the cross while leading the pastor out of the sanctuary following the end of mass. He was still wearing his robes, since the pastor had made the exception and allowed Josh to wear his white tunic as long as he wanted. So, it was easy to spot Josh among the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh! Josh!\" Erin said as she walked up to the altar boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! How's the karate-girl?\" Josh grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That was nothing! I had to help you and Earl!\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I really appreciate that! Earl was getting picked on again and I hate seeing the altar servers getting bullied before mass! That is so lame!\" Josh explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You guys are serving and helping out the pastor of the church and you guys are a very important part of the mass so there is no way I'm gonna let those bullies take advantage of my two favorite altar boys!\" she affirmed. \"Now, I need you to explain something to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Sure?\" Josh wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you glowing during prayer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... People were saying their prayers! Those prayers were very personal! It was really cool to hear them!\" Josh responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but... Those prayers were made to God!\" Erin whispered to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around. Luckily, most of the people had already left the sanctuary and he and Erin were now the last people left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I can hear all those prayers!\" Josh whispered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Only God can hear them, Josh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin... I'm God!\" he whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin just stared at the altar boy for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josh stared at her and made her believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow!\" she exclaimed. \"You... You're not kidding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am God!\" Josh repeated. \"I hear every prayer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stared at him completely slack-jawed. This was unbelievable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't believe it! I'm talking to a kid who's... God?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Okay! If you're God, then... Let's go to Disney World! Right now!\" Erin grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Josh replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh snapped his fingers and in a blink of an eye, Josh and Erin were standing before Cinderella's Castle in the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Orlando.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... NO WAY!\" Erin shouted as she looked around. It dawned on her where she was, as Josh looked on with a big smile on his face. \"You have got to be KIDDING ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-J-Josh... JOSH!\" Erin stuttered, as she placed her hands on Josh's shoulders. \"Did you... do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just nodded in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You're God? So... You can do anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! P-p-please... Send me... Send us back to church!\" Erin said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh raised his arm and snapped his fingers. In an instant, both of them were back at their parish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA!\" Erin gasped. \"Ohmygod! Ohmy... Oh Josh! You're amazing! You... Can I take you out for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure!\" Josh shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna go to MacDonald's?\" Erin asked him. \"I mean... I hate the idea of taking God to lunch at MacDonald's but that's all I can afford!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright! No problem!\" Josh laughed. \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josh snapped his fingers and the two of them appeared before the golden arches...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His robe was back home hanging neatly in the closet. Josh was now wearing a pair of black slacks and a yellow knit shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then held the door open for Erin to walk in. She smiled and  'Thank you, you are such a gentleman.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh did have a coupon for two Fish Fillet Combo in his wallet.. He handed the coupon to Erin.

Josh made sure everything was especially delicious today. Soon they were at the park. Suddenly Erin started worrying about Earl. Josh heard her mind thinking.  He smiled ' Relax, his mom was there. She took him home.'  Then Erin breathed a sigh of relief. She liked Earl too and still had a crush on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh and Erin took a walk on a cobble path near the creek.  Josh asked Erin if she liked the martial arts. Erin replied ' Not at first....but I realized that it is good exercise. After that, I realized that I could protect myself and others... as long the opponent is not better than me.  I have to admit that I was surprised that I won the fight so easily. I am not a black belt yet but a green belt.'  Josh smiled and looked at her ' I have a surprise for you.  I did make you a black belt earlier that day. Otherwise you would have a broken nose and some bruises. Yes, you would have still won but with those injuries I mentioned. I had to make you a little bit stronger too.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was not mad but gave Josh a gentle hug of thanks. She said ' I hope that it is not wrong but sometimes I dream of being a superhero or at least defending people in need.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh replied ' There were a few women heroes in the Bible. For example, I selected a woman named Deborah to become a prophetess, counselor, and perhaps a warrior..You can find it in Judges 4.'  Erin replied with a smile ' Thanks, I may read that tonight.'   They continued walking together.  Josh and Erin stopped once to feed the ducks in the creek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they felt it was about time to go back home. Erin asked Josh if he could just transport her home. He nodded in agreement. Josh had to get home too. Almost instantly,  Josh took Erin back at her front porch.   Then he held her hands and said ' I know that you now have the Level One Black Belt in your martial arts. I know that you have a caring heart and it won't stop being caring. Keep on training but I am now going to give you Level Two. It is partly because of your caring heart and partly because it will come in handy a few times this year.'  A quick glow appeared over Erin then disappeared.   Erin felt a sense of  godly responsibility. She gave Erin a respectful nod of appreciation and a sweet 'Goodbye Josh. I will use this wisely. Help me if I get too tempted.' Then she went inside her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew that Erin was much safer now. He did a quick check on Earl too.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Josh teleported back to his own house, he saw his mother standing outside, along with several neighbors. Then, he looked at the house and was startled for a moment: The house was on fire. Specifically, the kitchen and the wall seperating the kitchen and his bedroom had caught fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then turned to the sky and wished for a might rainstorm. Big, thick, dark rain clouds came rolling in, while they all stood there, waiting for the fire engines to arrive. Flashes of lighning struck, followed by loud rumbles of thinder, just as Josh had commanded. Then, they all ran over to the neighbor's house as it started raining very hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of the rain helped put out the fire just in time before the fire engines arrived on the scene. They pulled out the fire hoses from the trucks and they went inside of the house. They put out the rest of the flames, which were caused by an electrical short in the old house. Josh and his mother spent the night at the neighbor's house, so Josh was able to return to his house the following day once school was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking through the damaged part of the house, Josh decided to use his powers to fix everything. After all, he didn't want his mother to suffer anymore than necessary. So he wished for the kitchen and for his bedroom to be restored to normal, like it was before the fire broke out, minus the electrical short which had caused the fire in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, Josh was happy to walk around his room again, although he began to find his small bedroom rather tiny for a boy of his stature, who had quietly become God. He wondered if now was a good time to slightly upgrade his bedroom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Josh willed for his bedroom to grow to three times bigger than it was before, with a thirty-foot ceiling and with two ceiling fans attached to the beams. Then, he wanted large, bright lights hanging from the ceiling as well. Lastly, he wanted hardwood flooring and a nice, round spa located in the corner of his bedroom, with a large king-size bed on one side and a large, oak desk on the other. The bed was a waterbed and he had a large dresser against the wall with a full-body mirror next to it. He had his own bathroom and a large walk-in closet filled with nice clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Now, that's a bedroom fit for a God!\" Josh grinned, as he walked around the large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the desk there was the latest laptop with the newest Windows software, an iPad, and a Mac computer. He also had a large, 24-inch monitor and two large speakers and a webcam. Next to the desk he had a small stereo system as well. In short, he had everything he ever wanted. Lastly, Josh had the newest cell phone with all the newest features and the most memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in the other corner, he had a large flatscreen TV set with an Xbox console, a Sony Playstation 3, and a Wii. He had a bookcase with over 300 games and another bookcase with over 1,000 books! He had everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just smiled. He knew he had spoiled himself. But, this was truly the first time he had used his powers on himself. He figured it couldn't be bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay on his bed and closed his eyes, as he meditated while he listened to a flood of prayer requests that he was getting from people all over the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard a pleasant voice of a boy, who greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Joshua!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a dream! That voice came from his room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh opened his eyes and looked up at his visitor. It was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had brown eyes, brown hair which was straight and long, which reached just past his neck. The boy was a little over 5 feet tall and he wore sandals and a light brown tunic with a white rope around his waist. Josh immediately recognized him from the day he had received his godly powers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked up and examined the large bedroom with the high ceilings and the hardwood flooring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place you got here! Is this your new room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh, yes!\" Josh said, as he quickly sat up on the edge of his bed. \"I... Our house caught fire... And... My room was burned down and... I used my powers to give myself a bigger room... A room that I always dreamed about! Is... Is that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fine, Josh. You didn't do anything wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh quickly stood up and stood, facing the boy in the brown robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want me to put the room back the way it was, then I'll do it! I... I just wanted to give myself a bigger room! I'm sorry...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh! You have helped so may people already! It's not like you have abused your powers or your position! This is the only time you've used your powers on yourself. Maybe you need to do something fun!\" God said, as he walked over to the spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh quickly followed God and walked next to him until the two boys were standing at the edge of the round spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's test it!\" God said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, both boys were changed into wearing swimming trunks rather than the clothes they were wearing just a moment before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod slowly walked down the steps of the spa, as the jets in the spa started making the warm water bubble. Josh followed right behind him and pretty soon, they were both in the water. God dove underwater and came up again, with his dark brown hair completely wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! That felt great, Josh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to come over more often, My Lord!\" Josh grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have many other planets and galaxies to visit, and lots of people to see!\" God replied. \"But this is nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You go to other galaxies?\" Josh wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod swam over to Josh and placed his hands on Josh's shoulders. The boy looked Josh straight in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joshua... There are billions of planets out there... Humans on earth have no idea how infinitely huge the galaxy is... Or how many millions of galaxies there are, which contain millions of planets inside of them! There are infinite number of stars and black holes out there! Humans cannot understand it!\" God explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I... I'm so honored... to have you here... That you trust me with your powers...\" Josh replied calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for being a loyal servant and for being an altar server in church!\" God replied. \"I wish other parishioners were as passionate as you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen God turned around and walked up the steps of the spa. Once he was out, he was instantly dried off and wearing his tunic again, with his sandals on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh quickly climbed out of the spa and did the same: Using his powers to dry himself and to change into his white robe and sandals as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, My Lord... Please don't go!\" Josh asked God. \"Could you stay a little longer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" God shrugged. \"Show me some of the fun things you like to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two divine beings then walked around the large bedroom and looked through Josh's vast collection of books, they played music on his stereo, they surfed the web on his laptop, they played a game on his Xbox and they fed Sharkey, his goldfish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, God placed his hands on Josh's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep on helping other people. It's okay if you help yourself now and then, but spend the majority of your time using your powers to help others! I will come over now and then to answer any questions you may have, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, My Lord! I'm truly honored to be your servant!\" Josh replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now be a good God to my people!\" God said to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, God disappeared from Josh's room. The boy with the brown tunic was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Josh sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, it all seemed like an incredible dream, that Josh got to hang out with God and that he actually had God's powers. He felt great!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Karl hated girls who trained in the martial arts and go out of his way to shame them. Karl agreed to arrive in town in a week to beat Erin up--- unfortunately, legally too.

On the way in, Erin nodded ' Hello' to a couple of people already working out. They nodded back to her. Erin walked toward a door and typed in a number code to get in. She smiled ' I got some bottled water in here too in case you get thirsty. Hope it is not too boring watching me train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh first looked around. There was a large punching bag, a jump rope, a few lightweight barbells and a mat on the floor for Yoga and practice. Josh then took a seat on a nearby chair and asked her 'Do you know Kickboxing?' in a curious voice as possible. She smiled \"Not yet. I just know the martial art form I am training in. But knowing Kickboxing would come in handy.'  Josh laughed gently ' Well, I can train you in that easily.'  Erin's eyes lit up excitedly ' You Can????? Wait a minute, of course, you can.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh said ' well, first you need to relax and do some stretching exercises. That will limper up your legs.' Since Erin have done it before, that part was not hard for her.  Josh knew that there were several steps to it.  Then he decided to slow down time to which she can get a years of training in just a couple of hours. But Josh did not want to tell her just yet. Then he trained her to strengthen her legs.  Before too long, she was able to lift her legs all the way up a few times.  After that, Josh trained her in 'reading' her opponent\u2019s moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh made a beginning level hologram for Erin to 'fight'. After Josh was satisfied, he started the next level for her. Soon Erin did well in that level too. Soon, the two hours was open and Erin finished the third level in a remarkable way. Josh did not really want to tell her yet of the thugs. He wanted her to enjoy learning it first. Her smile showed her joy in learning it. And Josh was teaching her for free. There was about 5 days to go. Josh did not want her to be too good too soon. Not even her personality can handle that much too soon. The temptation could possibly be too great right now.  But Josh planned for her to be ready and fearless in whom she was going to face in a week. At that time, Josh knew that Erin could handle it spiritually, emotionally,  and physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked at the time and remarked ' Wow, it is two hours now. I need to be heading home. Thanks for training me. Could you just transport me home? If not, I could walk home. It is just 3 blocks away.'  Josh nodded with a smile \" Sure, i can do that for you.'  Josh continued with a gentle smile '  Have fun but remember to use your gift in helping people. Some people can be tempted to get haughty later with with what they have.  Pray to God thanking him daily for what you have and how you can be a positive role model.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin paused to pray briefly that she will also be sweet and not to misuse her gift. Then she relaxed and  said 'Thanks for reminding me that.'  Josh then said ' Relax, God loves you. Just come back in two days and I would like to give you some more training.'  Then Erin was sent home in a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then went home himself and did his homework and housework. Lying in bed at night, He did sleep a couple of hours. he wondered what to do now. After all, Josh did not really need sleep. </span></div></div>",

Excellent women kickboxers have tried to beat him in the past but have failed. None of them lasted past  3 rounds against him. Only the best one lasted that far. Every woman that Karl defeated was broken emotionally for at least a couple of weeks. Karl also knew two other forms of martial arts as well. He also began training the two boys who was defeated by Erin earlier.

And Karl did not care if he was facing an 2nd grade girl. His philosophy was that no female had any right kickboxing.  Josh did not plan on Erin being a superhero but he could make her much better than Karl. Erin had a sweet heart in her but knew how to fight. Josh was planning to give her that extra power in case of emergency or when she needed to defend someone. After watching Karl, Josh decided to return back to train Erin the next day. But did she need some relaxation first or training first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh planned to take her to a special  top secret dojo where she can soon defeat Karl. Josh could train her himself and even suspend time with no ill effect or metaphysical paradox.  Or being God, he could take her for some relaxation to the Milky Way. Nothing would happen to Erin in the Milky Way with Josh being there. Josh planned to tell her what was up and how he planned to help her. After all, Erin was beginning to wonder what was going on. She was beginning to be worried that someone better will soon beat her up. The two boys that she did beat up was not just going to go away. And she did have some trouble sleeping now and did know about Karl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Josh took Erin <br>\r\n...<br>\r\n. </span></div></div>",

Just come to our mass next Sunday.'  She smiled when they returned to Earth again in a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Sunday morning, Father Williams was finishing up a homily or sermon on <b>Psalms 139</b>, reading some verses, then commenting on them explaining that God know all of our thoughts, words, and acts that we do and nothing can be hid from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Williams ended his speech with  <b>\" Our God's infinite knowledge and universal presence should be a comfort for the believers. Amen.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Williams wiped his forehead since the air conditioning in the building could need to be replaced soon. But the parish did not have the money for it.  He planned to ask the Vatican for help and advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the service and Mass was over, Father Williams reminded the congregation about the VBS ( Vacation Bible School ) for the younger kids in the parish and the community. He hoped for some more volunteers to help out, regardless of how much talents he/she had. The heart is what really mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone went home, he finally locked the door to the parish. But he saw Josh standing there.<br>\r\nHe asked him if everything is OK.  Josh smiled and said ' Certainly, Let me take care of the A/C right now.'<br>\r\nJosh divinely repaired the A/C that it should function for another 7 to 8 years with no problems and using a smaller portion of electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Williams gracefully thanked Josh for helping him with the A/C and said ' See you next week. Take your robe home if you wish. I know that it can easily be cleaned.' Then Father Williams went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh went home, he was trying to think of ideas for the VBS at the parish. He was not worried about the fruit punch and cookies. He wanted to attract more children to the parish without forcing them or controlling them.

May I suggest you find a way to bring them together so they can help someone less fortunate than them? They might want to help children who are poor, perhaps?\" God suggested. \"Every child must have the opportunity to serve and give to the poor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... YES! Of course!\" Josh said excitedly. \"Thank you, God! That is brilliant! We'll get together and serve the poor! But...

Thank you, God!\" Josh smiled. \"I know many kids in our church didn't get anything for Christmas, or for their birthdays this year...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...

Josh felt that this year VBS can be different and more rewarding to the neighborhood kids as well as the adult volunteers who help with VBS. ( Vacation Bible School)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Josh presented his idea to Father Williams who thought the idea was great. He added ' They just need to sign a release of liability form. Sometimes lawyers are more of a thorn than help. But overall, the idea is great.  Find a couple of other kids to help you organize. If you need extra help, I could ask Deacon Dan to help IF needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh said ' I think that I know two people who can help me. But I will keep Deacon Dan in mind in case I need extra help.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the VBS began. The first 30 minutes were bible stories.  The series was set to last for 4 days...One lesson per day. The first day was about the Good Samaritan who helped the man who was beat up by robbers and left to die. Then the kids went outside for the car wash.<br>\r\nJosh managed to ask Sam, the Center of the high school football team to help as security. Sam brought along one more player to assist him just in case.

Josh easily detected the phony pleas for help from the true need for help..  The car wash had a $10 suggested donation for the local food bank and the Summer Time Toy Drive. Each one would get  50 % of the funds. That way, the needy kids would have more food to eat, and a couple of toys to enjoy playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh made sure that there was no possibility of accidents there.  The fund drive was gong well.  The kids were learning about helping the needy and feeling worthwhile doing it.  Josh realized the cars in line for the car wash was getting long so he divided the single line into three group.  Erin and Earl was having a good time working with Josh and was making new friends at the car wash.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh placed two hard workers as group leaders in group #1 .

Josh nodded but replied ' It is not huge but still noticeable but not too scary for someone your age. She did flex and was satisfied with the size of it. It was not too big but still would WOW the students in her elementary school. She did look like an impressive jock in spite of her age. But she did not look like the SheHulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was now better than Karl in every way. But she was just somewhat better and no superhero. Since Josh counseled her too.  Erin knew how to use her new skills wisely. But she hoped not have to use it too much. She hoped that Karl still had something in him that could change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day arrived and the contest was set to begin in a hour. The contest was closed to most all the public. Karl and Erin met with the referee of the match briefly.  Karl was looking over Erin. He realized that Erin was better than he realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the match began. Josh was the coach in Erin's corner while someone else was the coach in Karl's corner.  Neither Erin or Karl gained much ground in that round.  Josh told Erin to hold back for now. Erin complied with Josh's orders. The same thing occurred in the second round. It looks like the contest could end in a draw unless Josh allow Erin to defeat Karl in a later round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the break, Karl wrote a note to Erin asking something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Nobody else was allowed to come to the match- just those few people..</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was gaining some more confidence now. She was just in the 2nd grade yet she was still standing up against someone maybe twice her age. The 3rd round continued with Erin punching Karl about 3/4 of the time but missing a few times. The punches that connected did hurt Karl although not as much as a punch with metal clips in the gloves. But Josh was not ready for the match to end. Josh wanted to wait until the 7th round. At the end of the 3rd round, there was just a minute break. Josh was encouraging Erin saying ' You can win against him. Don't worry. I will make sure that he won't successfully cheat.' Josh was reading Karl's mind the whole time.  The 4th and 5th round continued as usual. Karl was becoming more and more tired while Erin felt great and refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the 6th round, Karl was now planning to scream a special yell like a bloody banshee-like scream that would rattle almost anyone.  Karl learned the secret scream in Korea. It was successful on all of his opponents.  But Josh simply focused on the mind of Erin, making he fearless against such tactics. Karl was now going all out against Erin, he really wanted to win. Erin managed to dodge many of Karl's moves, punches, and kicks. She was not even tired , injured, or had any pain in her body. She successfully punched and kicked Karl many times. Even though, Karl dodged some of them. NOW he was getting mad.  Even the scream he used on Erin had NO effect on her. In fact, she was even laughing at him. NOW he was getting really really angry that a girl could even last that long against him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the 6th and 7th round,  Karl flexed his muscles in a weak attempt to unnerve Erin. She simply flexed too. Even though it was not as impressive as Karl, it looked great on a 2nd grader. The abs on Erin's stomach looked firmer and harder than a 6 pack.  Karl was now getting really tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the 7th round, Karl tried one more tactic to beat her--making her tired/sleepy. His trainer dowsed chloroform on Karl's gloves.  Josh frowned at Karl's attempt at cheating again. Josh simply made her totally immune to chloroform.  The bell rang. Karl aimed his gloves toward Erin's nose several times. He was also trying to punch it too. He even tried punch her in the jaws but Josh made her dodge left and right every time. Halfway through the 7th round, Karl was covered in sweat and panting. Meanwhile Erin just was barely starting to get tired but had a cheerful smile on her face. Karl made one last attempt to punch her in the abs with every ounce of his strength. He felt that maybe the metal in his gloves would finally hurt her. WACK went the sound of his gloves. But Erin was unhurt and started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Karl was too dizzy and shocked at how good Erin was. He collapses out of exhaustion and fear..Finally somebody from the different gender beat him. The fans on Erin's side was cheering while the referee declared Erin the winner. And Josh was smiling. Erin now had a fan club beginning and she still was humble enough to be her sweet self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[hope you like my two choices..if not, feel free to edit it]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So Josh and Gabe rushed off to watch Erin play. Her martial arts skills would come in handy in the game. After all, she is an expert on that, thanks to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game just started a minute ago. Soon, as the game wore on, Erin was holding back her skills in the first few minutes of the game since she did not want to appear to be a showoff. Yet she made it difficult, although not impossible, for people to get by her.  Her great intuition and skills could almost understand what the other opposing player with the ball was going to do. Many times, she won't let them get far from her. And she looked like a great athlete for someone her age on the team. She knew how to be a teammate, allowing everyone a chance to \"shine\"- if you know what I mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier, the other team was heckling Erin for trying to be on a boy's team. Now they stopped that since Erin proved her merits but they were mad, especially when Erin scored 1 goal in the first half. That helped her team maintain a 2 to 2 tie so far.  Gabe and Josh was cheering for her and her teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the halftime break, Josh 'overheard' the other team's coach who was angry at having a girl score a goal against his team. He was ordering his player to put a 'bounty' on Erin to knock her out of the game with an 'accidental' injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh frowned. He just had to fix that.</span></div></div>",

She was unstoppable.

Erin ran back to the sidelines to \"rest\" a moment, Then Gabe went in to play. Gabe did not want to outshine Erin. But he did not make it easy for the other team either. They tried doing a bounty on him too. There was one low blow on his legs AFTER he kicked the ball toward the goal. Their goalie did stop the ball from going in. But there was a red flag penalty on the Spider player that did it. Gabe was not even hurt. He just shrugged his shoulders and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Gabe got to have a free kick.  Gabe focused on the ball and quickly kicked the ball into the net easily. The game ended with Erin's team winning. Everyone was hugging each other. The other team just nodded their head but refused to shake hands They just left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin and Gabe smiled as they were accepted as part of the team. Josh was slowly bring Gabe and Erin closer together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, Erin met Gabe and Josh at a local park a hour before mass. Erin felt slightly uncomfortable with her muscles. But Gabe and Josh reassured her that her kind personality was more important.  Josh added ' Besides there are people at your school who may need a bodyguard like when Gabe did a few days ago. Consider it God's gift to you to help others.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin commented 'We have been having more people going to mass now. But I haven't been forcing anyone to go, really.' Josh said \" I know that. But people are more interested in God now. Know what, Gabe and I better go now to the parish. The Father has some last minutes instructions for the alter boys.  You can meet us after Mass.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin hugged both Gabe and Josh gently as she went home to change for the church service. Meanwhile Gabe gave back his powers back to Josh since he feared that it was too much to handle. He said ' It is not easy trying to be God.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Mass began with no trouble. Erin was with her parents near the front row. Halfway through mass, there was a big sound outside that was distracting the service.  Gabe looked at Josh in concern.

A lady news reporter appeared on the screen holding a microphone in her hand as she was showing a large crowd standing behind her. The scene appeared to be just a few blocks away from where Erin and Josh were staying at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lost rhino had just been reported as having escaped from the local zoo and the police is trying to contain the loose animal without having to shoot or kill it! We are asking all local residents of the area to stay indoors and to call 9-1-1 if they spot the animal roaming around their street!\u201d the reporter said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s really close to us right here!\u201d Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I bet I can get the rhino to calm down!\u201d Josh said as he stood up. Josh snapped his fingers and his church clothes changed into his soccer jersey, his tennis shoes and socks and his khaki shorts.  \u201cCome, let\u2019s go get that poor rhino before it gets shot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh snapped his fingers again and Erin and Josh were instantly standing outside together, about two blocks away from their house. There was a whole commotion going on just down the street as there were people walking around, looking for the lost rhino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have to go looking for the rhino?\u201d Erin asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. The rhino will come to me. Just watch!\u201d Josh said calmly as he stood in the middle of the street located in the residential area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? The rhino is dangerous! It will just come up to you?\u201d Erin asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! Every animal on earth knows who I am! It comes to worship me! Look, there it is!\u201d Josh grinned as the large rhino came from behind the woods and wandered over to where Josh was standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosh! I\u2019m scared! It looks dangerous!\u201d Erin said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t do anything! The rhino comes to worship me!\u201d Josh said calmly as the rhino wandered up to Josh and lowered its head right before the boy\u2019s feet. Josh reached out and petted the large animal gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood boy!\u201d Josh said as the rhino just stood there, meekly awaiting Josh to give it any orders. \u201cJust stay calm, buddy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, zoo officials came along with two police officers. They came with a cage on a trailer behind a pickup truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo in the cage! Be good!\u201d Josh ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhino turned around and quietly wandered into the cage before the zookeeper closed the steel door on the trailer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I don\u2019t know how you did it, kid, but thanks for calming down the stray rhino!\u201d one of the officers said to Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sir!\u201d Josh grinned, as he waved at the rhino as it was taken away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosh! You never cease to amaze me!\u201d Erin grinned, as a dozen birds landed before Josh\u2019s feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t know me, but the animals do!\u201d Josh grinned, as lizards, birds, owls and squirrels and stopped and paused in front of Josh\u2019s feet. \u201cAlright, guys! Go on! Shooo!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the animals left as Josh commanded before Josh snapped his fingers, teleporting him and Erin back into the house\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What should I do?\u201d Melissa said to Josh. \u201cCan I help her like this, dressed in my normal clothes?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right\u2026 Well, I guess you need to look like a superheroine from now on, Melissa!\u201d Josh smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her dress and shoes vanished and she transformed into the exact likeness of Supergirl! Melissa was now wearing light blue tights with long sleeves showing the \u201cS\u201d emblem over her chest. She wore a red skirt with a yellow belt over it and she had long, red boots which came just past her knees. Lastly, she had a long, red cape which started from her blue shirt and was draped over her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Look at me! This costume is amazing!\u201d she gasped as she examined her new outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa! There is no time! Go help that lady down the street!

Yes!\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without thinking, she leaped into the air and flew towards the woman, who was being assaulted by a masked man, who had ripped her handbag from her arm and started running towards the car. The man got in the car and started driving away when Supergirl swooped down from the sky and landed a few feet in front of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere!\u201d she shouted, as she extended her arms and stopped the car in its tracks! The hood of the car slammed into Supergirl\u2019s mighty hands, stopping it on a dime and denting the entire front hood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shouted something out loud as he frantically got out of the car and pulled out a gun. He immediately started shooting at her, but all the bullets bounced off Supergirl\u2019s invulnerable chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl then took a deep breath and blew cold air at him, freezing the gun. She didn\u2019t have to do anything else since the police had arrived on the scene and arrested the man on the spot for robbery. Supergirl then leaped in the air and flew away as one of the officers grabbed the stolen handbag and returned it to the lady who was standing on the sidewalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how did I do?\u201d Supergirl said as she returned to where Josh was standing. She landed right next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you make a great Supergirl, Melissa! You were awesome!\u201d Josh smiled. Any boy would be honored to be friends with you now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, can you walk me home then, every day?\u201d she asked him quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?

Josh spotted that she was talking with Sean's dad over coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a little creepy,\" said Sean's dad. Josh didn't need his heightened senses and omnipotence to hear that. Sean heard it too. \"Sean's 13 years old. He should be hanging out with kids his age.\" Sean stopped to eavesdrop and Josh joined him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh is his only friend, honey,\" said Sean's mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" said Sean's father, \"Josh is 10. Sean should be hanging out with other teens, checking out girls, you know, being a teenager. Not playing around like a little kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear, isn't it a little early to be worrying about that? Just because he's 13 and looks a bit older than that doesn't mean he should be forced into growing up. Give him some time, maybe it's just a phase,\" said Sean's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean looked at Josh curiously and Josh shrugged. Once they walked outside, Josh teleported the two friends to the entrance to the mall. \"Why didn't you just take us inside?\" asked Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to give everybody a heart attack when two people just appear out of nowhere,\" said Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right,\" said Sean. The two entered the large mall. There were people of all ages and all walks of life walking around, just like any typical mall. The kids and teenagers of the town liked hanging out here, also like any typical mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking, a group of guys Sean's new age spotted them. \"Hey, look at the freak!\" said one, refering to Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, retard,\" said another. They said other things that were even ruder and they laughed. Josh could see behind the facade and saw how insecure they all were. He saw how scared and doubtful they were and it surprised him. Josh would've never guessed that was how a 13-year-old felt deep down inside. He never would've guessed that these teenagers made fun of someone else because they themselves were so insecure and unsure with themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked off, laughing. \"See ya, crybaby,\" said one as a parting remark. Josh looked at Sean. There were tears in his eyes and he started sobbing. Josh didn't need his powers to tell that Sean had been hurt. That much was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sean, are you alright?\" asked Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember now what my life's like,\" said Sean, \"you know, now that I'm 13... It's horrible, Josh. You're my only friend and everyone laughs at me at school. I'm beat up a lot and they all make fun of me...\" He cried a bit. \"I thought being 3 years older would be fun. I always thought I'd be so much more awesome when I'm older. I never thought it would be this bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Sean,\" said Josh, \"I didn't think of how your life would change when I made you older...\"</span></div></div>",

He was really sharp and he always noticed everything. Sean was also an avid reader of books and comics. Needless to say, Sean had a massive comic book collection, which he inherited from his father and from his grandfather. He had gained boxes filled with literally thousands of comic books, which were each wrapped neatly in plastic bags and thin cardboard. Some of them were over forty years old!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh closed his eyes and concentrated on his friend when he snapped his fingers and focused on being at Sean's house.

Josh decided not to teleport into Sean's bedroom just yet, because this was the first time he went to his friend's house since he gained his powers and he didn't want to scare him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean opened the door and smiled right away. Sean was a few inches taller than Josh, and slightly more athletic. Sean had short, black hair and blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Josh! That's a surprise! Come on in!\" he said, as he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean and Josh walked into the house where Sean led his buddy into his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

Are you reading some of your comic books?\" Josh asked him, as he walked over to the bed and picked up one of the issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I found one of the issues of Superman from 1948... It's really old!\" Sean grinned. \"Superman is such an awesome hero! I wish he were real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up at his buddy, who was standing next to the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you would make a good Superman!

What's going on?\" Sean wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sean's muscles hardened! He felt his strength increase all over as every muscle started to inflate! His chest bulged out and his quads and calves gained more definition. His stomach gained washboard abs and his arms became muscular!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the---?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh continued reading the comic book as Sean saw his shirt and jeans disappear. He was standing in his room wearing just his underwear when a thick, strong, stretchy blue-colored material like a body-suit began to cover his body. Red boots covered his feet up to his knees while a long, red cape draped over his broad shoulders. A red-and-yellow \"S\" symbol appeared on his broad chest as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, Sean was looking exactly like a teenage version of Superman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOSH! Look... Look at me!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked up and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Just like in the comic book!\" he laughed. \"I got it right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But... I... How...?\" Sean stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go outside so you can fly around and try out your new powers?\" Josh suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean was completely astounded. Powers????<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instantly his dress pants change into a pair of board shorts, his shirt changes into a t-shirt &amp; his dress shoes change into sandles. He makes the short walk to the beach &amp; sees his best friend Chase a 10 year old surfer. Chase is currently surfing &amp; is looking for the next wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decides to help him out &amp; uses his powers to create the perfect, massive wave for surfing. As he imagines it, a massive wave starts forming. Chase sees it &amp; swims right for it. Chase mounts his board &amp; surfs riding it all the way to shore. Arriving at the shore, Chase waves &amp; says, \"surfs up dude! Did you see that wave? That was awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh replied, \"I did. I created that wave.\" Chase replied, \"no way. You couldn't have!\" Josh decides to prove it but how should he do it. Josh having all the knowlege &amp; knowing where everything, knows there is a large pirate ship that sunk centuries ago five &amp; a half miles off the coast. Josh says, \"there is a pirate ship that sunk with tons of gold out in the ocean. Why don't we go get the gold &amp; use it to help people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase replied, \"How would you know that? We can't get to it. It's on the bottom of the ocean.\" Josh takes a deep breath &amp; blows directly at the ocean. The ocean water immediatly begins dividing creating a passage way into the ocean with walls of water on both sides. Josh then commands the walls of water to stay like that &amp; stops blowing. Chase stunned says, \"this is like Moses &amp; the Israelites! This is so cool! Lets go see if there is gold there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh &amp; Chase run down the path into ocean as sharks, whales &amp; other fish swim on the other side of the walls of water. A little while later they come across the ship. Once they climb aboard &amp; see how much gold there is, Chase asks, \" how are going to get all the gold back ashore to my house to help people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do they move the gold?</span></div></div>",
