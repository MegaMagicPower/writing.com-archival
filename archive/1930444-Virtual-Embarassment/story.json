As soon as the device was turned on, they entered the game's hub. The two looked at each other and noticed that their avatars look exactly like them even down to the clothes they were wearing. Mackenzie was wearing a blue blouse with 3 buttons from the top, beige khaki shorts and white sneakers. Selena was wearing a black T-shirt that said Zerg Rush!, a pair of navy jeans and brown sandals. <br>\r\n\"Whoa\" they said in unison, \"We look practically like we're IRL. They got every detail right. Wait. Did they even get the underwear right?\" They both checked their pants. \"Yep\" they said.<br>\r\n\"Well what do we do first?\" Said Mackenzie as a unique NPC came down and greeted them. <br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is LUCI,\" said the unique NPC girl,\" I am supposed to be a computer player but in this beta, I shall be your introduction to this world.\" The unique part of the NPC is that girl seemed very clumsy as she fell a lot in the few moments that they met not to mention she was pretty cute.<br>\r\n\"Here is the first area, the Arena,\" said LUCI, \"Here a variety of in game sports are played from real world sports to gladiator fights to races to an interesting shooting arena. You can also bet on each of the events and through the registration, you can participate in the actual matches. The matches do require that participants put down an object to bet as a penalty to loss.\" <br>\r\n\"Next, we have the casino. It is a large facility which you spend the credits for the chance of greater funds. You are given 1000 credits at first but if you lose it all, you can sell your inventory though beware as you cannot get it back if you sell it.\"<br>\r\n\"Here we have the games' main market, The Mall. Anything that you can buy in game, you can buy here though some stuff is in low quantity. There are plenty of high buyers here too if you look around.\"<br>\r\n\"Past this gate are the dangerous fields surrounding the city. You can hunt monsters here and take the loot to sell in the Mall.

Mackenzie decided to check out the local stores. <br>\r\nA few hours later, Mackenzie comes back and looks for Selena. She gets a tad sidetracked and gambles a little bit<br>\r\n\"Dang it\" said Selena at a nearby table. Mackenzie came over. \"What's up Selena?\"<br>\r\n\"Um well,\" Selena struggled to say, \" It seems I lost all my money.\"<br>\r\n\"How did you lose 1000 credits in a few hours? I just had a spending spree and I only spent 300 credits and that is including the inn fare.\" Said Mackenzie.<br>\r\n\"Well it just disappeared after I started betting.\" Said Selena. \"Anyhow, can you lend me some credits? I don't even got enough for the inn.\"<br>\r\n \"No way!\" replied Mackenzie, \"Why don't you just sell some of your inventory?\"<br>\r\n \"What could I possibly have in my inventory?!\" said Selena angrily, \"Wait! You don't mean..\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mackenzie, \"If you have no money and you don't have any extra loot, then I guess you can convert your clothes into credits. Or you could try hunting?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't have the gear to go hunting so I guess I have to convert my clothes.\" said Selena. \"Then what will I wear?!\"<br>\r\n\"Well with the excess, you can buy the cheap clothes,\"said Mackenzie,\" though I hear they don't have good durability values like our clothes. \" <br>\r\n\"I guess I have no choice.\" said Selena. she opened up her inventory screen and unequipped her shirt and went to the convert screen. The black t-shirt suddenly vanished and instantly tried to cover her unveiled black lacy bra. She then, place the shirt in the conversion box and it estimated a value of 4000 credits. As she press the \"Deal\" icon, the shirt vanished from her inventory giving away any chance to turn back and cover herself<br>\r\n\"Nice.\" Selena said, \"I think I could keep gambling to get my money back.\" <br>\r\n\"What was that?\" asked Mackenzie<br>\r\n\"Nothing, \" said Selena, \"It's just that I can buy a new shirt now too.

She was astonished by the fact that she lost 11000 credits in a day. She not only converted her shirt to credits but her pants(6000) and had just converted her shoes into 2000 credits so she could afford to go to the inn. It was so embarrassing for her to walk down the city streets in her underwear even if she was stealthily sneaking around the whole time. No clothing stores besides the lingerie store were open so she couldn't buy more covering wear. She decided to buy clothes tomorrow. <br>\r\nThe inn owner laughed in her face as some guys oogled at her while drinking some beer. She still was stuck there for a good 20 minutes as the innkeeper looked around for the room key. By the time she got to her room, she desperately needed a session alone. <br>\r\nThe next morning, she headed to the mall. She wrapped herself in the inn's bathrobe and headed out but soon discovered that if taken too far, the robe would teleport to the inn. She quickly hid into the bushes and discovered that her underwear gained a couple new holes. She decided to run into the clothing store she saw last night.<br>\r\n\"Didn't you read the sign\" said the shopkeeper, \" No shoes, No shirt, No service. Seeing as you have neither, you're definitely getting no service.\"<br>\r\n\"But....\" Said Selena.<br>\r\n\"No but's, \" said the shopkeeper. <br>\r\n\"Fine. I'll go somewhere else\" said Selena. She did but each of the shopkeepers said the same thing. Finally, she ended up at the same one she first went into.<br>\r\n\"Can you please let me buy some clothes?\" she asked with puppy dog eyes. The shopkeeper still said no except this time he offered an exception with some requirements.\"You're pretty good-looking,\" said the shopkeeper. \"Here's what I'll do. I'll let you buy some clothes, if you be my window display model for a few hours. Just put on this special suit and stand in the window. It can change the appearance of it to whatever I want.\" <br>\r\n\"No way,\" said Selena, \" You'll just put me in something super revealing.\" As she left the store, a weird guy called her over. \"Hey, I can get you some really good clothes for cheap,\" whispered the guy.<br>\r\nWhat did Selena does?</span></div></div>",

They're worth 3000 normally.

Even though the other people at the table were oogling at her, she couldn't win a big enough pool to recover from her losses. She still got plenty of stares as she left the table.<br>\r\nShe converted her shoes into currency and stayed at the nearby inn. The way the innkeeper stared at her was very embarrassing. She decided in the morning to go buy some new shoes and shirt. Luckily, she easily found one though the shirt was tight. It was a white button-up blouse and the cheapest clothes they had. As she headed to do something else in the world, a mysterious NPC asked her to play a game. It was a cup game and she found no issue with it. All the NPC asked for was a single coin. At first, the cups shifted pretty slowly and easy to keep track of. Suddenly, the cup moved extremely fast that she couldn't keep track of it. When they finally stopped, she had no idea which one it was so she guessed randomly. Unfortunately, it was wrong. The NPC asked \"Do you want to try again? There is no additional cost.\"<br>\r\nSelena, figuring she had nothing to lose with trying again, tried again. The cups did the same as before and she couldn't track the cup so she guessed again. Selena kept trying 10 more times. Then, she noticed something. She thought, \"I'm not sure but are my clothes getting tighter?\" Selena's clothes did seem more exposing. Her midriff was now visible, and her jeans were more form-fitting showing the curvature of her butt. There was also much tension in the buttons of her blouse. Selena tried once more to confirm and failed once again. Suddenly, the top button from her blouse and the button from her jeans bursted off. It eased the pressure from both of them but, much more cleavage was shown and her jeans were harder to hold though the did rest on her butt. \"What the hell is going on?\" she asked the NPC.<br>\r\n\"Well, well.\"said the NPC, \"Seems like my trick was finally revealed. Though most women give up before it gets to this point, you were quite stubborn and kept trying. Each time, the patron fails to guess correctly I shrink their equipment while each time they win, I enlarge their equipment. Normally, I get away with more cleavage revealed or a shorter skirt to see under. Luckily, you were stubborn enough to keep playing and I'm seeing more than usual. So will you continue to play? If you don't want to play anymore, your clothes will stay the same, but if you play more, your clothes will change their size.\"<br>\r\nSelena didn't want her clothes to shrink more but she couldn't afford a new set of clothes without selling at least one of her original clothes. Even then, underwear is really expensive.</span></div></div>",

So my theory seems to be correct.\"<br>\r\nAnd since she guessed wrong, her clothes shrank even more. The jeans no longer needed the button to be held up, and the topmost and lowest button on her blouse were about to burst off. She hadn't considered her underwear but it was shrinking too.

She tried the game again to lose on purpose but she won again. She kept on trying but she kept on winning. By the time she stopped, her blouse became a dress and her pants and panties were too big to wear. Her breasts were now display and her very long sleeves made it difficult to cover up. \"What the hell is going on?\" she asked the NPC as she put away her bra, panties, and jeans.<br>\r\n\"Why nothing patron?\" replied the NPC, \"You are merely lucky. Though if you want, I can return your clothes to normal size in exchange for your pants.\"<br>\r\n\"Why my pants?\" asked Selena.<br>\r\n\"Since it is an original item, it has a lot of value.\" said the NPC, \"It should cover the fee\"<br>\r\nSelena...</span></div></div>",

Failure on the other hand was incredibly costly, doubling the damage level down to .5% at lowest. For a lot of equipment, this basically made it useless and it was irreparable by normal means.

You do that by selecting the item in your inventory and placing the bet marker in the object. You are not required to remove it if it is currently equipped though. It will be teleported off you if you lose.\" said the receptionist.<br>\r\nMackenzie pondered this for a bit. She had yet to buy anything ingame so she only had the clothes on her back. Which one should I bet? She thought. In the end she decided to bet her bra as that would be the least embarrassing to lose.<br>\r\n\"Now that you entered the current ladder, you will be randomly entered in a team. You are on a blue team so put on this. This special suit is representative of your hit points. If it is finished, you lose. If all of your team loses, you lose your ante and have to leave the ladder unless you've won your previous matches. Your first match is in 15 minutes.\" said the receptionist as she handed Mackenzie the suit and the gun. <br>\r\nMackenzie quickly headed to the locker room and changed into the suit. She headed over to the arena gate. She was warped to the arena and met her teammates. Her teammates were  11 girls of all different figures but still fairly attractive in the blue skintight suits. The enemies would be clad in red. The announcer sounded, \" T minus 10, 9, 8....\" The excitement was building intensely and adrenaline was rushing. Then,the buzzer sounded and they rushed into the battlefield. This battlefield seems to be some sort of office building with numerous hallways and cubicles. She and a blonde girl were sticking together. Suddenly, two girls in red appeared around the corner and started firing. Mackenzie ran for cover but still felt some stings on her body after behind the wall. She tried rubbing the stinging parts and noticed that she felt some bare skin there. There were some holes in the suit there. She looked back at her teammate who was still in the firefight and noticed that more of her suit was vanishing. Then, she realized what is meant by the suit representing your hit points. It meant that it was going to dissolve the more you got shot. Her teammate had already lost most of her jacket and some of her pants, and her  sleek onepiece underwear was now very visible and starting to gain some holes. Mackenzie decided to join in the firefight.</span></div></div>",

She really did not want to lose again now. <br>\r\nThe timer sounded off to signal the beginning of the match.

The players all seemed to be male; the girls reasoned that macho, manly types wanted to enjoy the combat while the girls enjoyed the shopping and the socialising. As each player finished speaking with the NPC, a shroud of light surrounded them, hiding them from view. A moment later they reappeared, covered in either shiny steel armour or else a purple robe emblazoned with stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladies.\" the NPC greeted them. \"Before you explore The Wilderness, you must first choose your class. Will you be a melee warrior, or a caster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A love a good tank.\" admitted McKenzie. \"I'll be a warrior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be a caster, then, so that we're a balanced team.\" agreed Selena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls visions were temporarily blinded by the shroud of light that surrounded them. As it disappeared, however, they noticed that all the men seemed to be staring at them. A couple even wolf whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcKenzie looked down first. Whereas the male warrior outfit was made of full-body steel plate, the female version was made up of a chainmail bikini, and a pair of supple leather boots. The bottoms were basically a triangle of metal attached by chainmail strings around the sides and back to make a thong, while the top was essentially the same but with two triangles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe caster outfit, meanwhile, provided Selena with a wide-brimmed wizards hat and a purple one-piece swimsuit. It was not a conservative one, however; similar to the \"mankini\" seen in Borat, the material covered her nipples with a thin strips of material reaching up and around her neck from her crotch. It, too, was a thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the ****?\" Selena screamed, the in-game censor hiding her words as her hands tried to hide her assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't armour!\" McKenzie agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has the same armour rating as the males.\" the NPC replied quizzically, as though unable to understand their objection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical sexist male fantasy.\" muttered McKenzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair decide to...</span></div></div>",

If she stayed there, the guards would no doubtly fine her. Then, there was a new prompt, saying you can directly convert inventory items into gold if you don't have enough. At first, she didn't realize what the game meant by inventory items but she realized the clothes on her back were counted as inventory items.

Slowly, Heather caught her breath, before giddily starting to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I did it!</i> she thought, <i>I mean, of course I did it! None of those hacks were about to catch me!</i> She rose to her feet shakily, taking a second to remember to actually <i>wear</i> her ill-gotten garment.

Stealth skill rank up!\" - but as realization hit her eyes got wide, then her brow furrowed while a sinister grin spread out beneath. The game was rewarding her for stealing from it? And she could get better at stealing from it? Seemed a bit backwards to Heather, but as she steepled her fingers, plots a-brewing in her head, she wasn't about to complain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display scrolled down further, showing her that she'd unlocked two new abilities- Lockpick, and Pickpocket. Heather pondered the other rows of shops, run mostly by NPCs, and how easily she could get into their store rooms if she could get past their locks. Alternatively, other players had been willing to turn on her as a thief; why shouldn't she target them as well with her Pickpocket ability? Either way, she could only imagine what was in store. Top-tier items... exclusive armor and weapons... underwear... it was all Heather's for the taking, assuming she could get good enough! She just had to pick her target...</span></div></div>",

So when they heard about a contest for a virtual reality MMO beta signup, they immediately signed up. Luckily they were among the 100 winners and won the trip to the companies' office where the beta test will take place.<br>\r\nThe morning after their arrival they headed to the company's office. Soon, the company directed them to a room with five futuristic chairs with headsets. They looked very comfy.<br>\r\n\"This is the specially made device to give the user the absolutely best experience in this new MMO that we have designed\" said the company representative, \"The chair is designed for the most comfort and best integration of the user. When you sit down and strap in the device, you will enter the game. Your essential bodily functions will be taken care but your conscious will be fully immersed into the game. You will be staying in this room for  2 days but the in-game time will be accelerated so that it will be 20 days that you'll experience.
