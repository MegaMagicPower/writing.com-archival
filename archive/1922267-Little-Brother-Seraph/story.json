            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a normal spring morning for Jake as he slowly woke up. It was Saturday, so he hadn't set his alarm, and instead just let himself wake up on his own. He was fifteen, and he lived in a normal suburban home with his family; which was his two parents and his ten-year old brother Gabe. Jake himself was normal height for his age, with an athletic and toned build, slightly sweeping brown hair, a tanned complexion and brown eyes. He went to high school, Grade 9, and his brother was in elementary at Grade 5, all very basic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes he felt awake enough to get out of bed, which he promptly did. Jake quickly made his way to the bathroom where he stripped off his red pyjama pants, he didn't wear a shirt to bed, and showered. A couple moments later he was clean, dried off, and dressed in a t-shirt and his pyjama pants, with boxers on underneath now. He wanted to relax, so he hadn't changed too much. Either way with that done he trotted down the stairs to make breakfast for himself, and saw his little brother Gabe in the living room watching TV and texting. Despite that lazy look, Gabe was quite athletic too, with short, slightly messy brown hair, and brown eyes as well, and he was currently wearing blue pyjama pants and a white t-shirt. \"Hey Jake,\" he said distractedly, to which Jake replied in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was halfway through his bowl of cereal when the doorbell rang. He quickly made his way to the door and opened it... only to find nobody. There wasn't anyone in sight, not even on the street. Well, there was someone walking their dog, but they were way to far away to have rung the doorbell. He was about to disregard it as a prank when he looked down and saw a small brown parcel. It was addressed to their household, though not to a specific person within it, and possessed no return address, but did at least have stamps. \"Since when is there mail on Saturday,\" Jake muttered, bringing the package into the dining room table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining room linked right into the living room where his brother was, and he came in when he saw Jake come back. \"What's that?\" Gabe asked, sounding just as curious as Jake felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea. Let's open it,\" Jake replied eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly tore off the wrapping paper to reveal a white wooden box, sort of like a jewelery box, with a hinged top and gold trim all over and a symbol on the lid like a six-pointed starburst. When Jake opened the lid he saw a glass orb inside, resting on a gold cloth. It was perfectly round and smooth, crystal clear and it seemed to contain some kind of golden light. It was quite beautiful really, but he would never admit that for fear of sounding feminine. \"So... what's the point of this?\" he asked, taking it out of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see?\" asked Gabe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jake replied with a shrug, handing the orb off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gabe turned it over in his hands it really did look like nothing more than a pretty little trinket. So Jake simply went back to eating while his brother looked it over. A couple seconds Gabe made a slight sound of surprise. \"It turns,\" he muttered, twisting the top and bottom of the orb in opposite directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later Gabe pulled apart the orb into two halves and the light inside shimmered for a moment in the open air before shooting right into the boy. For a moment both brothers seemed stunned at what had happened, then Gabe's whole body pulsed with white light, or maybe energy. \"I think you should move back,\" Gabe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't seem to be affected by the energy at all, and in fact he sounded invigorated when he spoke. And because of this Jake wasn't sure if he should take his brother seriously. Besides, he wasn't really sure what was happening and wanted to be close in case something bad happened. \"I can't,\" Jake replied as Gabe's body pulsed again, \"We have no idea what's going on, and I should be close so I can be ready if this goes bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No seriously, I feel like you should probably move back a bit,\" insisted Gabe, sounding more serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Jake only want to move closer. It was clear from the way Gabe was talking, like he knew what was happening when he shouldn't and of course the actual pulsing that something was very wrong. Neither boy had much more time to react as white light suddenly shone from Gabe's body; shimmering across his body as waves of warmth and power emanated from him. Jake couldn't even look at his brother, the light was too bright, and the waves of power that emanated from him were each like getting a giant basketball thrown into his chest. Then it felt like a stone one was thrown at his head and he collapsed to the floor in unconsciousness.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"Brother?\" came Gabe's voice through the darkness of Jake's unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm,\" groaned Jake, feeling sore all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wake up brother,\" Gabe said, his voice sounding slightly higher, sweeter and more charming than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm awake, I'm awake,\" Jake mumbled, slowly opening his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two things he noticed as he did so. The first was that he was laying down on the couch in the living room. The second was that Gabe was standing beside him, and looking completely unlike he'd ever seen him. While it was still clearly his younger brother, there were a number of things that were different. First of all his hair, though not much different in style, was now light blond in colour, and looked extremely soft. Second of all his eyes were blue like the summer sky and currently concerned looking. Third of all his features were smoother and fairer than before, making him look slightly younger and, while Gabe was always called cute, he now looked downright adorable, possessing a childish beauty that not even Jake could deny. Furthermore Gabe's athletic body, though still very athletic and toned, seemed smoother and softer. To top it all off his complexion had changed, no longer was he tanned, but instead possessing fair, creamy skin that was completely unblemished by freckles, scars and birthmarks. And Jake could see all of this because Gabe's clothes had changed too; he now wore a simple white exomis that covered only a little of the right side of his chest and was open enough on the right to show most of his right leg. Still it covered the important things, but it seemed to be the only thing he was wearing, except for possibly extremely simple underwear, and a pair of gold bracers on his wrists and just above his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, and probably most obviously, Gabe now possessed six magnificent white wings extending from his back, and an additional pair jutting out backwards from just over his ears, but they seemed more for looks than anything else. And his entire body gave off a slight, but warm glow. It was undeniable what he was; Gabe had become an angel. Not just any angel, but a seraph, if Jake remembered his fantasy correctly. \"Gabe?\" Jaked asked, not sure what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabriel,\" corrected his brother sweetly, \"But yes, it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the Seraphic Orb,\" Gabriel explained, \"I don't know much more about it, but I absorbed the energy from within and I was transformed into this. You were rendered unconscious due to being too close to me during the change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" was all Jake could say, barely able to believe what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to though, because the proof was staring right at him. He even pinched himself to make sure he wasn't asleep, and he wasn't. He hadn't even bothered to mention Gabriel's slightly different tone and way of speaking, but he'd noticed it. \"I told you twice to stand away, I really hope no harm has befallen you,\" the angel said, looking him up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Gabriel,\" Jake assured, \"How did you get me over here anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that was quite easy,\" replied Gabriel, \"My strength has been greatly increased by becoming an angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it like being a seraph?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible!\" replied the angel, \"Watch this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even the slightest effort Gabriel rose into the air and hovered there, about six inches off the floor, his wings only slightly moving. \"Come on brother, let's go flying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, hang on,\" Jake said, grabbing his brother's arm and marveling at how soft and strong it felt at the same time, \"We need to decide what to tell mom and dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do not worry brother, I can disguise my form if you think it appropriate to hide my state from our parents,\" assured Gabriel with a smile. \"But come, we can decide on that after a quick fly around town. Please brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amusing that, despite now being many times greater than him, Gabriel still looked up to Jake. Unfortunately the sight of his brother's angelic face caused him to crumple like paper and he sighed out a \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Gabriel led him outside and actually picked him up, holding him horizontally, before rising into the sky and beginning to fly, his wings flapping gently as he went. \"So brother, should we go somewhere?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm...Well, maybe we could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was cut mid-sentence, as something flashed by them, passing them by dangerously close. Gabriel looked around and saw something flying towards them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure flashed by them, close enough to graze Gabriel's wing. Jake held onto his younger brother because of the fact that they were flying mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the heck was that!?\"  Jake said, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but it's coming back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure turned around and started flying back towards them. Gabriel knew he can't fight without the chance of his older brother getting hurt in the process. He dodged the attack as he quickly landed on the rooftop of their house, gently setting Jake down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to try and fight this fiend. You'll be safe here.\" Gabriel said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just nodded as Gabriel took to the air again. Jake watched as his little brother went toe-to-toe with the mystery enemy, ramming each other in the sky. It wasn't long until Gabriel grabbed hold of the creature and began flying towards the house. It was a quick descent, stopping just inches away from the surface of the roof. Then, he slammed the creature hard onto the surface, one hand on both wings, and the other on the neck. Jake could see the creature clearly now, a harpy. It had bright brown feathers, sharp talons on its legs and arms, a pair of wings on it's back, and a slightly feathered face of a pretty girl with brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go! I said let me go, darn it!\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you explain your reason for attacking us!\" Gabriel said, keeping a firm hold on the harpy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because! Y-you must be evil, kidnapping an innocent guy like him! I won't let you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? We...No! We're brothers!.\" Jake said, sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you...You're brothers? So then, you weren't trying to kidnap him or something?\" she said, calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, miss. I was transformed into a seraph just recently. My brother and I received it in a package just a few hours ago, and we were heading off to see the extend of my new-found abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Well, uh...This is awkward. I'm sorry for attacking you guys, cause...Well, it's sorta hard to explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriel released her as she introduced herself as Ramona. She was transformed a week ago under the same conditions, and seemed rather excited and happy about her new powers. Then, just a couple days ago, she heard that one of her friends were transformed into a chimera, again through some kind of orb. They met up somewhere and discussed about the whole thing, and decided to call them the Orbs of Myth, since they turn people into Mythological creatures. They then thought about how some people might decide to use these powers for their own personal gain, and decided to stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Yeah. Right now, it's just me and Jerry, and he's having some split-personality issues...And, um...I think that's about it.\" Ramona explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Sounds like you don't know any more than we do about these orbs...\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it would be best to try and gather more information about these orbs. But without any leads, we cannot gather any information.\" Gabriel said, thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'll go home for now. Besides, it would be best for you to know what powers you have.\" Ramona said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey bade farewell as Ramona flew off. Jake and Gabriel looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So brother, where shall we both go?\" Gabriel asked.</span></div></div>",

You're in a family of four; yourself, your mom, your dad, and your younger brother Gabriel who's ten. You all get along like any normal Western world family. However one day you receive a package; a glass orbs that seems to contain pure light. Not really understanding what it is you show it to your brother, who discovers that it can be twisted open and he absorbs the energy within and is promptly transformed from a human boy into a mighty seraph; a six-winged angel of immense power. As an angel your brother possesses great power, and soon must put it to work as the two of you discover the existence of other Orbs of Myth; other items which can transform humans into mythical beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can choose to follow the more action-adventure oriented story, or look into the interactions between Jake and Gabriel now that the latter is an angel. There is going to be some mythical creature transformation in this, but don't overdo it. This isn't a transformation-erotica story, this is about using the story mechanic in a more serious light (though feel free to add some comedy).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso to be clear; this is an angel in the fantasy sense, such as you might find in Dungeons and Dragons, this is not a Judeo-Christian angel. Any gods mentioned must be fictional, and polytheistic (meaning there're more than just one). You have freedom to set up the exact mythos however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso rules...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Correct spelling and grammar<br>\r\n-Make sure chapters have substance, and that doesn't mean a specific paragraph limit, but there should be more happening than just a one or two line bland description<br>\r\n-Romance is fine, kissing and hugging is fine, leading up to sex is fine, but use the 'fade-to-black' mechanic to skip over the specifics<br>\r\n-Don't be <i>too</i> violent<br>\r\n-No abrupt endings<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI believe that's it.</td>",
