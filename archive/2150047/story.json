Abort the Project!\u201d shouted the lead Illumati scientist as he rushed into the main lab chamber. \u201cRin Okumera and that bitch from the Vatican will be hear any moment. Burn and delete everything!\u201d Everywhere scientists were scrambling to erase any evidence of their research. Meanwhile the sounds of screaming low-level demons echoed into the chamber, as well as the sounds of swords clanging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d shouted one of the engineers as he pointed to the case in the center of the room. \u201cWhat should we do about the artifact?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of us will have to try and escape with it!\u201d proclaimed the lead scientist. \u201cEven were it not indestructible, it is the key focus of our project and I\u2019ll be damned if it falls into the hands of the exorcists.\u201d He rushed over to the display case and quickly removed the glass, but just as he was about to take it, blue flames erupted from the main entrance as a glowing figure in a school uniform glided into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone drop your guns.\u201d Rin said with a triumphant smile and sword drawn. \u201cThey can\u2019t kill me anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood because we need you alive!\u201d The sicentitst smirk as he and all five combat personel in the room drew their weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half demon laughed and raised him palm. \u201cSAITAIN MELT!\u201d he shouted as all six guns became enveloped in blue flames, forcing those wielding them to let go. <br>\r\n\u201cNice work Rin!\u201d cried the ever scantily dressed Shura Kirigakure as she entered the room, sword resting over her shoulder. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t even have to kill a single one of these low lives. Great work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before reinforcements showed up to take the captured soldiers and scientist into the Orders custody. It was during this time that Rins eyes fell upon the open display case in the center of the room. On it rested a necklace with black string and a bright blue gem.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sweet!\u201d the exorcist said with a grin as his tail perked up, \u201cI bet this would look great on me.\u201d Without any moment\u2019s hesitations or causation, Rin yanked the necklace from its stand and placed it around his neck. Upon doing this that Rin felt a jolt through his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRin take that off.\u201d Yelled Shura who had finally taken notice of what Rin was doing. \u201cYou god dame idiot!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he shrugged. \u201cIts just a dumbass neckless. I can take it off right now.  Rin tugged at the strings of the necklace only to find that for whatever reason he could not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit Shura I think this thing might be cursed.\u201d<br>\r\nShura smashed her palm against her face and moaned. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the academy\u201d she grumbled. \u201cMephestio will probably know how to remove it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                                            ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know how to remove it!?\u201d Shura yelled looking completely dumbfounded.  <br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d the demonic headmaster chimed. \u201cJust have the Mr. Okumera keep an eye on him.  I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Shura caught a sinister but subtle hint of Sarcasm in his last sentence as if he knew exactly what that neckless was and what to expect from it. It could have just been her overall mistrust of him that made her come to that conclusion but still, for a moment she thought she got a smirk on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin yawned and stretched out his arms. \u201cAnyways I better split. This necklace looks good on me anyway. I won\u2019t even tell anyone it might be cursed.\u201d Thus the story of Rin and blue stone around his neck began. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rin's body desperate to retain form as the flames of his demon heart threaten to consume him, his sword demolished and no longer able to seal it away. Shiemi cries out to Yukio to stop as Amaimon holds her back from interfering with his father Satan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not yet! I won't give up yet!\"</i> Rin declared in his hazy mind as his physical body began to weaken, on the brink of turning to ash. <i>\"I will make that idiot realize just how much he means to me when I punch Yukio in his flaming four-eyed face!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet a star of hope had shined down on him in this second. A miracle for his mortal coil, for what should have turned to cinders so his demon heart could manifest in Assiah and his new demon flesh could materialize in the world of men still lived. His daemonic heart veiled in fire did indeed grace the cold world. Yet Rins human body still remained alive as the heart burst forth, flame embracing it as blue fire manifest in Rins heart sized hole to sustain him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis demonic heart throbbed with power as flesh materialized from the sapphire flames. Albino skin and snow white hair donning a carbon copy of Rin's features. His horns now a singular mighty V of flame perpetually manifest. The second Rin smiling as he gazed down at his body. The two Rins connected by chests rippling with fire \"I feel amazing! Power coursing through me!\" The ego of Rin loved his the new sensations as he had a true body coursing with his power. The eyes of others drinking in the sight. Too engrossed by the happenings to care he was naked as the day he was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhistling Amaimon looked surprised \"Whoa~\" Bon shaking Konekos in shock as he saw Rin was fine.<br>\r\nShiemi could only mutter \"Rin?\" in surprise.<br>\r\nYukio was still walking over to Shima as he saw the sight. \"What in the world.\"<br>\r\n<b>\"I never expected this either! This is a really amusing development!\"</b> Satan said in amusement from Yukio's eyes.<br>\r\n\"That is fine and all but lets hurry please before something happens and we both get caught!\" Shima was worried Bon would give him crap for still doing his spy job even now. Not like he could understand the thrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before *huff* anything *huff* else\" The original, who was still on his knees looked at his other half with will even with weakened body. \"Go *huff* stop *huff* Yukio.\" Human!Rin couldn't even tell him to punch Yukio in the face, but the smile that crept across the albino demon!Rin informed that he understood. Yukio had arrived at the helicopter ladder just as he did, ready to hold tight as him and Shima prepare to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my brother Yukio! So you should accept what I'm gonna do!\" Demon Rin jumped over with astonishingly force. A small shockwave produced as he quickly slammed down on top of Yukio, his head nearly colliding with the cement till Demon!Rin gripped his face inches away from the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Whined Shima as Demon!Rin grabbed him by his collar and dragged him down. <br>\r\n\"You aren't going anywhere either.\" Demon!Rin licked his lip seductively.<br>\r\nThe Illuminati above realize the operations failure and quickly retreat for safety. Shima flailing about helplessly below. \"Don't leave us!\" It was too late too beg for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" Yukio growled. He was so close to power! He would surpass his older brother and show the strength he got! Satan only snickered at his predicament.<b> \"This is too good! You are on your own kid!\"</b> Amused at his one spawn helpless at the hands of another progeny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nude Demon!Rin smiled sinisterly. \"No can do! The other me over there let me free in exchange for getting you. We're gonna have so much fun now that I've got you and all my friends to play with~\" Flames erupted in his hand holding Shima, who was crying as he frantically tried to put them out. A being of power that reveled in chaos. That was the ego of the demon half of Rin Okumura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir friends came over to help human Rin. \"You okay Rin-kun!?\" Shiemi asked as Nee began to ready himself to help.<br>\r\n\"I *huff* think so.\" Rin tried to smile. There was no visible changes save for the pit in his chest where bottomless fire emerged. \"It just *huff* feels weird having a gaping hole in my chest. I feel *huff* my strength returning too.\" Shiemi liked how warm the chest flames are.<br>\r\n\"That's good!\" Bon sighed with relief.<br>\r\n\"Will that other you get Yukio out of here? We need to run after helping him escape prison after all!\" Izumo asked concerned with their safety.<br>\r\n\"Yeah *huff* but only after it finishes *huff*.\"<br>\r\n\"What finishes?\" Bon asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not *huff* done changing.\" Rin declared as his eyes glowed a spectral blue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Assiah and Gehenna were connected together by the Illuminati's Gate, the half demons power was freed upon humanity,  the two would undergo fundamental changes as a prince of Gehenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Rin becomes more muscular in order for his human body to adapt to the power. Demon!Rin grows larger in size and can become big enough to hold Yukio and Shuma in each hand. The group makes their getaway as Rin tries to reason with his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The two of them grow larger and beefier. Demon!Rin wants to rampage and runs off with Yukio and Shima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The group makes their getaway, but normal Rin has to keep Demon!Rin under their control as they both start changing (More choices Basically)</span></div></div>",

Pressed against the ground near the corner of a wall. Pink haired teen pinned down by a raven haired one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Rin stop! I'll show you my atash!\" A pink haired boy dressed in his every day clothes of a white buttoned shirt with a green one underneath, gripping tightly his K'rik between both hands, for the  one on top, an animalistic dark haired boy covered in blue flame with horns and tail were growling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Grrrrrr.....* Cat like pupils looked down as sharp teeth bit into the staff, sharp deadly fingers swiping at the pink haired boys head, narrowly dodging each strike as a *SWIPE* from each swing ripped deep scratch marks into the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat was beading down the pink haired boys head, tears of fear leaking as he felt his life on the line. \"Why was I chosen for this!?\" He moved his head to the left as another swipe struck the ground, whining in his voice ramping up with Rin's aggressiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I was reading porn mags during lessons but don't blame that on me! I'm clearly the victim!\" Eyes closed as he let out deep whines. Unwilling to accept his punishment. \"At least let me summon Yamantaka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response from those watching above, safely behind glass several dozen feet above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh! Fiiin guess I'll deal with this myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smashed his knee into Rin's stomach hoping it would stop the growling beast. Nothing changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he opted for kneeing him in the balls. That time Rin finally let go of his staff, deep bite marks were in it. The swiping of claws ended as his tail froze in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin sat up, tilting his head in confusion at what Shima was teying to do. His balls safe despite the attack, but he felt him try something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it was over, tears poured faster than ever as a massive smile crossed Shima's face. \"Thank Buddha!\" He let the temporary respite get to him as he moved up to hug Rin in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank Buddha! God! Jesus! All the pretty girls for not killing me Rin!\" His head was next to Rin's, eyes closed as he relaxed. A neck near Rin's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wild Rins' eyes regained focus as he went on the defensive, mouth opening wide as he bit down hard on the neck before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah!\" Shima felt it as the bite went in, blood trickling down his neck as the demonic wild Rin initiates sucking blood through sharp fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it felt <b>good</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShima couldn't speak, just let out \"Aaaah!\" And \"oooh!\" and \"Mmmmfffs\"  as the process seemed to go on forever. His pants gaining a noticeable tent as hormones were released by the fangs to make it orgasmic to Shima, who began to softly open brown eyes to the world as they began to become cat like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAHHHH!\" Renzo Shima screamed out as he jumped upwards in bed. The bedroom normal even with ragged breathing escaping lips. Sweat dripped from his forehead, looking down to see a tent sticking out beneath the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is wrong with me?\" Shina grumbled, rubbing one eye. Looking away everything still seemed normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hundred plus time I had that dream. Why is Rin always an animal and why does getting my blood sucked by a guy such s turn-on!?\" He didn't get the dream at all. He loved women! Yet across 200 days the dreams happen more frequently and more....intensely than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time be was bitten though, something always seemed to pass on. Fingers softly moving from eye to neck to caress where he is bitten, now glowing sigils incarnating on neckflesh with the One Hundrend and Eighth dream on the Thirteenth Friday since the dreams began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoking out from behind, even as he was oblivious to it, was a pink colored tail the same as his dyed hair. A big round heart at the end. His own dyed hair transfigured to become....natural? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell regardless be rose from his bed, stretching as he smiled, oblivious to his wagging tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a wonderful day awaits!\" Getting dressed, he looked proud of himself as somethinf began to wake deep inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunger. Deep. Primal. Insatiable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt needed nourishment. It wanted it now. Which Shima's mouth responded without realizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if the Real Rin can satisfy me too?\"</span></div></div>",
