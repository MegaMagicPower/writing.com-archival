Oh no this is bad. Please don't cry louise! Im sorry really! From now on I won't make fun of you just please don't cry!\" Saito begged. \"WAAAAH! It just hurts so much when you make fun of me! It just hurts so much!\" Louise cried. (Damn! She won't stop crying! I guess ill have to go to my last resort!) Saito grabbed Louise and holding her in his arms he kissed her. Louise had taken out her whip already ,but she stopped once she took it out and just let him continue. \"Saito! why did you do-\" she was cut off. \" Just shut up and let me apologize to you Louise.\" Saito whispered. Saito had continued again. Louise feinted. When she awoke it was night time and was in bed. \"Oh good you're awake.\" Saito said. \"Huh? Saito what am i doing here? what happened to the golem?\" Louise said. \"Don't worry, while we covered by the clouds Tabitha and Kirche finished off bouquet and we took you home. Well its time to sleep now so goodnight.\" Saito said. Saito had begun to go to the floor to sleep but Louise quickly responded. \"Hey what are you doing? You're not sleeping there, it's filthy and I can let that happen to you.\" Louise said. \"Huh? i always sleep here though. What's up?\" Saito asked. \"Oh it's nothing... now hurry up and get in.\" Louise said. \"Huh? I-In bed? W-With you? W-Why would you want me to do that?\" Saito responded. \"Of course i mean in bed idiot! Now get in so we can sleep!\" Louise shouted. Louise had developed feelings for Saito, but she had no idea that it would all end soon.</span></div></div>",

That you loved me, can i believe you? Will you keep your word?\" Louise said. siesta of course was eavesdropping. \"Oh course Louise, why else would I have asked you to marry me?

Hmm here it is. yeah it seems that love potion I made was actually three doses of it so the water spirits tear didn't completely drown out the effects.

Louise ran out the door crying. \"Did she drink another aphrodisiac? Or did you finally choose Miss Valiere?\" siesta asked. \"Uh be right back! Fix louise's bed please!\" saito said running out the door. Saito finally found louise by the fountain because it had a great view of the two moons in the sky. Once he found her Louise started to hit him lightly. \"baka baka baka! Saito no baka! Baka baka baka!(Note: Baka= idiot/stupid. no= you.) Why don't you love me? You like every girl on campus but me! how come you always do stuff with that maid or Kirche! even though we're always in the same room you never try to do stuff to me!\" Louise cried. \"Wait a minute, are you saying that I CAN do stuff with you?\" saito asked. \" only if you get my permission!\" Louise said. \" well do I have your permission?\" saito asked. \" No! Of course not!\" Louise yelled. saito gave her a kiss on the lips. \"Oh yeah well how about now?\" saito said with a smile on his face. \"Maybe. I might if you get me in a better mood.\" Louise said as she looked away. Saito started to kiss her many times after that in various place. \"how about now? Now can I do stuff with you?\" Saito said. \"fine do as you wish but first lets get back in the room.\" Louise said as she hugged saito.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once again at the Charming Fairy inn, which Saito hated, Louise and saito were sent on another mission. They were waiting for Agnes to come. But instead Julio had come and called all maids to one table, including Louise and started to get drunk. (Hmm where's saito? Why does he look so angry? Why does he-) Louise stopped thinking as Julio spun her around a few times and kissed her on the lips. ( Dan that bastard! he kissed Louise! ON THE LIPS! Only I'm allowed to do that! that's it ive got to do something!) Saito thought. as Julio kissed Louise three more times saito couldn't hold it in anymore. Saito pulled out his sword and went over the counter to slice the drunken julio. Even though he was drunk he still had sharp reflexes. \"Damn you! Now you've done it! You've kissed my girlfriend to many times! Only i'm allowed to kiss her! She's mine so back off jerk-face!\" Saito shouted as he grabbed Louise by the waist. \"Such poor speed my friend, how do you expect to protect Louise like that? If you cant even hit me then how do you expect to protect Louise?\" Julio laughed. Thoughts of count wardes taunting him came to his head and now no longer was he just angry, he was so angry you could even see the heat coming out of him. \" That's it! now you've said it!\" Saito said as he smashed Julio's sword and pointed his sword at his head. \"Prepare to die!\" Saito exclaimed. Before he could dig his sword through his skull Louise grabbed hold of his arms. \"Saito no! Don't do it! You've done enough! Look at all the damage you've done! I'm sorry but i can't forgive you for this!\" Louise shouted as she stormed out the door. \"louise wait! Don't go! LOUISE!\" Saito cried. After hours of chasin her Saito finally found Louise only to find her half dead and being attacked by a soldier. \" Louise duck!\" Saito said as he slice the enemy. \"Saito! baka baka baka baka! Saito no baka! Saito no baka! baka baka baka! I was lonely and then a soldier randomly hit me with his sword and I was hurt! The thing that hurt the most was that you weren't there to protect me!\" Louise cried as she limped towards Saito. \"Louise don't move so much here get on my back we have to get back to the inn! As soon as they got back Saito began to unclothe Louise. \" Wh-what are you doing?!\" Louise shouted. \"i'm unclothing you so I can bandage you up! Hurry we don't have much time until the enemy finds us! Alright all done. Don't move just climb aboard and hold on tight!\" Saito yelled. \"Saito while I was on your back I noticed one thing. I-i noticed th-that I-i Ilove you Saito! Don't ever leave me again!\" Louise cried as she hugged saito. \"Don't worry Louise, i'm here now, it's alright. I love you too Louise. but weren't you the one to leave me?\" Saito said. \" Shut up! just don't leave me ever again, promise?\" louise cried. \" I promise. Now come on lets hurry to Losasailes because I heard the her majesty is there.\" Saito said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they got to Losasailes Louise began to speak to Saito again. \"saito, I have to tell you something. While I walked out of the charming fairy inn the head priest had come out and begged me to become bait in south gotha to protect the princess. I'm going to take the job.\" Louise said weakly. \"What?! You can't go! Especially when you're injured like that!\" Saito said. \"saito just run. You don't have to die here, no, not like this. Besides you don't even belong to this world so you shouldn't have to die here.\" Louise said with tears swelling up. \" No! I promise you won't die! This won't be the end of your life!\" Saito shouted. \"saito, before I die I have one request. I wish to get married. You know as proof that I was alive, as proof that I'm real.\" Louise said weakly. Saito accepted her last request and after the got the ekuledumuru flower they went to the church and prepared. \"Louise i'm going with you.\" Saito said. \"Huh, where?\" Louise asked. \" To the battlefield. I said I would protect you, and i will keep that promise no matter what! So how does the ceremony go?\" saito said. \" Holding hands and doing a vow is fine.\" Louise said. \" Louise, i love you, and to you I give m life to. I vow that I will forever love you and that I will protect you no matter what.\" Saito said. \"Saito, to you I give my life to, and I vow i will forever love you too.\" Louise said. Julio had burst in.  \"Then I now pronounce you husband and wife.\" he said. \"Julio! what are you doing here bastard?!\" Saito said pulling out his sword. \"Relax im just here to tell you to escape.\" Julio said. \"Well too late, we're already prepared to fight the army of 7 million.\" Louise said. I'll skip the part after that because it's just Julio telling them to leave. Once Louise and Saito were at the battlefield Saito pulled out his sword and began to attack soldiers. In less than 2 minutes he had killed over 7000 soldiers. Louise had began chanting spells and with one explosion she wiped out 10000 soldiers at the least amount. \" About 17000 down and over 6 million to go.\" Saito said as he took out another 5000. in less than 30 minutes they had barely lost a sweat and they had taken down 1 million soldiers. Saito and Louise were a good battle duo because whenever Louise was about to be attacked Saito charged in and sliced the soldier. Whenever a mage came after Saito Louise used explosion to wipe out the blast. As the battle continued Saito and Louise grew tired, but what fueled them was their love for each other. 1 hour had passed and they had taken down nearly 4 million soldiers. \" Saito i need to rest. Let me go on your back please?\" Louise asked. \"Anything for you Louise\" Saito said as he took down another 50,000 soldiers. Without Louise, Saito was defenseless. He was shot with some fireballs, but Louise had taken the most damage. Saito heard Louise's cries of pain and he grew angry and in 1 minute he took down the last 2 million soldiers. \"S-saito i-i'm s-sorry.\" Louise staggered. \"Louise no!!!!! this won't be the end!\" Saito shouted. \"Don't worry partner i'll teleport us to a forest with a fairy that once helped the gandalfr in his time in need.\" Derflinger said. Derflinger did so and their was a fairy there with abnormally huge breasts which shocked saito. She had put a gem stone in side of Louise which brought her back to life. \" Thank you for all your help miss fairy!\" saito said. \" No need for thanks, and call me Tiffania!\" Tiffania said.</span></div></div>",

Her big tits surprised me.\" Saito laughed. \" Fairy with big tits huh?! You just love big tits don't you?! well why don't you just go live with her instead?!\" Louise said as she charged up an explosion. \"N-no! i'm fine with your flat ones! Wait no I didn't mean to say that!\" Saito said. \" Die you perverted dog!\" Louise said. (Think fast! This calls for drastic measures! Saito death escape plan Z!) Saito thought. \"Explosi-\" Louise was cut off. Saito had kissed Louise right before she could finish chanting her spell. Once Saito was done Louise began to speak. \" Y-you p-perverted dog! You must be punished!\" Louise shouted. (darn, I thought that would work on her!) Saito thought. \" As punishment you must do the same thing again without stopping until I say so!\" Louise yelled. ( Not exactly the punishment I expected but okay!) Saito thought. Saito pinned her down and began to do it many times while rolling on the fresh grass. They had rolled so many times that they had gotten to the royal family of tristain's castle. \" Saito you may stop now.\" Louise said. \" Aww, do I have to?\" Saito whined. \" Don't worry i'll give you time tonight.\" Louise said. (Wow this is the second time he actually wanted to keep kissing me.) Louise thought. Once inside they saw Henrietta. \"P-princess! I'm sorry for disobeying orders!\" Louise said. \" Rise Louise Francoise. Don't worry about it. I'm just glad you two came back safely. I have a gift for both of you.\" Henrietta said. Henrietta lead them to the throne room. Once inside they bowed down to her. \" Rise Louise Francoise le blanc de la Valliere. Take your chevalier cloak with pride.\" Henrietta said. Louise did so and Henrietta turned to Saito. \" Rise Saito Hiraga, now Saito chevalier de la Hiraga. take your cloak with pride.\" Henrietta said. \" Congratulations Saito!\" Louise said as she hugged him. \" Huh, what's so special? It's just a cloak.\" saito said. \"You idiot! You've been granted the title of chevalier, the lowest rank of a knight! You're nobility now!\" Louise shouted. \"Both of you have. You both have also gained the title \"The couple who defeated the army of 7 million\"!\" Henrietta said. \"C-c-c-c-couple? You must have misunderstood things princess!\" Staggered an embarrassed Louise. \" Huh? But what about at the chapel? And outside a few minutes ago? Are you saying we never got married, or rolled around on the grass outside all the way to the castle?\" Saito laughed. \"Shut up you filthy dog!\" Louise said as she whipped Saito. \"Oh, you two got married? congratulations both of you!\" Henrietta said smiling. A few minutes after that louise and saito were outside once again. \" Hey Louise?\" Saito said. \" Yes Saito?\" Louise replied. \"You want to know what I thought when I first came to this world?\" Saito asked. \" Sure.\" Louise answered back. \" I thought Who are these people? Why are they dressed so strangely? What language are they speaking? Oh hey a girl. Darn her breasts are small. what a waste.\" Saito said. \"Grrrrr! saito you dog! Why don't you just-\" Louise shouted as and explosion was being charged. \"Hey let me finish! I thought oh well it doesn't matter at least she's cute. What am I thinking? I can never score a girl like her! But look at me now, I just got married to you last week!\" saito said. As Saito said those words Louise calmed down and tears began to swell up in her eyes. \"Oh Saito!!\" Louise cried as she jumped on top of Saito. \" I love you Saito!\" Louise cried. \" I love you too, Louise.\" Saito said once again rolling around on the fresh grass.</span></div></div>",

He came in to find Louise, with her clothes on the floor and wearing nothing but her transparent, pink nightgown. The mood was right too, because no one was awake but them and it was midnight so no one can see them. \"L-L-L-louise! wh-what are you doing?! Put some clothes on!\" Saito shouted as he shielded his face. \"No! I don't want to!\" louise cried. \"Wh-why not?!\" Saito asked, still shielding his face. \" Because tonight you have a reward!\" Louise said. Saito unshielded his face. \" Really? How so?\" Saito said suspiciously. \" T-tonight y-y-you c-c-c-can touch my b-body freely. A-a-as many t-t-times as you want to, no matter wh-what part it is.\" louise stuttered. \" I'd be fine if I die right now.\" Saito whispered as he got a nose bleed.

I've wanted to do this for a long time.\" Saito said as he began to undress. Soon after he was undressed he undressed Louise too. \" S-Saito... I love you. tonight do whatever you want. If you don't I order you to.\" Louise said. \" Yes master, if it is the masters wishes I shall do it.\" Saito said softly as he gave Louise a kiss.

Why couldn't I save you?! Why?! Why did you join Sheffield?!\" Saito shouted once more. Over the next few Saito was depressed over how he couldn't save Louise.
