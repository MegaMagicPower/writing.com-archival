However, people have been noticing something new appearing in town, small green wind. The wind just showed up one day and kept appearing and disappearing at random. It had gotten to the point where people have started making rumors about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more rumors started to pop up, citizens stayed away from the green wind, afraid of what it does. What they didn\u2019t know was that whoever touched the wind would shrink down. However, you hadn\u2019t heard many rumors about the wind, leaving you naive to the danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho exactly are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There had even been a time where you accidentally found yourself in a teacher\u2019s lounge due to looking around. You have quite a few friends and do your best in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou live with your mother (Olivia) who\u2019s 40 years old and has long brown hair and brown eyes. She is considered to be one of the most beautiful women in town, sometimes causing boys to stare at her beauty. She always worries about where you\u2019ll go or what you\u2019ll do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also have an older brother (Bruce) who is 19 years old with black hair and blue eyes. He does well in school and has quite a few friends. However, he typically treats you as inferior. Bruce usually tells you to do things for him or tells you how much better he is than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a lovely girlfriend (Elizabeth) who is 17 years old and cares about you a lot. She loves to hang out with you and even likes to work or play games with you. Her favorite game is cat and mouse because she gets to chase and toy with you at the same time. However, sometimes she can be a bit too clingy. There had been one time where she held your non dominant arm for an entire history class period (the teacher didn\u2019t mind at all and even found it amusing).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the day that you encountered the wind, where did you start off at?</span></div></div>",

You were now walking through the automatic doors, looking around for the aisle which was labeled to what you desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You made your way past the cash registers and through the somewhat occupied store, down several rows of assorted products that you weren't interested in, before you spotted the aisle which held your treasured eggs. You made your way past the flour and vinegar, before stopping at the wide assortment of eggs they offered here, grabbing a pack and opening it to see if there was any cracks on the eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you looked up to head out, a green gas surrounded you, and your vision went fuzzy. You were temporarily immobilized before your sight gave altogether, along with your consciousness. You woke up on the cold tile floor of the supermarket, before a very startling realization had come upon you. You were now six inches tall, and resting next to you was a carton of spilled eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Freaking out, you sought what you remembered from the collapse and recalled the gas, which must have somehow been responsible for the event. Luckily, your clothing had gone down with you, so you were still fully clothed, though now the clothing seemed rather suited for a ken doll than your typical teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked around frantically for any kind of help, before you</span></div></div>",

You looked down at the tanned, beautifully manicured fingers which were pulling you off of the shelf and fought hopelessly. The woman who held you turned you around, getting a good look at your face as you looked back, seeing a beautiful young Hispanic woman in her mid twenties. She grinned, her lips growing wide as you admired her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was sexy to say the least, with decent sized breasts and an ass the size of something you had never seen, then again any ass would be the biggest you had ever seen now you had fallen victim to the gas. She was wearing a white tank top with jeans that were way too tight, hugging against her like they wanted to escape their denim prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do we have here?\" She said deviously with a slight accent as your heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I shrunk down to this size, do you think there's any way you could help?\" You asked her hopefully, yet realistic about your chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think I might help myself to a new little pet, it seems like nobody will miss you. I came here looking for a fish or something small, but a half foot man will do the trick.

My name is Sam and I need to be let go!\" You plead, hoping that she would show some mercy upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She soon silenced your hope, saying \"Well Sam, I'm Maria, not Miss, and I don't think you'll ever be let go. You're way too cute!\" before bringing you to her gigantic lips, and planting a wet kiss over your head, giving you a good look at the massive teeth of the predator who's hands you had fallen in to. \"Now please excuse me, I need to buy some equipment for my new pet.\" She said with a giggle, before lowering you to her purse, where she dropped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You landed with a thud against the leather, the smell giving away the material to you. There were gigantic makeup kits laying around, a tube of lipstick which seemed to be your same height rolling around on the floor of the bag. You sat, contemplating your situation, deciding that maybe it wasn't as bad as it could possibly be at the moment. After all, there were worse looking people to be at the mercy of, and right now you were lucky that somebody hadn't squashed you under their sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You waited patiently as you heard your new proclaimed owner purchase some kind of tank for you, along with some doll furniture before making her way back outside to her car.

All the while you just sat in the bag trying to be optimistic about your new situation. As the car came to a park you were tumbling around the inside of the bag as Maria picked it up with ease and then preceded to grab the rest of the bags from her shopping. She went up a flight of stairs and into her apartment. She set the bag that you were in down for a moment as she went to put together your new home. And once she was done she came back to grab you and bring you to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the first bit of light pour in since you were caught by Maria, you were blinded at first as her giant hand swoop you up and placed you into your new home. Gaining vision back you see that there is doll furniture spread around with some kind of hamster flooring beneath you and  there also seems to be no walls around you, just clearness. But as you walk forward you hit the wall of glass. Then you are greeted with Maria gorgeous giant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"So how do you like it? I thought about a hamster cage but figured you might find yourself climbing it and \"mistakenly\" escape it. So a fish tank seemed like the best and safest choice for... You know what I haven't named you yet have I? hmm...\"</span> Maria stands there bent over looking at you with a thinking face on. You knowing that you have already told her your name just come out and say<span class=\"cblue\"> \"Maria my name is already Sam...\" </span>Maria cuts you off with saying<span class=\"crose\"> \"NO No no, that is just the name that you came with. That is like if you bought a dog they all come with names but as your new owner I need to come up with a name. And I think the perfect name for you is Chip. Its an absolute adorable name for such a cutie\"</span> Maria says all happy as she lifts your tank up and places it in on her dresser. Then she says that she has to grab the rest of her groceries and tells you to make yourself at home as she also makes a phone call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her out of the room, you begin to think that this whole pet thing needs to stop now. You don't want to have your name changed and be nothing but a pet. Plus what are you really going to be doing all day just standing around this fish tank, waiting for your owner to come home. I mean your always up for a new adventure but you also want to be free to choose what adventure you go on. You then decide right then and there that you have to find a way out of this insane place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then though Maria comes back into her room, walking towards your tank. But instead of saying anything to you she just opened her drawers and toke out some pieces of cloth's. Your then reminded very quickly of why this situation is so bad. As Maria begins to undress. Your body can't help itself but get erect as you see Maria in her bra and panties. She begins to take off her bra as she looks over and see's you starring at her. Getting a smirk, followed by an angry face she walks over to your tank with something in her hand. Then suddenly your vision is covered in darkness as Maria ha just put a towel over your tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused you hear Mari say<span class=\"crose\"> \"I will not have some perv as a pet. You will learn to respect your owner and not eye her as some hooker. And then maybe in time you will be rewarded with seeing your owner's beautiful body\"</span> Hearing this you get a little disappointed, I mean that was the only pro to being this chick's pet. But then you watch as the towel comes off and your greeted with Maria wearing jeans and a new bra. Your mood seems to get excited all over again as you see her boob's. Ignoring what was said before you think again that this won't be so bad, as a new tank top cover's her boob's right up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you hear a knock on Maria's front door. She looks down at you and says <span class=\"crose\">\"That was quick, I'll be right back my little cutie...\"</span> Maria says as she walks out of her room and towards her front door. During this time alone you seem to be finding yourself weighing pro's and con's again of staying versus leaving. But as you were thinking about this Maria has re-entered her room and you feel humiliated as you see...</span></div></div>",

Your mom had started to read a book while you kicked around a ball with your friends. After you played with them for a bit, you laid down in the grass and stared up at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was good and filled with a lot of positives. However, things had gotten a tab boring. Though you weren\u2019t complaining about your life, you still wished something exciting would happen. You closed your eyes and listened to the sounds of the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you closed them however, a mysterious green wind approached you. You had no idea it was even there or the fact that it was starting to surround you. Without realizing it, you breathed it in causing you to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, your head was a bit dizzy. You looked around to see that nobody had noticed you pass out. You looked over at your mother who was still reading her book quietly. As you took a step towards her, someone ran past you, but they were giant! Another person ran past you, almost crushing you in the process. You started to panic a little at your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, I shrunk! How small am I?\u201d You asked yourself. In truth, you had shrunk down to 6 inches, a good size to be man-handled. You were a bit scared, but also pretty excited. Your wish had come true! Though, you sort of hoped it wouldn\u2019t involve putting yourself in actual danger. You took a minute to think before\u2026</span></div></div>",

She was so focused on her book, she had no idea what was going on. You suddenly realized just how tall she was though, you were like a doll to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped onto her giant shoe. It smell really bad and almost made you pass out. You shook it off and started to climb. As you got to her knee though, she suddenly moved her leg onto her other one. The sudden shakes caused you to lose your grip, causing you to fall. You panicked and quickly grabbed her pants again, stopping your descent. You shuddered and looked up at your mom, who was still unaware of your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! How can you be so oblivious?\u201d You said quietly. You continued up her leg until you got to her knee. Once you were on stable ground, you took a deep breath before continuing to her pelvis. You looked up, hoping she had spot you now that you were in a more detectable spot.</span></div></div>",
