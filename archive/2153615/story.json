This is loosely based on Greek Mythos, and very slight inclusion of Cthulhu Mythos; please try to stick to those mythologies. The main author will do so as well and will edit what does not follow, but will understand small errors. Please don't turn Cthulhu into a penguin and call it accurate lore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it. Enjoy the story! </td>",
