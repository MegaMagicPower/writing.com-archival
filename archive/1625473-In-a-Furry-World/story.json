You enter your neighborhood and begin to cut through people yards in order shorten the walk. As you walk through the green grass, you feel the breeze pick up. You look behind you to see a large storm system coming towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to pick up the pace, not wanting to get soaked. You feel gusts of wind as well as small rain drops pelting your back. You start to jog through the yards as you hear a crack of thunder. The drizzling is getting worse as the clouds roll in above. Everything has gotten slightly darken, aside from the bolts of lightning shooting off above. You start sprinting to you house. A few feet from your driveway, and flash of light shoots out right in front of you. You fall to the ground as a blue static cloud envelopes your body. You instantly feel sleepy, and black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unknown period of time later, you wake up... The first thing you realize is that your stark naked. You try to search next to you for your cloths but find nothing. Thats when you look around to see, something has changed, drastically. The world around you is massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to get dizzy by shear size of house you can see in the distance, but it is not your own house. Standing there, dumbfounded, you look around more. You realize that your are still on some concrete. You look to your right and see some grass. \"No this can't be!\" to scream. Where ever you are, you have shrunk.... to about</span></div></div>",

You rub your arms to warm your self up \"What the hell, where are my cloths..\" Your mind jumps into gear and you look around and say to yourself \"where am I?\". You realize your in a small carpeted room with white walls,and a door. You struggle to stand up, muscles failing you a bit you hobble over to the door and try to turn the knob. It was locked. \"what the hell is going on here.. and why the heck am I so sore\" you think to your self as you begin to bang on the door. After a few loud knocks, you feel a little light headed... everything dims a little, and you collapse on the floor. Trying to keep your eyes open as you lose consciousness, you see the door slowly open. Right before you are completely asleep, you definitely saw an anthro....</span></div></div>",

You start to stretch out, and feel an artificial breeze of air-conditioning flow over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all floods back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump up out of your daze and frantically look around. You were still in that room, and still stark naked. The only difference now was there was some sort of collar on you. You decide not to fidget with it, because you have more important things at hand. Like how to get out of this room. You pull your self up, not nearly as tired as you were earlier. You study the room your in more closely this time, noticing a tiny white camera in the corner of the room that you must have missed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few steps towards it and look into at it, focusing on the lens of the camera. Before you took another step forward, you remembered the collar. Running your fingers along its metallic surface, you were amazed by how decorated it was. You could feel little bumps and notches... You walk over to the stainless steel door knob and try to see the reflection. \"What is this thing?\" you think to yourself. Looking at the warped reflection, you see the collar covered in things that looked electronic. \"Is this some kind of shock collar?\" you again contemplate. Before you could answer your own question, the door knob jiggles a bit. You almost fall over from the change in sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoot back a little bit. You watch as the door slowly swings open. On the other side was anthromorphic animal. This one was different then the one earlier. It was some kind of....</span></div></div>",

You just sat there, breathing heavy, heart thumping out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature lifts his hand, revealing what look like a key fob. He clicked a button. Nothing happened for a few silent, intense seconds, but then a beep came from nowhere. Wait... it was coming from the collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try that one more time, come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough some of your initial fear had subsided, you didn't want to go near that thing. But instead, you started to inch toward him... \"what the hell?\" your inner voice screamed. The creature watch you as you tried to resist the invisible force that was causing you to walk toward him. You then realized it was the collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frantically start to claw at it, and pry it off, all while you legs slowly step toward the anthro-dog. You finally blurt out \"Get this thing off of me!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature just smirked. \"Put your hands down\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly your hand dropped to your sides. You try to move, but nothing budged, you frantically strain your neck, as if the rise in blood pressure would break the electronic collar off. Nothings seems to work. Again, you feel exhausted from your efforts. You stopped fighting the force... for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now shoulder to chest with the furry creature when you finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me\" the create stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if a servant to a master, you body did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature walked through a long white walled hallways, all covered with doors, such as the one you had just come out of. At the end of the hall, you see what looks to be an elevator. Once you had both reached the door, the anthro speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Press the button\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little exhausted from you struggles earlier, you body reaches forward and presses it.

Inside was a creature similar to the canine, it had what looked like a human body, but it had the head of a Jaguar. It's black fur contrasted against the white lab coat it was wearing, and really made it stand out. This creature looked female, however, because it had to bulges at the top of the lab coat, indicating breast. She was looking at a clip board when the door opened, and didn't even pause to look up when the doors opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black and brown German Shepard walked in, you defeated body soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the elevator was mirrored. You could now clearly see that the metal color was lit up by some small green LED's. You look at the reflection and stare at you naked form. Your body looked so much more week then the two stand next to you. Still naked, you blush a bit at how foolish you felt. But that was the least of you worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a small deep breathe and were to speak, when the Jaguar looked up from her clipboard. She glance at the Canine, which she gave a polite smile too, and then to you, which she examined as if you were made of wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe speaks \"uh, what a strange little creature. What planet did this one come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shepard responded sincerely with \"A new planet called earth, they just got the coordinates for it, this is one of the first commercial ones they've brought over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responded with genuine interest \"oh wow, I didn't think we would start sale on those for a few months... gosh, everything advances so quick now adays...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine spoke once more. \"Yeah, tell me about. Even though these new things are extremely expensive, these life forms are quite similar to ours, at least in shape and mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both giggled a little bit at that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this looks like this is my floor\u201d, the Anthro-Jaguar says while stepping forward. \"It was nice talking to you, have fun with your new toy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I will\" The Shepard says while he glances back down at your now confused form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mind is completely boggled with what you just heard. You start to think to yourself \"What is going on... what did she mean by 'toy'. What the hell is this place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors open once more. The Shepard walks out but, accidentally hitting you with his tail, though thinking nothing of it. You follow, but not at you own will. This floor looked like that of a hospital lobby, minus the sick people. In the center was a station of people in lab coats bustling in and grabbing things and leaving. The Shepard glanced at a women who had the body of a wolf, quite similar to the Shepard body actually, and says \u201chave a good one\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou too sir.\u201d She responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole time, still stark naked, your astounded by all the different creatures around you. You see about twenty different anthro animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look straight ahead, to see to electronic doors, with a security guard next to it. As you approach, the red Anthro Fox security guard gives a quick word to the Shepard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmake sure you have that collar on, because we don\u2019t offer refunds for runaways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing\u201d He says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the guard pressed a button, and the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It has similar atmospheric conditions that your planet has, so you will survive just fine, and PTI provides a month worth of food for you as you make the switch. You were brought here by Planetary Transfer Incorporated. That collar around your neck, basically controls your body. It is registered to do whatever is asked on command. There is no point in trying to resist it, the company guarantees that it will control you. And it's impossible for you to take it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour species is the new to being beamed over. They have found a few other planets that support life, but earth is a gold-mine compared to them. Trillions of intelligent beings on them. You, were one of the first to be brought over commercially, for public sale, but man, you are worth every penny . The ones have come before you have been brought to labs to test you for any diseases you may carry and the ability to survive under certain conditions.

The floor was covered in dirty laundry... shoes... and school stuff. The smell in the air was similar to that of what you smelled earlier, just not as bad. There were no windows, and the room was very dim... the walls looked to be a shade of beige, but you really couldn't tell. They were covered in posters and randoms stains of well... you don;t even want to know. You see a dirty, stained queen sized bed... and beside it, a larger then usual doggy bed. When you shift your gaze to the doggy bed, Bilo pipes in \"That's where you'll be sleeping... some nights\".  You think to your self.. \"What the hell does he mean 'some nights'...\". Opposite of the bed was a computer and another TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could look any more, the Anthro Canine walks toward a cabinet you had missed while looking... you follow. You watch as Bilo opens it up, and you see a large bin with a logo on it \"Slave Chow\". Bilo sticks his furry hand into the bin and grabs one of the gumball sized pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then commands: Stick out your hand, palm up. You do so... by force.  He places the dry, light ball in you hand and begins to talk: \"This is slave chow, it has all the vital vitamins and minerals a slave needs to live a healthy... heh, happy life. It also puts a lining in your stomach, causing you to be un-able to throw up. Even if you stick your finger down your throat, you wouldn't even gag. So eat up Cado!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou body does as it's told and places the ball in you mouth. As soon as you bight down on it, its grainy texture breaks apart and completely dries out you mouth. You have trouble swallowing not only form the sawdust like taste but by the physical inability to swallow such a food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then, now we can have some real fun\"</span></div></div>",

But if you would like to help clean me up, I don't mind.\" He says sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lays back on the bed, stretching his legs and footpaws, he was wearing shorts similar to Zehd's, just different design to it, and as with Zehd, he had no shirt on. \"Why don't you start by cleaning my paws\" he says with a drowsy smile, allowing his long tongue to loll out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, your body didn't respond....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of movement cause Bilo to perk up a bit \"Oh... heh, forgot...

The smell causes you to want to throw up... and you try to... but.. \"Oh god.. that food...\" you think...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon grasp the right paw with your hands and proceed to stick your tongue out. You run it straight up the ball pad of the foot... all the grime and sweat and whatever else, being forced onto you tongue. You start to taste the grime.. a salty mixture of dirt and sweat... god it tastes awful. You keep running you tongue in the same spot until it was sufficiently clean. You move on the the heel section, all while grimacing and trying to vomit the foul tasting stuff. With your nose now pressed into the furry arch as you lick the heel, all you can smell is the furry musk.  You even lick the furry arch, causing some hair to fill your mouth... You then move on to the toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot a glance up to see Bilo just laying there... trying not to giggle... truly enjoying himself.. you think \"What a sick fuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wandering tongue licks the individual toe pads... and then between the toes... which was a disgusting mix of fur, dirt, toe jam all held together by sweat... \"this is hell\" you think. Bilo wiggles his toes, trying to grasp your tongue with them... Between each toe.. it's own little stash of gunk.. Though it may be small, the taste was intense...</span></div></div>",

Come, I`ll help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, you got up and followed Bilo out of the room you were, down a corridor and right, into a bathroom. \"Here, bitch...er, I mean Cado\" Said Bilo with a big grin on his face. \"Enter the bathtub, NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body moved by itself, obeying Bilo, and you entered the bathtub. Bilo turned the water on, and really cold water fell on your body, it was real freezing and your body started shaking. \"oh, sorry, is it cold?\" Said Bilo laughing, but he ended up turning the hot water about enough for it to get actually comfortable. \"Now, now, what do you say?\" Asked Bilo, and you answered fastly, afraid to be punished \"Thank you.\". \"No, no, no...\" Said Bilo, \"It is,  thank you, sire\" Said Bilo, with emphasis on the \"Sire\". \"It seems you need to be taught some manners Cado\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a little desperate with Bilo's words, imagining what could happen now, what he would do to you, but to your surprise, all he did was turn off the hot water, so it got freezing once again. He started rubbing some sort of soap on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shaking once again when Bilo said \"Are you cold? I could do something to warm you up\".  You thanked god he was going to turn the hot water on again, but you did it to soon. When you realized it, he had taken his clothes off, and was heading to you, his crouch facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Cado, open your mouth, then close it in my dick, don`t you dare biting if you know what`s better to you. Keed licking, good\" Said Bilo, laughing happily to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to, but your body opened your mouth, inviting his dog 6 inch cock into yourself. He introduced the head of his dick into your mouth, and left it there, while you licked it all, tasting the foul thing in your tongue. he was petting your head, while slowly pushing his dick back and forward, always a bit more into your mouth. The scent was really strong, almost as strong as the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now pushing it all into your throat, and you strangely were unable to vomit, because of the strange tasteless food, you had to eat before. He was now pushing faster than before, moaning hard, while pulling your head against his body. His dick in your mouth was being licked all over, because of the order you received sooner, and the taste was horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pre-cum started to appear, and the taste wasn`t good at all. He pushed harder than ever, you head was being hit really hard by his balls now, a soon he pushed all he could, cumming deep inside your throat, stopping there for a while. You could breathe because of the cock in your throat, and you started choking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were barely losing conscience when he pulled his cock out of your mouth, patting you on the head. \"Good job Cado. It`s being a while since I had such a good time. I guess I will take real good care of you... If you behave of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had cum all over you mouth and throat, cursing him and the destiny for the humiliation you were forced, and for all that was to come.

The funny thing about the human spirit is that it never gives up, and considering the fact that you had a family, friends, and a girlfriend at home, there was NO WAY you were going to spend the rest of your possibly not so long life with that sadist as his sex slave/torture toy.  Luckily, you had lot of experience with technology, you were the install wizard before they had install wizard, you were the reason your house never called tech support, ect. ect. ect.  After running what you knew about the body and what you could assume about the collar, you had a few theories.  (1) the collar hacks the body's nervous system and controls it like a brain extension.  (2) the collar is voice activated and cuts off the brain's communication with the body. (3) you had no third one, three is just a good number :)if the first theory was true then the collar should have influence over your thoughts, seeing as you still hate that flee-bitten bastard of a man, that is not the case; so theory number two it is! now if the collar blocks off the body from the brain, then you should be able to overcome it with a bigger impulse.  now to see if this was possible, all that would need to happen is for you to walk to the other side of the room without any major trouble from the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou concentrated as hard as you could... but nothing, you were still \"asleep\" on the floor.  try again...nothing, WAIT, was that a twitch? one more time, but with more effort! yes! your legs moved, slowly at first, but like the collar taking control it became easier as you practiced more at it.  then it occurred to you that you could kill this motherfucker in his sleep, as much as you would like to it's a no go.  if this planet is anything like earth, you'll simply be taken to a pound and be \"put down.\" so now what, you've found a way to break the collar's spell; goody for you, but now what are you going to do with that power?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose it would be pretty nice to have a new pet at home, assuming you could both get the collar off while keeping it intact AND slip it on him without noticing. As for transfer back to earth, he bought you so it stands to reason that he can get you back. then you remembered what the guard said to Zehd on the way out \"keep a collar on that thing, P.T.I. doesn't refund for runaways,\" so maybe he can't, but it would still be fun to have THAT guy for a pet... but what ABOUT Zehd? how do you know he couldn't help help his friend? in any case you need to get this collar off before anything else</span></div></div>",

Pretty nice, uh?\" Said Bilo to his friend, the other friends talked a bit about you and stuff. Then they started playing something really similar to poker, or at least it looked like it. You just stayed the, standing by their side, when Bilo ordered you \"Hey, Cado, go get us a drink, a man`s drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that`s why he had showed me the house, uh?\" You thought to yourself, while leaving the room, heading to the kitchen. You opened the refrigerator, and you found lots of bottles, but none that you could read. He asked for a man`s drink, so it must probably be some kind of alcoholic drink, but you just couldn`t say which one would be. You closed your yes and picked one at random, then took two more for Bilo`s friend and wished they were what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back to the bedroom where Bilo was with his friend, playing that strange game, and offered the drinks.<br>\r\n\"What is this supposed to be? A joke? I asked for a man`s drink, can`t you make one thing right?!\" Bilo said, scaring the hell out of you. You answered as polity and respectfully as you could \"Sorry, but I can`t read, so I had to pick one at random\". \"At random?!\" Shouted Bilo \"I`ll show you...\" But Bilo was interrupted by one of his friend \"Hey, man, give...uh, Cado, was it?....well, give Cado a time.... He is new here, he couldn`t read what was in the bottle, so he tried his best to fulfill your command...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked god for this good fellow to have said something for your sake, and then he went with you back to the kitchen and showed you what Bilo wanted, and even helped you bring the stuff back. You wished you were his slave, but the thought quickly changed to \"I wish I were no one`s slave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back to the bedroom, and the three of them kept playing for a good while.

Once you were tired of trying to get rid of the damn necklace you closed your own eyes and worked on sleeping. Your dream wasn`t pleasant, but it wasn`t all that bad either, though once awake you couldn`t remember it at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes, finding rather strange the fact that you weren`t on you bed, or that this wasn`t your bedroom, taking a while to remember where you were, and who you were now. You could hear movements and see light outside the door, Bilo`s roommate must have awoken by now, but Bilo was fast asleep still. You couldn`t leave your bed, so you didn`t have much to do, but you could now see, and that allowed you to explore the room. Bilo didn`t have much books, but you had figured that out already, he wasn`t any genius. He had pretty big sound boxes, and a nice guitar, or what looked like one. There was something similar to a joystick, or perhaps a video game controller, but no TV or computer, then again, their were three helmets. Assuming that their technology was much better than a human`s, you supposed that the they didn`t need the computers, as they used the helmets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you were looking at the sound box again, Bilo woke up, yawning like your dog, back at home. \"Hello, Cado.\" He said, like you had always been there. \"Hello, Sire\" You answered. You could now leave your bed, since the order was until he had awakened. You got up and went to the helmets you were looking before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don`t touch that now. You will have your chance later.\" Said Bilo, and so you were unable to go forth with your exploration. You didn`t have anything else to do, so you walked back to your bed, but as you where going, Bilo said \"Hey, come here and give me a massage, so I can start the day feeling well.\". As he said that, he laid on his bed, his belly facing the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved yourself to where he was and knelled there, and started pounding softly his back.By his face, you knew he was pretty content with your job, as he had a big grin on his face. you started moving you hands over his back, so to get every part of his back taken care of. He was happy indeed, almost sleeping again. \"A bit lower now\" he said, and so you went with your hands to the lowest part of his back. \"A bit lower he said, grinning. So you started to give his butt a massage. \"Yeah, that`s it. Massage there and my legs, will you?\". When you finally finished massaging his back, butt, legs, arms and feet, he rolled over, now with his back facing the bed and said \"Really a good job Cado, a good job indeed.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and went to the living room, happy with himself, and his new toy.

You weren't completely sure if you should follow him or stay behind until he ordered you to follow him.  Ordinarily you wouldn't give a shit about which he would like more, but he was clearly the kind of guy that would punish you for not acting as he expected; Even if you had no reason to know what his expectations were.  You had no choice but to pretend you were the complete bitch Bilo took you for.  What would Bilo's bitch do after giving his master a massage in the morning? Even though you hated thinking like that, you were pretty sure it was the way to figure out Bilo's thinking pattern. You decided to stay in the doorway of his bedroom and watch him closely.  After all, humans liked it when their dogs stood still in the corner, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilo didn't seem too impressed with your decision, but at least it didn't make him angry.  He was walking around the living room picking up the occasional rag and throwing it in the corner, smiling to himself for reasons you probably wouldn't understand.  As you watched, he sifted through a bunch of pairs of shorts on the floor.  He eventually found the one he was looking for and put it on. It was the same kind of cargo-shorts you'd gotten used to seeing on him. You wondered if the animals here dressed in anything other than shorts or if it was just Bilo's preferred fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he put on his shorts, he reached into a pocket and pulled out a weird little gadget.  It was about the size of a postcard and as thin as an ipod.  In fact, if you didn't know any better, you probably would have thought that was exactly what it was.  It was a green thing, with three orange buttons on the bottom and what you assumed was a touch-sensitive screen taking up the rest.  Weather or not the thing was actually used for music, you didn't know, but it made Bilo smile wickedly.  When he looked up and noticed you watching him, the smile became even creepier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Cado! How silly of me, guess I forgot..\" He walked over to your bowl, and you decided it would look good if you walked after him.  He smiled while looking at you and bent down to pour the foul food into your bowl.  But it seemed he didn't want to bend down while you were still standing over him.  He gave you a look and ordered, \"kneel down to get your food, Cado\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body quickly got on it's knees, and your hands rested in front of the bowl as Bilo poured the food into it.  \"Eat up, boy\" he crooned.  While you weren't exactly grateful for the ass-holes food, you were at least glad that he wouldn't be starving you.  Hell, maybe he would have starved you if you hadn't acted like a 'good boy'. That didn't make this any less humiliating.  You were eating straight out of the bowl on your hands and knees while Bilo moved his paw through your hair.  You were sure he was smirking like an ass again.  Suddenly, he left your sight, and before you could decide weather or not you should follow him, you felt his paws gripping your hips tight, and you almost instantly choked on your food. Was he doing what you thought he was doing?</span></div></div>",

Jane picks you up and gently hugs you to her cheek. \"thank you tyler for being so patient with me on this. i promise i'll make this thing have a growing function as soon as i can!\" says your friend as she points at the ray gun next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe is now laying in bed, though not flat a bit up right on some pillows, with you placed on her stomach. she's trying to get to know you. \"do like to...\" she ponders for a moment searching for a question.

Jane looks at you tenderly, \"aww i'm sorry that this happened like this for you. so unexpected. i really don't know how you could have just ended up here and i know you don't either.\" she says. you both are silent for a bit. \"well i guess its something i'll have to figure out one of these days.\" she says with delight. \"this all just seems so magical and mysterious. i'm so fascinated now.\" you smile at her gleeful grin. \"i guess this kind of stuff really interests you?\" you say lightheartedly. \"oh you bet it does. i've always been super curious about everything.\" she looks at you a little more compassionately \"and i do enjoy learning more about you.\" she says lightly poking you. grasping her finger you smile up at her and ask her, \"um Jane what do you think of me so far?\" you ask. she responds with...</span></div></div>",

A wall of towers sweeps past, creating a hurricane that knocks you into the nearest tower.  Beneath you, a rumble of thunder roars, almost like a chuckle.

After rubbing your eyes trying to see if your mind wasn't playing tricks on you, Your mouth nearly drops to the ground by the shocking realization. Walking right towards you was what you could only identify as a wolf. The head of the furry humanoid body did carry the same distinguishable features of the wild canine, though her eyes were oddly blue in color. Strangely enough, Long locks of pure white hair trailed down from the crown of it's head as it gently swayed behind its massive back. It was clear that the wolf, or wolfess to be precise, was female mainly due to the feminine features of it's light brown furred body. Just like a human being, she was adorned in an attire consisting of a sleeveless grey shirt and blue short. As your eyes were helplessly glued at the ginormous wolfess's body, it didn't take long to finally snap back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of loud thunderous booms begin to echo right before you as her massive furred feet were on a clear path towards your location. Terrified, you quickly turn your head about trying to spot some means of escaping possible death. To your ever-growing dread, you immediately notice that the edges of the massive sidewalks were way too far to reach in such a short time period. Before even having a chance of making a run for it, the wolfess's huge shadow soon looms high above you as her huge footsteps send you momentarily airborne. Shocked and unready to meet a sudden demise, you quickly curl up and clench your eyes shut hoping for a painless end. In just seconds, you suddenly manage to feel the immense power of her huge foot stepping down, though oddly enough a warm soft surface encasing your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no idea what it would be like after death, you continue to clench your eyes close unwilling to face the tragic fact. Just then however, another thunderous boom immediately catches your attention as your eyes bolt open in shock. To your surprise, you soon find yourself in an extremely soft yet confined area surrounded by fur. Upon further inspection, you quickly realize that this was the same color shade of the great wolfess. Whether it was a miracle or just shear dumb luck, you were still alive and breathing. With a deep unnerved sigh, you quickly gaze about once more trying to find out your strange whereabouts. Considering that the closest thing of her that made contact with you was her massive foot, it seemed as though of all places you were trapped between her massive toes. Immediately, you try to wiggle and pull your way out from the furred digits, but due to her massive body this ultimately proved futile. Or at least you thought it did.<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

With a slightly defeated sigh mixed with an irritated groan, you try once again to wiggle free from the furry confines between her toes. After one good tug and shake, you somehow manage to raise our upper torso just by a few inches. Undaunted and filled with newfound determination, you continue onwards with your struggles before finally managing to get both of your arms up and free. With your upper torso and arms escaping from the tight walls of fur, you soon place both of your hands upon the soft surface before trying your best to pull yourself free. As you attempt escape, the wolfess soon raises her foot back after making ground contact causing her to part her toes by just a small fraction. This small movement proved to be your ultimate benefit as your body soon manages to rise right out from the compressing fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a victorious sigh, you quickly grip upon the nearest set of fur to avoid losing balance upon the huge foot. Once her foot returns back to the ground, you were quickly starting to regret escaping from her toes. In there, you didn't have to worry about getting thrown off by her sudden movements. Now however, you had no choice but to desperately hold on to her fur for dear life. \"why did I even do this!?\" you think aloud, as you cling on tightly from a sudden ascend. It was obvious that staying on the wolfess's foot was a terrible idea. There was no telling just how long you would be able to keep a steady grip from the walking motions, let alone just how far this ginormous canine planned on traveling. As you were crouching down from a quick falling motion, your head slowly raises upwards to gaze upon the wolf girls massive body. As your eyes trailed up her towering furry legs, a sudden idea came to mind. Maybe climbing her would be much safer then staying down on her feet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes quickly widen over how ridiculous the idea sounded. Yet despite the overall stupidity of the notion, it did seem like the best bet to make. With a deep breath, you slowly begin to grasp tufts of long fur strands as you begin your ascension upwards. Her foot didn't seem like that much of a problem, considering that it was nothing more than a hill like slope. Though the sudden shifts in gravity and motion did manage to slow your pace tremendously. After what seemed like minutes of arduous climbing, you finally manage to clamber your way up to the start of her massive ankle. Just then however, the wolfess soon froze to a stop. Whether it was to take a break or admire the view was anyone's guess, yet regardless you quickly take this moment to recuperate from the climb. As you sit down exhaustingly while gathering your breath, another idea quickly springs back to your mind. Maybe since she wasn't moving she'd be able to finally hear you from below? </span></div></div>",

If she was unable to hear you from down besides her feet, then there was no doubt at all that she wouldn't be able to hear you on her ankle. With a deep breath of air and long muscle stretch, you soon resume your ascension up the huge towering furry leg. To your surprise however, during your climb upwards it seemed much more easier to clamber your way up her calf compared to the unpredictable speed of her feet below. After what must've been about 10 or 20 minutes of climbing, you soon discover that you were making great progress on the lower section of her legs. However, just when enthusiasm was starting to cheer in your mind, you soon begin to feel light twinges of pain erupting from your biceps and shoulders. It seemed scaling her would truly be a test of your will and overall physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 20 minutes soon pass by as you finally manage to scale past her knee cap up to the bottom section of her huge thigh. At this time, your muscles were practically shouting for some sort of break in order to recuperate. In fact, your entire body was beginning to scream for some form of respite after the arduous ascent. While you really did wish to oblige to the painful requests your body was shouting, you knew all too well that stopping right upon the thigh would be a dangerous act to perform. If the movements weren't enough to toss your tired form straight towards the concrete ground, then trying your best to hang on to the soft wall of fur would surely send you, and your weak muscles to an early grave. You had to think of something fast. Some way to avoid succumbing to exhaustion as well as keeping you safe and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were taking a quick breather with both hands tightly gripping a set of fur, you gaze up at the wolfess's upper body. Right before you was her massive pair of shorts, around half the distance of her ankle from your earlier travel. As awkward as it might sound, it seemed like your best bet would try to make your way to the fabric and use it as a sort of base for recuperating. The only problem was deciding just which path to take. You could attempt to continue your climb until you reach the waistband of her shorts, or the more awkward decision, you could try and squirm your way through the leg hole and rest within them. With your whole body starting to burn and course with pain, you had to make a decision quick.</span></div></div>",

You managed to make it this far up, so why not just try and make your way up towards her waistband for a break? With a deep breath and loud grunt, you raise your right hand upwards to grip the fabric of her shorts before pulling yourself upwards. Upon ascending only a few feet (to you at least) on the shorts, you suddenly feel your muscles begin to tense up in utter pain. A low grunt and gasp escapes as you exert some of the pain vocally, though that really didn't help much in your case. \"Come on...just a bit-\" With a great gasp, you soon find yourself gazing upwards as the wolfess's huge fingers slowly begin to descend towards you. \"oh no...nonono!\" You stammer as she appeared to be scratching an itch, which ironically happened to be your location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly shocked, you try your best to keep a steady grip before clenching your eyes close. Hopefully she wouldn't scratch you too hard with her fingers. And maybe, just maybe, you'd be able to avoid her claws. Upon holding a steady grip, you suddenly feel a solid force from behind beginning to poke you. Just as you were expecting the worst however, the object quickly retracts as a sudden gasp was heard above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the?\" a female voice stammers in shear confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEqually confused, you slowly open your eyes to gaze up from your current position. Upon staring however, you quickly find the massive wolf girl's head gazing straight down at your form with wide eyes. A sudden gasp escapes your mouth as you quickly feel your blood begin to freeze inside your body. With your current position so high up, trying to release would certainly leave you badly injured, if not dead from the impact. To your horror, it seemed your current fate was within the lupine's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second or two of silence, the wolf girl simply continues to stare down before lowering her right hand towards you. To weak to try and quickly move away, her huge fingers easily manage to wrap around your miniscule form before raising you skyward. Despite the terrifying predicament, it felt great to finally give your muscles a brief break from climbing. With shocked eyes and slightly agape mouth, you gaze upon the canine's huge face utterly terrified. Just then however, the massive girl begins to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" she asks.</span></div></div>",

You screamed a little from the drop but you were fine when landed on her thong but the bad thing is because of the angle it was place in it was just like a slide sliding you between Bruno\u2019s cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Bruno felt you reach her cheeks she let her sweatpants and thong go which caused them to catapult you further into her butt you were now a few metres away from her ring of flesh \u201coh got could things get any worse. </span></div></div>",

The safest place, is on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Lynx let go and ran off, it seemed that survival out here was rather impossible given there was nothing small enough for you to even kill for food and it'd take days to get a dent in the skin of any berries or plant life. If there were regular animals here, it was more likely that the hunter would be the hunted or just get crushed, and a bug, most would be somewhere between the size of your house and the neighborhood or bigger. Weather wasn't even on your side, a light breeze was a hurricane gale and a drop of water was a pretty darn big pond, the millions in even a small drizzle could make oceans of mud now miles deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no choice, you followed the other lynx, at a dead run. Movement was almost impossible, the grooves and imperfections of the cement were paths you were forced to run through. Easily you could remember walking on millions of sidewalks and never noticing, at the most, you'd known that a sidewalk felt rough underfoot. At the time of course, your feet weren't in the range of 1/175th of an inch long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, it was beyond understanding why the enormous Lynx had stood there so long, but that wasn't mattering much as you were right at the smaller of them and ready to ascend. Between you were several strands of fur, they were more like buildings than an insulator, but were the way up. Your companion was already ascending, like a little rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing had never been your strong area, and now being naked as you did it was making it worse. Images of girls laughing below came to mind, a reminder from school. Of course, football and soccer had always been the thing, not shimmying up frigging ropes.That was stuff for cheer leaders and kids, stuff that was a waste of time.</span></div></div>",

Things stayed good too, as the Large Lynx walked rather than ran, it was hard enough to hold on as things were, each step generating plenty of force to hurl you off. More than anything, it was your companion that kept you there, his claws had no effect to the giant but were plenty to hold him down and then dig in and anchor you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good while later, you arrived at the creature's house, or at least what you thought was his house. At the steps, you thought for a second you saw a human-like pair of flipflops and sandals, but could not be sure. Inside, the giant proceeded up a set of steps and then left down a hall way. It was all huge, you were certain a city or even state could fit in here and have room to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our stop\" the smaller lynx said, running forward, grabbing you and boldly jumping over the edge. Oddly though, the descent was not all that fast, but rather slow. In fact, you felt nearly nothing at the landing. Quickly he said, \"we're like particles, being so small, gravity almost doesn't apply to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around, the wooden floors continue on as if they never ended, miles upon miles of them. There were doors though, with a kilometer or more gap between their bottoms and the floor. It all seemed familiar though, the layout of the house, the area, everything, even from this low angle. All of a sudden, your examination ended as yet again, the Lynx hauled you off, to the side of the hall and across a series of bridges of various materials, most of it so small they needed a microscope to be seen. However, these every-day materials were the only way between floor-boards, seemingly smooth if you were big, but greatly separated at this level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room, you were hauled under a piece of furniture of some sort before you saw the room. Under this there were all sorts of toys, but you couldn't figure out what most were from the perspective of a piece of dust as even a small action figure or plastic doll was a giant beyond imagining. You went to demand an explanation, but one was practically thrown at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Felix, and welcome to your new and for that matter, old home\" Felix said, launching into an explanation that would have made a squierrel's chatter seem slow. \"This is a universe, or really, a reality that does not create its own life, but takes if from others. Each reality is how things could have gone different, there are infinite numbers of them, most life develops at the same size and either is shrunken getting here or was just that small to begin with. There are many of these realities, but despite the differences, people stay together. This is your house, as it is also mine, in my world, I was your cousin. That Lynx, was you. By your lack of dress, I am going to guess you shrank coming here. A few days ago, your siblings here died, I imagine yours in your world are now here as well, but far larger. That giant nearly died, which is why you are here and likely small. Unfortunately, everyone who comes here has a slight attitude change if they keep their size, the biggest change is either an ignorance for us, a need to enslave us or being outright evil to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door opens, a furry set of paws and then a human foot enter.

He loved running in the dirt, didn't wear shoes out there and didn't always understand the difference between little toy and little animal or thing. That meant the huge things down here were everything from GI-Joes to socks to shoes to any boyhood toy, but even the smallest of them was like a skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the edge of the furniture, whatever this was, you craned you neck up in the hopes of seeing something beside a death-machine for a brother. Unfortunately, all you saw were feet, leg and muddy clothes. His feet, luckily were not like the Lynx's but were smaller, though longer. Without the mud, you figured at the toes he was 300 feet tall and by the ankle could be as much as a thousand. This was not a particularly pleasing though, the kid you had tortured as all older brothers must do to the little ones, was now like a walking city to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever talked with the giants?\" You quickly ask Felix, wanting to talk with one of them and maybe see being friends and getting along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad! That's suicide!\" Felix yelled, though both of you were small enough that about one thing was going to hear you. That one thing was the gigantic Lynx, who could spot a mouse from 200 meters away and hear almost anything, but you weren't sure if he could hear you or what he would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do you know all this?\" you ask, grabbing your 'cousin' by the neck, through all the fur you put enough pressure on it to give him reason to fear for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"City people, they flee the place for their lives, tell of the horror stories\" he hastily answered before forcing his way out of your grip and backing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a sudden movement and you are forced to retreat, and fast. The human giant is coming this way, his titanic toes slipping in the very gap you occupy, unaware he was going to kill his directly related brother. Just narrowly, you avoid the rock-hard wall of flesh, it seems more like a machine than a person. In front of it, you look up at the mud in the huge gaps between the toes, on the toes and all over, not to mention the sweat. An enormous ammount of it falls to the ground, making small mountains, though really it isn't anywhere near the full ammount.</span></div></div>",

On the right, you see mud, uck and general gross slop. However, at the top of that enormous tower, there was someone who should be very close to you and well known. However he may also not hear you or have the toy-problem and think of you as fragile as a toy, though he may also get vengance, at his size, you couldn't stop him if that was the way it went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the left, however, your sights saw a much bigger and stronger creature, not that strength was much of a factor anymore, anything could disturb dust. Well, anything but yourself as a spec of dust could well be as big as a house or a semi. Moving up and down, you know the fur will be easier to climb, but that the beast will also be more active. There was also the fact that you knew yourself the best, though he was a different you. How well would you know him? Of course, he had better chances of hearing you with the couple thousand feet of radar-dome like ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill naked, you run to the giant, his toes alone made you a speck when held up to comparison for size, and there wasn't a single muscle in him as small as your entire body.

There was however, no chance of that happening, so it was to your giant counterpart you went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic fur-ball was holding still, it seemed now would be your only chance to catch him as otherwise there would be miles to cross before getting this close. By sprinting, the distance was covered, as you got closer, you looked farther and farther up to see him. For a few seconds, your thoughts turned to imaging being that big, that strong but found in truth you had been until today. You always had been taller than your little brother, you always had been able to hurl a toy like it was a little rocket, you always had crushed bugs, you always had been that strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the titanic toes, all this thinking ended as a problem was discovered. There was no way up, here you were at the base of a creature weighing a million tons but lacking a way up him. Earlier, a strand of fur had reached the ground, but now, they were all teasing you by ending 50 feet overhead and a few came as low as 10 feet over your head. To the giants, there was no difference in distance, but to you it was the difference between getting up there and being stranded in the middle of the floor of a giant boy's room. A few times that giant had stepped back during your run, which left you now far from any cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically looking around, you finally spot the pads. By now you've walked as far as the middle toe and have no choice but to try and scale that center piece of fleshy protection before your counterpart takes another step. Hurredly you run at it and jump on, fitting into the grooves that formed a distinct paw-print, then jumping up to climb onto the next. All the time doing this, the enormous mass covered you in sweat, which was coated on thicker than you were. It felt like climbing a cold waterfall of salty grime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a seeming eternity, but possibly just minutes, you'd reached the top. Here fur ran all over flatly as it was pushed against the paw by an enormous weight. These pieces of fur made the perfect bridges, but you doubted their ability to hold you. The option to turn back is however removed in an instant as the ground disappeared, then it was back but it was like the view out from an airplane's landing gear, like seeing a whole country-side. Each step was well into the thousands of feet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything came up and you were deafened by an enormous explosion, really it was the sound of a step. On the ground, things moved as the toes splayed before being picked up again to repeat the process. Quickly, you jumped out onto the nearest piece of fur and started making for the nearest edge. If 'you' started running, there was no way to hold on to the pads or the fur, a higher and better perch was needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweaty black foot prints marked your path along the enormous pathways, like catwalks and bridges across the sky. At some places you could run right to the next spot, others you couldn't and had to jump or find another way. Despite the giant's walking, you kept your balance and did not fall off, something to this day that is a mystery to you. There was no time to stop for a breather as at last you reached a piece of fur going vertically, though a thought about it would have been wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed up, you realized you were in one of the worst places possible, between the toes. Splayed or closed there was plenty of room, but if he wiggled them for any reason, you were certain that the fur would become a much more active crushing agent. Still, you climbed up, through muck and grime, dirt and more. At one point, you found a 'pebble' now a 300 foot tall boulder wedged in and found there was an identical but smaller one between your own toes. You plucked it out and threw it, imagining doing the same thing to this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the steps stopped and you were forced to hang on to whatever you could to avoid being hurtled across wherever you were. The foot was now upright so that the heel was down and you could walk on the gap between the toes like this was a giant valley. Running, you reached the cliff like end of the toes, there was an enormous drop to the leg and then everything became a landscape of clothes and fur heading up the giant's body. \"You\" were lying in bed with your feet propped up and back against a mountain of pillows and some gaming implement in hand. At the moment, you were only a couple hundred feet up the toes and having thousands more to go, 3 miles of a furry you.</span></div></div>",

The giant Lynx puts his toy down and starts looking around for a little person, probably thinking its a creature that was naturally small from another world, perhaps a friend from his own.

His face can't remotely get that close without a lot of moving and probably killing of you. Off to the sides, you see his enormous arms pick up and close in, under the fur you can clearly see enormous muscles, as yours once had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left foot, between middle toes!\" you yell, there are four of the mountains, but you are unsure which side of the middle you are on. An absolutely enormous hand closes in on the foot, claws coming out and one nearly crushes you but just misses, quickly you climb up to avoid an further risk of crushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand moves up as the whole giant shifts to be comfortable again, he brings you right in front of his enormous eye with a quick layover at the mouth. In his mouth, you see spires of enormous teeth, built for predators but also plenty good at crushing cities and skyscrapers that would be midgets next to them. Easily you can see him destroying a whole city in there, though perhaps you head was picturing a city smaller than it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see you\" the giant booms, it almost seems as if it is the enormous green eye talking as it passes from side to side, but is unable to spot you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here, just really tiny, your something like three miles tall to me\" you yell, looking around and finding that you blend in with the many imperfections of the claw. A giant would have a hard time finding the small pathways and bump or two, but they were plainly visible to you. \"If Felix told the truth, I am you from another world. I just shrank getting here. My brother though seems to have come in fine and full-sized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains that strange pile of clothes I found earlier,\" the lynx said, \"I came here like that too. I got normal by luck, sometimes a portal shows up from here to here. They can go both ways though I'm afraid, watch you don't go through one and get any smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour view shifted as the claw came around to sit you in the enormous ears, they were huge, stretching far into the sky. A  radar dome like that would be used to detect frigging planets, small radar units picked up big stuff, big ones picked up huge stuff. \"Any idea where to find one of these?\" you ask, not yelling though, surely up here he'd hear you fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally around people who've recently crossed over\" he answers, \"one could form around you, but the odds are really good with your brother, sister and that girlfriend of his, and that one of yours too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone ever controlled them?\" you ask, hoping to find a road home by controling whatever portal you find between the worlds. Get home and get there fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few tries, but that's it\" he answers again, \"supposedly you can do it once or twice with your mind.\"</span></div></div>",

At the moment, the scales have tipped drastically against you and an inch is closer to 5000 feet than it has to being an inch. The ear your in is deep enough to probably hold a city, at the least, it seems like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, your attention is once more drawn to the enormous furry foot. Looking up, you see it is Felix! Earlier he had been far, far shorter than you and nowhere near as strong. A second or two ago, you were a giant compared to this, and the giants, it was best not to think about them.  1/25th of 1/25th of an inch tall, or possibly even a bit worse, either way it was not good for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you run up to Felix, your actions seem like de'ja vu. When you start the climb though, you realize it is not.  His feet are buried in mud and dirt, he may well have been worse than Tom. The climbing up furs thing though is getting old, you've been doing it all day long. By the time you make it up onto a toe, the titan is on the move. He walks by strands of fur that are big to him but to you, they're just enormous, hands-down gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second or two, your attention is shaken back to the present and the current enormous fur your surrounded by. It seemed a little on the ridiculous side right now, but that was that. Being on a forest of fur walking through an almost identical forest of fur. Of course earlier, you'd pinned this forest against a wall, now the weight of a single toe or a piece of fur would make you flatter than any pancake.</span></div></div>",

It just didn't work. The enormous movements Felix took to climb down your counterpart, then the bed and then just to walk made progress impossible for you. All the effort at hand was just on keeping on the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat seemed hours later, it was darker and cooler all around along with a deafening roar that seemed familiar. After climbing a stalk of fur, a very interesting fact was revieled, your cousin had taken you outside or at the least he had gone outside. Earlier, this place was a scary environment, but now it was horrifying as nothing could be smaller than you and anything bigger would be like a walking country block. There was one piece of good news and that was an abundance of shelter, the smallest holes were caves, and there were probably billions of caves as a result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright cous'\" a voice booms from overhead, \"I saw the portal, I know you didn't grow but I'd bet you shrank and are on me now. Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurredly, you scale a strand of fur and start yelling up \"I'm down here! Here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix hears a shrill yell, it is barely understandable but coming from the ground. Having been in similar positions, he knew how and where to look, quickly finding the amazingly micro you. Things now became bad, a claw was not offered, but two of the enormous things caught you like titanium vices. A quick ascent forced miles to dissolve quickly, leaving you far into the air of a vengeful \"friend.\"</span></div></div>",

It was Tom's toe-print, at least an old one at the base of a plant, a mountain of grass. \"But, I can't watch you tonight, I might just be finding a portal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan walked down slope into the pit, it was several miles to you from the start of the slope to where it became level at the base. This was a result of dirt washing from the top into it and lengthening the expanse, not to mention the dirt settling over-time. At the plant, Felix stomped, pushing down until his whole foot was well under the dirt. As his foot was removed, you were dropped as fast as you had come up to land in the enormous footprint, dead-center in a lake of sweat from the center pad. Your pit was a few thousand feet deep, assuming you could swim through the mucky-sweat and start climbing the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What out for the bugs\" Felix said, walking away. His steps created earthquakes as he left, putting you in a miniature storm at sea. \"Just about all of them are way bigger than me and that's a lot bigger than you. They seem to have a thing for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat fact was quite true, a worm's diamter was significantly greater than Felix and thousands of feet to you, an ant's leg was probably bigger around than this whole footprint and a single rain-drop would go a very long way to flooding the hole created by Tom's toes. You moved off towards the far off walls as fast as your micorscopic feet could kick to take you. In the grand scheme, that was not very far.</span></div></div>",

At the worst you just couldn't sleep because of the booming of giant insects walking around or the immense bass sound of the crickets. These problems kept you up, loud noises, fear of attack, and even to an extent, a fear about exposure as you had yet to find clothes this tiny. Admittedly if a girl were to show up you'd be embarrased despite being so small that you couldn't be seen, let alone anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though, the morning has arrived. At first you are greeted by extreme hunger as you wake and stand, but then there is something worse. Lakes start to fall out of the sky. Really, its dew from the plant overhead dripping off the leaves, but that's a good quarter to half inch diameter of water which on your scale is a couple thousand feet. It would be a welcome opportunity to wash away the sweat from Felix's paws along with all the grime, but you also wanted to live through that and right now, the water around you was heavy enough that it'd make you a piece of paper on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning along the edge of the paw print as fast as you can, you try to outrun the coming water. Your feet splash in the shallow lake of sweat, at least shallow here, if you were to slip, the landing would be in a section well over your head. Its a race against time and gravity, far off there's a section of pad-print without any leaves over it and thats the objective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy luck and probably a slurry of new medical disorders,  you reach the safe area and immediately collapse on the ground there. Hours could have passed as you laid there and it was all good until you were interupted. Five soft shapes patted on your back, trying to rouse you. It was a feline foot, and on your scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over, you find Felix, whatever portal he used, it did the same to him as yours did to you. Before he can say a word, you grab the foot still hovering in mid-air from an interrupted attempt to shove at you. Ordinarily this would've been gross but as your whole body had been there it wasn't anymore. As you stand, you ram you fingers at the toes and start to spread them wider than they were meant to go and simultaneously push back. Your thoughts struck for a second that it was funny to have the foot that made this crater be in your hands and in the crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the edge of the water, you shove with all your might and send the little lynx into the pools of his own sweat from his pads that now formed masses far larger than his whole body. Looking down, its funny to see him come to shore looking like a drowning,but oddly yellow rat. Though a rat was also far larger than this little spot as well, a rat wouldn't drown here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was once more smaller than you, there were a few things that could be done...</span></div></div>",

At his pits things got a bit tricky, you weren't going in there. For once though, the simple solution just worked. Dropping to the side, you just moved along from piece of fur to piece fo fur and eventually end up getting to his head. It was indeed huge, but as far as you were concerned was hollow. Now here came an interesting choice: wake him up or wait until he comes to. His ears were right there, very sensitive and you'd be mroe than loud enough standing in them.</span></div></div>",

At the worst you just couldn't sleep because of the booming of giant insects walking around or the immense bass sound of the crickets. These problems kept you up, loud noises, fear of attack, and even to an extent, a fear about exposure as you had yet to find clothes this tiny. Admittedly if a girl were to show up you'd be embarrased despite being so small that you couldn't be seen, let alone anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though, the morning has arrived. At first you are greeted by extreme hunger as you wake and stand, but then there is something worse. Lakes start to fall out of the sky. Really, its dew from the plant overhead dripping off the leaves, but that's a good quarter to half inch diameter of water which on your scale is a couple thousand feet. It would be a welcome opportunity to wash away the sweat from Felix's paws along with all the grime, but you also wanted to live through that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a great deal of running, it seemed the down pour would never end as you reached the edge of the paw-print, but really it wasn't. This was the end of a pad, its just that huge walls separated out the toes and claws, which appeared to be too far under the plant to be effected by dew. Examining the wall, you find a small hole, even to you it is tiny, but you can fit in and move forward, seeing light at the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end you find that wasn't light but a very shiny piece of rock, however it is reflecting light from around a corner. Very quickly, you move on around, expecting the curve will take you to a toe. Its slower going this time and you have to move forward on your belly, it is that low and its a longer run too. After a while, you realize that this is also a climb upward, it seems steep and to be making a lot of distance, but on the grand scheme, a kid's finger-nails were longer than the whole foot print was deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you emerge to find yourself in the center pad again, but higher up, on a cliff that is almost as high up as the ground around the print. However there is a problem, its also too far from the edge, likely carved apart by a piece of fur or something. Either way, there was no way to reach the toe-print in which the paw-print was made. Jump and you'd never make it, climb down and over, you'd slide to the ground, it was unattainable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you sat at your high perch, legs stretched in front of you and for a second, laugh at calling this high. For one thing, a paperclip was bigger than this hole, as a little kid who was barefoot and loose on a playground you'd made deeper pits and taken bigger falls. You looked down at your body and saw a total mess, you were coated in dirt and in places it made you blacker than Felix's pads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the thought train is forced to a stop as thunder fills the area like nothing else. Far off, you think you see the sliding glass door of the back of the house open, but aren't sure. Seconds later, an Earthquake that shattered the richter scale like an egg. This tiny, you'd yet to be around a full-sized person walking around and now you never wanted to again, someone could be hundreds of miles away and do this, up close would be even worse.</span></div></div>",

From here you can see the toes of a furry walking mountain, but that's all so far. Already you'd been on your counterpart this size, though never his feet so that would be bad as at a scale larger it was nearly impossible to survive, this probably would be impossible. Should that be Felix, it would be even worse as he knew where you were and could come for you, even if he couldn't see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seems to pass slow, even slower than in normal bad situations. Its like the enormous white walls in the distance are only closing at the slowest pace they can, though truthfully they are moving far faster than you ever could, with two feet exceeding 20 miles on your scale. Gradually though, he closes in and becomes more focused as your eyes handle the closer distance better than the greater one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the creature is clearly Felix. His toes are around 3 miles tall and seem forever wide whenever they splay against the ground. Looking skyward, you fail to scale much more of him, its just too disturbing of a thought to bring to mind right now that he's suddenly so large. Whats worse though is he'd headed right for you and its fairly certain that he's going to destroy you rather than attempt some sort of rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he closes, you see his claws sticking clearly out of each toe, to the creature that made your current footprint they were sharp as needles. to you they came down to a broad plane probably as big as a soccer field or so. If the claws came down, they'd crush rather than cut, so at least now he couldn't inflict harm by making you bleed but rather he'd just make you a stain and end it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on you, his enormous foot, far larger than Tom's would level the toe-print from Tom and then Felix's on footprint from earlier. Being smaller than a spec of dust, you might survive but probably would not. The forces here are in billions of tons hitting on a 15 mile area, not counting the gaps between the toes, which were miles to you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he's on you, the pads are looming overhead, bigger than cities...</span></div></div>",

Its part of how barefeet get dirty and how contact can spread things, its also what saves you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous foot comes down like a lightning bolt as it covers miles in seconds. Air is shoved downward by the shear wall, it works like an ancient fan made from a huge plant leaf or one of those cheap folding paper fans. Tons of pressure stacks in the small space and it becomes impossible to stand or move as you fall to the ground, pinned without even being touched and at that, technically by one of the few things smaller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll goes black as the foot blocks out t he sun. Your surrounded by cold liquid and float upward on pure reaction to what has just happened. Felix's sweaty paws have dumped a few drops on you, but its like an ocean of the stuff rather than the lake from earlier. At the top, you look around to see nothing, then suddenly feel pressure again but with something solid there, something harder than any rock ever was, or for that matter any metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight floods back in, blinding you for several seconds. When you open them, you see the ground far, far below. Looking around, its soon discovered that your in what is comparatively a valley, a huge imperfection a couple hundred feet deep in the Lynx's pad.

The only guess right now was that the Feline's mass was great enough to create its own gravity, or at least enough to effect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather disturbing to see the ground and light coming and then going like this, but there was nothing that could be done about it right now. You just hoped that Felix didn't get into a fight or wrestle anyone or kick at anything, every one of those cases would have enough force to throw you off or push the pad in enough to reach you. Recalling some early memories, it was also known that no-tactic was ever spared in some fights, a few of which could end up killing you.</span></div></div>",

Evidence licked off in bath that night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, that line changes. As the titan's toes come flying down, you see yet another portal. The universe was extremely unstable and well, the more portals got used, the more would open. When someone went through that made a ripple in the fabric of space and a few portals could open around them, especially in the presence of someone else who had their own ripples following. Your jumping through so many portals recently has made it possible to open one here as Felix's huge ripples made small holes against your microscopic ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHovering in the air, you saw that shimmer indicating a portal. There was no time to think things through, you just ran forward and dove through it. On the other side, everything was dark as you blacked out, but wherever you were, it was bright, warm and sunny. Before you eyes closed, black and white objects filled your vision and in the distance, you thought there may well have been something pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, you come to.

As it climbs, you see white beams that seem to be weaved, running up the enormous incline. All around, there is grass stretching well over your head and off in the grass right to the side you see a huge object that appears to be black and white as well, with several large masses coming off it. It suddenly clicked in, these were skating shoes, by the coloring it was extremely likely they were your brother's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be dangerous to let him see you, but he could also help. You figure at the worst case, he's over a half-mile tall and won't even notice you.

Then as quickly as it was there, the massive mountain like floating structure is gone, to have landed at least a half-mile away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's how easy it is for a giant to kill you. One would never know it and all that would survive as evidence would be a red blood stain on their feet or whatever crushed you that would be 1/25th of an inch long if that and almost non-existent in depth. For the Lynx that'd be a pin-head sized dot on a surface of black that was continually exposed to rough dirts, rubbing the micro-stain clean if he didn't lick himself clean like a normal cat. In the case of your brother, in all likelyhood, mud would wash away whatever remained now matter where on him your were crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you push all those thoughts out of your mind; no more red stain on the threads in Tom's shorts, no more red-stain on a piece of fur or pad, none of that. Back on track, you move forward towards Tom once more, though the closer you get, the farther away you want to be. At 250ft away, toes dominate your view and the gaps between them forced wide by the weight on them, seem like valleys. The grooves that made finger and footprints are clearly visible and enormous, though not as deep as they should be, as they're filled with mud, it is only in some places that plain flesh is visible. Even the toe-nails are coated underneath where it seemed not even you could fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, everything is a sudden blur. Tom's titan toes disappeared for just an instant as they shot into the air, trying to get him higher to examine the odd ears. He's gone thousands of feet in the air, at least it seems it from here. The next seconds come in slow-motion as you find out what it felt like for the many bugs you crushed under your feet, though now you were far, far smaller than any bug. You wonder if the titan Tom will even feel anything besides floor under his toes?</span></div></div>",

Standing up, it seems you are on an unending plain, there are patches where a shiny material is visible, though its a rough type of material as well, but most of the plain is coated in some mix of dirt and mud forming hills and valleys and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a sudden booming overhead, its deafening. You look to the sky and all you see behind you is an absolutely enormous tower running into a blue thing that kept going and seemed to meet with another blue tower and then one like this. There comes another booming, but it is definitely feminine, a 'little' girl's voice, probably shrill if someone were on her scale but to you its bass. A second later, a spire slams into the surface out of the sky, you look up and see it connect to an even larger mass and keep going out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" you say, imagining this to be some sick person's idea of a real-life twilight zone. Nothing was making sense, where the hell were you. There was no place on Earth like this, not yours and not that damned new world Earth either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there is another object flying from the sky, it lands directly in front of you, but quite a distance away. It looks like your counter-part but he's grown, he's grown a LOT. The toes were well clear of a thousand feet tall, at least 1200 if not more, running up he was standing 24,800 feet tall not looking at the ears. As he closed though, you realized that wasn't your double, it was Felix! This...was....Tom's....TOE NAIL! 25 times Felix's height, it was half a million feet in any direction to get off the nail, assuming it was the big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurredly, you look for the portal, maybe a chance to dive back through it?</span></div></div>",

Being so small, the gap in his toes was like a valley when he was standing flat, and it was practically a canyon if he stood on them as they were forced apart just a bit by his weight. Everything fell to darkness when he hit, a huge bang and shaking spread out like a bomb going off and then it was still as he tried to reach those ears, though without jumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, you looked around in near total darkness, the only light came from the openings between the toes on either side of you. All the dirt made it feel like you truly were underground, at least for a second, then you found all the sweat and other yuck here too. In all likely hood, the slime and mud had been here for days, weeks and maybe even months or longer, a scary thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls began to move, little bits as if the giant wanted to move again but was unsure of where. Wasting no-time, you flung your naked body against a wall, not even caring to worry about where you'd come out on-top as in it all you'd lost track of which toes you were between. Of course, it was climb or die given the slight movements, it didn't matter where you were, just that there was distance being made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt twenty feet up, you felt secure enough to look around. You were on the right side between two toes but had no idea which ones, during the jump your brother could have moved or held still. Another glance and it was noticed that you were farther in, earlier the nails were right there, but now you were almost at the back where the rest of the foot started. Lastly, you noticed just what it was you were climbing. Here, everything was an unidentifiable slime likely far thicker than you were tall, at the least you knew your arms could not reach skin under it. The stuff seemed to be a mix of mud, sweat and dirts, little rocks were mixed in and farther off there were boulders which started around half your size and grew into giants. Your whole front was coated in the stuff, it was everywhere on you; between your toes in globs proportionally thicker than Tom, all over your heels and running up the back of your legs, your stomach, arms, hands and places you'd rather not think of it being.</span></div></div>",

Are you?\" she suddenly asks, perplexed. \"I've never seen anything like you before. You're as small as a mouseperson... But you don't have any fur, or ears... or a tail for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Well, I'm a human,\" you say. \"I'm not from here, though. I don't know how I got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not from here, huh? Guess that explains why I've never seen anything like you...\" The giant cat girl pauses, her eyes widening suddenly. \"Wait... Does that mean you're an alien?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to shake your head, but after thinking a bit, you realize that you actually are an alien. Clearly, this is not Earth, and since you're from Earth, you are technically an alien here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not from here,\" you repeat. \"Maybe that does make me an alien, but I'm not sure. That's not really too important right now, though. Can you tell me where I am? And... Maybe help me get back home? I know that's asking a lot, but you seem nice, and I hope you could help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little compliment near the end makes the cat girl smile. You're thankful for that. She seems more willing to help you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what I could do,\" she says, \"But maybe I can think of something. For now, do you mind if I take you to my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her that's fine, and she smiles back at you. She tells you to hold still, and reaches down with the hand not holding you to open up her purse, and then she gently places you inside, telling you that she doesn't want anyone seeing you and potentially causing problems. With that, she closes the top, sealing you in darkness as she begins to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while...</span></div></div>",

Luckily for you though, there really didn't seem to be too much inside, let alone anything heavy that could pin you down. Seeing as how it was a challenge to keep a standing position within the carrying bag, you quickly make your way to the closest corner as a means to keep some sort of balance inside. As you sit patiently placing your trust within this humanoid feline, a sudden jostle manages to toss you front first as the bag begins to ease into a stop. Confused, you gaze upwards wondering just what was going on outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there!\" a female voice, despite being a bit muffled, emerges for above. To your surprise, you quickly discover that this new voice must've been some sort of companion to your feline friend. \"Didn't expect to see you around here.\" the other voice says in a giddy tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's my normal route of course.\" The catgirl replies with a small chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile continuing to gaze upwards, you can't help but wonder just what type of animal her supposed friend could be. Seeing as how you were in some odd world inhabited by humanoid animals, the possibilities seemed to be enormous over species. As you begin to contemplate just what she could possibly see, your ears continue to overhear the two's conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! it's been forever though!\" The other voice says still exuberant as before. \"We Totally have to do something. Oh! I know!\" She beams happily. \"How about we spend the day at your place?\" she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden suggestion manages to leave your blood cold. There was no telling just what the feline's friend would be like, let alone if she would actually see you as a supposed friend or not. Above, it seemed like the catgirl was just as shocked as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My house?\" she stammers taken aback by the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh!\" The other voice replies playfully. \"Who else's house am I talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know.\" The Catgirl stammers, obviously uncertain about the idea. \"W-well...how about we try hanging out some other time?\" she insists with a small chuckle. \"I mean, I'm pretty busy right now so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? some other time?\" The other voice asks taken aback. \"Oh come on! it's the weekend, what could you possibly have to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" The feline murmurs under her breath.</span></div></div>",

It continues as it stares at you intently: \"are you really of those human creatures they have been talking about on the news?\". You say nothing, the fear inside you is causing you to blank completely. You try to mumble out some words.. but your jaw locks up.... The fox kid hasn't moved an inch, his warm breath seems to speed up, as if excited by your silence. \"You must be one... what else could you be\".

Your makeshift prison release slightly, allowing you to see a very large (to you) door open in front of you. After the door swings open, your prison closes up again. Your world is shaken by the quick movements of this giant anthro. You hear another door close, and again, everything stops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel his hand open slightly from the bottom.

I'm gonna die now... fuck...\" As the weight begins to increase, you begin to feel pain, but it was a strange kind. Your expecting excruciating bone breaking intensity, but instead.. you just feel like you have a heavy blanket of sorts on you.. enveloping you in warmth. Has the fox shifts more of his weight, the sensation of the heavy 'blanket' begins to compress your chest, cause you to have trouble breathing.... You begin to panic more has the weight increased. A musky smell fills the little bit of air around you as you try to stay alive. All why this is happening, you can't stop thinking about how your bones haven't snap and the weight crush you flat. Though you feel really uncomfortable, your not in serious pain....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the weight shift off of you this time. You again assess yourself for damage... \"holy crap... I'm fine..\" you mumble to yourself under your breath. As your heart rate slows to just above normal, you glance up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the giant fox looking down at you, again smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this confirms it, your human\".... you giggle a bit at that statement...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox kneels down in front of your now sitting form. As you realize the situation your in (again) your heart races has the macro fox lowers itself to look at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide it's now or never... you swallow your fear and try to speak \"Wh.. who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foxes' ears switch at your small voice.

Some how there was enough room for both of you, though it was tight. You were pressed up against his toes and claws, face and body pressed into the smelly fur. Your arm was under the soft leathery pads and was be squished, luckily not painfully. Tome put on the other shoe, tying the laces tighter then the first one. Nothing so far was as bad as when Tom stood up. Some much pressure was put on you. Every step rattled you to your core and shook you up and down.

She should warm up fast though.\" Tom sits down on the bed, dropping you a couple inches in front of his crossed legs. \"Dad's the strict one, but he will bend if my mom insists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else in the family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I have a brother in college and a couple cousins that might drop by. No one else my age though,\" Tom tells you, looking around the room instead of you. \"You can meet my friends this weekend. Eric is going to be so jealous,\" he absentmindedly says. He gets up off the bed again, causing you to fall forward with the mattress springing back in place. Pushing yourself up to look where he's walking off to. He is digging through some container on top of his dresser.

One alone was over twice you height and it's width was almost wide as you were tall. Similar to his hands, leathery pink pads made up most to all of the bottom of his foot paws. The pink pad was separated into basically two parts. The sole, which was the heel, arch and ball, all one solid pad, and his toes, which were individually padded with black tuffs of fur coming through between the toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaku began to speak \"So, like I said, we will start out easy, go ahead a massage my paws a bit.

The feeling of knowing something terrible is about to happen. The hand that's grabbing you keeps lifting you, giving you the feeling of vertigo. Your body is turned around... forcing you to face the face of this creature. You close your eyes in fear... but nothing happens... and after what felt like a solid minute, you open your eyes.

Until now, you never really got a chance to look at her thoroughly, for a wolf-girl, she was quite attractive. She was wearing what I guess was the equivalent of tight jeans and a green top. And when she started to walk back, her perky boobs bounced a little has she stepped. She bends over towards you, revealing her grey furred breast, and says, if you do a good job, I may even reward you. You speak out:\"what If I do a bad job?. She just smirks...\"well, if I were you, I would just do a really good job.\" And with that, she plops on her bed, sending you flying a few feet in the air, luckily the bed made for a soft landing. She swings her legs over you, and pushed the crumpled covers (from sleeping the night before) to the edge of the bed. \"Ok slave, get started\". Not really sure what to do, you walk down to her paws. As you pass her shin and ankle, you realize that her foot was almost twice as tall as you are.... You hear your master sigh, indicating you better get started and quick. You look up at her wiggling clawed toes..... You continue to the front side (or I guess bottom side) of her paws. You were actually quite surprise at how similar her paws were to the human equivalent, all the basic parts where there, now just covered in fur and paw pads and claws. Since her heel pad were all you could easily reach you began there.... Not all too confidently, you place your hands on the surprisingly soft, leathery surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to rub the soft black pad, pressing your hand in a massaging motion. You realized something as you were massaging... \"god her paws smell bad....\". You guess that, like humans, these anthro creatures must sweat as well....As you rub the heel pad, you hear sighs of content coming from your \"master\"..... You keep rubbing her heel pad for the next 5 minutes or so, then you move onto the other foot, repeating the process. After you finished her left heel, you aren't really sure what to do. \"Unless she wants to rub the fur of her arch as well.... I'm not going to able to reach the upper pad or toes.....\" Not wanting to get punished, you just start rubbing the extremely fine fur between the heel and ball pad. The smell didn't even seem so bad now, but it was definitely there... After another solid 10 minutes of rubbing, you are running out of ideas. You look up to your new \"master\" for some guidance, but, she appears to be sleeping....You think to yourself while still rubbing the soft fur of her arch... \"This might be my last time to escape.., but that space between the door and floor looks pretty tight....</span></div></div>",

What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still don't respond, still too afraid and shocked to do anything. The wolf-girl sighs and brings up her other hand. You're worried what she'll do with it, but to your surprise, she begins to gently pat your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw... you're afraid,\" she says quietly. \"Y'know, I'd be too, if a giant creature came and snatched me up. I'm sorry if I scared you... But, if you don't mind, I don't think I'll release you--for a while at least. I have no idea what you are or where you came from, but it must be dangerous for something your size to be all alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile slightly and nod, and finally regain your speech. \"Th-thanks,\" you say. \"Y-you're not going to hurt me, then? Promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" the wolf-girl says with a grin. The number of sharp teeth in said grin doesn't help calm you though. She notices and seals her lips again, giving a smaller smile without showing any teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get going,\" she says. \"It's getting late, and I don't want anybody to see us. It'd be best to keep you a secret... Except... there's one person I might want to contact and show you to... I was just talking with a friend, who found something like you. Maybe she knows mroe about what you are and how you got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unsure if it would be a good idea to let this wolf-girl inform others about you. She seems gentle, but you're afraid that others might be mroe violent. Before you can offer her your opinion, though, she says...</span></div></div>",

But instead you ended up with the ironically caring and gentle predator that you now knew as Melody. You relaxed you're body as sleep took hold of you once more.

The shadowy figure peered into the window. It's yellow eyes scanning through the bedroom until the locked onto their prize. A small human sleeping in a box. The figure opened its paw to reveal three humans. One women and two men. \"He's asleep on her dresser, bring him to me,\" The voice was cold and harsh sounding, so much so that even a simple 'I'm coming' from it's owner might be mistaken for a threat. The figure released the three humans onto the ground and without hesitation they found a small nook in the side of the house where they silently entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unaware of the danger, both you and Melody slept soundly. It wasn't until you felt a pair of arms grab your legs that you stirred in your sleep. You eyes fluttered open, bleary shapes moved before you. Taking a few moments to blink away the sleep you found that a human man had your legs and was dragging you out of your bed, \"Mel-\" you tried to call for Melody but your mouth was covered by the woman. You used your hands to twist her arm and make her let go of you, but the second man grabbed your arms and restrained them. They began carrying you towards the edge of the dresser. You glanced around the room and froze when you saw a pair of yellow eyes staring at you through the blinds. The eyes seemed to pierce into your very soul and mad hour heart feel weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the trio continued on with you in tow, you noticed that there was a small bottle of perfum that you were going to pass. As they brought you closer to it you tightened your muscles. As they hauled you past it you thrust your body towards it with all the strength you had while at the same tim kikicking your legs straight out. You weren't released, but you did manage to change the momentum of your group enough to cause them to stumble into the bottle and knock it over. The bottle clattered against the top of e dresser and rolled into a second bottle clinking into it before knocking it over as well. Melody stirred and sat up. Her long black hair in a messy tangle and her eyes drained of life. She mumbled something unintelligible before looking over at where you should have been. Upon seeing that you were not there, her eyes suddenly came to life filled with worry. She scanned the entire dresser looking for you until she finally found your small fram amongst a mass of thieves that held you captive. Her expresssion changed from worried to outraged as she got out of her bed. The kidnappers dropped you before disappearing into the shadows. You looked in the window to find the eyes had vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Melody hesitantly scooped you up into her paws, \"You okay?

She smiles as you clambered onto her paw, amused by your antics. \"Come on, let's get you cleaned up,\" She said as she carried you into the bathroom. She set you down on the counter top next to what looked like a small paper cup filled with water. Next to the cup, there was a price of cloth which had clearly been cut from a larger piece. It was like a hand towel for you, a bit oversized and thicker than you were used to, but it was useable.

The puma gazed down at you in wonder, \"How did you find him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He found me first... but he had second thoughts about sticking around when he realized I'd seen him, he tried to run but I was able to grab him before he made it to far... the little guy was scared senseless and I doubt that my grabbing him helped,\" Melody explained as she recalled the events of the previous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie nodded, \"I can imagine. But still, I'm amazed at his level of intelligence....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I actually brought him here to see if you could help find him a way home,\" Melody continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie scratched her chin, \"I'd have to run a few tests on him...\" she mused as she began to reach for you. You instinctively cringed as her clawtips neared you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before she reached you though, Melody's free paw came up between you and Katie's paw, \"He's a living creature, not one of your test drones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right,\" The puma laughed as she withdrew her paw, \"Sorry, I got a little excited there... So, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Keith,\" Melody supplied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie nodded, \"Keith... Would you mind... um... stepping onto my paw for me?\" She awkwardly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nervously looked back to Melody who nodded at you with a reassuring smile, \"I know she seems a bit... excitable... but she's trustworthy, you've just gotta give her the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nod and take a deep breath, \"Sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After your affirmative answer, Katie extended her paw so it was parallel with Melody's. You noted that her paw as slightly smaller than Melody's. With trepidation, you inched your way closer to her paw as if it might snap up and grab you at a moment's warning. \"Oh come on little guy, I promise I'll be gentle,\" The large cat pleaded. You hesitantly crossed over to her paw. Once you were in her palm, she carried you into another room. This room both amazed you and frightened you. There were scales, beakers and test tubes filled with all sorts of different colored chemicals. Computer and digital displays hung above various tables and containers displaying all kinds of readings and numbers. There was no doubt in you're mind that this was definitely a lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And now I'm suddenly concerned for my welfare,\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie giggled as she brought you up to her muzzled, \"Don't be silly, I'm not going to do anything more than weigh and look at you.\" She then moved over to a table with a magnifying lamp and a small scale. She then set you down on the table next to the scale. \"Alright then,\" Katie grinned, \"Step up on the scale if you would.\" You carefully did as she asked and stepped on the polished stainless steel surface. The scale beeped a few time before Katie gave a small nod, \"Hm... a bit lighter than I thought... Ok, now come on over under the lamp.\" You looked over to where the feline was gesturing and found a magnifying glass with a florescent light on the underside. \"You might want to close your eyes for this,\" Katie warned as she flipped the switch causing the light to flicker to life. Fortunately for you though, you'd managed to act on her warning before she actually turned the light on. \"Hmm... aside from not having fur like we do, I'm not seeing any abnormalities... the subject-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"-Subject?\" Melody asked with a disapproving tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Er... Keith, seems to be fine with healthy vitals as far as I can tell. I'll have to get more specialized equipment to get more data. It'll take a while though, I may be interested in keeping him in one piece...\" Katie stated, \"But I can think of quite a few scholars who'd be happy to dissect you all the same. I'll have to spread the shipments out to keep them from getting too curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shrugged, \"Well, if that's the way it's got to be. Looks like I'll be here for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both girls nodded down at you, \"Well, I don't mind,\" Melody said with  a smile, \"As long as you're happy to stay I'm happy to have you!\" She beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um... Melody? Shouldn't you be getting to class?\" Katie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Melody's face dropped, \"Oh! You're right, I totally forgot! Keith... I guess the best thing to do is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Overall, the result was the once titan like anthro that could crush you by flexing her fingers now resembled a stray puppy in a cardboard box, begging to be adopted.

Maybe somewhere inside of you, just for a moment, you had felt a wanting to go with the flow, to follow along with her game and be a good acquaintance... but not if she's going to scare you into playing. You stand there and fold your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna play Katie!\" You shout to her. (You shout because you're a bit far from her.) She continues to hum and mess around with her mechanisms and experiments. Her tail flickers from side to side in an innocent sway... she's still gonna play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Keith! You've five minutes left to hide.\" Kat meows. She giggles a bit. You grunt. It's like you're talking to a child. You stand on the desk, waiting patiently for her to turn around and say 'o.k., we don't have to play if you don't want to.'... but she doesn't. With every passing minute you feel like you both gain and lose confidence at the same time. Your instincts are telling you to hide so badly that you've broken into a nervous sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie...? Come on now.\" You call to her anxiously. Your words go through one puma ear and out the other. \"You're making me nervous.\" You tell her flatly. You try to look around her to see what she's working on, but her massive frame blocks too much of the view. You glance left and right, still with your arms crossed. Your heart pounds by just standing. Another minute goes by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty seconds, Keith.\" She says with a monotonous tone. This time her voice seems to have changed its demeanor. You freeze and contemplate hiding, but you know she can't hurt you without hurting her friend... right? You breathe in and out in an attempt to calm yourself. Maybe your assertiveness will pay off when she turns around to see you not playing. \"Alright, times up.\" She says out loud. She turns around, her gaze now frighteningly scary. You stand still, you want to run, you absolutely want to run so much! She locks her eyes on you and steps closer. You progressively look up as she approaches. The puma towers over you, her petty stare peering right into your soul. The puma puts a paw out and grabs you. You're squeezed, but not too rightly. The feline brings you up to her face once more. She doesn't speak. You shiver, what is she thinking? Thoughts run through your head, ranging from 'I should have hid' and 'Where's Melody'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K- Kat- ie?\" You stutter. Your voice breaks a bit, revealing your composure to be weakening. Suddenly she opens her mouth, you gasp. You grasp the strands of hair on her paws as she lifts your small body into the air. Skillfully she tosses you up, while in your apex she catches you by the leg. You dangle over her open mouth, her hot breath washing over you. \"Katie?!\" You yell terrified, you flail around trying to hit her nose until she suddenly drops you. Adrenaline courses through your body as you land on her tongue. It's wet and it feels sharp. Your eyes widen as she clamps down, shutting you out from the outside world. You're left in total darkness, her tongue forces you into the roof of her mouth. She pushes you around all inside of her mouth, completely coating you with her spit. Your shouts of protests are muffled from the outside world. She tastes you for a while. You could feel her purrs emanate from her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel exhausted after a while from trying to fight it, your body giving up on you. \"No...\" You plead. You go limp. With one last suckle on your four inch mass, she puts a paw in her mouth and lightly grabs your torso. You lay half-awake on her paw, drenched in saliva. You groan. You can't exactly rub your eyes with nothing dry. You hear her say something like 'I wasn't gonna eatchya, silly!' ... then you faint. </span></div></div>",

Melody said after you get through her goofiness and craziness, she would be a good friend. (Or so to speak.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six minutes!\" Katie calls. She stops fiddling with her apparent project, she's across the room by now, her frame looking out a relative window. You scan around, there are not to many places to hide... especially when you're four inches tall on a table. At least this table is more than just a table, it connects to the other ones to make the appearance of a doctor's office... but it's full of science and miscellaneous things. For five minutes, you scramble to find a good place. You eventually decide to try and climb her cameras. Her room is filled with so many things, it seemed almost a perfect ladder to the top of the shelves above her tables. Seems almost too perfect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty seconds!\" Katie lists out her playfulness in a purr. She must be super excited to play with a new species. You reach the top of the head level cabinets and run towards the wall, crouching so she can't see you if she glanced up. You're well on top of a hiding place! The thought of what she said, 'most mice usually end up inside the cat'... it chills you... she can't mean it, right? How would Melody feel? \"Alright, hope you found a spot!\" She laughs. She turns around and clasps her paws together. You frown. She looks around the room for a bit trying to find where you are. You breathe lightly, for you don't know how much noise these large animals can pick up. You don't lay on your stomach, mostly because it's really dusty up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sounds of shuffling and the moving of mechanical objects, sometimes she'd exclaim 'Aha!', to only find she was wrong again. Katie mumbles to herself, trying to use her brain. Her face lights up. You can't see her; you don't take the risk of peeking over the top of the cabinets to watch her. \"This may be unconventional, Keith... hehe.\" She chuckles, she turns around to look at the conveniently placed material you had climbed up on. \"But Melody had taken a Psychology class a couple years ago. I, on the other hand, took a biology class.\" She rants. You make a puzzled expression accordingly. What is she talking about? \"Oh, I don't know... but a little intuition and thinking put two and two together...\" She was readily looking at the items, a smile growing wide on her face, her teeth showing with pride. \"And you make a good trap for little intruders... like mice in a lab.\" She finishes. \"I know where you are this time, Kieth!\" She puts her paws on the top of the cabinet, your stomach drops. She pulls herself up and looks left to right, landing her gaze on you. \"There! Ha!\" She exclaims, her furry arm extends to grab you, but you're <i>just</i> out of her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" You gasp. You scramble and dart across the top of the cabinet. She stumbles and falls. You feel a massive thud, but she simply landed on her bottom, brushing it off. You breathe rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Originally, I set those items there for actual mice, but I see you're the only one it-\" She was pushing off the floor mid-sentence, \"worked on!\" She grunts and pulls herself up, this time, she's right in front of you. Your eyes meet hers, she throws a paw out to catch you in your running trajectory, you don't have enough time to react and land in her paw, she grasps. You're squeezed, and let out a cry of pain, she was crushing you. But that wasn't the worst part about it- she didn't adjust herself properly when she grabbed you, and she violently falls back to the floor, letting you go. You're lifted and you're flying through the air, your heart is pounding. You freeze, your spine sends a gut wrenching feeling through your whole body- you're falling! Kat lands on her back, she clenches her eyes shut as she hits the floor. \"<i>Grraawr!</i>\" She grunts. Kat opens her eyes and sees her little friend falling! Your eyes are wide open as you fall towards her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasps, reaching out to grab you... but you fall past her paw... and straight towards her face. She doesn't expect you to fall so quickly, your mass speeds towards her face, and her opened maw. You brace, expecting to land on her head, a heavy landing, but you don't? Immediately, your body feels a soft surface, everything goes dark. Katie chokes, putting both her paws to her throat. She's forced back a bit as you slam into the back of her mouth. You can't slow down, though, and your upper body is stuck in her throat. You're stopped. You feel the tough, jerkish gags coming from these soft insides. She keeps trying to push you out with her natural, overpowering strength, but she can't get you out. Every vibration and movement only slides you deeper into her throat. You're coated with saliva, slipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour muffled yells don't help. Kat's eyes tear up from her attempts, she wasn't planning on this, she was just going to tease you by putting you in her mouth, but her over playfulness made her irresponsible. You feel gravity pull you down once more, her muscles are a traitor. She instinctively gulps. You feel a rush as her body clamps around your small form. It's dark, hot, wet, and you're sliding into her stomach. \"Nono! No! Ahh!\" You shout, mouth opening, you only get wetness in your mouth as a return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Oh no no no!\" Kat panics. She feels the bulge go down her neck, and with a paw she inspects it. She coughs and gets up. On the inside, you're shook around, you reach her stomach entrance. Her muscles squeeze you past, and you're pulled through into a small opening. The vibrations from her panicked voice are like an earthquake. You're scared out of your mind by now, hurt from her paws, and being constricted by the soft walls all around you. You wince in pain, she had to have broken something? On the other hand... you feel an odd arousal being in Kat's stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat hurriedly looks around, trying to figure out how to get you out. (You get one freebie because that wasn't lucky.)</span></div></div>",

Who knows?\" You cringed as she set you down on the counter. \"Now, as I was saying; I've been repurposing these doll clothes to fit one of you guys in case I ever found myself in your company. So go ahead, try some on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You looked through the flies hoping for a style that would suit you and trying on anything that fit you. Eventually you found a white t shirt and a pair of gray sweatpants that fit. You hoping for some denim jeans, but at this point you were happy to have clothes at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm,\" Katie mused, \"they seem a little big on you. Could it be the molecular distortion effect? Or perhaps the doll maker's fabric wasn't very high on quality as it was in production... did I remember the deminsions wrong?\" At length Katie waved her hands and shook her head, \"Meh, it doesn't matter, I'll make sure to adjust some more clothes that fit you better later. Right now, I've got a manual I need to read over, and you're coming with me.\" Just then, you noticed a blur of motion out of your left eye. You turned just in time to see Katie's tail lightly smack into you. You were thrown off the counter with a yelp of surprise, a shout of fear and a grunt from the impact of landing in Katie's waiting paw. She laughed at your various expressions as she brought you up to her muzzle and dumped you on her snout just ahead of her green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You glared at them with anger and frustration, \"Are you trying to kill me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No,\" She snickered, \"Just give you a heart attack.\" Something told you it would be a long day before Melody came back to get you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She occasionally asks you to remember a word or phrase as she continues reading and later will ask you what said word or phrase was later on. You think she's just checking the context, but she could be cross referencing. She was reclined in her bed while you lounged on her shoulder against the pillow she was resting on. Time seemed to fly by as she read chapter after chapter. Eventually she finished the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I bet you're hungry huh?\" She asked as she looked down at you from the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come to think of it yeah, I am...\" You replied with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She lifted a paw up to your shoulder, prompting you to jump on, \"Then let's go get something to eat.

You take a moment to debate mentally on the best way to get her attention. However, in the middle of your debating, you begin to have second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dMaybe this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t such a good idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d You mumble to yourself as you realize how big she actually is in comparison to you. You turn and decide to run into the grass, but you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite escape her notice. The vixen hums a bit as she notices movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhat was that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asks herself quietly as she begins to move toward where you had been standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hurriedly make your way through the grass as the giant fox tries to track you, and unfortunately for you, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing a fairly decent job. Though she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pin down exactly where you are, she trails you rather closely as she moves through the grass in a crouched posture and inspects the areas where she notices movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You eventually come to a stone wall. It takes you a moment to realize that the \u00e2\u0080\u0098wall\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is actually the foundation to a house. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait... then that means that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been running through somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You panted to yourself, you began to wonder just how big this world was from your perspective. You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time to dwell on that thought however as the vixen was once again getting too close for comfort. You searched all around the wall looking for a place to hide. Eventually, after what seemed like an eternity, you found a crack in the bricks just above the foundation. You hoisted yourself up and crawled into the tight jagged opening. You were sure that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d scrapped yourself up trying to force yourself through, but you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care. You sat for a moment and caught your breath before continuing into the crack. You figured that if you stayed outside long enough, if nobody snatched you up, the elements or dehydration would kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You pushed, crawled, shuffled and climbed for what seemed like hours, though in reality it was probably only a few minutes. At length, you saw a light up ahead. The texture of the walls around you changed. After one final push, you fell onto a tile floor. You were inside the house. You searched for the owner, but you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find any sign of one. You knew that they were probably in another part of the house, so you decided that caution would be the priority as you tried to find a \u00e2\u0080\u0098safe zone\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to collect yourself and figure out what to do next.</span></div></div>",

You continued to search for a place to hide when the two giants walk into the kitchen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, perfect...\u00e2\u0080\u009d You quietly moaned to yourself. One was the fox from earlier. She was wearing blue denim jeans with what looked like converse sneakers, but the toes were completely open exposing her paws and the claws on the tips of her toes. She wore an unbuttoned gray plaid long sleeved shirt, and a white v neck t shirt underneath. She had brown hair the naturally fell to shoulder length and soft amber eyes that seemed to radiate their own glow. Her conversational partner appeared to be a border collie. She had blonde hair pulled back With a green bandanna. Her two ears poked out of her hair and had the classic \u00e2\u0080\u0098dog ear droop at their tips. Her eyes were deep blue and she wore blue jeans with a green t shirt that matched her bandanna. She wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wearing any shoes at all, so her paws were completely exposed and she seemed to be a little shorter than the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You began to wonder where in god\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ended up. But you decided to stick to the task of finding you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re safe haven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dSo this thing you saw,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The collie mused, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow big would you say it was?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very big, maybe a few inches at best,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fox replied as she opened a cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dSeemed kinda agile?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dActually it was impressively agile for its size.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dDid it happen to be blue and red in color?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fox paused, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really get a good look at it, but it seemed more like an orange than a red to me... wait... how did you know what color it was?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was at that moment, you realized you were wearing blue denim jeans and a red t shirt. You slowed to a stop, and with every fiber of your being screaming for you to keep running, you turned around to find the border collie locking her blue eyes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dBecause I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking right at it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d She told the fox, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stranger still, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure its looking right at me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The vixen turned to face her friend and then traced her line of sight to you, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh my god, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I saw!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt Kinda looks... like a human...\u00e2\u0080\u009d The border collie mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut, those aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t supposed to be real,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fox replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dTell him that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The shorter canine replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were frozen in place, your willpower was gone. You wanted to move, but your legs just wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it. The fox took a step toward you ever so slowly, you finally regained control of your body and took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dErm... hey there, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hurt you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fox coaxed as she gave you the friendliest smile she could muster. However, given your size you realize that believing her and allowing them to come near you would be no different than resigning your fate to them. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help that you had rather recently experienced heartbreak, and you came from a disfunctional family to say the least. So needless to say, trust wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something you gave out freely, and you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about to trust these giants with your life. You turned on your heel and sprinted away just as fast as you could push your legs to carry you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A shadow fell over you prompting you to glance up, you found the border collie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand just above you blotting out the lights above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some small part of you was amazed that she was able to reach you so fast given that her starting point would have been from behind where the fox was standing. You picked your feet up in the form of a short hop before you kicked them down and out to your left, throwing yourself into a horizontal vertical leap. You barely avoided her white paw as she slid past you along the tile floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You started running for the furniture in the living room as you heard the fox yelling at the collie. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBree!? What are you doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She demanded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to scare the poor thing to death!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already scared, at this point we need to catch him and then worry about how he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feeling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bree replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut-\u00e2\u0080\u009c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dChris, if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t catch it and it ends up outside again, what do you think its odds of survival are going to be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Forced to conced her friends point, Chris joined the pursuit. Time and time again they would make a grab for you only to have you slip away. A large factor in all of this was that you could understand what they were saying, which of course they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize. This made understanding their tactics and evading them much easier than it should have been. But even that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep them from cornering you. After a few minutes of the cat and mouse game they finally cornered you, literally. In a momentary lapse of judgement you found yourself pinned in a ninety degree corner between the canines and the two walls that met at your back. You shifted yourself to move right, but Chris was positioned to catch you. You then changed position and began shuffling to the left, but Bree was set up like a catcher in a baseball game, practically daring you to make a move. You thought about going between them, and after a deep breath, you decided that was your best bet. You bolted toward the gap between the two giants. Bree shifted herself and mad a grab for you, but you were able to jump over her hand and landed on top of her fist.

She was wearing a tight pair of black pants with a black and white striped shirt and had long violet hair that reached down to her monster sized butt. But what struck you the most was that this tigress had blue fur rather than orange or white. You've heard of a cryptid called the Maltese tiger that was supposed to be blue but you didn't think they really existed or that they'd be this tall. This tiger woman was talking on her cell phone and you could see somewhat of a look of disbelief on her face. \"You're crazy Sadie,\" she said. \"You really are. You just happened to see a strange creature, smaller than a thumbnail with no fur, no tail and no claws? Are these those humans you're always going on about girlfriend? Those saber tooth fangs are cutting off the flow of oxygen to your brain. Everyone knows there is no such thing as humans.\" As this obese tigress let out a laugh, you think about it and laugh at the absurdity. A Maltese and sabertooth tiger were on the phone discussing the existence of humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't laugh it up long because this tigress was about to step on you. You jump out of the way and let out a scream. That was too close for comfort. However, that was when the tigress's ears twitched and she let out a slight confused growl. \"Hold on Sadie,\" she said. \"I think I heard something.\" \"Down here!\" You yell. This tigress woman then looks down and spots you. She decides to crouch down and take a closer look to see you waving at her. A look of surprise appears on her face before she goes back to her phone. \"Well Sadie,\" she said. \"Looks like I owe you an apology. I'll talk to you later.\" As the big blue tigress puts away her cellphone, she lets out a laugh as she gives you a sinister look. Maybe getting her attention wasn't such a good idea. You try to run off but she picks you up by the shirt and you let out a scream as she takes you up to her face. This giant obese tigress gives you a toothy smile and shows off her massive fangs. This was bad, she could easily eat you and to her it wouldn't feel like anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her smile turns pleasant as she prepares to speak with you, all while stroking your head with one of her enormous fingers. \"Aren't you a cute little thing. You can ride home in my top or in the bottom little man. I'll let you decide.\"</span></div></div>",

Pushing away the excess covers and sheet. With you still in her hands, she spreads her legs out to make an acute \"V\". The feeling of free fall overcomes you as she puts you down between her macro furry thighs. You quickly get up, standing on the uneven bed surface. You were in a canyon of black and white fur. To your back, the ever so massive body of your <i>master</i> and to the front, the end of her bed, with two tall, clawed footpaws almost guarding your only real escape. You turn around and realize that your captor is wearing jean short shorts, which dominates your view. You look up, along her thin tone body, over her large round breasts, covered in a light red shirt, up to her face, sharing the same black and white markings that a normal skunk would have. The only difference, was that Rakala was huge, and had an obvious feminine look to her. Some of her white hair cascaded down. It was the same as her white fur just longer. She was smiling. But you couldn't tell the reason why. It was actually quite a devious smile. The kind you only see right before some bad hap---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so we will keep things easy to start\".</span></div></div>",

You turned to face the pink leathery soles, grimacing at the task at hand. You step forward, realizing your head only came up to the ball of her furry foot. Not wanting to make Rakala any angrier, you start. You were pretty unsure of what to do at first, but you got into the groove of things pretty quick. You rub and kneaded the soft warm surface, the paws giving off a pleasant girly scent. You moved all over the paw, being careful as it twitch and shifted. Rakala had proceeded to putting earphones in and listening to music. Her eyes were shut, meaning you could now possibly escape. You took the time to admire the busty figure of this skunk girl. Though giant and animal like, she was still pretty hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to double your efforts rubbing. Even rubbing the fur arch, which you quite honestly enjoyed because of all the soft fur. You reach up as high as you can, trying to rub her little pink toepads. After rubbing the her toepad, you started rubbing between her black furry toes. This made the smell around you intensify, as well as making your hands smell of the strangely pleasant scent. You were really working up a sweat, and as was she, making the environment even warmer. But your efforts appear to be working, she looks to be falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

She kept pushing you in, very slowly as to be care not to hurt you. It got to the point where your hands were going to enter, along with the rest of your waist. Rakala adjusted her grip forcing your hands to your sides as the rest of your body slides in, all the way to your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRakala was just in heaven. She had never felt anything so good. Every little movement you made sent a tingle down her spine. Her toes squeezed and relaxed as her large black fluffy tail twitches high above.

It was sitting on a table next to the bed. Rakala reached over and grabbed it.</span></div></div>",

She slowly pushed you further working to keep the friction low. You were going to scream, but there was no use. You were under her control with her iron grip around you. Your shins started to enter, and things got warmer and warmer. Her tail-hole, pink and pucker, enveloped the rest of your legs. You were now up to your waist.

Your feet pressing into a warm strange flesh, something you had never felt until this day.

I was expecting a nice easy summer. But instead I got hell everyday. There is something to always be done. I need to get back in the game myself and fix up this interactive. Some members have made it clear (and I agree) that this needs a bit more context. Or more indepth additions. I <b>love</b> all the stuff written, but it should not mean we sacrifice good writing. Now, I am not the best writer, far from it. But you can see the difference in adds from beginning to end. Even with my later additions I see myself adding less. I think we can change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen time allows me, I will be going through, editing/lengthening adds so that this thing will shine like it used too. So bear with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for those of you who added in my absence, THANKYOU. You are the reason why I don't just let this thing collect dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you think your writing is subpar, add it anyway. Or send me a rough copy and I'll add it after slight revision (I will give credit to the real author unless I am told otherwise). I really wont delete much at all, so please add! My <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">grammer</span> <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">gramar</span> grammar sucks too. I live in Texas, and constantly add my voicing into the writing, so don't ya' worry 'bout nothin'. I won't bite :) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this interactive is about a guy (basically 17-18 or so), who gets transported to \"a furry world\". In this world, he can either change size or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarning: This story will/could contain lots of female AND male macro/micro interactions, same size interactions, nudity, sex, slavery, paws, worshipping, mind control, dominance, macro stomp, macros, and normal sized furrys, and really whatever else you could think of... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will gladly take ideas and request for the next chapters. If you see any serious grammar mistakes, please contact me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy!<br>\r\n-J<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><u>In Depth Rules</u></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Everything is in <b>second person</b> meaning using \"you\" as the main character, this also means don't create a name for yourself. Ex. \"You ran away as the beast chased after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.\"You\" are basically a kid still, about 16 or 17. You have a good build, but nothing special. The giant furries are around the same age, varying with whatever path you choose. But for the story sake, don't go into detail about yourself, keep it open for all if you know what I mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. I decided that certain aspects of a furry story are hindered by size limits... SO I have taken a portion of them out, I will start a section for \"normal size\". I also decided the smallest can be about 1 centimeter (more so for any \"unaware\" story lines). If some one really wants smaller, they can just add a chapter (Another size) at the beginning. And if you do, make a section with the same Another Size option, so other, if need be can start something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The <b>sex of the giant doesn't matter (Male or Female)</b>, if you add any new characters, try to describe them a little, as goes for if you start a new section that hasn't been written on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. In this world, furries usually make these found humans slaves, though others may keep them as pets, so on and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. <b>No reptile, marine or avian</b> characters please, I just don't care for them (no offence for those who do). <br>\r\n7.[EDIT]<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">No hard vore please</span><b> All vore is allowed</b>, anything and everything.  <br>\r\n8. You can kill the main character, but try to build up to the death, or make it a 'interesting' death to say the least. Make sure another option is available before the ending.<br>\r\n9.<u>Everything is allowed</u>, so go crazy <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> . It's 18+ and I can increase the rating if need be. If you have a question on whether something should or shouldn't be added, just send me a message, you can even make it anonymous if need be.<br>\r\n10. 2-3 paragraph minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </td>",
