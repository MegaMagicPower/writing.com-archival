            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'So, what do they do?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sceptical. I don't normally do pills, but my dealer, we call him PF (long story why, involves a tractor and an ostrich), he was trying the hard sell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The guy who gave them to me makes all his own meds yeah, he's like the modern day McKenna or some shit, he said he the trial one he took give him a real out of body experience. Like, he literally left his body behind and went flying about the room and crap.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You serious?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Totally serious, mate.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought buzzing around my head finally landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, wait a minute, if they're so good then why are you selling them so cheap?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPF shuffled awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, to be entirely honest, I tried to sell them before, but they, um,\u2019 he rubbed his neck and avoided my eyes, \u2018they don't seem to work for most people.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI folded my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, so I see how it is, you got defective merch and want to just flog it to any old schmuck who\u2019ll buy anything, namely, me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nah man, nah, that ain't it, look,\u2019 He pulled out the box with the pills inside. \u2018Look, we\u2019ve been mates for years, so I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ll say it\u2019s twenty for the whole case.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out a hand to stop me from speaking out, then unscrewed the top of one bottle and handed me a pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You take this one home now, but if it works, you buy the whole thing, deal?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out his other hand, waiting for the shake...ah, what the hell, if it works it works, and I get a cheap box of highs, if not, fuck it, I lose nothing. I shake his hand and he places the pill in mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Later</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sitting on the stairwell of the flats where I live when I hear a loud, exaggerated cough behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do you really have to smoke here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocal busybody, Laura Yates everybody. Couple of years older than me, and yeah, I'll be the first to admit it, pretty damned hot in a coquettish librarian kind way (she\u2019s actually a teacher in the local gramma school from what I heard, real posh place, people all high on the smell of their own farts), but man, does she ever get on everybody\u2019s case. Especially mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry, miss Yates,' I say in a sing song voice dripping with sarcasm, then move aside to let her down the stairs. She turns her nose up and walks by. I watch until she\u2019s out of sight. Man, what I wouldn't give...I stub out my cigar and make my way inside my flat. Yeah, I don't like to smoke inside my flat, even though it would be much more quiet and I'd have fewer interruptions and...okay, there's a few positives but I don't like the damage it does to the walls you know, which sounds silly when you consider what it does to my lungs but anyway...nah, in my flat it's strictly non odious substances, like shrooms or tabs or...I dig dip into my pocket, remembering the pill. I roll it between my fingers as I examine it. Its nondescript in every sense of the word, could be mistaken for a tic-tac and, in fact, I sniff it. Huh, I\u2019ll be damned, mint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk over to the couch and flop down into it. I look at the pill...what the hell. Down it goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes pass and I don't feel a thing. In fact, I seriously don't feel anything, my entire bodies gone numb but my minds working fine, this is such bull shit! I try to lift my arm but nothing happens. My leg, nothing, my other arm, nothing, I try to tilt my head, nada. But then I feel a horrible thump and suddenly I feel like I'm falling and that\u2019s when I realise I am falling. I can move my arms again and I claw and grasp but I'm still falling through the couch and then everything\u2019s gone dark but then it\u2019s so bright it hurts my eyes and when they adjust I see the front hall of the flats and Laura's stood there checking her mail and I'm about to hit her and I close my eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing...no impact. I feel something in my hands and I slowly open my eyes. I see letters. As my eyes focus and the words start making sense, I see Laura's name on the letters. Then I see the red nail polish on the thin fingers. I look down and I see a blue coat I wasn't wearing, and a brown scarf I don't own, on top of...breasts I definitely don't own and my hand travels down to my crotch to my...my...wheres my penis?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a strangled yelp and I rush up the stairs, wincing only slightly as my new breasts bounce hard against my chest. I stop in front of my door and feel around the edge of the door frame for the hidden crack where I keep the spare key. My fingers brush against it when I stop and my panic instantly subsides as I realise, I <i>could</i> go into my apartment, I could do that....or I could go up to Miss Yates' and...well...I just could, I'll figure something out when I get up there. </span></div></div>",

I slowly, but somewhat gracefully, I think, spun myself around without moving my feet. I still don\u2019t know how I did that, I don\u2019t think I could do it if I was trying to. Anyway. It was only:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Mrs Pernold!\u2019 I let out a relieved snort of laughter and wiped my forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Do I know you?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Mrs Pernold, you know me very well, dote on me like\u2026well, maybe not a grandson, but certainly a close grandnephew, grandson once removed? I was never sure what the correct term here was. Which was bad because Mrs Pernold had never met Laura Yates and was already suspicious of why she, a stranger, was feeling around the door frame of my apartment. That it was actually me, well I could never tell Mrs Pernold. I couldn't say to her that I had accidentally possessed a female body, she\u2019d never believe me and then she might call the cops or the funny farm and already the silence had gone on too long and now her look of suspicion was quickly turning to outright hostility, I had to break the silence quickly with a most cunning and entirely believable display of deception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Look!\u2019 I shouted, pointing at a kid at the far end of the corridor, \u2018that child\u2019s epidermis is showing!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018His what,\u2019 said Mrs Pernold, turning to look despite herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy expert ruse had worked and so I ran. I ran quickly to the stairs and was bounding down them, two, three at a time, and was already halfway down before Mrs Pernold managed her first \u2018Oi! Get back here!\u2019 out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs I reached the ground floor, I decided it was safe to relax and gather myself, take some deep breaths, and try to figure out what was going on. What had Laura been doing? Since I was back where I started, maybe there was a clue here. I looked down at the floor where I\u2019d dropped her letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, I mean, I shouldn\u2019t look at what she\u2019s got in the post\u2026but they are technically my letters right now\u2026\u2019 I said this aloud, startling only one elderly gentleman who was walking past and who smiled nervously at me. I smiled a toothsome grin back at him for having been caught talking to myself and he sped up walking to the elevators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bent down and picked up the pile of letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Can\u2019t believe no-one picked these up,\u2019 I muttered to myself. \u2018That geezer could take the time to be scared of a person talking to themselves but not pick up a person\u2019s strewn letters and put them on the shelf so they won\u2019t get trampled. I tell you, people these days.\u2019<br>\r\nA little voice in my head reminds me that I was the one who left them on the floor in the first place and I tell it to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Let\u2019s see,\u2019 I leaf through the letters. \u2018Hmm, bill, bill, junk, bill, doctor\u2019s letter\u2026.nah, bill, junk, ooh, hello, what\u2019s this?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a heavy letter in a thick envelope. It was embossed, the paper felt like duck feathers, it smelled faintly of lavender. It also had a door-to-door tracking seal on it, got to love the work ethic and accountability of those posties, am I right? Laura\u2019s address was written in a florid cursive that I could barely even read it was that fancy. This letter was important, no doubt about it, I could practically smell the intrigue (or maybe it was just the aforementioned lavender) and was about to pry open the letter when I felt something grab me around the midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oof!\u2019 I jerked backwards, then forwards, and then upwards and my vision swam and I saw myself being lifted from Laura\u2019s body which swayed and juddered as I was swept away. Faster and faster I moved, completely unable to control direction, or where I was going until I landed back in my regular old body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI fell off the couch, such was the force of re-entry. I clambered onto my knees and then violently, spectacularly vomited all over my floor. It was a few seconds before I realised that I was burning up, I was running a massive fever. I ran to the bathroom, filled the basin with cold water and dunked my head in. Again, and again, and again. After a few minutes, the fever subsided entirely, and I looked at myself in the mirror above the basin. I saw bleary, watery, red eyes and they didn\u2019t look at all familiar. I needed to get more of those pills.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I ran back into the living room, drying my hands on my pants as I went. I picked the phone up from the table and was about to dial PF when I realised, I was tweaking bad. I looked at my hands, they were shivering, and I\u2019d already input in the wrong number three times (I don\u2019t have him saved on my phone, call it paranoia, but you never know who might get ahold of your phone). If I called him like this, despite our previous arrangement, he\u2019d probably sense my\u2026predilection\u2026towards his novelty pills and renege on our pre-arranged\u2026what the hell, why was I speaking like that? Okay, okay, I need to\u2026heh, renege\u2026no! I have to focus! If I called him like this, he\u2019d welch on our deal and probably charge three, four, maybe even five times the amount already agreed. No, that wouldn\u2019t do, this called for a touch of class, of sophistication, of subtlety. I held the phone out, took a deep breath, and then carefully, and most importantly, calmly, dialled PF\u2019s number. It rang. One. Two. Three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hello?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018GIVE ME THOSE PILLS! I NEED THEM! I WANT THEM SO BAD!\u2019 I yelled down the receiver. Calmness? Nailed it. I waited with baited breath for PF\u2019s response but he was already speaking, had been speaking over me actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Anyway, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t come to the phone right now, leave me a message after the\u2026do people even listen to this part? You know what to do.\u2019 Then there was heavy tone to indicate that I should leave a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned, ended the call, and threw the phone down on my couch, then fell on that same couch. I had to get those pills, but if PF was out then PF was out for a while. If he was in, then he was always in, but if he was out\u2026.well, he regularly went missing for days at a time. Whenever he left his house, it was never just a quick trip, it was always days. Days. Without those pills. Without being able to astral project or\u2026or\u2026there was something niggling me there and I shook my head to dislodge whatever had crawled up inside it. I swung my legs over the side of the couch and decided that this was a time to break one of my few rules, smoking inside. I opened up a fresh packet of panatellas and lit up. It helped, but not nearly as much as I thought it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I was just concerned that things in my apartment were going to smell of smoke (it\u2019s hard to get out of the upholstery, sue me), but maybe, maybe\u2026.I found my thoughts drifting to Laura Yates. How it felt to be inside her body. How it felt to be inside any other body. There was an entire world, literally, to be explored here. I could do anything, be anyone. From the petty (I imagined making the ardent anti-smoker Laura an addict) to the colossal (I could rob any bank and no one would ever know it was me, I could kill anyone and no one would ever know it was me\u2026.) and anything in-between. My mind raced with the possibilities at hand. I could do anything. I could do\u2026Damn it, damn it PF! Why\u2019d you have to go on one of your excursions?! You couldn\u2019t have waited even one more hour\u2026.just one more hour so I could get the pills? So I could get\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf, and this was so often the case, PF had left his abode for one of his lengthy, extended periods, could I not, maybe, break into his house and, perhaps, steal the pills. No. No, I couldn\u2019t do that. I was just mentally berating him for welching on our deal, I couldn\u2019t possibly turn around and do just what I was admonishing, hypothetically, him for, could I? Could I? I looked over at the puddle of sick that still laid on the floor, the only (so far that I\u2019d noticed anyway) physical reminder of what had happened\u2026and decided that I would\u2026.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No. I resolved, resolutely, absolutely, to hold my tongue in cheek, my pride in check, my patience would hold until PF was back, my will was stronger than steel. My.... wait...what was I doing outside PF's house with a crowbar in me hand? Oh, gods dammit. I was breaking in, wasn't I? Yep, I was. Look at the cracked window pane. I'd already been at it. Well, like the queen said, ain't no stopping me now. Wait, that's not how that song goes, is it? Ah, who cares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now, I just have to be careful not to make so much noise. This neighbourhood isn't exactly the...what's the opposite of sketchy? Professionally drawn? No, that's, that's not the right sketchy....the other type....proper! It's an area that is not right and proper and which is full of people like PF and myself and who needs that noise in their lives. But, whilst they won't call the pigs, would never call the po-po, they would, they might, go investigating should they see an open window. Shaking hands with the door knobs and all that, making sure that their neighbour's properties are locked and secured and whatnot because there's types about, oh my, yes, types. And who knows, some of those types might even be our type, wouldn't that be a terrible occurrence. Can't be having that, no sir, no ma'am, no how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now, if I know PF, and I do know him. Intimately. If I know him, he'd have the pills in his bathroom. It's unsanitary, and you'd better believe that I've told him this. At length. On several occasions. No one wants to be shooting, snorting, grinding, gumming, inhalating, or otherwise imbibing shit that he has stored in presence of his actual taking of a shit, but the guy heard someone refer to a bowel movement as \"taking care of some business\" and ever since, well, it's where he takes care of his business. Even though I can't say I approve of this, I will concede that it must be night to be able to conclude business deals whilst concluding business, even if the longer deals must lead to crusty ass. Mental note, ask PF about encrusted arse later. Right now, however, let's get back to pilfering. I forgot to mention, I'm now already in the house, ascending the stairs. I'm sorry, my flow of consciousness overrides me sometimes. I mean to be saying stuff like \"and then I crept up the stairs, and saw the bathroom door which concealed therein my prize' but honestly, I forget. Narrative is something that happens to other people these days. Which is why I now have the pills. Being a courteous home invader, I did put a concealing sheet of plywood over the broken window through which I'd gained entry before....it might deter people from entering, you don't know! It might! Probably not though, but anyway, I also left twenty quid in his place, I paid for the pills. It's PF's fault if his home gots broken into, maybe twice on the same day. He should have picked up his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I make it home really quickly. I think I bumped into one of the Pernold's, the man or the woman, I'm not sure, I just brushed them off and squirreled myself away to my apartment. The pills under my arms. In my possession. In my possession the means to possess. In my possession the possibility to possess. I suppose the possibility to possess is in my possession. I thank any god willing to hear that I don't have a lithp. Dammit. Now, the question is, where do I start. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The basic plot premise is this, a shiftless twenty-something acquires pills which allow him to astral project. In his astral form, he is completely undetectable, can fly, move through solid objects, and, its most powerful aspect, is able to completely take over (possess) any body he wants to. The person being possessed can sometimes remember being taken over or acting weird, but mostly they have no memory of it happening at all, and don't know how to explain the missing time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the pills:<br>\r\nAt the start of the story, the main character has only one pill. He can acquire more (either through direct or indirect means) but in all cases, each pill lasts for only one hour. He can take multiple pills to extend his astral projection but at the end of the limit, no matter where he is, he returns back to his body (i leave what happens if his body dies when he's not in it up to you all).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\nMC - A twenty something wastrel, he loves to smoke, drink, do drugs, but not to a hardcore level, he partakes at a moderate pace. He doesn't work and lives rent free in an apartment block owned by his aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura Yates - The direct opposite (because of she is) to the MC. She's a teacher at a private school where the standards are exceptionally high. She lives in the apartment directly above the MC's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr and Mrs Pernold - An old couple (he's early 70s, she's late 60s) who live in the apartment next door to the MC. They both have slight dementia which makes them think and say odd, but funny, things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPF - A drug dealer, he and the MC have been friends since childhood, he is the one who initially provides the MC with them. Very overweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Nikkelson - The inventor of the possession pills. He invents and tests (on himself mostly) new types of drugs, mostly as a hobby. He was originally a practising surgeon, but he lost his medical licence when he showed up to work extremely stoned and tried to graft arms from corpses in the morgue onto his own body because 'I need to be Spiderman and spiders have eight arms!'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious other residents of the apartment - Feel free to create and use other residents within the apartment block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rules<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are five rules which cannot be broken but almost everything else is fair game.<br>\r\n1) The astral projection is never permanent (that is, the time limit of 1 hour per pill taken is in effect, always).<br>\r\n2) A character who is possessed never has their own attitudes, feelings, or beliefs directly changed as a result of possession. (e.g. if they were a vegetarian, they wouldn't wake up from being possessed by a meat eater suddenly loving to eat meat, even if the possessor ate meat in their body).<br>\r\n3) The pills never work for PF.<br>\r\n4) Absolutely no underage stuff.<br>\r\n5) Dr Nikkelson cannot be possessed nor possess others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I say, other than that, feel free to do as you please.</td>",
