            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Everyone had rushed over excitedly to Sally's house when Sally had said that she had a way to get back at all their rivals whom had made fun of their weight over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  All four of the girls had gathered in the main living room, flopped down on the floor in a circle beside the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So what's the big surprise?\" Cathrine asked eargerly, her deep dark eyes shining with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Sally smirked her quirky little smile the three other girls knew all too well. She had come up with another invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"This!\" Sally held up a small remote device, \"Will give us the edge we need to get back at our enemies who've tormented us over the years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Kelly laughed and snatched the small black remote from Sally's pudgy hands, \"What's it control? Some kinda giant mecha? A new toaster oven to make a bad batch of cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  With wide eyes Sally slapped the back of Kellys hand and took the remote back. \"It's a size changing device. With it, we will be able to make anyone we want see us the way they say we are. Absolutly huge! The rest is up to your imagination, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Marie pushed up her glasses eagerly and took one of the devices as Sally laid them out on the dark blue carpet. \"So we can, make them small and bring them home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ha! What's that going to do? Comon Marie! I say we go on an all out stomp fest and show those punks whos boss now!\" Kelly roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Sally grumbled, \"Quit! My folks are still asleep upstairs!\" She calmed down a bit. \"Really, we can do whatever we want with these as long as no one sees your target get shrunk. Otherwise we could be in a world of trouble. But since it's such an unbelievable story, the remote comes with a shrink button of its own. Making it small enough to toss away and never be found again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"So what, we just sleep over tonight and then wander out tomorrow and start shrinking people?\" Cathrine questioned, looking kind of weirded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Smiling Sally said, \"Sure! It's going to be great. As I said, you can do whatever you want really. Personally I'm with Kelly. I think they deserve to be taught a lesson, and no one else is going to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm not sure,\" Marie said, \"I don't even step on bugs. Nevermind tiny people. But I do hate it when they make fun of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well sleep on it!\" Sally said, laying back and grabbing everyones backpack from around the side of the sofa to toss to each of their owners. \"Let's get some shut eye now, and we'll all do our thing tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

It was as wild as the science fiction novels she loved so much, but her imagination made it real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She got up and dressed into a white tee shirt and khaki shorts. After spending a few moments fixing up her red hair into it's usual pony tail but with her bright bangs still hanging over her eyes, Sally was ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Running downstairs she grabbed her backpack and looked down the hall into the kitchen. \"I think I'm going to head out for a bit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Her mother called to her, \"Sally! Get in here! Your friends are having breakfast without you. You can't leave them here alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Sally replies...</span></div></div>",

The mall wasn't too far from her house. It was the perfect place to try out her remote in public, she thought. Sure there were lots of people, but no one would be paying much attention to a short nerdy fat girl. At least that was the plan, based on years of experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two story mall was only remotely packed today. With several cars in the parking lot but not a lot considering it was a weekday and only around one in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stood on the sidewalk before the parking lot, wondering what to do. Around the back of the mall there could be some people hanging out by their cars. Then again, several stores inside could have lots of isles to find a lone person in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mall was still pretty quiet today. Even with exams on, the halls seemed empty as Sally walked in past a few name brand clothing stores. Her eyes lit up. Besides science, the mall was her second passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull of choices, Sally walked down the short enterance hall to the long corridor that made up the main section of the mall. It was an odd building. Though she had come in on the ground floor, she was on the second level. With the mall being built on a slight incline, one side gave access to the first floor, the other to the second. Of course there were stairs and escalators along the way too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Sally realized her mistake in rushing out so early this morning. Her tummy growled and she realized she hadn't eaten in quiet a bit. As the notion passed through her mind, she realized that she could cause a lot of havoc in the food court too. Patting her tummy she wondered what it would be like to eat one of the people she shrank. Most of her ideas and just been stepping on them. Usually tormenting them first a bit to get her point across on why she was doing what she was to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTugging her white tee shirt down a bit over her cut off khakis, Sally considered her options as she tapped a sandal clad foot upon the polished mall floor. What to do first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wandering the mall could wait. Sally was hungry now. Plus the scientist in her couldn't help but wonder... What do little people taste like anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food court was a single level in a circular shape. Various vendors ringed the outside of the clusters of tables, chinese food, lots of fried chicken, and of course a few burger places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too many people were in the food court. That would probably make it easier for Sally to track down a few of them. But she couldn't just sit down and start munching away on tiny struggling forms in her hands. Definatly she would need some sort of meal to cover up her extras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back and forth, Sally considered. Chicken nuggets would come with some good dipping sauce. A quick dunk in that would probably shut anyone up, or at least goop them up long enough to make the quick trip up to her mouth. Otherwise, being tossed into a hamburger would probably pin them pretty well and keep them quiet too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that on her mind she went off to catch her lunch. The arcade was just off to the far side of the food court, and as she hoped, had only a very few patrons. The change employee was wandering around outside and the cluttered arcade would provide more than enough coverage that the few blasts of light from Sallys remote would go unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few nerds from her classes were hanging out in there. \"Perfect,\" she thought. They were always pretty bothersome. With all of Sallys interests, one would figure she would be widely accepted among this group. Sadly, even they made fun of her. A few of them had a crush on her too, and that only made the situation worse. If they were going to host a role playing game at their houses she could never come because well, they couldnt have a girl over! Not that they were sexist, but mainly because they would already stumbling over their words with her just asking to join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much of a selection. Four guys and two of their sisters were hanging out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few flashes later, they found themselves staring up at Sally's impossibly huge hands as she eagerly reached down for them on the sticky floor of the arcade. None of them besides one of the girls could bring themselves to run as Sally's huge sandals landed with amazing force of each step. She smiled down over her plush tummy and breasts to her prey waiting below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one sister was getting annoying so she just decided to stomp her quickly. Grinding her out as she dumped her companions into her backpack. As much as Sally wanted to take the time to play cat and mouse with one person, she had a lot more people on her mind to catch today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly wiping off her sandal against the side of one arcade machine, she left for the food court to once again go over her decisions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ordering some chicken nuggets and a cola, Sally wandered over to a table without anyone really nearby and flopped down. Leaning over she unzipped her backpack and reached in, a chubby hand wrapping tightly around one struggling boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all gasped confused as she closed the bag and took their friend up to the top of the table. He was dropped out on the dark gray plastic serving tray, next to her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay was this ones name. A scrawny one with sandy brown hair. He laid there, looking up at the giantess hovering over him. She didnt seem to care at all as her plush arm reached over him to jam her straw into her drink. He reached up toward her soft skin, confused by what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to talk to her, but nothing seemed to get her attention. He was terrible with names too, so he wasnt even sure what to call the massive girl before him. Then his heart skipped a beat. Her huge eyes looked straight down at him and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally slowly licked her lips as she tore off the top to her honey mustard dip. This was going to be a lot of fun. Ray was one of the ones that Sally had a suspicion he liked her. Quietly she mumbled to herself, just loud enough so Ray could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I wasn't so alone,\" Sally's looked down as she said that, intentionally putting a plump hand down on the edge of the tray. \"No one has ever loved me and the only thing that makes me happy is using my magical powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay wasn't quite buying the bait yet. He still seemed stunned and just stared up at Sally, only looking away to see her hand land palm down on the edge of the tray. Her titanic fingers tapping down one after the other. The soft scent of her perfume or maybe some body spray wafted over to him. A light yummy vanilla flavour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally continued to play upon the whole sci-fi motif she ironically knew Ray would 'eat up', \"I just wish I didn't have to do this anymore. My poor broken heart. The only thing that helps me get through my days is eating people that I shrink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it. Ray was up and petting at Sally's hand. As slow and lazy as the nerd was, he caught on to that quick enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. What's wrong little one? Do you want to leave me too?\" Sally questioned, staring down at the cute little form that she nudged with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay shook his head no vigorously to make sure she could see his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally grinned, \"That's good! It's comforting you know.\" Her lips, so soft and moist, pouted as she blinked her beautiful eager eyes, pupils wide with desire. \"I won't hurt you really. My tummy may. I'll just eat you up, swallow you whole, then you can squirm in my tummy until you're all gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Ray not knowing what to do. He backed up a little as Sally grabbed a chicken nugget and looked away. She jabbed it down into the goopy sauce and brought it to her mouth. Her tongue lolled out as she brought it in and bit down, tearing it in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay fell flat down on the tray. Was that going to be his fate? He had always wanted to be near Sally's mouth, but not like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Sally popped the rest of the nugget into her mouth and swallowed it whole, making a show of tilting her head back and gulping it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong little one?\" Sally questioned. \"Look at it this way, you're going to be with me for a bit. Keeping me happy as I feel you in my tummy. Though I'll probably be sad when I can't feel you any more. Then I'll eat your friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this horrible girl really going to do all this? Ray hoped this was all a joke, a dream, anything but reality. However, when Sally's thumb pressed him tightly to the soft wall behind him of her fingers, the pressure on his chest made it feel all too real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her tiny prey, Sally contemplated. Was she really going to pop a real person in her mouth and gulp him down the hatch? If so, that was it, no turning back.</span></div></div>",

To Ray, this was a horrible experience as he was splunked into the thick slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot stopping, Sally brought him up to her mouth and absent mindedly licked some of the sauce off. Her huge thick tongue lapped along Ray's shivering body. He managed to get enough of the goopy substance out of his eyes to see the soft pink lips and lolling tongue of Sally's mouth right before he was plunged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurping the honey mustard dip off her fingers, Sally sat there with Ray in her mouth for a moment. She had options here. Should she chew? Or just swallow? This was a tough choice. She knew if she just gulped him down that he may make it into her tummy alive. That could be slow and painful in there. But she figured getting chewed up would be no picnic either. So...</span></div></div>",

She wanted the tickling sensation from his struggles inside her. Plus she didn\u2019t want all that messy blood on her perfect teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside Sally\u2019s mouth, Ray was frozen with fear. Still covered in some of the dip from earlier, he was laying face first on Sally\u2019s massive tongue, hot breath covering him. After a while he finally started to get up when suddenly, the tongue moved to the top of Sally\u2019s mouth and started to move back and forth. This would have crushed Ray if Sally\u2019s tongue wasn\u2019t so soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaliva was flowing all over Ray like a river and he could have sworn he heard moaning but it was hard to tell. After a while of this, Sally\u2019s tongue stopped moving and settled back down. Suddenly, Ray could see a light forming in front of him, Sally\u2019s mouth was opening! Ray was so excited, he knew Sally would never really eat him; this must have been some weird way of getting his attention because she liked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay started to crawl toward the opening when he found himself slipping backwards. Sally was slowly tilting her head backwards! Ray struggled to get out but tongues surface was way to slippery to get any kind of grip. Sally kept her mouth open but Ray had no way of getting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally suddenly closed her mouth and swallowed Ray. She looked down to her belly and felt Ray struggling in it. It was like a light fluttering in her and she loved it. \u201cWow, if I had known these little guys had tasted so good, I would have done this a long time ago\u201d, Sally muttered to herself. What was she going to do now, she was still hungry but did not like to eat alone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sally was like a mountain to him, a towering goddess who had complete control over his fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this in mind, Sally smiled and talked softly to make him feel comfortable, \"Hey there little guy, you look so cute all the way down there\".

Sally then grabbed Tony between her fingers and opened the top of her tank top. Tony's heart began to race as he was being positioned over Sally massive breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Tony thought they were big before, now they seemed like buildings. Just before Sally dropped him in she said, \"Make me feel sexy\", and she let go of her tiny toy and snuggled Tony between her breasts. Tony was in heaven; Sally's breasts were so big and soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was being tickled from Tony's movements, but she could tell he was enjoying himself so she kept him in there. If this wouldn\u2019t make Tony fall for her, nothing will. After a little while she plucked Tony out and put him on the lid of her drink. Tony looked up at her enormous and flawless eyes. Sally then went on to say, \"I have some friends I want you to meet\". Tony suddenly finds himself in Sally's pocket.

I'd only have ate her if he didn't go out with her but he decided to ignore my advice so,\" Marie trailed off. Saying it out loud didn't sound as good as she'd thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring dumbfounded Sally burst out, \"Comon! I said have some fun not petty revenge! I brought home a few nerds from the mall to play with. Sure someone may have got squished in the process but she wouldn't stay still. You're out here getting ready to gulp these two because you don't approve of them, and Kelly... I don't know where she'd been but her feet are filthy and on my parents new couch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's been stepping on people over at the park. Like all afternoon,\" Marie said, looking off casually. \"Come to think of it I don't think Cathrine is at school to just pick people up, she's probably shrinking a bunch too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought home a bunch! Urgh, here!\" She threw the bowl back down, almost sending the couple sliding out of the far side as it rocked back and forth on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering back into the living room she was shocked to see...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately during their conversation, Kevin had slid down the huge blonde girls throat as his sister Jane and their friend Ted watched. The three of them had struggled in vain to hold onto the girls mighty plush tongue, but Kevin had been too far back in Kelly's warm maw. It was actually pretty crowded in there which made it easier for Ted and Jane to hold on, sometimes even grasping at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally had looked on in disappointment as she saw a lump slide down her friends throat. She had hoped it was only one that had been gulped and that Kelly would spit up the rest. Instead Sally got a chubby soft palm in her face has Kelly held her away from the meal she was enjoying. Outraged Sally struggled back against her friend, but out of the two of them there was no chance for her to overpower Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They LIKE us you idiot! These aren't people that made fun of us, these people like us!\" Sally blurted out, ignoring the fact that she herself had squashed one of the sisters back at the arcade. Obviously her mind was much more focused on the guys anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly stuffed the two people within her mouth into one cheek. Trapping Ted and Jane together against her teeth and inside cheek. \"Look. I don't CARE Sally. You brought us this gift and expected us to just go wild with it. So what? They're shrunk now, so they're screwed anyway. Not like you can bring them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking exasperated, Sally breathlessly blurted out, \"Of COURSE we can bring them back! You think I'd give you a device that could end up shrinking the group of us and doom us to be tiny sized forever without a way back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back on the couch and propping up her disgustingly dirty feet on the arm rests material once again Kelly grinned, showing some struggling arms trying to reach out of the corner of her mouth, \"Big deal. We can shrink more then. What guy isn't going to want to be ours if we're able to do this to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally still looked sad and frustrated but Kelly did have a point. Even though she knew her friend has just being a bully and fighting to get her way, no matter if Sally liked it or not. Did she really even care about the guys she got at the arcade? After all the world was hers now. Was she really just jealous of her friend and wanted them for herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go do your thing. I'm going to sit back, enjoy my food, and then do whatever too,\" Kelly encouraged as her throat bulged with another swallow. Sally's eyes pleadingly watched, but it seemed the two remaining shrunken people were still in her friends mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did shrink them herself, so why should Kelly get to have all the fun. Still, her friend was much stronger than her. This wasn't fair at all.</span></div></div>",

The two of them didn't speak much besides the occasional scream. Much of the time they were too coated in saliva to do much at all. It was actually impressive the three of them had been in Kelly's mouth together up until Kevin was accidentally gulped down during the conversation with Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified at the prospect of being eaten by this giant girl, both Ted and Jane were taking their time making sure they didn't upset her, or get hurt themselves. When a soft hungry moan echoed up Kelly's throat, Jane laid down flat on the thick tongue she was kneeling on. Her eyes had adjusted to the darkness and the heavy breathing of their massive captor was shivering Kelly's uvula, just a meer meter away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really was no room in the girls hot and humid mouth. Saliva was gushing and sloshing around them, but thankfully most of it was able to be gulped down without them being sucked into Kelly's throat with it. When Kelly breathed in through her mouth deeply Ted reached out for Jane's hand to pull him back over onto the giant girls tongue. Jane felt bad for it, but looking back behind her, she realized she could try to squirm her way free from the huge lips and just leave Ted behind. They were friends but this was definitely a helpless situation. What good would it do to be once again cuddled in fear with Ted, waiting for Kelly to get bored with playing with them and gulp them down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane took a deep breath herself and considered her split second decision of what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Dangling from the plush girls mouth yet again, Jane screamed in defeat, pushing with all her might against the pillow like lips. It was no use. Her hands just sunk into the soft flesh. Was there no way out of this helpless situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Ted and struggled out from between Kelly's teeth and cheek and was kneeling on her tongue holding onto Jane's ankles. He didn't know what to do. Pushing or pulling did no good since Kelly's lips had formed a complete seal over poor Jane's body. The girls bare legs and feet just kicked feebly in the darkness. Ted held on tightly though in hopes that if Kelly decided to spit out Jane, he'd be dragged out along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile outside Jane had collected herself and was crying out for Kelly to let her go as she beat on the girls lips.

What's so wrong with that. Would you rather she just crunched them up like candy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally didn't quite know what she expected, but Marie seemed really intense. She wondered exactly what Kelly had been doing the whole time she was gone too. That was when Sally started worrying about Cathrine wandering around looking for people to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was her scientific nature but Sally had been a lot more focused on all this. One tiny person or so at a time, and focusing on the different sentations. It seemed like her friends were enjoying this on a much bigger level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww comon Sally, we're having fun!

Maybe some do! I've been sitting around the house most of the afternoon anyway, see? They're fine.\" Kelly lifted her foot up behind her and showed Sally the bottom of it. As Kelly wiggled her toes, Sally saw that it wasn't as dirty as she had imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out onto the porch, both barefoot plush girls looked into the plastic container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So on the porch or down on the front pathway?\" Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked from one to the other.

It wasn't a big deal with the ones she'd played with but she knew Ted especially, whom now dangled from Kelly's fingers, had a pretty big crush on her. Was she ready to put a pretty big crush on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly tilted her head a bit and then a huge grin spread across her face, \"You want to torment them first? That's so cool! Yeah let's do that. Tell you what, Ted always had a thing or something for you, so you take him and I'll take Kevin here. He's the gross one that couldn't just figure out what hygiene was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over, the two girls sat down on the swing, tiny guys in each respective grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this isn't so bad is it Kevin? You're all disgusting and dirty anyway, so you'd probably feel at home down with my feet,\" Kelly explained to the tiny guy in her plush hands. He was laying in her palms, sunk down sightly into the soft skin. Looking up at Kelly's huge face above, Kevin shivered at the idea. It was actually his sister Jane that had been gulped down earlier when Sally and Kelly were talking inside. He was horrified by the fact that his sister had been eaten by the now titanic girl he adored. That didn't change the fact though that he had to try to keep her happy to save himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin flung himself forward and hugged Kelly's fingers. The huge blonde menace couldn't help but smile and even have a trace of a tear well up into her eye. He really did like her. Or he was just trying to save his own butt, but at least he was putting on a good show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the other hand, Ted was looking up at Sally. The red head was leaning back slightly and almost studying the tiny guy in her hands. Sally did kind of like him but her friend was pretty set on them squashing these two guys. After watching Kelly do the same, Sally put her shrunken man down on the old wooden planks of the porch and extended the soles of her feet out towards Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth guys stared in awe of the massive feet before them and then exchanged a glance from across the way at each other. Ted was ready to do whatever was asked but Kevin was pretty worried. Unlike Ted, Kevin wasn't in good shape at all. He was overweight and tired easily. If Kelly was going to put him through a lot, he'd get worn down and squashed pretty quickly. Still, he couldn't just ignore her requests or he'd end up crushed even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well go ahead!\" Kelly boomed, \"It's not like you two can't hear us. Sally wants you two to massage our respective feet. Get to it or we'll just stomp you like the bug sized people you are now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's voice was soft at first and then she cleared her throat, \"Y, yeah! Come on Ted. I want you to put some effort into it! It should be able to feel your hands at your size. Show me what you've got!\" This wasn't going to keep Kelly busy for long. Maybe she should just go along with it. Sally had already squashed and eaten people already anyway.</span></div></div>",

After all, Sally believed that was the guys job anyway. He was quite the video game nerd with short light brown hair, and a cute anime tee shirt on with a pair of jeans. That and he was also only a couple inches tall, danging from her friends chubby fingers with the doom of being stepped on looming loudly over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kelly instead made a fist around Ted, Sally saw his arms reaching out to her eagerly. He desperately wanted to be rescued by the girl he was so interested in, but he didn't know what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally wasn't even too sure how to feel. Was this the wrong idea and had she gotten the girls far too excited with this concept? Kelly had always loved to step on bugs, and the scientist in Sally dreaded that about her friend. But this was even worse, these weren't bugs at all. If it wasn't for Sally taking the size remotes home with her they'd all be regular sized people still. On the way home from the mall she'd had almost a sleepover idea in mind. The girls would go up to Sally's room, sit around and talk about what guys they liked, and play with the tiny shrunken ones they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Kelly's fat feet were stomping down the front steps to Sally's house and onto the warm concrete pathway leading down to the sidewalk. Sally hadn't had time to mow the front lawn with her research and all, so there was a good wall of grass that ran down the length of the pathway. Was Sally really going to do this? Maybe she should take Ted. After all, at least he'd be crushed by someone he cared about. Not that it was even close to being a comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin, the other guy, was still in the container which Sally was holding onto. He was a bigger sized guy with blonde hair and a stained white tee shirt on with faded jeans. He'd always had a thing for Kelly and the two of them would have probably gotten along great if Kelly didn't think he was disgusting. Really if he'd just taken better care of himself Kelly would have asked him out. Not that Kelly didn't have some self esteem issues too, but she was still the tomboy of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you want me to show you how it's done?\" Kelly asked, putting the squirming Ted down on the pathway and placing the pad of her foot on top of him gently. Unfortunately it was a bit more vicious for Ted as she tried to run and instead was hit with the massive ball of Kelly's foot which threw him to the ground and quickly pinned him under it's weight. He wasn't being crushed, but he wasn't going to be moving anywhere either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her friends foot, Sally considered her options. At least getting squashed under Sally's foot would potentially be better. Could she just leave Ted to her mean friend that would be who knows how cruel? Snapping the lid onto the container with Kevin and placing it down on the front steps, Sally padded back over to Kelly.</span></div></div>",

Looking up with fleeting hope, Ted watched as Sally raised a huge bare sole up in the air and brought it right down upon him. It wasn't the hardest of steps, but Ted definitely felt bruised. He didn't know what to think. Ted assumed they'd just smush him in one good stomp, not whatever Sally was just doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it with just enough force to feel the ground around the sole of your foot,\" Sally encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over, Ted looked up as Kelly raised a big thick foot and stomped him as well. He lay there, breathing deeply and trying to regain his senses. The pressure definitely forced the air out of him and it still felt like he was being hit. Just instead it was like a very vicious pillow fight. They were using just enough strength to squash him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls kept taking turns, again and again. Giggling high above and stepping on poor Ted. He even tried to rise to his hands and knees and crawl away, but was just forced back down when the next grimy footstep pressed upon his back. This was more fun than Sally could have imagined, just playing around with shrunken Ted. Sure Kelly wasn't going to just leave him alone but it was funny just knocking him over with their feet and softly squashing him against the concrete path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed tried to yell up to the girls, but he was almost out of breath. It was taking a lot out of him to try to keep struggling and squirming away. Really that just made Kelly try extra hard, sometimes taking an extra turn and stepping on him twice in a row. This would make Sally laugh and take an extra turn herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww what's wrong Ted? You always wanted to get closer to me. Now here I am and you're trying to crawl away!\" Sally joked. She didn't feel too badly for him. He wasn't really hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Kelly licked her lips and raised her right foot up as high as she could. Sally looked up and realized she wasn't playing around anymore.</span></div></div>",

I mean come on, where's the fun in squishing someone with your bare feet? It's over in a second and then you've got to deal with their blood and guts all over your foot. It just sounds messy and tedious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Kelly said with upbeat confidence in her voice. \"Don't you wanna feel them struggle under your foot, completely powerless to fight off such a huge and powerful girl like us before being squashed from just the tiniest movement? Can you imagine the rush of power you'll get from completely snuffing out someone with only your bare foot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally felt a shiver shoot down her spine at Kelly's response, but ignored the feeling for now as she continued. \"Yeah that does sound kinda fun I guess, but you could do that with anyone. We know these guys and we know they like us. Imagine what you could do with a tiny person who would be willing to cooperate with you rather than some random nobody. This is pretty much our one shot at getting some shrunken people who genuinely like us and it would be a waste to just squish them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Kelly mulled over what Sally was saying to her. She was right about the two boys having a pretty big crush on them and that could be used to their advantage. Still, getting to squish a guy who really liked her sounded like a saucy tale of betrayal that was just so tempting to go through with.</span></div></div>",

Holding him in her cupped hands she tried to treat him with a bit more care as she handed him off to Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, little guy.\" She casually said as she dropped him into Sally's palm. \"I hope there's no hard feelings about the whole trying to squish you thing!\" Ted cowered in Sally's hand and seemed to find a little comfort in her embrace away from the girl who wanted to kill him just moments ago. Sally felt a ping of regret over putting him through this as well as an urge to protect the little man from any danger he would face at that size, be it from outside hazards or her own friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then. Where's my tiny man?\" Kelly asked impatiently. Not waiting for it to be given up to her she grabbed the plastic container from Sally's free hand and popped off the lid before plucking Kevin out of his translucent prison to replace Ted in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you two...\" Kelly said looking at Kevin, but also addressing Ted. \"Since we know just how much you adore us, me and my gorgeous friend here, in our endless benevolence, have decided to spare you both.\" Sally rolled her eyes at this cheesy speech.

That means no more squishing so don't worry about that.\" She added with a sly wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get one thing clear though.\" Kelly continued in a half-stern half-joking tone as she brought her face closer to the tiny man in her hand. \"You're gonna have to shape up if you want to make this thing work. A girl of <i>my</i> stature is gonna need something a little better than this!\" She gave Kevin a sharp prod with her finger, knocking him clean over onto his back. \"From now on you're hitting the gym, little man. And showering every single day. We'll make boyfriend material out of you just yet!\" Being in control like this seemed to give Kelly a massive boost in confidence. She was always the most outgoing of the group, but even then she still shared some self-image problems with everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry.\" She added calmly. \"I'll be there to help you out every step of the way. At your size we'll be able to improvise and it'll be fun for the both of us. I'm already thinking of a few ways to put you to work where you'll be burning calories in no time.\" She licked her lips in anticipation with that last statement. \"Ooh this is fun! I'm glad you talked me into this, Sally. Anyway I'm gonna take my new boyfriend here and introduce him to the rest of the girls; make sure everyone's clear on who not to squish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly left with her captive leaving Sally alone in the yard with Ted in her palm. Without her friend around controlling the situation Sally suddenly felt a lot less talkative than she did a few minutes ago. Having her partner literally in the palm of her hand seemed to work wonders for Kelly's confidence, but as she looked at the tiny man in her hand all Sally felt was embarrassment, as if she was standing in the middle of a stage with Ted being a faceless member of the staring audience. All of her body was amplified and presented to her new boyfriend and she could feel her palm starting to sweat slightly with her nerves, something Ted would notice for sure.</span></div></div>",

Then Sally started kissing him softly. Her lips were so huge they completely covered Tony and was starting to get spit all over him. After a while of kissing him Sally placed Tony on her tongue and slowly closed her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little guy found himself being felt and prodded buy this huge tongue and was being pinned down on the front teeth. Then Sally moved Tony beneath her tongue and almost suffocated him under it until she finally released he and Tony just laid there in her mouth. After what seemed like forever Sally opened her mouth a little so she could laugh a little and talk, her works were muffled a bit with a tiny person in her mouth, \"Do ou lek it in there\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice seemed to come from everywhere to Tony and the movement of Sally tongue to form words was throwing Tony everywhere. Sally closed her mouth and used her tongue to move Tony to the back of her mouth and she slowly swallowed the little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to struggle as best as he could to climb back but the strength of her throat surpassed him by at least ten times. When Sally finished with her man meal, she felt an incredible, almost orgasmic feeling building up in her and she felt a little dizzy from it.

The feeling of a tiny person hopelessly struggling in her mouth before being sent down a one-way trip to her stomach was indescribable. She held a hand against her large belly and could just make out the subtle movements of her two captives trapped inside of her. It wasn't nearly enough to satisfy her. Sally wanted her stomach to be filled with shrunken people, just thinking about it sent a shiver down her spine and made her mouth water in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up from the table and started to walk around looking for people, sub-consciously rubbing her bloated belly as she explored the mall. It was still early in the morning so it was almost empty save for a few eager shoppers wandering around waiting for the main stores to open. Every time she passed someone she imagined shrinking them down and swallowing them whole on the spot, but Sally wasn't dumb and she wanted to do this without attracting any unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 minutes of walking Sally saw her opportunity. A woman who looked to be in her mid-twenties was here on her own and Sally caught sight of her heading into the ladies room. She quickly followed her inside and waited outside the stalls for her to finish her business. As soon as she left the stall Sally blasted her with the remote and smiled as she watched the woman quickly shrink down while her cries of fear and surprise rapidly became inaudible to anyone but her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally picked up the snack-sized woman and carried her into a stall out of sight of anyone who may have heard her screaming before she shrank down. She sat down on the toilet and locked the door before holding up her latest prey in front of her face. She didn't want to go through all the theatrics she did for her first two victims so she kept things brief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never done this with a woman before, but I doubt it'll be any different. Bottom's up.\" Sally said casually as she ignored the woman's screaming and begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe begging turned to a high pitched scream that was immediately snuffed out as Sally inserted her newest snack into her mouth. After only a few seconds of the woman being thrown around the inside of her mouth by her massive tongue to get her into a more comfortable position, Sally closed her eyes and swallowed. She leaned back in satisfaction as she felt the tiny woman fighting a losing battle against her powerful throat muscles that dragged her down to the awaiting pit of Sally's stomach. As she felt her snack reach its destination in her stomach she finally opened her eyes and let out a drawn out sigh of relief. Another one down the hatch, she thought to herself with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stood up and left the restroom. Every tiny person she devoured just made her want more. She was always the kind of girl to play things out in a slow and smart manner, but maybe this wasn't the time for that kind of thinking. Idly rubbing her awaiting stomach she realized that she'd have to pick up the pace a little if she wanted to feel truly satiated. She racked her brain to try and think of a way to do this right.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sally sighed in frustration as she ran her hand over her covered belly. All her first three victims had managed to do for her was make her desperately crave more. As she went back to wandering around the mall while thinking of a plan she was hit with a sudden realization; she still had another three little people in her backpack from the arcade. It still wasn't near enough to what wanted, but it was at least something to keep her going while she thought of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into her backpack and pulled out her tiny captives, keeping them tightly held in her pudgy hand so that their pitiful screams would be completely smothered. With the three of them secured tightly Sally could simply pop them into her mouth one-by-one and to outside eyes it would look like she was just swallowing mints or some other small candy. The rush of being able to shrink people down small enough that she could swallow them whole in public and anyone watching wouldn't suspect a thing excited her in ways she never imagined before today. Also similar to small candies the shrunken people didn't last very long in Sally's clutches as she quickly sent them down into her stomach one after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally let out another sigh as her supply of shrunken snacks had quickly diminished once again. She counted out six people she had now eaten. Wow, she thought to herself, I have six real human beings alive inside of me. This is so surreal. She rubbed her belly once again, imagining what it was like for the tiny people in there. The gravity of Sally's actions over the morning had only just dawned on her. She had just taken six people; regular people who have their own lives and families and everything, and reduced them to tiny little things that were no more than snacks in her eyes. To turn a person into something she could just casually eat like that, it was indescribable. The feeling of power Sally had was immense. A massive shudder went down her spine and settled between her legs as she realized just how powerful this remote could make her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally licked her lips in anticipation. All she had to do now was come up with a decent plan, and she had a few ideas swirling around in her head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Sally wandered aimlessly through the mall brainstorming ideas something caught her attention. There was a large advertisement in place for an upcoming football game that even herself, with her almost non-existent interest in sports and sporting events, knew was going to be the biggest game of the season. More like it was going to be the smallest game of the season, Sally thought to herself with a sinister smile as she turn around and headed back to her house to begin planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust over a week later Sally stood outside her town's local stadium. The game was already a good fifteen or so minutes in so the area was filled with the deafening sound of cheering fans and, luckily for her, the outer grounds of the stadium were pretty much deserted. It was the perfect setup for her plan to be put into action, which she had meticulously gone over again and again in the days leading up to this. If her calculations were correct (and they always were) this would go off without a hitch. Perspiration began to build up as despite her overwhelming confidence of success, Sally nervously raised the remote and pressed the shrink button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire stadium was bathed in an incredibly subtle glow that was almost impossible to notice in the bright sunlight. After a few seconds of suspense there was a stunning flash and it seemingly disappeared right before Sally's eyes. To anyone else watching it would have simply disappeared, but she knew better. She grinned ear-to-ear as she casually strolled towards where the center of the field would have been. In its place was the completely reduced and solely intact stadium, about six inches in diameter and still holding over ten thousand people as they continued to shout and cheer for their team in utter ignorance of what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sally reached the shrunken stadium she was taken aback by the uninterrupted cheering of its microscopic inhabitants. While planning this out she expected everyone to realize what happened immediately, but this was definitely a pleasant surprise. Now she could have a little fun breaking the <i>big</i> news to her newest little toys. Getting down on her knees she crouched just next to the stadium and waited for her moment to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo!\" She said loudly as she popped her head over the opening of the stadium, completely overshadowing the entire field and filling the sky with her looming face. The voice drowned out the cheering completely and left everyone in stunned silence as they stared up at her. After about ten seconds everyone seemed to process just what they were seeing and the shouting picked up again, only now instead of excited cheering and hooting it was now full of panicked fear as people fought to get to the exits. Sally smirked as she realized that everyone still believed they were normal size and that she was a giant. Boy did she feel like one right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore people could actually make it out of the stadium Sally acted. She didn't want to waste any of the tiny little morsels by letting them escape into the dirt where she'd wouldn't be able to even see them. Scooping up the tiny stadium and causing the people inside to be shaken up by the worst earthquake anyone has ever experienced in human history, she quickly and gently (as gently as a girl can be when she's handling a piece of architecture that's over a thousand times smaller than it should be) placed the stadium into a plastic container she brought with her and tightly sealed the lid. There should be easily enough air inside for her to get it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her prize secure, Sally quickly made her way to her mom's car she borrowed to make a hasty escape. An entire building as (formerly) big as this going missing was going to draw a lot of attention and she didn't want to be around when it did. She drove off and made it home with no problems, exactly like she planned. Sally went upstairs and placed the container on her desk before taking the lid off. I did it, she thought with confident satisfaction and a tiny hint of relief. Ten thousand people were now in her clutches and no one was the wiser. She couldn't help but start to salivate at the thought of all those tiny people before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be fun.</span></div></div>",

She owed her rather generous physique to this kind of weakness, but it also came as a blessing in disguise at times. The size-changing device was one such example that was born from her staggering devotion to its creation to fulfill the dream that she was currently living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiped a speck of drool from the corner of her mouth before placing her pudgy hands into the container and scooping out the shrunken stadium. Holding her palms as flat as possible she positioned her head so that it could be seen by the inhabitants through the large opening in the center and addressed the tiny crowd inside with a soft yet authoritative tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fifteen minutes I will grind the stadium in which you all reside into dust between my fingers. If you do not wish to meet the same fate then I suggest you make your way to the exits and onto my right hand.\" Sally gestured with a nod towards what was formerly the south side of the stadium. \"Only use the exits on this side if you wish to escape safely.\" Sally was loving every second of this. Her inner comic book nerd was jumping for joy at how she sounded so much like a supervillain right now. If only there was a microscopic superhero in the crowd she could do battle with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished talking the entire stadium erupted into panicked cries as everyone inside desperately fought to make their way to the appropriate exits. Sally watched with amusement as the mass of tiny dots slowly and steadily crossed the field and began filing out through the exits. It didn't take long for the more fortunate ones who were seated near the exits to make their way out of the building and onto the soft flesh of Sally's palm. She didn't feel anything at first but eventually started to feel the combined footsteps of the crowd as more and more took their first steps out of their shrunken shelter and into the massive, wide world of the normal-sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking occasional glances at the clock Sally noticed that the 15 minutes were almost up, however there were still a few stragglers who had yet to make their way out of the stadium and onto the 'safety' of her hand. Not out of mercy, but rather the desire to have as many little people to play with as possible instead of wasting their pathetic lives she decided to give them 5 more minutes before acting out her promise and destroying the stadium. Once the extra time was up and it appeared that the stadium had been completely evacuated Sally separated her flat palms, holding the shrunken building in one hand and its former inhabitants in the other. Then without warning she clenched her left hand into a fist as tightly as she could. The stadium instantly buckling in her grip and crumbling to dust like a dried out sandcastle. Sally closed her eyes and savored the feeling. Her city's football stadium, the most popular landmark in the entire area, capable of seating tens of thousands at a time, the tireless work of countless manhours spent in its construction, crushed into nothing in seconds between the fingers of a chubby teenage girl. The rush she was feeling right now could only be surpassed by what she held in her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily Sally turned her attention to the crowd gathered on her right palm. Destroying the stadium had been a thrill, but in the end all she had crushed was concrete and metal, hardly anything of true importance. Now this was something truly significant. Ten thousand people, no more than a tiny fraction of an inch tall each but still ten thousand human lives stood quivering in the palm of her hand. Kings and emperors throughout history have held the power to wipe out entire kingdoms with a few simple words, but none of them have come within even a hint of what Sally had over the people in her hand. Peasants have gathered by the masses to hear men speak from the tops of towers that made them appear as ants to the speaker and as an imposing deity to the listeners and yet none have truly experienced such an imposing dominance until today. The entire crowd focused with intense fear on the eyes of their captor and Sally simply swept her glance over the formless mass of little dots, each completely indistinguishable from the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was in complete ecstasy. Her brain was fighting a tug of war with itself over just what to do with all these shrunken people. She wanted nothing more than to exert her power over them some more, to truly feel like a supervillain out of a comic book lording over the success of her master plan. But something a lot more primal was stirring inside of her. An immense desire to simply throw back her head and swallow every last one of them in a single gulp.

The incredible give to the plush flesh causing his body to sink into her breast the instant it made contact.

She knew she made the right decision making Ray her personal servant instead of simply eating him. There are plenty of people she could make into her lunch, but very few who would dedicate themselves to pleasuring her. Speaking of which she just remembered about the other shrunken people she has stored in her backpack. Putting Ray to work on her body made her completely forget about them.

Things are going to be a little bumpy for a while.\" Upon hearing this Ray stops trying to pleasure his master and holds onto to whatever soft flesh of her boob he can as she picks up the pace into a brisk walk, causing her immense breasts to jostle up and down and threaten to send him flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhythmic thumping of her breasts as well as the jiggling between strides as they fruitlessly attempt to return to their relaxed position would be almost soothing for Ray if he wasn't holding on for dear life against the quivering boobflesh. His tightening grip only serves to fluster Sally further as she breaks into a full-on sprint to cover the last couple of blocks to her home. If Ray thought he was in for a ride at first what followed would almost shake him to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her breasts started heaving up and down. The two immense mounds acting as if they had a mind of their own and easily dislodging Ray from his perch and causing him to be thrown around the inside of her shirt like a discarded ragdoll in a washing machine. Luckily for him all he made contact with was more of her plush body, which was easily soft enough to cushion his multiple blows against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sally ran, not used to such physical exercise, she began to sweat profusely, which turned Ray's prison into a hot and humid hell. Fortunately it didn't take long for her to reach her house and she stopped for a moment outside to catch her breath. Ray, slick with (mostly her) sweat managed to miraculously stay inside of her shirt for the entire trip and held on to the fabric at the bottom of the shirt right in front of her swollen belly that rapidly contracted and expanded with her heavy panting in an almost hypnotic way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering her prisoner Sally checked her cleavage and was momentarily stunned by his absence and began to worry about whether she dropped him at some point on the way home. Luckily Ray noticed that she was looking for him and caught her attention by leaping from the inner part of the shirt onto her skin, easily sticking to her sweat-soaked stomach. As she lifted up her shirt to discover him stuck to her like that she couldn't help but fall into a fit of giggles. It wasn't every day she sees a tiny man stuck to her belly like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the house Sally called out to see if anyone was home. The silence that followed told her that her friends must have taken their remotes and gone off to do their own thing while her parents must have business elsewhere. This was perfect as it gave her some much needed alone time to spend with her new pet. She went straight up into her room and deposited Ray onto her bedside cabinet as well as throwing her backpack onto the floor next to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here.\" She ordered. \"I'm going to get a shower now as I don't want to be all sweaty for this and you better be still waiting for me when I get back. Don't forget what I promised you if you do your job properly.\" She gave him another quick kiss, smothering his entire upper body with her soft lips to remind him of how well she treated her pets when they behave before grabbing a towel and leaving the room. Ray was now left all alone on the cabinet.</span></div></div>",

And honestly, a little game of cat and mouse would have been fun. No matter. There are plenty of others who can fill the role of prey.\" She remarks as she makes a sly glance towards the backpack lying on the floor. \"It's nice to have someone who actually does what they're told for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then steps back and stands up straight.

I hope you're ready, little guy.\" Without giving him time to respond she scooped him up in her hands and walked to the bed.

I can't have you walking around on my body wearing those dirty clothes. Especially when I've just gotten out of the shower. They'll have to come off.\" As she says this she uses her other hand to attempt to undress Ray, resulting in most of his clothes in being left in shredded tatters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the now naked man in her hands, Sally laid back and carefully placed him on top of her stomach. The plush flesh had quite a give to it and calmly moved up and down from her breathing. Combined with the feel of her post-shower skin it would certainly make for an incredibly soothing place to simply lie down and drift to sleep. Sally however, had different plans entirely and Ray would have to earn his rest from his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, little guy.\" Ray looks in the direction the voice is coming from, but his view is obscured by two incredible peaks with only the top of her head visible above them with her hair acting as a crimson beacon for his journey. \"It took a while to finally get here, but now that we're all ready I want a repeat of what you gave me at the mall. Only with no interruptions this time.\" She teasingly used her index finger to draw circles around his position on her belly and then traced a path up her stomach and across the side of her left breast, teasing her nipple as his next destination. \"I hope you're a good climber. It's no fun to have to keep carrying you everywhere I want to put you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Ray swallowed with an audible gulp. He was going to have his work cut out for him here in order to climb this monolithic boob. Still, he'll worry about that when he gets to it. He still had to reach the base of her breast and her soft belly felt like quicksand beneath his bare feet. Every step made him sink into her, and it did help that she seemed to be extremely ticklish with her constantly giggling sending out vibrations throughout her entire body that threatened to knock him off balance as he made the trek across the expansive flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sally was loving every second of this. The feeling of having a tiny person walking across their body like this was indescribable and it made her feel bigger than she ever felt in her entire life. It made her feel like a goddess and she wanted more of it. Maybe she'll shrink him even more when he's done with his current task and then she truly will be his entire world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Ray made it to the base of her breast he figured that the best way to tackle this would be from the top as the incline would be much less steep. To get there he would have to push through her valley of cleavage, something that would take all of his strength to accomplish. He decided to do a run up and then dive head-on into the gap between her breasts. That way he'd cover as much ground as possible in a single instant and reduce the overall travel time immensely. Sally still couldn't see what he was doing and when she felt him walking back away from her breasts it confused her for a second. Then she suddenly felt the rapid tapping of his feet followed by a slight nudge as he made impact with her cleavage. Realising what he just did sent her into a fit of giggling with amusement at her little plaything that caused her entire body to jiggle and reverberate. This made things even harder for Ray as he tried his best to push through the endless mass of quivering boobflesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what seemed like hours he made it through the valley of cleavage. Upon his exit he got a good look of Sally's face staring down at him, with her applauding his efforts with a beaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very clever, little guy!\" She told him excitedly. \"You're gonna make a great servant I just know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was time for Ray to begin his ascent. Her breasts had a much greater give to them than her tummy and even with the shallower incline it would still be a daunting task. It didn't help that he now had Sally constantly watching him from behind as she judged his performance. Slowly but surely Ray made the climb up her breast. He felt like was wading through the soft flesh and while it did feel pleasant it was hell on his legs. Finally the 'ground' beneath him started to even out and he stepped on an even softer patch of brownish skin, which caused Sally to emit an audible gasp from behind him. In the middle of this colored ground he saw his goal; her nipple that currently stood at shin height, although he knew that was going to change soon. Sitting down he wrapped his legs around the nipple and started rubbing it as hard as he could, the nub of flesh quickly expanding to the point where he has to struggle to keep his legs around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's moans and gasps behind him only encouraged Ray to give it his all. He started biting and licking the tip to do whatever he could to pleasure his master. He also had to hold on as tightly as he could as she started to shake and buck harder than ever, which set her gigantic tits in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser and closer she came to going over the edge, but Sally didn't want to finish like this. Using all of her willpower she stopped her movements and plucked Ray off her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ray...\" She said between lengthy gasps for air \"I want you...</span></div></div>",

Seeing no other method of escape he shouted as loud as he could in the hope that Sally would hear him and help him get out of this chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally relaxed as she enjoyed the feeling of his tiny movements across her belly.

A blonde haired punk girl with bright blue streaks in her hair. She'd always been frusterated that Sally just didn't shop somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't really Sally's fault. All the clothes said one size, but were always quite different at her sizes. So she ended up leaving a lot of merchandise out that the blonde/blue haired punk had to put back. Which usually lead to arguments since she wasn't exactly the most quiet girl. It seemed like Sally would never see her, and then after she'd finally found an outfit that's when the punky assistant would be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the size remote tightly in her khaki pants pocket Sally marched towards the womens clothing section. She honestly didn't know why she even shopped here. Her parents were well enough off that she could shop anywhere. There was just something about these clothes that felt right to her she guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandals clapping against her soles as she wandered over, Sally stood next to the jewelry counter across from the clothes racks. Her eyes peered over top of the displays, standing on her tip toes trying to see if the girl was in today. She could be in the change room gathering other clothes to put back from another customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally wandered into the circular racks of shirts and pants looking for her rival.

I don't have all day to reorganize the plus sized section today can't you just take your business elsewhere? We're a department store! There's lots of these in the city!\" The assistant exclaimed obviously frusterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally waved her finger playfully, \"See now that's just not customer service.\" She glanced back over her shoulder. The girl at the jewelry counter was busy wiping down the glass display case and no one else was around. It was time to shrink this girl down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty certain that Sally wasn't going to find anyone as unimpressed when the clerk saw the size remote in the plush girls hands, \"Really? What are you going to do now? Try to mute me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll make you shut up all right,\" Sally mumbled as a blast of light shot from the remote. She'd forgotten about that and actually froze. The dull fluorescent lights humming overhead wern't strong enough to hide the lightning bolt that just erupted in the middle of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously Sally glanced over her shoulder and the jewelry counter girl was looking at her confused. In a quick instant Sally held up her cellphone, \"Taking photos so I can show my friend this outfit later!\" She nervously announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally turned back to the task at hand the moment the jewelry counter clerk looked away. The tiny girl, who's nametag read Nikki was now an inch tall down near some of the shirts she'd been folding.

Sally just smiled and shook her head. This was going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving forward slightly, Sally slipped off her sandals and let her bare feet touch the short carpeted floor that seemed to only be near the change rooms. It felt nice on her tired soles and she wiggled her feet eagerly at the thought of what was about to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally put her hands on her hips and looked down with confidence, \"You see these lil' punk? If you're not nice to me they're going to be what ends up squishing you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny thrashing form below slowed down a little. Obviously everything was settling in and her temper was being replaced with the fear of realizing just how much bigger this annoying customer had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better. Now, I'm not mean. I could just leave you here and let one of the other girls wander out of the change room and splat you instead. Who knows, if they're just dropping off some clothes out here they may be barefoot. I'm pretty sure from my research you should be able to take a variety of barefoot steps without getting hurt. Though of course that's a percentage of the time,\" Sally explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's shoulders slouched. It was an hour before she was going to go off on her lunch break, and probably take the rest of the shift off because she was already fed up with all the extra stuff that had been left behind for her to do. Now she was staring at this giant plush girls toes and hoping that she wasn't really going to end up under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few people in the back change rooms too. Knowing them they'd stumble out here and end up crushing her too. This was a no win situation. Hopefully Sally had made her point and Nikki could be returned to normal size now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the case as suddenly the big girls giant toes reached forward and grabbed Nikki, bringing her down into the carpet and rolling her around under the soft ball of her foot. Sally knew what she was doing. It would be uncomfortable but she was pretty sure that Nikki wasn't being hurt badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Nikki was struggling against the soft flesh that was weighing down upon her and having a hard time struggling back against the slightly sweaty soles of this giant girl. Not one to back down from a fight though Nikki was pushing and shoving with all her might. It did actually push some of the wrinkles of Sally's foot up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above Sally was actually giggling a little. That was when Nikki realized with a sigh of exhaustion that she was actually tickling the huge customers foot instead of much else.</span></div></div>",

Besides them there was a business woman who was trying on a few skirts. She was pretty careless was in a pair of heels. That wasn't something Nikki wanted to be dodging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant plush girl rolled her foot back toward her sandal letting Nikki get tossed along the floor towards her. Out of character Nikki gave it a last ditch effort and crawled weakly to Sally's foot. She was pleading too quiet for Sally to hear and almost in tears. She held on tightly to the giant girls big toe of her right foot, but Sally just smiled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her other foot over, with a flick of her other toes she sent Nikki falling backward and staring up in fear. \"You can't just leave me like this!\" She burst out, but the shrunken sales associate was beginning to realize that she couldn't be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's huge feet reclaimed her sandals and she shuffled them on so her massive toes were gripping the thong of each flip flop. This sent a shiver down through Nikki, she really was going to leave her like this! Yet again this girl was going to leave another mess, and this one wasn't clothes to put back it was a horrible situation! She stood up again, legs weak from being under Sally's feet, and she lunged forward throwing herself onto one of the sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, what'cha doing now? Trying to crawl under my foot again? Comon now. I've made up my mind. I'll leave you for someone else. Now don't bother me anymore. There's a lot more people I want to shrink and I can't be wasting my time on you,\" Sally explained as she tipped the massive sandal forward and let Nikki plunk to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe this. The giant girl really cared this little about what happened to her. Was she really this mean? Nikki could hear a change room door being unlocked back down the hallway behind the desk. It was either going to be an adventure dodging that womans heels, or the mothers sneakers. Then she remembered the girl just a few years younger than her and looked at the dirty pair of sneakers next to her. The daughter was barefoot. Just great. If torment from Sally wasn't bad enough, Nikki could go splat under that angry girls careless foot.</span></div></div>",

Holding her close to her mouth Sally said, \"I bet you'd be good to eat!\" Emphasised by the plush girl snapping her teeth shut on the end of 'eat'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash Nikki stopped struggling and stared at the girls huge teeth and soft lips. Looking up past Sally's cheeks she saw the giant girls eager eyes looking down at her tiny body. There was no doubt, Sally was serious. Nikki didn't want to go in there! Her huge plush warm mouth, those teeth, that saliva covered tongue, the whole idea made her feel unable to fight back she was so disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big happy grin, Sally pocketed her shrinking remote and then Nikki in the opposite pocket. The plush girl's pockets in her khaki's were pretty deep and Nikki just curled up and hugged her knees in fear. She hoped that the girl changed her mind but she doubted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long walk the next situation was even worse. Nikki could hear Sally ordering a meal in the food court. Images of being included in the food finally woke Nikki enough to try to squirm free. An order of a sandwich and a bowl of mac and cheese later, Sally was off to find a seat and begin her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki struggled back into the pocket as the huge pudgy hand entered to grab her and pull her out. There was no way to avoid those fingers and she was pulled free. The scene of the absolutely enormous food court came into view and Nikki's eyes looked around horrified. Everywhere she looked it seemed giant girls were eating food as sloppy as possible. Bits of food hung from their mouths and was slurped up with their eager tongues. Either that or a casual finger pushed their prey into their maw to be consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her plush captor Sally was grinning so happily down at Nikki. She dropped the tiny girl down onto a plastic serving tray and began rubbing her large tummy that seemed that the top of it was level with the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See little store assistant, that's where you're going! I'm going to eat you up in one of my yummy food options here. Maybe I'll get you all cheesy and gooey in my mac and cheese here. I'll be nice and use a spoon to try and get you out of it and into my mouth. Or you can be put into my sandwich and I'll eat that and you can squirm around trying to avoid getting all eaten up my giant mouth!\" Sally explained to the stunned Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn't really be happening. Yet there she was, trapped between a sandwich and a cheesy place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally grinned, \"It's not like people don't drop things in the food court. I'm sure I wouldn't even notice if I squished some of my food under my bare foot. I usually slip my sandals off while sitting in here. It's nice to let my feet relax while I eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki got what she meant. If she didn't choose one of the food items, she was going to be discarded food under the plush girls feet. None of these options sounded promising. What if she got free from the sandwich or such, would that mean she'd won the right to be changed back to normal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be some way out of this but already Sally was dipping her giant fingers deeply into the mac and cheese and licking it off them high above as she looked down at Nikki's tiny form, \"I'm waiting,\" she said as she twirled her soft pink tongue around a few strings of cheese.</span></div></div>",

At least getting knocked to the floor would have given her a chance to survive, besides that huge fall of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the girls huge mouth took a bite out of the bread and pulled the rest hanging from her lips in with her tongue. Nikki stared bewildered at the huge empty space where there had just been a room sized chunk of bread. Meanwhile Sally's mouth eagerly ate up the sandwich she'd bitten off and gulped it down into her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really! Just because I hated you being a slob in the store?\" Nikki yelled out at Sally. Of course the huge girl couldn't hear a thing the tiny one was saying, but she laughed anyway and yet again a pudgy finger shoved Nikki further back into the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrusterated Nikki sludged forward ready to leap from the bread and tell Sally off. Meanwhile instead she found herself staring out into the huge open cavern of Sally's mouth. Struggling back she screamed as loud as she could. The teeth high above her and below, the saliva hanging in long strands down to that plush pink tongue that lashed about eagerly for it's next gulp of prey, and even worse the uvula visible in the distance showing where Nikki would eventually be swallowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no time to think. It was either shove herself free from the bread and fall to the table below, or cover her head and hope for the best as she was taken into the giant hungry maw that was about to draw her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Nikki took and deep breath and...</span></div></div>",

She watched in horror as Sally eagerly gobbled up the sandwich. She thoroughly chewed it up and dispelled it to her ever-growing belly. Nikki cringed when she realized that it was almost her that was engulfed by the titaness sitting before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally let out a tiny burp when she finished with the sandwich. \"Well, you might've been a terrible person, but you were a great appetizer!\" Sally said to her stomach.

Great...\" she let her disappointment trail off and put a hand to her stomach, rubbing her belly a bit. The tiny sales assistant was horrifed. Not only did this monster want to eat her alive, she wanted to actually feel the girl squirming inside of her enormous tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly staying crouched behind the container Sally's mac and cheese was in, Nikki began to plan her escape. She'd have to dive over the edge of the serving tray and hide down under the rim until Sally's interest was focused once again on her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sally was licking some jelly off her fingers with her massive tongue high above, happily lapping away. That's when Nikki broke out into a full run and threw herself over the edge of the serving tray. Fortunately Sally was looking around the food court, perhaps she was even looking for more people to eat. The thought forced Nikki on, realizing that the tiny blonde girl with blue streaked hair could survive and just hope others would be snacked on by Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall was unexpectedly higher than Nikki would have assumed, probably not taking into account the thickness of the base of the tray. Of course after falling from the sandwich it didn't seem as painful, but it still sent the tiny assistant tumbling to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile above the ridge, Sally's fingers wrapped around the cup of mac and cheese and brought it up to chin level. She began shoveling the goopy cheesy food eagerly into her mouth with a small plastic spoon. Nikki couldn't help but look up in wonder and she was horrified to see the soft lips drawing in Sally's food, her tongue occasionally lapping out to slurp up some cheese hanging from her maw, and all the time her powerful mouth chewing. When Nikki saw Sally's throat gulp down a lump of her meal, that was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning Nikki looked towards the edge of the table. She could make it down to the chair and then to the floor she assumed, but then what? It didn't hurt to fall from the sandwich much and surely that had to be a similar height. There was no sense begging with Sally. All she wanted to do was experience eating the tiny associate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again there were crumbs all over the table. Perhaps there was something she could hide under and hope she could get the attention of the next girl who sat down at the table. One of her co-workers was just finishing up buying a meal in the distance and the food court was packed. With any luck she would wander over to the table. Sally was almost done her food and surely had more plans for her shrink remote. Maybe getting her co-workers attention was her best chance.</span></div></div>",

Hoping that her new found light weight at tiny size would save her, she landed pretty hard but still okay with a quiet thunk on the seat of the food court table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering herself up she wandered over to the edge of the seat and looked down. The floor seemed even farther away but at least the impact was so minimal she wasn't too concerned. Dropping down another couple feet, Nikki found herself down on the floor a little worse for wear but still mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and dusting herself off she looked around. Close by were Sally's feet, happily bouncing up and down on her toes on the insole of her sandals. Occasionally she'd put her big plush feet down and slap her bare soles against the floor loudly. She really was enjoying eating up there, Nikki thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be a bug at this customers feet again, Nikki went to dash away and then a frusterating thought grabbed her and she spun around. Sally had the size remote. Nikki could run all over the mall, but it wouldn't do her any good if she couldn't get back to her regular size to avoid being squashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCringing she looked at those scary massive feet. Just one mistake and she'd be smacked with that grimy sole of this nerdy plus sized girl. Nikki turned around again, someone else must be able to help her. Even her co-worker, she could grab Sally and get the remote off of her. That wouldn't be a challenge as long as she wasn't shrunk herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet how could she get anyones attention at this size. All she was going to do down here was get stepped on. Unless she could somehow get into Sally's sandal and safely ride with her. Eventually she'd make someone grow, if that was an option on that remote of hers. Hopefully then Nikki could get in the way and get back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose feet though. Sally was playing around with her sandals and slapping her feet on the floor so much, odds were Nikki would just get squished without noticed. However, Sally would probably just slip on her sandals and wander off the moment her meal was done so there really wasn't any better time for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked towards the giant girls wiggling toes of her feet that now rested on the ground and she sighed. At least if her feet were out of her sandals she had a chance. So Nikki make her decision.</span></div></div>",

The two had been talking for about an hour, rambling on about all the great new features of Ryans new purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, when Sally wandered around to stand beside Jack and look at the car, the two were quite surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it would be easy to get a ton more horsepower out of this thing,\" Sally mused as the two guys exchanged glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack crossed his arms. The two auto shop junkies never did like Sally. She always thought cars were so inefficient these days in class. Plainly they both felt she wasted a lot of class time with her ramblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring down at her, Jack responded with, \"We'll thats great Sally! I'm glad you realize that if your fat butt isnt parked in my car that it'll go a lot faster. Thanks! A ton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWheeling right around Sally met Jacks smart glare with a look that made even him back down.

I'd give you one, but it's too little too late for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out her remote, Sally clicked the button twice, quickly aiming it between the two guys. In a quick flash of light she stood towering over her inch tall auto mechanic classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stumbled back in surprise, landing on the gritty, hot ashphalt behind him. Sallys brown sandals sat before them, huge and imposing as her toes eagerly scrunched against the insole above. Red toenails digging into the soft surface that was above their view ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to us?\" Screamed Ryan, who took in the situation much quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Sally, the squeaks Ryan let out didn't sound like anything. She drunk in the power as her imagination flooded with what they must be seeing. Her soft feet, smooth ankles that gently blended with her calves, leading up into tan cut off khakis just below her knees. If the shadows didnt cover it up too much, they may be able to see her tummy poking over the edge of her pants under her white tee shirt hanging low over it. Finally her sparking eyes, peering down at them past her fat tummy with her red bangs hanging low over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think I weighed a lot before, I think you'll be in for quite a surprise now Jack,\" Sally beamed proudly as she decided their fate.</span></div></div>",

She didn't show it, but she was amazed they didn't try to make a run for it. Then one did, one of them, she couldn't tell which, made a dart for it. He didn't last long, all she had to do was slide her foot over a few inches and SLAM it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did, she could hear a faint 'CRUNCH,' just like stepping on a bug. She then twisted the ball of her foot around, mashing the tiny man into goo. As she did this, she completely forgot about the other man, who tried to make a run for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over and spotted him, then started for him. First, she slipped on her sandal, then, with one swift step, she brought here sandaled foot down atop him. He didn't crunch like the last one, and she could barely feel him as she twisted her foot back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the deed was done, she stood on one leg and looked under her swuishing foot. \"Ooh,' she said, as she saw the man was actually still moving, he had been compressed into the soft foam of her sandal. \"Are you lucky?...Nope.\" With that she plucked the little man from the sandal, and ripped him in half in the process, and simply put her hand into a fist, squashing the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed a sigh of relief, then pulled a napkin from her pocket and wiped her hands clean. \"Oh, almost forgot!\" She took her foot from her sandal and cleaned underneath it, getting all the squishy remains off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, it was fun whole it lasted, what now?\"</span></div></div>",

No one will ever make my life horrible again without having the favour returned!\" Sally sat examining her wonderful new creation pondering through her mind all the options this simple device will give her. \"Hmmm maybe a little test run wouldn't hurt just to get it warmed up\". First she started with a few simple things laying around her room like an old toy and sweater. Then she proceeded to peer out the window and spotted Jimmy the boy whom she had longed for for many years but wouldn't give her the time of day and instead would call her names and pull pranks on her in class.

Basically, the only thing Jimmy knew, was that he was walking down the street. Next thing he knew, Sally was sitting crosslegged in front of him on her bed and he stood only about an inch tall on her fluffy blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's custom remote had a matter transporter in it. Since tiny people didn't have much to move, this didn't take much power. So Sally had leaned out the window, blasted Jimmy, and all anyone would have seen was him vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she sat down on her bed, rubbing her pudgy hands together in anticipation as she pointed the remote to her blankets and pressed a button to reconstruct the tiny Jimmy before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the movement of Sallys large weight, Jimmy was unbalanced and fell over, staring up at her. He was in complete shock. The transition had been flawless. He was just walking down the street and now he was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jim, I always had a crush on you and all you did was make fun of me. Do you know how that made me feel?\" Sally pouted a little, barely visible over her tummy and breasts until Jimmy scooted back a bit, still laying on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Jimmy didn't really know what she was talking about.

Sally found this incredibly amusing. Where did he think he was going to go? Plunging off the side of her bed wouldnt do him much good. She tucked her knees up to her chest and extended to right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy looked back and saw the huge plush sole of Sallys big bare foot looming behind him, far beyond that her wicked grin and excitement in her eyes. Her huge sole was a vast wall of wrinkles, almost making a flat rolling surface all the way down to her heel. There was hardly an arch, nowhere for Jimmy to stand any chance at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure really of how much pressure was too much, Sally tipped her foot forward and poked at Jimmys leg with her big toe. The boulder sized toe was soft at first, but quickly the pressure shoved the tiny man into the sheets and the tension of the mattress pressed him back up into her soft skin making a quiet snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReeling around, Jimmy glared up at Sally beyond the wiggling toes hovering just over his midsection. He looked like he was talking but Sally didn't hear anything really. Her bright eyes lit up under her red bangs. She had her prey trapped now. He couldnt get away now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally wasn't interested in really playing games. She had all day to do that. So she began to rub her giant bare foot up and down on Jimmy, rubbing him into the cool wrinkled skin of her sole. She rested most of her weight on her heel, making sure she didnt squish him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootching forward, Sally gathered poor Jimmy up between her feet and stared down at him, resting between her soles. It looked like his left arm was caught between the outside arch of each foot and she wondered briefly if she had broken that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Jimmy, don't you wish you'd just been my friend? Now I'm going to have to make a yucky mess out of you all over my feet! My friends are downstairs and I'm up here wasting time with you.\" Sally mocked a sigh and began to wiggle her toes, forcing her soles to wrinkle and press Jimmy into deep soft folds of her foot. The pressure wasnt painful at all. Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally moved her feet back and forth, making a soft shuffling sound as her skin rubbed together. Jimmy was forced deeper into the soft yielding flesh that sourrounded him. Her feet were rather dry and dusty, having wandered around barefoot all morning. Sally finally just tilted her head to one side and made a little kiss, her pudgy cheeks softly blushing as she pressed inward, crushing Jimmy between her thick soles.</span></div></div>",

He sees Sally's eyes slowly scan up and down his body before locking onto his face, and his terrified expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, what's wrong, baby?\" she gently coos, lowering her head closer to him. He raises himself to his feet, wobbling like a piece of shoddy construction on a minute scale. Now closer to him, her voice, still uneasily gentle, is almost deafening. \"Are you scared? Ohh, baby there's no reason to be scared...\" Her hand begins moving towards him. By the time what's happening registers fully and his 'flight' response kicks in, her pudgy digits - normally stubby but now the size of sofas - are closing around him. Sally balls her fist completely around him. He struggles like a trapped wild animal, but in spite of the enormous girl's palms becoming increasingly sweaty by the second, Jimmy is unable to break free. He feels her hand moving, slowly but steadily, and soon his damp, soft prison opens to reveal that he is only inches from her incalculably massive face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no need at all to be scared, baby, honey, sweetie, my little manly man, my little sugar-coated gumdrop...\" Each word elevates a sense of bitter sarcasm in her voice to a higher level, and each word nearly blows Jimmy right out of Sally's hand.<br>\r\n\"I love you... and now that I have you here, I never want you to leave me... I'm going to ensure that we're together forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy can hear her breathing heavier. She's getting excited. If he was terrified before, he's on the verge of a heart attack now. He doesn't know what she's going to do, but he knows it can't be good.<br>\r\nAfter flashing him a big grin, Sally puckers up and begins moving her giant face towards Jimmy. Her plump, car-sized lips approaching quickly, Jimmy readies himself to jump off Sally's hand, but suddenly the slick, fleshy platform he's standing on tilts at a bit of an angle. Now he's looking almost directly up at the infeasibly large lips. He braces himself for impact as he is pressed between the palm of Sally's hand and the great cushions with a big, wet smack. She begins loudly kissing Jimmy's entire body, creating deafeningly loud squelching and sucking noises along with little moans of ecstasy as she gradually began working him with her tongue and drenching him in her thick, gooey saliva, which was now forming a small pool on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes of this extreme French-kissing, Sally began sucking on Jimmy's tiny form. Jimmy felt a sudden great pressure on his body, as he was slowly and noisily slurped through the tight gateway into the cavern. Inside, it was pitch-black and unbearably hot. The surfaces were all slick, and Jimmy could smell the burgers Sally had eaten the previous night. Everything was still. From the pit in the back of the throat, he heard some nightmarish gurgling - the grinding and churning of this organic machine - and as he began backing away from it, a strand of saliva dripped from the roof of Sally's mouth and fell into his face. Jimmy screamed his lungs out.<br>\r\nSally abruptly began sucking Jimmy's body and battering it around with her tongue like a piece of candy. She pressed him hard against the roof of her mouth, then pinned him under her tongue, briefly submerging his head in a pool of spit. Trying to get loose, he was lifted up and rammed into Sally's cheek for a few seconds before everything went still again for a few seconds. Jimmy became silent, having screamed himself raw over the past minute or two. Then he felt his whole world tilt again, and a powerful force pulling him towards the source of the gurgling noises. Realizing what was happening, he resumed screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally gulped loudly, and, feeling very satisfied, smiled at nobody in particular. She felt a tiny flutter in her tummy, and suppressed a belch, covering her mouth. She giggled - the boy who once made fun of her enormous, jiggling belly would now become part of one of its generously-sized rolls of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd never had so much fun in her life - her heart was beating out of her chest and she was getting moist in her lower regions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do now? Should she:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her custom remote was designed to shrink and transport the target into the remote, all in one smooth motion. Sure enough, the green orb on the remote indicating she had caught something was glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great! Now what am I going to do!\" Sally grumbled as she flopped down in her computer chair at her desk, next to her window. \"These people have lives, and I've got no way to make them big again yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Sally looked closer into the green glowing orb. The glow was caused by the tiny little particles that made up the car and it's passengers. She couldn't do anything for them now. It was either keep them as pets until she could make a remote to reverse it, and hope they wouldn't get her in trouble, or just to take care of this. For Sally, it wasn't a choice. The problem had to be eliminated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing the remote at her floor, the car popped into a miniature form at the press of a button. With a soft laugh Sally smiled at her fortune. Three of the preppy cheerleaders from school already had their faces plastered to the windows, staring out of the car that was only about three inches at most. Sure it was tiny, but Sally could reconize that gray sports car anywhere.</span></div></div>",

One moment, they were driving down the road, on the way to school, and the next they\u2019re on the floor in some giant bedroom, a bedroom that seemed to go on forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardwood floor itself appeared to stretch for miles in all directions.  Off in the distance, a bed larger than any of them could even fathom, sat, with a light blue blanket balled up near the foot.  Directly in front of them, a computer desk rose higher than any skyscraper and in a chair that totally engulfed them in its shadow, sat a fat teenage girl who looked awfully familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?!\u201d one of the girls yelled, as she desperately tried to open her door.  Suddenly a firm hand clamped down on her wrist.  It was Rebekkah, head of the cheerleading squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it, Michelle,\u201d Rebekkah said, trying to calm down her friend.  \u201cWe need to all stay in the car.  I have no idea what just happened to us, but we can\u2019t start freaking out.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Michelle said in a small voice, as she tried to hold in her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, guys?\u201d Stacy, the driver of the car, said.  \u201cI think we\u2019ve been shrunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on, Stacy,\u201d Rebekkah replied.  \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.  No one can--\u201c  Suddenly, she realized what was going on and what those two large, fleshy things were on either side of them.  It was someone\u2019s ankles which were thicker than redwoods and stretched for at least 500 feet from their vantage point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026my\u2026God,\u201d Rebekkah exclaimed, before a huge hand descended from far above and two chubby fingers plucked them off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three teens screamed as the car was lifted, travelling incredibly fast, before stopping inches in front of an enormous\u2014and incredibly pissed off\u2014face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, girls,\u201d a mighty voice boomed, forcing the three terrified cheerleaders to cover their ears.  \u201cFor years, you\u2019ve taken pleasure in tormenting me and my friends with your cruel jokes and endless waves of vicious gossip.  Well, now it\u2019s time for a little payback.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the car was enveloped by the fleshy walls of Sally\u2019s palm, shrouding the shrunken girls in complete darkness.  They screamed again, not knowing what was going to happen to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Sally pondered her next move\u2026</span></div></div>",

Don't you little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the shrunken person backed away slowly toward the far wall of the container. They didn't speak, none of them usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to step on one,\" came a voice from behind Sally and Kelly. Both turned around and the tiny people in the container looked up in surprise to see the asian girl had stepped forward behind the two cruel ones who were plotting their doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Marie finally steps up to the plate!\" Kelly laughed, \"Why not squish the one Sally doesn't want me to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally sighed, \"Because he's your only ex boyfriend that I've ever known about Kelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant blonde laughed and looked over, \"Jeff? You caught Jeff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh,\" Sally said monotone, \"he's shrunk, not invisible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we going to do then?\" Marie calmly asked, her voice quiet though.</span></div></div>",

She twisted her foot a little, definitely breaking ribs with audible cracks. He screamed in pain from this torture. Then, the pressure built rapidly, and some of the worst pain imaginable came to his brain as his body frame cracked under the pressure and gave way with a soft pop, causing blood to oooze out of him everywhere as he became more and more shapeless, until finally there was barely no more than a bloody stain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie panted a bit, having gotten a little too excited about that. \"That felt.....amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun, wasn't it?\" said Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want more.\" Marie said almost robotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get you more tomorrow.\" Sally said. \"Or if you prefer, I can let you borrow a remote...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He always ignored her when ever she tried to talk to her and whenever he did say anything to her it was always a \"whatever\" or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Cathrine has finally come around\", said Sally. Kelly bent down to picked up Jeff between two of her plump fingers and brought him up to her face. As she picked Jeff up, she said, \"hi sweetie\" while trying not to giggle. Kelly put Jeff close to her ear so she could better hear what Jeff was saying. \"What the hell is going on Kelly\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly then brought Jeff right up to her gargantuan lips and slowly said, \"You\u2019re finally going to give me some kind of pleasure\". She pulled the bottom of her shirt up and held Jeff right against her big belly. Jeff could not believe how soft it was, it even calmed him down a little. Suddenly Kelly's voice changed to sounding very sensual, \"see this big body you used to love so much, well now you get to be inside it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff's face turned white with fear as Kelly brought Jeff right up to her lips again. \"I'm going to take my time eating you my tasty little morsel\". And with that, Jeff was suddenly in Sally's mouth being licked and sucked for what must have been five minuets. There was a pause and Sally finally swallowed Jeff whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathrine looked at Kelly and asked, \"Was it really that good\"? Kelly nodded in reply. \"You know what?

Might as well say it...</i> \"Well, I...kind of wanted to...sit on them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone burst out laughing, and Sally sank into her seat. Great, now she sounded like a complete pervert! \"H-hey, our stomachs aren't the only parts we get teased about!\" She defended. \"Cat's got the biggest ass of all of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the laughing died down right then. \"Got me there,\" Cathrine admitted. \"And don't worry Sal, we like the idea. Putting our butts to use on some jackasses sounds fun. I bet it'll tickle when they struggle under there, if they survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should wear bikinis or panties if we do it!\" Kelly added. \"Sit down slowly too, give them a REALLY good look at what's gonna squish them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd prefer to keep them alive, but that does sound like fun...\" Marie put in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the girls do?</span></div></div>",

In the kitchen, Kelly could be heard filling a glass with water and brought it to Cathrine. She grabed the tiny guy and droped him in the glass and said to Cathrine, \"Try now\". Cathrine brought the glass up to her eyes to see the tiny speck of a man trying to keep afloat in the water. Cathrine was determined to show her friends that she could do this. So she began to drink from the glass. \"Oh no not again!\", thought the tiny man. He tried to swim away to the huge gaping mouth that the glass was leaning toward.

After he had cheated death he was just going to end up in the belly of someone else! \u201cCathrine looked at Sally and said, \"He really does. You might want to wash him off\". Sally picked up the guy Cathrine was holding and looked at Kelly and Marie and said, \"do what you want with the rest of the guys I shrunk, I can always get more\". Kelly and Marie almost jumped as they raced to the tupperware container to have the time of their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sally made her way into the kitchen and towards the sink. She turned on the water and quickly washed the tiny off. Sally turned off the water looked down at her next meal and started to get excited. She took off her glasses and was really a lot more beautiful without them. She started talking to the shrunken guy, \"I bet you thought you got lucky. I wasn\u2019t going to let you go anyway, not after what you said\". The little guy said nothing back, he knew there was not convincing this woman. Sally lifted the bottom of her shirt and brought her snack right up against her big soft belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny how you get to be a part of what you mock. I've been studying the digestive system and I know that chewing you will not be nearly a good enough punishment for you. No, I'm going to suck and wet you up nice and good in my enormous mouth and swallow you whole. In my stomach you will be slowly eaten away by my stomach juices until there's nothing left. Oh yes, my insides are such a perfect torture system for someone like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said Sally put the little man in her mouth and did just what she said, she rubbed her tongue all over him which was a huge change for the little guy from Cathrine's mouth. Sally was more aggressive, she was enjoying this far more than Cathrine did. After a moment, Sally tilted her head back and slowly swallowed her meal. In a second she could feel him struggling in her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a fluttering sensation just below her ribs and it made her feel so good she had to sit down to really take in the sensation. After a while, the feeling stopped and Sally patted her stomach and said, \"Hope everyone else tastes as good as you\". Sally then made her way back to the other girls only to find out they had already eaten and stepped on all the other victims she had shrunk. \"Hey. You couldn\u2019t pace yourselves\"!

Excited, she looked up her name, only to see that she had scored a B!  How could that have happened!

The others didn't stand much of a chance at getting away. The bratty one was easy to catch, she seemed more content to tell Cat off than run. Her goth friend put up the most fight, batting at Cathrines smooth dark fingers as they slowly wrapped around her black trenchcoat. Finally, the red head and hispanic girl were plucked up between her huge fingers and dropped in her giant purse she had opted to bring intstead of her backpack. The pink flap closed over the three screaming girls and Cathrine grined broadly.</span></div></div>",

She sat on her bed and kicked off her shoes, undoing he pony tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a shower.\" She said to herself, dropping all her clothes on the ground. She walked down the hallway and into the bathroom in her nude form, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she turned on the hot water and got into the shower, Rodrick walked into the front door. Rodrick was the next door neighbor who's been neighbors with Catherine ever since they were six. They were good friends and spent some spare time with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catherine,\" Said Rodrick, \"I saw that you were home and I thought I'd stop by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was in the shower and couldn't hear him. He walked upstairs into her room, and saw Catherines shirt, skirt, and undies on the ground with a strange remote that also looked like a gun a couple feet away from them. He picked it up and examined it. It didn't look like a gun that had bullets in it, now did it look like it had any kind of other deadly feature. It looked more like a ray gun that you would see in a space video game, but he was not at all sure. He didn't that Catherine would be one to be fooling around with a lethal weapon, so he decided to see what it does. He pushed the only button on the device, releasing a light that bounced off the dry wall and hit him. He felt like he was falling down, although it didn't feel like anything pushed him or her tripped on anything. He closed his eyes waiting to impact the ground. But he had is eyes closed for a clean ten seconds, and he didn't hit the ground, in fact it felt like he was standing. He awkwardly opened his eyes and saw he wasn't falling but he had shrunk down to an inch. He was standing on the carpet next Catherine's underwear. Her underwear was the size of his house! Meanwhile Catherine was getting out of the shower, drying herself off. Rodrick took a step inside the underwear and felt the warm, soft, white cotton. He lied down, pressing the soft cotton on his face. Catherine walked back in the room wearing some clean underwear and a tank top. Rodrick then heard her footsteps and came out from her undies. Catherine was quick to spot him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here playing with my stuff, Rodrick?\" Asked Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I thought I'd just stop by to say hi.\" Said Rodrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really?\" Said Catherine, \"Were you aware that I was taking a shower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" Said Rodrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know that I cant send you back to normal,\" Said Catherine, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! What am I going to do!\" Yelled Rodrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know,\" Said Catherine. Rodrick looked up at the giant Catherine. She could do anything she want with him at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this will make you feel better,\" Said Catherine picking up Rodrick and placing him between her boobs. She pressed them together and Rodrick loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later Catherine was sleeping in bed on her belly. Rodrick was sleeping in her butt.

The little tiny guy was growing tired of squirming, as his power was only so much compared to the goddess butt his was in. Cath could feel him progressively tire down, until he came to a complete rest. She took a deep breath of satisfaction as the squirming ended, but still felt some pleasure with the tiny guy lodged in her backdoor. On the inside, the tiny took deep breaths as air was pretty tight, albeit with an odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other tinies, seven in total, sat on the bed bunched together. They had no other options, as it was hard to walk on the blanket, and jumping off the bed was out of the question. Cath turned and walked towards the bed, rounding them all up in her hand. They attempted to shout up to her, but she just closed her hand into a loose fist. She looked around her room to find something to put them in, and found a small plastic container on her desk that originally was holding removable pencil erasers. She dropped them in, closed the lid, and placed it on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cath walked around her room, the little guy in her butt was being treated to an oddly soothing and comfortable full body massage as he hips swayed back and forth and her butt jumped up and down slightly. Heck, he started to moan a little bit himself, breathing in some more of Cath's \"natural\" air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath didn't want to keep him in there too long, even though she did enjoy her little butt plug. She walked over to the foot of her bed and bent over slightly, putting her palms on the bed. She felt a slight pressure in her lower belly, and decided to use it to help her little guy out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little guy noticed the movements come to a halt, and then... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pfft*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little guy was surrounded by gas and felt himself be slightly pushed out of the cavernous (well, to him) butt hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Perffttt*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the little guy was out like a cannon he was airborne for a second till he safely flew into Cath's cotton panties. The landing felt like he was falling into a sea of pillows. Above, Catherine smiled and giggled to herself, letting out one last toot with that. It smelled rancid in Cath's panties to the little guy, making him wonder what she ate. Then he remembered Cath swallowing that Gloria girl whole not too long ago. He wondered if she was still in Cath's belly, or if she was on her way out, or what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath plucked him out and without saying a word brought him over to the rest of the tinies. She opened the container, and dropped him in with the other 7. She put the container in her night stand drawer, snapped on a flash light and put it in the drawer so they could see (how nice of her), and closed it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath yawned and figured a nap didn't sound too bad. She fell on her bed, and slowly drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside of the drawer, all the tinies were conversating. They didn't want to stay shrunk forever, but they also didn't want to be succumb to becoming Cath's snack either. So, what do they do?</span></div></div>",

It wasn't so much she was feeling remorse for the girls. That is, she pitied them, certainly but...they had to have had it coming, all those means things they said to her. Yes, they deserved to suffer, and perish in such an ironic way. Yet, for some reason, she couldn't detach herself. Make herself feel as if she had just smushed a couple bugs, nothing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't shake this awful feeling, that she had just crushed out of four helpless human beings. And the way she just stomped them--! Bringing her heel down with such force that they couldn't possibly hope to---!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's blood ran cold and she started breathing heavily. Was this what it felt like to have a nervous breakdown? It was becoming clear that no matter how perfect the crime, Cat's own guilty conscience was going to haunt her. \"I can't stand this.\" Cat told herself. \"I have to go back to Sally and tell the truth.\" Cat shivered at the thought of what might happen if Sally got angry. After looking down both sides of the hall, Cat ducked out the door and raced for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK! Without looking, she ran straight into Billy, a handsome(if somewhat nerdy) boy from her science class. Billy hit the pavement and dropped all of his books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Billy, I'm...I'm so sorry! Let me help you with those books...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBilly glanced up with anxious eyes and pulled  away from her helping hand. \"No no, it's okay. I'm fine, really.\" He seems awfully nervous and in a hurry. Cat stood back up and eyed him suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Billy...where are you off to in such a hurry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh??! Oh, I'm going to class. I'm, uh, running late. See ya.\" He picked up his books and backed away from her nervously. Arching her eyebrow, Cat took a hefty step forward, her flip flop landing in front of Billy with a loud smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Billy,\" she gravely warned, \"I need you to not move. Did you see anything strange, or...unusual just now??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go, seriously!\" he blurted. \"Sorry! Gotta run!\" He turned and ran away from her. Gripped by paranoia, Cat stuffed her hand into her back pocket to feel the controller and took off after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Billy, please don't do this!\" she pleaded, \"Tell me the truth! Stop running!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go!\" he shouts. \"Let me go!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!\" Cat pulled out the controller with a wail and fired it at Billy. The familiar hum rang through the hallway, and then a bolt truck Billy in the back as he ran away, \"GAAAaaaAAAaaahhh...\" and his screams grew smaller he disappeared from sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat was still running at full-speed and skid to a stop when she realized she might have passed over Billy. She looked all around her feet, searching for a moving speck, until she leaned over and peered between her legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly was there, running in circles trying to figure out what happened. Just then he stopped in his tracks and peers up...he saw Cat towering over him with her huge legs surrounding him, and after a few seconds his eyes got so wide even Cat could see them from way up. He makes a break for it, but Catherine is already experienced in this and easily cuts him of by turning her heel. Billy, now completely freaked out, started running back and forth trying to get out from under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat looked up toward the end of the hall--no one here. She lifted one leg and positioned it over Billy...she brought it down--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe missed! Billy suddenly sprinted and barely avoided her flip-flop! Angry, Cat began stomping like crazy, trying to get at him, but she had trouble seeing over herself. Finally, she spotted out of the corner of her eye tiny Billy, scurrying across the floor trying to get under a door! Thinking fat, Cat took a giant step, planted her heel and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--her sole plummeted toward the ground, right down on pitiful Billy, as her foot flattened. She felt his tiny form get crushed completely under the weight of her flip-flop with a wet,  squishy smack, like the sound a grape makes. Catching her breath, she realized all at once that some girls had been talking about Billy earlier...that he had a CRUSH on Cat! That would explain why he looked so nervous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! It can't be!, she told herself. He must have seen something, he told her to let him go! She stuffed the controller back in her pcoket and turned up her sole to see--the gooey remnants of what used to by Billy glistening beneath her foot. Now Cat felt even worse. She might have just smushed an innocent boy who knew nothing about the shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat wiped her sandal on the floor and doubled-over with stomach pain. She wrapped her arms around herself. This was all too much...she had to get to Sally fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They mumbled quietly to each other before Kelly unleashed at one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was instant. Her remote buzzed and flung a burst of light at one of the guys and he vanished. Quickly as that burst had come, Kelly had already turned the remote on another one and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long all five of them were miniaturized somewhere on the barns dirt floor. Kelly looked through the misty beams of sunlight coming through the cracked and split wooden walls, trying to see where they were. Wandering into the barn, she slid off her sandals, just incase she needed to move faster than her flip flops would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the nearest guy, it was horrifing. Dust puffed out from each step of Kelly's thick feet as she padded toward him. Small strands of hay crunched underfoot as she walked on. She was staring right down at him. Not knowing what to do, he turned to run toward a pile of hay nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly broke into a sprint, her tummy bouncing as she ran.

I thought you wanted to play in my barn! We're going to have lots of fun.

Unfortunatly this just upset Kelly and she stomped him imediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe your friends will be more understanding,\" She mused as she turned to look around the barn. They seemed to have all scattered, frightened by this giant girl stepping on their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly grinned, \"Silly little people. If you come out, I may be more forgiving.

Kelly's foot raised over him and slowly began to lower down. She wiggled it teasingly, and he couldn't help but stare. Even though it would be the instrument of his death, in an ironic twist, he admired it's perfection. Perfection that slowly pinned him to the ground. He didn't squirm of scream, he just laid there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accepting your fate....mmmm...I like that. I wish everyone else was as accepting as you.\" The pressure of her now slightly dusty foot began to build. The tiny guy sort of rubbed against the softness, trying to enjoy every last bit of her perfect foot just before the end. Organs burst open inside his body and bones snapped as blood emerged from several orifices in his body. Even at the end, he had enough strength to kiss the bottom of her foot, hoping his death gave her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end came with a combination of a THUMP and a SPLAT!

Her belly had made its decision and they were going to satiate its needs. But which one first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Shrinkee POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ice cold shiver ran down William and Simon as they heard her belly rumble from high above. They didnt miss her thick tongue dart out to wet her lips either. How much food must have passed through that big mouth already? But they weren't food! they were human! Albeit now on a smaller scale but surely she wouldn't! She rubbed her exposed, soft belly looking down at the pair hungrily. Her toes tapping, reminding them of a different end they might have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Kelly POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly decides to get down closer to her prey, seeing as they weren't going to go anywhere quickly. She lies down infront of them on her side, her head propped up my one hand, belly facing its food, they were what? Two inches tall? The one on the left who had first spoke out, she recognised as William. He was the older brother of a friend of hers at school! He was cute and well built and they had always got on well, too bad that he had just been reduced to food status. The other boy she didn\u2019t recognise, he was wide eyed and looked very scared. Bless. She licked her lips sensually, mmmmmmmm they were going to taste good. There was no point rushing, no one was going to be home for hours and the look on the boys faces was priceless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Shrinkee POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill frozen solid they watched as Kelly came down towards them, as she rested on her side her belly bubbled outwards over the barn floor. They could see her face better now, Kelly was a pretty girl, on the chubby side. But with big soft lips and a pleasant freckled, pale complexion. All the same however the boys didn\u2019t fancy their lives ending as a mere snack to this hungry girl, as they new it would. With her eyes fixed on them, her other hand continued to stroke and swirl her stomach making the silence all the more ominous. Suddenly Simon made a run for it. William still paralyzed with fear collapsed and did not move. \u201cOh no you don\u2019t\u201d Kelly said.<br>\r\n(Kelly Pov)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one the guys making a break for it, Kelly finally decided to make her move, she casually outstretched her free hand and plucked the shrinkee mid run, he hadn\u2019t got far. \u201cmmmm hello pudding,\u201d Kelly purred, bringing the shrinkee to her face. \u201c I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met before, my names Kelly and I\u2019m a maneater\u201d and with that she outstretched her big tongue and dropped him in on it. Slowly he made his way into her mouth desperately clawing to get out, screaming and shouting. He almost made it getting halfway out her thick rubbery lips\u2026 only to slowly be sucked straight back in. Kelly licked the boy all over, wanting to savour his taste, the other shrinkee William had proceeded to hit her stomach, she smiled at this, I\u2019ll deal with him later. Finally it was time for her little snack to meet its final resting place, in her belly. She swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Simon POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon couldn\u2019t take much more of this and ran, he wasn\u2019t going to be eaten by this girl! He heard her say something behind him, but the door was there in front of him! If he could just\u2026 and suddenly he was no longer on the ground and then he was infront of this big girls face. \u201cPlease don\u2019t eat me!\u201d he shouted, but she ignored him. She said something to him, but he wasn\u2019t listening and suddenly her big mouth yawned open and he landed on her tongue. He was on a girls tongue! It was squishy underfoot and wet, he tried to get off it, running desperately to get off as he descended into her mouth. The light closing off and he was out! But he wasn\u2019t. Trapped between these soft lips. He was going to die! Just a snack for this hungry girl and with that he gave up. Letting his body go limp he was sucked back in. Swished around this girls mouth, he was tasted all over, clearly she was enjoying him. But finally he slid to the back and down her gullet he went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Kelly POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmmmmm, he was yummy!\u201d Kelly exclaimed, patting her big round stomach \u201cyummy in my tummy! And now its your turn little one, do you like my big round belly? There\u2019s got to be nothing better than being inside a girls stomach\u201d She rubbed it for emphasis as William had now backed away. \u201cWhats the matter little one? Are you scared? Soon you\u2019ll be in her with your friend and the only way out is as a blob of mush\u201d she giggled and rolled on to her back, rubbing her tummy sensually. Dreaming of all the fun she had had, and was going to have with this shrink way. \u201cWell William, I think its time you slipped down my throat too\u2026\u201d she rolled over \u201cWilliam?!\u201d He was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(William POV) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter beating on the walls of this giant\u2019s stomach he had given up, it was so soft! Like a big warm, inflatable pillow. Exhausted he collapsed away from it. The black hole of the belly button staring back at him, as big as his head and when he had been next to her stomach it rose out and over-hung him, just daring for this giantess to flatten him under it. He backed away as she taunted him, his friend was in there! In her belly like food. She rolled over, and with her eyes no longer on him, he legged it. Hiding wasn\u2019t too hard for a shrinkee of his size, he simply ran a fair leg and dived under the thin layer of straw. He could see her stand up now, looking around angrily. Big feet padding here and there, belly wobbling with each step He shuddered at the thought of his life ending inside this monster. But she was just a girl! And she saw him as a snack! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Kelly POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrat he\u2019d escaped, \u201cWhen I find you William I\u2019m going to eat you!\u201d Suddenly out of the corner of her eye, she saw him. He was just a few feet infront of her two her left, on the floor under some straw. Oh William\u2026. But she decided to play his game. \u201cFee-Fi Fo Fum!\u201d Kelly stomped around the barn clawing at the straw with her big, bare, dirty feet. After 5 minutes or so she put her foot down on him, trapping him underneath, and smiling like a Cheshire cat, Kelly had caught her prey. grabbing William from her foot she held him to her belly. \u201cDo you hear your friend in there? Mmm you guys are so tasty, but very small, I\u2019m probably going to go eat a big meal after slurping you down, maybe shrink another little man snack. How does it feel to know your life ends in my belly?\u201d She giggled, and with that she raised him to her mouth, and sucked him in feet first. He went straight to the back of her mouth and down to her belly. Kelly burped and sighed happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(William POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching carefully, he was waiting for her to move out of the way of the door so he could make a break for it. But all to suddenly he was sandwiched against the barn floor. He was under her foot! He couldn\u2019t move under the thick, heavy sole and before he knew it he was against her belly. He didn\u2019t want to die! Not in there! He felt his legs being sucked into her mouth through her lips. Those big soft lips. \u201cnoooooo!\u201d William screamed as he became nothing more than a snack for a hungry girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry!\u201d Kelly exclaimed, and walked out the barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Squeezing, she compressed it slowly. He writhed in pain until the bone was basically shattered and it was reduced to a long, bloody mess protruding from his shoulder joint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAH! OH GOD! LET ME GO! AAAAAAH!\" He was in more pain than imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe.....don't like my foot?\" she teased, as she dropped her heel down on his legs. It wasn't enough to just crush them, she had to twist them into an even worse mess than his right arm. There were sickening, audible breaking and squishing sounds the whole time. And Kelly loved it. He was screaming his lungs out, but starting to lose conciousness. Finally, Kelly put him out of his misery (pun intended). She trapped his head between her toes, and then squeezed them shut. Darkness took him as his skull and brain were reduced to a bloody mess. She stamped down on his remains once for good measure.</span></div></div>",

He could see a bit of an outline of a foot......A foot that was approaching quickly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he cared not. He lied down in the area where the sole was going to descend. This was his death, and it was going to be incredible. The foot slid in and covered his body with incredible weight. He stroked the soft flesh and kissed it once for good measure, as she began to walk. The first step was extremely nausiating. His whole world shifted rapidly, as the weight lifted off his shoulders, and suddenly it all came back down seemingly twice as heavy with a loud THUMP! His ribs snapped under the pressure immeadiately and his main skeletal structure seemed to groan under the weight. And that was just the first step. It was the same process, continuing on and on. To the end, he rubbed against and carressed the sole, even as he began to black out and his body began to be mishaped. It was all over as soon as a loud CRUNCH signaled his body's collapse, and Kelly's beautiful, plush foot met the sandal.</span></div></div>",

Too much......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTighter and tighter the wrinkled soles began to press. But it wasn't enough. Soon she began to move both feet in a back and forth rubbing motion, still pressing them. It was the most wonderful feeling for a tiny guy like him. She wiggled her foot a few more times, causing things to tense up and hurt occasionally in there, but it was all worth it. He couldn't have escaped anyway....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself rubbing himself up back against the flesh soon enough. It got darker and more moist in between them....They got tighter and shut out all light as the sole molded around his body. He was going to lose it any minute now.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure was too great, as bones snapped quickly. He fought through the pain to stay awake to the last moment, as he went for broke, rubbing against the soles and even making thrusting motions, until......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT!

Did you look at my feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked over to the girl sitting next to him from just staring out the window, \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly grinned broader, pushing up her freckled cheeks. \"I think you did. Wanna see?\" She plopped her right ankle on her plush left thigh and slid off her white rubble sandal. Kelly spread her toes and wiggled them a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn watched, and then looked up at Kelly. \"Why would I look at your smelly feet? Or any overweight part of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno John. Maybe it's a dream of yours. Maybe you just make fun of me cause you really do think Im big. Giant even! Think you could get away if I wanted to squish you under my feet?\" Kelly asked as she rubbed her thumb around on her plush sole and then looked back up at her rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts?\" John went back to looking out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly put her foot back down and grabbed the transparent red straps of her sandal with her toes to pull it back on. She dug around in her pocket for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to shut you up once and for all you bothersome bug,\" Kelly grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn turned to look back, but before he could finish saying, \"What was that?\" A flash of light blinded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, he was staring up at Kelly from the seat. She looked down laughing and in her right hand she had what looked like a black tv remote. He wasnt any more than an inch tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus lurched and he fell on his face.

She checked to make sure no one was especially paying attention, then she shot one of the boys with the remote, shrinking them down to 1 inch tall. Before the other surfers could react, she had shrunken all of them, and they were in danger of getting squashed by, from their perspective, a Godzilla sized chubby girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Kelly's foot slammed down on the nearest of the boys. He screamed as he was basically pressed almost flat, but not all the way. Kelly twisted her foot and intentionally tried to press and squeeze him dry, causing obscene amounts of blood to spurt out from under her foot. \"Mmmm, nice and squishy, just the way I like it!\" She finished bleeding him dry and stomped on his body for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the boys ran off, but Kelly had other plans. She picked up the Frisbee and tossed it directly in front of them, bringing a sudden halt to their running. A few more stomps later and another of the boys met his end, getting torn in half by one of her steps, which landed so hard that it literally squished his legs off his body. He crawled futily as the only thing on his mind was survival, but he was soon put to rest as she placed her big toe on his head and crushed it, as if she were an animal killing her prey brutally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked down at the terrified boys.

She took her bag off, then she unbuttoned her shirt and she stuffed the shirt into her bag.  She looked curiously on the three tinies.  She smiled which gave them the chills.  She grabbed two tinies and threw them into her bag.  She closed the bag, then stood up at her full height.  The last tiny saw a enormous fat girl in a swim suit.  Her pinky toe was 2 times his size, he knew that if he ran, death would be assured.  She picked the little man up and went to the storage area where she can put her bag in.  As she walked the little guy's head was sticking from her fist.  As she walked she spotted a group of girls who caught sight of the tiny but were not sure if that was a person.  One girl went up to Kelly and said \"Hi, my name is Kayla, nice to meet you.  Wow you got a cute pet in your hand, what is it, the suspense is killing me, I really need to know.\" Kelly put her hands behind her back, pulled the back of her panties open and dropped the little guy in.  He flew headfirst into the crack of her buttocks.  Without saying a word, Kelly quickly ran from the group of girls.  This made the tiny man in her panties move to the front of her panties.  She started to slow down and breathe heavily.  She started giggling because the tiny was touching her g-spot.  After a minute, the tiny climbed into her vagina which made Kelly go hysterical, the tiny stuck his head out, took a long deep breath and then crawled back up into her vagina.  Apparently he enjoyed being in contact with her special body part.  Kelly then kept on laughing and wiggling in a weird way the she landed on the floor which sealed the way out for the tiny.  After the tiny ran out of breath, he tried to come out and breath but couldn't, this made him kick and move more violently then ever.  Kelly burst laughing then found out that he was suffocating.  She stood up, which made him fall on her panties.  The tiny started gasping for breath.  \"Hold your breath little one, I must go into the water and remove you from my panties, I can't do it in public\", Kelly said laughing.  The tiny man had no other choice but to listen.  He took a very big and deep breath.  Kelly then jumped into the water, opened her panties, and took the tiny out.  She stuck her hand in the air giving the tiny man air to breath.  Kelly had enough fun for one day and was ready to go back home, she didn't want to put him in her panties or else he might get crushed.  So she placed him in her mouth, closed her mouth, and walked to the storage area to get her bags. As she was walking she bumped into an old lady and tried to say I am sorry, but when she did, she swallowed the tiny man.  She heard his last screams before he became a part of her meal.  Kelly stood their paralyzed, then she looked at her bulging stomach, then she smiled.  She quickly ran to the storage room, took her stuff, and went to the bus stop to wait for the next bus.</span></div></div>",

It was the stupidest thing she had ever seen. The labels and such on it seemed to imply it could make things smaller. Which of course, just isn't physically possible! Well, of course that's what Shannon thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomping off the bus, her tough grey boots, almost like work boots, clomping on the sidewalk, Shannon walked to her home. Tired out from walking down near the beach, because she had nothing else really to do, the goth was miserable. Her boots of course were way too hot, but she really didn't care. Of course, her entire black attire didn't help the heat situation much either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering into her place, the door was already open and she grimaced at the grimey entrance way. Her room mates that she had lived with for years now were always so lazy. Unfortunatly, so was Shannon, she just never let that point be made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis! Tanya! I'm home! Is the freakin cable fixed yet?\" Shannon bellowed, closing the front door. Enjoying how it made the entrace hall dark and shadowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl with blonde hair, streaked pink, ducked her head around the corner. \"Whatcha yellin for dark stuff? Had fun at the beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon grumbled, \"The guy didn't show up. I sat out on the stupid park bench for almost two hours in the sun, waiting for a stupid nerd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling off her boots, the angry goth wandered from the wood floor in the hallway onto the soft carpet that felt good against her damp bare feet. Flopping out on the couch, next to the recliner her friend sat in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost glaring, Shannon looked up her friend. Alexis was the girl who had poked her head around the corner. The blonde girl with pink streaks in her hair was actually quite regular really. An average, sorta thin sorta not build that Shannon held great envy for. Alexis liked to show it off too. Wearing only a light white tank top, and a pair of faded blue shorts. Her skin was so pale though, Shannon couldn't help but wonder which of them went outside more. She still had on her necklace too, a trinket her boyfriend had given her. Which only made Shannon feel worse to remember her friends new love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't let it get you down Shan Shan, the guy's probably held up in a basement somewhere, asleep after playing those role playing dice games with his friends all night. You know how they are. He's probably crazy into you because the goth thing drives him wild,\" Alexis offered finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuddling down onto the couch, Shannon pouted and looked over at the tv silently. After a few moments she finally asked, \"So where's Tanya.\" Then the goth quested her plush hand out to grab a bowl of chips from the table that she started snacking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh upstairs or around. Hey I have an idea!\" Alexis said excitedly, sitting up from laying with her legs over the edge of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon was almost afraid to ask, \"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you invite your friends over tonight? Well you know, whats his name and his friends. The role players! They could come by, have a game here, we all have some snacks, and he gets both things that he loves!\" The crazy looking blonde was actually completly wrapped up in this idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes Shannon rolled over and grabbed the phone, \"Fine! But I'm telling you, I think the guy just doesn't like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and Shan, you may want to stop wearing those boots in the summer. Whew,\" Alexis laughed lightly and smiled at her friend almost aplogetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall brunette haired girl stumbled over to the archway leading into the dining room. Wearing a blue rock band tee shirt, covered by a grey overshirt, and her usual, rolled up light gray khaki's. \"What's going on?\" Tanya yawned, stumbling slightly as she stepped on some cereal left on the floor. She seemed like she just woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're having a role playing game night for some of Shannon's friends,\" Alexis explained. After Tanya didn't respond much besides staring on with eyes half opened she added, \"With lots of snacks, maybe we'll get a pizza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey thats cool. Has anyone seen my lil digital pet thingy? I love torturing that little thing. I'm sure there has to be a way to make them die off eventually,\" Tanya mumbled as she flipped a seat cushion on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon held up her hand as someone answered her phonecall, \"Hi! Jeff? What? You slept in? Yeah, but I wasn't there too long I guess. Hey, we were talking. If you and the guys don't have a place to role play tonight, you can stop by over here. Really? You want to? Sweet! See you this afternoon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up the goth fell back laughing. \"See? Don't we look after our own here Tanya?\" Alexis chirped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's great. Cool my sandwich!\" Tanya laughed as she was digging through the couch. Shannon being the biggest girl as far as weight went in the house, no one would ever know it by how much these two skinny girls ate.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tanya called a bit early and ordered up a few pizzas for her and Alexis to go pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when they were just leaving, Jeff and a bunch of his nerdy friends showed up. Shannon wasn't too impressed to see the rest of them, but she eagerly hugged Jeff a hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey shorty, where are we setting up?\" Jeff asked as he took off his backpack full of gaming rule books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon glared at his comment but she casually said, \"The table in the kitchen is pretty big, probably the best place. How many people did you bring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven, well eight including me. I kinda figured you had the room and all. Comon guys, oh and girl,\" Jeff said as he walked on toward the back of the town house. Shannon peered back curious to see that one of the guys had brought their wife along too. Everyone, including Shannon was only around their early twenties, but some of her friends did marry early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone set up and Shannon stood off in the wood trimmed doorway leading back through the dining room and into the living room. Most of Jeff's friends were heavy set guys, which made her feel a little better about herself. But Jeff himself was rather scrawny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, who was I with last adventure?\" Began Jeff who was leading the game it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob and I had just gotten out of the castle with that thing the mage guy from town wanted us to steal when he caught us stealing from his shop,\" One guy explained. One of the heavy set ones, with thin blonde hair and stubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, also a heavy set member of the group joined in, \"Wasn't I finally back with the caravan? Shouldn't we wrap that up first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" the voice broke all the comments, \"when do I get to roll up a character?\" Shannon asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shan you can't play! We're in the middle of a campaign!\" Jeff laughed, \"There's too much going on right now for me to just work you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I figured you'd make room for your girlfriend,\" Shannon pushed him a little with a smile, standing over his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff dropped his bag of dice on the table, \"Is that what this is about? You thought we were dating? I've had enough of fat girls! Kelly was a hyperactive pain. Last thing I need is you getting depressed on me all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of his friends sat there, kind of in shock at Jeffs words. Worst of all was Shannon, who's eyeliner had already began to run in ragged dark gray tears. Bursting out of the room crying, she threw herself down on the living room couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the kitchen, Jeff's friends were telling him off quietly, encouraging him to go make up with the poor girl. Though he would have nothing to do with it of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough tear filled eyes, Shannon's shivering body allowed her to look up to see the remote on the couch. If only that thing really worked.</span></div></div>",

In her outstretched hands, Shannon held the remote like it was a pistol she had never fired.

Seeing the remote for the first time he snapped back, \"Whatcha gunna do? Mute me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were Jeff's last words at that height, as a bolt of electric blue energy was flung from the remote and diminished him soundlessly, besides his cry of surprise of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all knew what he was suppose to do today! You knew this wasnt about just using my house! Now you're all going to pay for Jeff's stupidity!\" Was Shannon's final words as she began to feel a little better, blue light flashing out the back windows as she shrunk person after person with wild laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tanya and Alexis were just getting out of their car and closing the doors as they carried the pizzas up to the town house. Unaware of the chaos out back they opened the door and walked in to find Shannon on her knees on the floor, sobbing over a tiny figure that was stumbling away from her toward several others under the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you're all going to pay,\" Shannon said in an almost pouty voice, wiping her nose with her forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at each other, Tanya and Alexis slipped off the flip flops and slowly approached the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

Their pizza boxes had been dropped behind them. Creating not only a mess on the floor but an effective wall behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the eight role players on the tiles of the kitchen floor, Shannon turned on her friends. The goths huge feet padded forward slowly through the carpet. The black nail polish on each of her toenails hanging like curved blades over the tips of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still want to make fun of me for wearing my boots in the summer Alexis? Now you're really going to see what my feet are like up close!\" Shannon boomed as she hovered over the miniature room mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Sqeaked the miniature Alexis, \"Comon Tanya! She's going to squash us like bugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya laughed, \"Shannon? Nah she wouldn't do that, she likes...\" Was all the brunette had time to say before Shannons huge foot moved forward as she used her toes to knock her friend to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped just under the arch of the giant goths toes, Tanya struggled with her lower body trapped under the soft yielding ball of Shannon's sole. Her hands slapped into the still slightly sticky skin that was pinning her down as she tried to push free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch Alexis, I want you to see what I'm going to do to you,\" Shannon said coldly as she picked her foot up again. The tiny Tanya yelped as she saw the massive wrinkled sole pass above her. Before she could react, Shannon dropped her pale foot down upon her and slowly began turning it from side to side gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis was almost in tears, \"You're going to hurt her Shan! Stop it!\" Oddly, even the role players found this action to be too interesting to pass up and were looking from the kitchen doorway in complete shock and horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Tanya felt her body begin to colapse. Tight pressure pinned her tightly into the goths soft sole and began to roll the plush flesh down over her. She coughed a little, but it hurt to. The scent was so strong and it just made her want to struggle more to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels really good Tanya. Struggle for me until I squish you okay? I want to feel your tiny hands clawing at my foot as you crunch!\" Alexis heard Shannon say. She had never seen such a look of hatred in the goths eyes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Alexis couldn't take it anymore. She crawled under the giantess toes which were propped up slightly near where Tanya was and reached in to her friend. Before she could even yell to her, Shannon brought her toes, each the size of the blonde and pink haired girl, down on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying out in pain, Alexis tried to fend off her friends now wiggling toes. \"Not so much fun is it?\" Shannon looked over their shoulder, \"So should I crush them, or you guys?\" She said to the role players.</span></div></div>",

Jeff took one look at it.....and screamed. It was horrifiyingly huge, and yet so perfect. And about to crush him in a step. Jeff took off just as Shannon playfully stepped behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, that's it. Run away from me. Run and prolong your death.

AAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe once again licked her lips and pushed down.

Struggle to your last breath as I slowly squish you to pieces...\" Shannon taunted as her perfect sole slowly pressed on his other arm.

The soft, plushy foot twisted back and forth, slowly grinding them down. The brittle bones snapped and turned to powder under her foot, and soon they were gone as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME GO! PLEASE! IT HURTS! STOP! I'M SORRY!\" He was crying like a baby, in such pain and bleeding so much that he was starting to pass out. Shannon wasn't going to give him the luxury of dying unconciously. She pressed her foot on him, and slowly began the end. \"Time to squish. Goodbye!\" The rest of his body squished rather easily, with him struggling until his body was so warped and damaged it was impossible for him to stay alive anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon was panting.

She loved working there, since the manager let her play whatever music she wanted, which Tara took advantage of on a regular basis.  She was a big fan of punk, so for most of the time, that's all the 22 year old would play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smoothed her Blink-182 shirt over her small belly and looked out the window.  Tara had always been kind of a big girl, but she had been lucky, in that she didn't have much belly fat.  Sure she had a little, but the majority of her excess weight seemed to always go to her breasts and thighs.  Still, that didn't stop people from picking on her over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara had always kept silent about the taunting, not speaking up to defend herself, or her weight.  To most people, it appeared she didn't have much of a backbone, but in reality, it was that she really didn't care what other people thought of her.  Still, that didn't mean Tara didn't think about getting even with a few people.  But, what could she do about it, really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout five minutes later, the bus lurched to a stop on her street and Tara got off.  She took out the remote she found on the bus and looked at it again, inspecting it further.  She decide to push one of the buttons, just to see what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little ways down the street, a younger guy was riding his bike, unaware that his life was about to be changed forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara pressed one of the buttons and watched as a white beam shot out of the remote and hit the guy.  She looked up in time to see both him and his bike seem to vanish in thin air.  Her eyes went wide and she ran over to where she last saw him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, on the ground, Billy Corrigan sat in shock on his bike, as the entire world grew around him.  A little ways away, he saw one of his neighbors, Tara, running towards him, her footsteps booming as she got closer, shaking the ground as she ran.  One of her footsteps bounced both him and his bike high in the air and Billy lay on the ground, his bicycle by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara's footsteps were getting closer.  There was no way he could escape in time.  Billy cowered on the ground in the fetal position and hoped his giant neighbor didn't accidentally kill him.</span></div></div>",

She had the day off from work so she had an idea on how to use the shrinking machine to her advantage.

He was always making her feel bad, so Tara decided that it was time to end his cruel game once and for all as she walks inside. Freddy sees her and gives an evil smile as he adjusts his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well,\" he says. \"If it isn't the steel zeppelin.\" Then he makes some beeping noises. \"Truck backing up. Truck backing up.\" Tara however didn't give in and instead gave Freddy an evil laugh. \"As hard as it is to believe Freddy. I'm actually glad to see you.\" Freddy lets out a laugh. \"Oh puh-lease, the only men who'd be interested in you would be whalers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tara takes out the remote and Freddy gives a scoff. \"You think you can mute me. I didn't know you were fat and dumb punkopotamus. I ain't a television.\" However Tara activates the remote and in seconds Freddy is shrunk to half an inch tall. \"Hey? What happened?\" Freddy looked around on the ground before the tremors from Tara's footsteps shake him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara looms her massive figure down and looks down on her insect sized antagonist as she rubs her exposed belly and gives a sinister look. \"I always knew you were a planet,\" said Freddy. \"Now change me back.\" The plump punk giantess just shakes her head. \"Oh no,\" she said. \"You've made fun of me long enough.

Don't eat me.\" But Tara holds Freddy over her head and her mouth opens wide showing her pierced tongue. \"Bottoms up asshole,\" she said. \"Now you get to be part of the body you love to mock so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy lets out a final scream as Tara drops him into her awaiting mouth and snaps it shut. She swishes him around in her mouth and grunts in ecstasy because of his delicious taste. Freddy panics in the punk giantess's mouth and tries to get the to front to escape as the teeth close, but Tara's tongue wraps around him like a python and tosses him in the back where he falls down the esophagus, letting out a buffled scream as Tara feels the bump going down her neck with her fat fingers. Finally Freddy lands with a splash in her bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy runs to the front and pounds the walls, making tiny bumps appear on the front of Tara's belly. \"Aw,\" says Tara with a giggle. \"How cute.\" \"Tara!\" yelled Freddy. \"This isn't funny! Let me...!\" That's all he can saw before the stomach acids completely dissolve him into a skeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her enemy perishing in her stomach, Tara lets out a loud burp. \"That felt good.\" She says.

The thudding footsteps of people getting on the bus shook down the hall as he tried to pull himself over the rigged rubber flooring of the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stoped and gasped at what he saw next though. Jennifer, the girl he had always desired in school stood miles above him. A tall, thin girl who looked just like he pictured the elven ranger from his novels to look like. Her long brown hair even cascaded around her slightly perky ears. She stood above him wearing a two piece light blue swimsuit with a towel over her shoulders. Water dripped down from high above as she sat down on the chair above John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as she had sat down, Jenn's feet lifted and landed in front of John on her toes. With wide eyes John took in the sight and realized he was in trouble. Too late, Jenn's foot lifted and pinned him into a groove in the rubber floor under the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was even worse! The girl he adored was now standing on his almost broken body. John cried a little, wishing that poor innocent Jenn knew what she was doing and could help him. To be taken home and cared for by her. But she was already aimlessly talking to her friends and had no idea what she was doing to her tiny admirer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, Jenn did feel something. She leaned over and started down toward John. Her foot lifted and she gasped, \"Eww, a bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's heart sank as her beautiful scrunched up face voiced his doom. Her gigantic sole descended casually and rubbed John down into the floor as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn spent the rest of the trip bouncing her toes up and down on John's remains as she chatted with her friend on the way home.</span></div></div>",

'If this doesn't work I'm going to look so STUPID!' she thought, pointing the remote at one guy sitting on the edge of the fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a click the remote unleashed a short whirr and a blast of light.

He was about level with her plush thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was huge to them. A giantess clad in a black tank top showing off her plump shoulders that were as freckled as her face, to her light blue jeans that were rolled up to almost her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrembling below, the three watched as Kellys soft feet, a light shade of pink from walking to the park and speckled with grass stains and dew, landed right before them. They couldnt even see her face for her tummy hanging over them, tucked lightly under her tanktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello little bug,\" they heard from high above. They all realized she was talking to their friend on the ledge. \"You and your friends are going to play a fun game with me, are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellys massive body leaned over and the tiny punks below assumed she was picking up their friend. She spun around, her huge bare feet slapping against the concrete as she almost stepped on one of them. Her big butt landing hard on the cement fountain edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had their friend in her hand and her eager plush hand was reaching down for them! Before they could scramble away, they were being smushed in the soft embrace of Kellys fat hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Kelly began, \"You're going to show me how good you guys are at skateboarding. I'm going to put you on one of your skateboards along with my big bare feet. If you can stay standing while I sit here and slide it around, I may let you go. But if any of you fall,\" She trailed off and made a little eww expression. \"Well my toes will just snap you up and mush you up good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kelly laid one of the boards down on the ground and placed the tiny skateboarders on the smooth surface in the middle. Glaring down at them, Kelly put her giant feet on either side of the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared, the punks looked back and forth from her giant bare feet.

Everyone freezes in alarm as Kelly announces \"Uh oh! Looks like we have our first disqualification! You call yourself a skateboarder. That wasn't even that much motion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling to get up, Kelly's right foot beats the tiny punk to the punch. Her eager wiggling toes descend upon him and pick him up between their clenched grasp and the very soft pad of her foot. Trying to push back against the soft wrinkled flesh does no good as Kelly holds her bare lower calf over the skateboard and drops the little guy just a bit beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to play, but your friends might get bored so...\" Kelly cruely presses down with her foot. The punk struggles madly against her, confused at first as her foot lands on the ground but the soft plush sole doesn't squish him. Instead it slowly forms down around him and slowly presses out all the air. Suddenly though, the ground shifts under him as he looks out near her arch to the lays rays of light as the world blurs outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly twists her bare foot against the ground and stamps on the punk a few times to make sure he is dead. Padding his body with the ball of her foot until she is sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their horror, Kelly's foot with their friends remains smeared on the bottom lands up on the skateboard again. \"Lets continue!\" The cruel plush giantess says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly shifts the board back and forth with a bit more force this time, feeling eager to have more of them squirming under her sole. Her green eyes glare down at them. A soft pink tip of her tongue slides between her lips and licks them moist from the hot summer day. Her blonde hair hangs low over her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth falls next, over toward Kellys left foot. Without missing a beat, she pivots her foot on its heel and rubs it down on her next victem. She feels him fighting under her tender sole and she scootches over so she can keep her barefoot on him while she continues her game with the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning out of air, the goth struggles in vain to escape from Kelly. Only to be finally trapped under her toes. Soft pillows of her wrinked sole pinning his legs as her toes wiggle eagerly, forcing him tightly against the ball of her foot. He doesnt last much longer beyond that until Kelly scrapes him off and brushes him along the rough surface of the board to the ground leaving a little smear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two are crouched low, staring up scared as Kelly laughs more and more. \"Think you're going to make it? I dunno.\" She tips her feet forward, forcing the board to arc away from her and they slide off onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I guess that shows you all. Amatures. Guess my feet are going to have to teach you two a lesson too! It's called practice, you should have tried some.\" Kelly teases as she kicks the skateboard off to one side, almost running over one of the punks under a grity plastic wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above they see Kelly, grinning down eagerly. She was a beautiful girl. Sweet face, soft skin, cute. But moreso they were looking at the dirty bare soles that were now held above them, her bare ankles almost smooth against her plush calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly planted a bare foot on either punk and held them there. Feeling them squirm and struggle deeply against her wrinkles. It felt great but she was sure they didnt like it or the smell. She looked around the park a bit. The fountain was all alone now besides for her. Standing up she felt a soft wet pop under each foot, stopping the lovely wiggling feeling she was enjoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it works. Now what to do, what to do?\" Kelly mused. Obviously loving the power she now had.</span></div></div>",

She wandered over to one of her favourite benches and sat there, staring down at the dusty ground at her feet. The odd ant wandered by but Kelly just poked at the ground with her right big toe. Missing her target and watching the ant stop, run right or left, and try to go past her foot instead of just running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the park, Kelly considered her options. She wanted more obviously, that much was for sure. The odd person was walking along the trail that circled the park. Most of the people were her age, but the odd few were older. Taking their daily walks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked down to the remote in her hands and suddenly realized there was a dial on the side. It apparently was for reversing the effects.

I'm absolutely huge! Nothing can stop me from just squishing you under my toes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had already taken the massive stomp as a hint to get moving, but Kelly's words encouraged those in nearby houses to rush outside and get away from the now giant sized plush girl.

She smiled and pressed her smelly toes against a first story window and smashed through it. Her entire foot entered the classroom delightfully. She felt the students touching the bottom of her reeking bare foot and giggled when they began to run. Kelly slowly lowered her massive bare foot, trapping them and cruelly crushing them to death. She smiled as their bodies popped and spread warmly all over her sweaty wrinkled bare sole and she wiggled her toes. This caused great chaos in the school and students began to flee out the front door. Kelly\u2019s stinky bare feet had their way with them. The students met their demise painfully and slowly as Kelly\u2019s giant smelly bare toes came down upon them, mashing their worthless little bodies into the pavement. Kelly placed her hand inside the building, seized a handful of students, and lifted them up to her face. \u201cMMM, you all look mighty tasty. I believe I am going to eat you all, and there isn\u2019t much you can do about it now is there?\u201d The students screamed in gut wrenching terror as Kelly raised her hand to her mouth, lifted her head and dropped the screaming students into her mouth. She closed her mouth and listened to them squeal. She loved having this power and slowly began to chew. Slowly and cruelly she grinded them between her teeth. It made her beautiful stinky toes wiggle she loved it so much. She swallowed them and exclaimed, \u201cWow, human beings sure are tasty to a goddess, I think I\u2019ll have a feast\u201d. Kelly ripped the roof of the building and plucked scores of students from the structure. She devoured them wholeheartedly and they tasted wonderful. After she had her fill there were still about a dozen or so, students left. Kelly got an idea that made her bare toes tingle. She plucked out four students and placed one in between each of her long lovely toes. Kelly raised them in the air and said, \u201cHow do my sexy sweaty toes smell? Do you like being near my toes? Aren\u2019t my toes beautiful?\u201d and she slowly began to curl them. She giggled as they screamed bloody murder and their bodies began to compress. And my goodness did Kelly\u2019s bare foot stink! Kelly waited until she felt some of the students\u2019s bones break and then spread her toes, leaving them alive and suffering. \u201cNow that wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d She began to curl them again, laughing and getting a bit turned on by the power that her sexy stinky bare foot had over these worthless mortals. Looking up at her beautiful toes, she got very sexually aroused. She got moist looking at how powerful her feet were and her nipples hardened. Kelly curled her lovely toes even more until her victims popped like grapes. The student\u2019s blood dribbled down her lovely wrinkled sole and she giggled at the tickling sensation. Kelly smiled as she realized this was another opportunity to suck on her toes. Thus, Kelly took her stinking bare toes into her mouth gracefully. She loved sucking on her own toes. They were so sweaty and sexy. Kelly also licked the blood from her bare sole. The blood and her sweaty sole were delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow....</span></div></div>",

Her sandals wern't even visible, unless she didn't even bring them back with her after she got her bikini that was on under her rolled up jeans and black tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you heard me!\" The plush giantess grumbled as she looked down at the road below. The two story buildings barely came up to her ankles. She was having trouble figuring out what any of the people down below were doing. This was just great, she gets a compliment during what she figured would have been an impressive growth that would have sent people fleeing and now she was too huge to figure out who had said it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the crowd far below, Kelly pondered what she should do next. To the tiny people, this massive giantess was wiggling her house sized toes revealing the huge ball of her foot beyond that would be impossible to out run. Everyone tried to remain calm but the occasional few made a run for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comon, back away from him or I'll just squish you all! Is that what you want? Maybe I'll let the rest of you go for now!\" Kelly had actually paused for a moment between saying she'd let them go and the for now part. She realized more and more that there was no way to tell who the tiny people were at her feet. Nervously she realized that even the other girls could be down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up a bit taller, straightening her stance. This wasn't something to worry about. The girls all had their own size remotes. They wouldn't just stand there and let Kelly smush them. So she looked down again and one tiny person was left standing out in the middle of the road with the rest watching from the sidewalks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly grinned, \"That's better!\" She took a deep gulp. This was silly, so the guy liked her, so what? She was busy squishing people! Part of her was honestly flattered though. She had a choice to make, go stomping around the city like she had planned, or shrink down and see what this guy was all about. Of course, not too far.

He had no idea what was going on at first and when she was ten feet this whole illusion was quite funny. Now that Kelly wasn't twice the size of a regular person, but around twenty times instead this was a frightening and unreal prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsterous Kelly stood there staring down at the tiny thing at her feet. Amist cracked roadways and surrounded by many confused onlookers, her admirer stood bravely before the massive plush girl at her impressive hundred feet tall. He'd thought she was cute but this was overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah! I didn't grow to this height to flirt with a bug sized guy!\" Kelly laughed as her right foot raised up in the air. She slammed her heel down into the road, sending a plume of dust and debris bursting from the road that had no hope of holding up the giantess weight behind the stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith wide eyes, Kelly's admirer found the ground under him tilting up into the air. Falling onto his back and furiously trying to scramble back he was left staring up at the heel that was dug into the ground, then up her wide wrinkled sole to the looming pudgy toes wiggling just above him. Behind him was a fifteen foot drop to the ground from the broken asphalt ledge he was now struggling not to slide down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her foot forward, the entire chunk of roadway slammed back down to the ground and jarred the tiny guys bones as Kelly's big toe fell down upon him a moment later, \"Squish! Gotcha lil' guy! At least you enjoyed the view I'm sure.\" She said, her voice echoing off nearby buildings as she smiled down at her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken a moment after everyone had crouched at the initial impact, but now the crowd was quickly trying to get away from giantess Kelly. Of course it was her decision if any of them actually escaped since anyone nearby could easily be caught by her gigantic feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising her left foot over a group near the buildings at the side of the road, Kelly grinned down and simply stepped into the crowd with an eager, \"Gotcha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGround level it was very chaotic with some trying to squirm free from the soft edges of her huge sole. Others wern't so lucky and were under the foot when it landed. The rest were already running from the plush girls step. That didn't last long as Kelly balanced on a nearby building and brought her foot on again, stomping several times at the fleeing tiny people below her giantess body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few that ran down the street were ignored for now as Kelly went back to looking for those she didn't quite get under her foot. Curiously she searched around for more to squish under her enormous feet. Most of them were finished off with her toes as they tried to crawl away. The occasional few though were softly compressed under her plush soles as she took her time playing with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was trying to stop her yet, and why would they? It was only at least five minutes into her fun and nothing was going to stand in her way anyway. Kelly looked back at the park which actually had quite a few people running through it now and several others were running through the wide downtown roads. Downtown would lead back towards the houses where her friends were though. She didn't want them ruining her fun too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling her toes against the busted street and loose chunks of sidewalk below, Kelly pondered over where she'd go next.</span></div></div>",

However, it was obvious to anyone with a bird's eye view that the park would soon be overrun with people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went entirely without saying that Kelly had a bird's eye view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smiled widened even more when she realized the bottleneck that was about to happen. Unfortunately, the people were so crowded, so close together, that it wouldn't be nearly as fun to stomp them as it had been to crush individuals or tiny groups. She needed to then them out a bit before that would become as pleasurable as it had been a few moments ago. And a deep, deep rumble from her jutting stomach told her exactly how to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hand on her fat belly, giggling slightly. \"You hear that?\" she announced to the crowds below. \"You used to make fun of how much I ate. So, I'm pretty sure this,\" she paused to let another rumble emerge. \"Is the sound of irony. You expected me to be one of those shallow Cosmo women. You called me fat. And now, you're gonna' make me fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that her words weren't really having an effect on the crowd; they were already fleeing at full bore.

She put her enormous hands together like a scoop, and slid them into the frothing mass of humanity. She gathered dozens of people in her pudgy paws, lifting them back up to her face. Taking a moment to give them a wicked smile, she opened her mouth, lolled out her tremendous tongue, and slid the mass down into her waiting throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, there shouldn't have been much of an appealing flavor. But Kelly's senses had been enhanced with her size, and her tongue was as alight with sensation as her soles had been earlier. \"Ohhh, my god,\" she moaned, tilting her head back. \"You little runts taste so, so good. I need more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, she did. Her massively increased size had played a bit of havoc with her metabolism, and she'd kick-started it with that first bite. The hunger pangs she'd felt moments ago came back, in much greater force. She couldn't remember ever being as hungry as she was at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More!\" she snapped again, reaching to fill her eager hands. She continued to eat, mouthful after glorious, practically orgasmic mouthful, only to reach for another as soon as she could. \"You...you're going to feed me,\" she breathed in between bites. \"I'll...eat this whole city if I have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, the park wasn't merely cleared; it was empty. Many people had managed to escape in  the chaos, but many more met their final resting place in Kelly's bulging belly. Kelly pouted slightly, irritated that her meal was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood, rubbing her plush stomach slowly...</span></div></div>",

This went on until the size changing device finally broke. Kelly looked at the remote with concern and gave an, \"oops\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she spoke, Kelly noticed a booming echo in her voice and she suddenly looked out to her town which now seemed like a model set. With shock she looked down to her now bare feet. With a gasp from Kelly that sounded like it came from a million speakers turned all the way up, she estimated that she grew around 1000 feet! At first, Kelly was scared, she had just broken the remote and any chance of growing to normal size, plus she had become really, really huge! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Kelly thought about the possibilities more, did she really want to go back to normal size where she was just average and made fun of by just about every living thing on the planet. Now she was an actually goddess. Nothing could stop her and she had never felt more powerful in her life. With this realization, Kelly felt better than she ever had before and now it was time to have some nonstop fun! \"Oh where do I stomp to first\"?</span></div></div>",

Most landed on the right spot but Kelly wasn\u2019t being careful and a few just missed her mouth and fell away. Once everyone was of her hand she kept her tongue stuck out for a moment so everyone could see the light of day for one last time. Then she brought her tongue back in her mouth and closed it.

So after building up enough saliva she swallowed them all with one big gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kelly's hunger was barely satisfied. Suddenly she looked down and noticed something odd on the strap between her bikini top. Suddenly she realized it was a person.

No chewing, no quick finish, you will be slowly be made a part of me in my big, lovely belly\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Paul heard this, he was petrified.

It took him a moment to realise that he was being picked up and lowered just on top of one of the womans breasts and the other hand was slightly lifting the bikini top to fit Paul in.

(My butt has power over everyone, if this doesn't make me a goddess I don't know what will.)

He fell backwards, and the people around him crawled away, hoping not to get caught in the collateral damage. \"Hey!\" <br>\r\nHer words were even louder this time, his face turned to a pained grimace, and he did not remove his hands from his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Kelly poked again, harder this time.<br>\r\nThen there was a little squish. Or to the tiny people on the overpass, a horrible squelching, crunching noise as the guy's body collapsed underneath Kelly's finger.<br>\r\nKelly lifted her finger. \"Huh?\" She said. Two red spots were all that was left of the guy. One on the overpass, one on Kelly's finger. \"Oh, whoops.\" Then she wiped his remains off on one of her wide thighs. \"He was an asshole anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked at all the other people still nervously bowing and remembered what she was doing. She stood up straight, put her hands on her big hips in what she hoped was an intimidating pose, and spoke.<br>\r\n\"With the exception of the rude little asshole, you have shown your loyalty.\" She boomed. \"I will postpone your squishing, and you may all return to the city as my toys and subjects.\"<br>\r\nThen she thought of something. \"Well, actually. You all still tried to escape, didn't you? Maybe I shouldn't let dissenters get away so easily.\"<br>\r\nKelly smiled, which was extremely unnerving to her tiny subjects. <br>\r\n\"Let's not wait until you all get back to the city, play session starts now! Survivors get to go back home, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was enough for several of the people on the overpass to lose their nerve and try to run.

All the girls stared in awe, as their meek friend had now become a goddess. \"How do you feel?\" asked Kelly. \"I've never felt better. Or more beautiful!\" replied Sally.

Marie's growth was similar to Sally's, except for the fact that her entire bikini snapped off because it was already exceedingly tight on her fat body. Marie wasn't exactly as modest as Sally. In fact, she enjoyed the freedom. Cathrine was next, but a little scared. \"I'm not sure I want to get naked\" she said. Sally crouched down and said \"It's not as bad as you think\" Marie said \"Go ahead, try it. You'll feel wonderful!\" Kelly aimed at Cathrine and fired. Cathrine grew a bit faster than the others. And like the others, her clothes didn't stay on very long. But unlike the others, she didn't wear a bikini, but a one-piece swimsuit. It didn't last any longer, though. It immediately tore to shreds. She immediately crossed her arms to cover her still expanding chest, but as soon as she realized how powerful she had become, she became more comfortable and let her arms down.

I'll take a taxi and meet you over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly hopped onto a nearby taxi and asked for Chinatown. She was already plotting out what she could do in her mind. She could go on a massive stomping spree, or eat everything in sight. Hell, she could do a combination, and let's not forget Marie. She could probably warm Marie up to the idea of being like Godzilla.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, she though. They needed to pick a size to grow to.</span></div></div>",

Ohmigod, Kelly Stop!\" she squealed, \"Those aren't insects; they're, like, little tiny people or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The murderess stared down at the little blonde as though she'd beamed down from Mars. The truth was that she'd been so carried away with torturing and killing her latest prey that she'd been in a world of her own. Of course, Ali mistook her surprise as a reaction to her own seeming insanity. Kelly frowned. The last thing she wanted was Miss Prettypopularskinnypetitewonderfulpants Ali bursting her bubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless... She quickly surpressed a cruel smile. Luckily for Kelly and perhaps fatally for her, Ali missed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What?\" she said, feigning ignorance, \"Oh hello Ali, I didn't get that. I was busy squishing these ants.\" She was determined now to have some verbal fun with her classmate before she shrunk her and had some physical fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ali was in a state of confusion and near shock. She must be hallucinating this! There were no tiny little insect sized people. And why couldn't Kelly see? She looked again. It was hard to see what the specks were; nearly impossible, but she had A1 vision and the colours and shapes and the way they moved..... She stared at a near invisible speck which seemed taller than in was long, mauve, with a dot of white and gold.... (a face under blonde hair?) and seemed to be waving two 'arms' up at her, as though begging her to save her from....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A shadow fell over it and Ali let out an involuntary gasp as she took in the sheer size of Kelly's big dirty foot as it trod down just missing the ant/person, her chubby toes dwarfing it/him/her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, that they aren't ants.

Don\u2019t move,\u201d Ali said, as she cautiously placed her hand on the ground a few inches from the tiny person, not wanting to harm her in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above, Kelly looked down at Ali with a sneer on her face.  \u201cWho does this little shit think she is?\u201d Kelly thought, flipping her long hair behind her shoulder angrily.  She pointed the remote at the back of Ali\u2019s head, unbeknownst to the smaller girl.  She wanted to shrink Ali down to microscopic size, then leave her in the middle of the park to fend for herself.  At the last possible moment, she decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kelly thought, putting the remote away for the time being, a sinister smile forming on her face.  \u201cI have something much better planned for her.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the ground, the terrified shrunken girl was panting heavily as she neared Ali\u2019s giant hand.  \u201cI\u2019m going to make it!

Kelly ground her foot back and forth on the pavement, making sure the shrunken girl was dead and smearing a tiny trail of blood on the ground in the process.  She looked down at Ali, who had just watched someone die in front of her and was on the verge of tears.  Kelly smiled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli shot to her feet angrily and confronted the bigger girl, more than aware that she was nearly a foot shorter than Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you do that?!\u201d Ali asked, raising her voice.  \u201cI told you that those little specks on the ground were people and you killed her anyway!  How could you be so heartless?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly simply shrugged.  \u201cMy foot must have slipped or something,\u201d she replied rather nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d Ali said.  \u201cI know you did that on purpose.  You are NOT going to get away with this.  Do you hear me, you fat cow?!\u201d  She turned back toward the other shrunken people, determined to save as many as she could before the psycho bitch behind her killed them, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d watch you mouth, squirt,\u201d Kelly replied, a little anger showing in her voice.  \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to piss someone like ME off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah.  Whatever.  What are you going to do about it, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli was grabbing as many speck-sized people as she could, not really worried about how delicate she was being with them.  Her priority was to get them as far away from Kelly as she possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ali felt a pair of large hands grab her shoulder from behind and push her roughly to the ground.  The people she was holding went flying, presumably to their deaths, while those still on the pavement felt a quake more powerful than anything they had ever experienced before in their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli groaned as she sat back up, glaring angrily up at Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably do something like this,\u201d Kelly said, as she\u2026</span></div></div>",

She had to shield her eyes as it fully enveloped her body.  Ali could feel something strange happening to her, but couldn\u2019t figure out what.  A short while later, as the light dissipated, Ali was given the biggest shock of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli was staring at a big toe that was a little bit taller than she was.  She began to panic, not wanting to share the same fate as the other shrunken people, but was too scared to move.  Ali knew if she tried to run, she would probably be killed instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from high above, Kelly\u2019s face appeared, peering down at the terrified Ali.  Kelly bent down and roughly snatched Ali off the ground, not caring how tight her grip was, before dropping the shrunken girl unceremoniously into her other hand.  It took Ali a moment to catch her breath, clutching her sore chest for a few seconds.  After a quick inspection, Ali was relieved to discover no bones were broken.  She then turned her attention to the billboard-sized face staring down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are, insect,\u201d Kelly\u2019s voice boomed, as her warm breath washed over her prey.  Ali was no bigger than an inch and a half at this point.  Kelly smiled.  This was going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you doing this to me?!\u201d Ali asked, terrified.  \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing to you!\u201d  She started to sob silently, not wanting to be crushed to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly could see Ali\u2019s lips moving, but could barely make out what she was saying.  Not that she cared, anyway.  \u201cOh, shut up, Little Miss Perfect.  I\u2019m not going to kill you.  Well, at least not right away.  I\u2019m going to have a little bit of fun with you first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli was grabbed again and hoisted back in the air.  Dangling from one arm in front of Kelly\u2019s huge face, Ali looked down, contemplating how far off the ground she was at this point.  Two thousand feet?  Five thousand?  More?  She started whimpering at the thought of smacking against the pavement from such a high altitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid of heights, huh?\u201d Kelly asked.  Ali shook her head vigorously in response, too terrified to open her eyes.  \u201cWell, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you conquered this fear once and for all?\u201d  She let Ali go and watched as the helpless girl plummeted quickly, screaming as she fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as her descent began, however, it was over, as Ali bounced against something soft and large\u2014Kelly\u2019s breasts.  She desperately wrapped her small hands around a loose string on Kelly\u2019s tank top, stopping her body.  Her heart beating a mile a minute, Ali curled into the fetal position and began crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?\u201d Kelly\u2019s voice boomed from above.  \u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t going to kill you yet.  But unfortunately, I have places I have to be today and I can\u2019t have you dangling from my top.  It\u2019s too dangerous, you know.\u201d  She plucked Ali from her top and placed her in between her breasts, before a large index finger wedged her deep into the cavernous gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Ali heard Kelly\u2019s muffled voice from above.  \u201cThis is just for safe keeping.\u201d  She then felt Kelly take off, her heartbeat thudding against her body every second or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was going\u2026</span></div></div>",

She ran quickly to her room, locked the door, and set them free allowing them to roam around her room.  The tinies were running frantically around her room, but because it was empty they had no place to hied which made Kelly laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She took of her shirt and skirt and all there was left was a blue-green swim suit. \"How do I look my little tinies\", she giggled.  \" Allow me to demonstrate my power over you.\" she said.  She grabbed a boy named Jack who was in her Biology class at school.  He made fun of her normally and would annoy her most of the time.  She placed Jack in the cleavage of her breasts and with one powerful squeeze, Jack popped allowing blood to scatter around her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She laughed at the deed she had thought was funny and scared the hell out of the others.  This time, another idea overcame her.  She grabbed a handful of people in her hand and lifted them up carefully.  She brought her hand up to her view, opened her hand, and counted 6 little people.  She stretched her bikini and shoved every one of them into her vagina.  This got her very excited.  She felt her womenhood grow rapidly in her.</span></div></div>",

Trixxy was always a good friend, but she had a very short temper. Even in their obscure situation, she might even see them being shrunk as playing some kind of game on her.

He looked up nervously as Trixxy tossed her other shoe aside and moved on to adjusting her pony tail. Her huge daunting toes with black nail polish were calm and still as she focused on her hair. Maybe it would be okay and he could climb up on his friend. It wouldn't be anything to climb her black cargo pants with how bulky they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly approached her foot and gained speed with each passing moment as his confidence rose. High above Trixxy was finishing with her pony tail and looked down glumly at her feet. The other two realized this and hoped that they could be seen by her again.</span></div></div>",

Despite her quick temper, Trixxy was always a good friend and eager to help, especially in desperate times.  Now, more than ever was one of those times, and Trixxy had no idea how easily she could remove her tiny friends from the danger she was putting them in at her feet.  Her Chuck Taylors were a little dingy, but still mostly clean, only having two or three months of wear and dirt on the soles.  Her right foot, the one on the ground, cast a dark shadow above them, and as she bounced her foot, the tiny boys could hardly imagine what the kind of power the shoe must have to contain such a powerful foot so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the time for speculation had passed, now was the time for action!  Collectively, the three shorter members of the skateboard quartet pushed the taller, fourth member forward.  \"Go check it out man, see if you can get on her shoe and get her attention!\"  Begrudgingly, the long haired, skinny skater boy turned and began walking towards Trixxy's left foot, still on the ground and docile, neatly contained within her shoe. Ever so often, he could see her toes wiggling inside, causing the shoe to shift and move.  With a shudder, he wandered around towards the side of her foot, with the rest of the foot getting taller and more intimidating as he got closer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he reached his goal the sole of the shoe stood above him like a huge, dirty white wall.  Despite what little use it had gotten, he could see the imperfections in it as clear as day, every scuff, scratch, mark, and tear.  These all did well to give him a way up towards Trixxy's exposed ankle.  With the rest of the group cheering him on from a safe distance, he grabbed the etchings in the sole and began to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb was relatively easy, he was glad they did rock climbing in gym class a few weeks ago.  Even Trixxy was relatively calm during his climb.  Soon, he was boarding the black canvas material on top of the shoe, and it was a short feel steps before the curve of the shoe lowered to expose the slim ankle of the giant girl.  The ankle itself protruded from her leg like a majestic carving, and after a quick jump the tiny teen pulled himself onto the lip of the mouth of the shoe, now standing face to face with a wall of flesh under Trixxy's ankle.  Smiling at his success, he quick began to beat at the warm, soft skin around his friend's ankle.  However, he did have to lean forward a bit to do so, there was a small gap between the shoe and her skin, where he could see down into the shoe itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

Sighing, he waved his hands, gesturing for them to come join.  At first, they were hesitant, but after an obscene gesture with his right hand, followed by a disapproving look, the three other teenagers headed for Trixxy's shoe.  Splitting up, two of the guys went straight for the toe of the gigantic Chuck Taylor, while a third opted to climb a loose shoe string.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixxy was getting impatient, but maybe even a little worried.  The guys were jerks sometimes, but they didn't usually just abandon their boards like this and leave her hanging.  She was no super model, but she thought of herself as being attractive, and at least two of the guys she was pretty sure had a crush on her.  That alone was enough to assume they would be right back.  If they didn't show in a minute, she'd call.  Besides, these shakes were going to melt soon.  Maybe that girl that kept looking up at her wanted one?  She may end up giving one to her, soon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the shakes, she decided to lift the lid off and stir it some.  Whoever made these was obviously new, or just sucked at their job...their was some shake near the middle that seemed to have less chocolate in it.  Trying not to let this tiny inconvenience distract her, she uncrossed and recrossed her legs.  WIthout knowing it, all four of her shrunken friends had made their way on top of her shoe.  As she swung that foot into the air, one of the guys was thrown skyward.  He was treated to a birds eye view of his gigantic female friend, and her displeased look, before he began to fall back down to Earth.  Closing his eyes, he waited for impact, only to land...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None of them considered that Kelly herself may be as vicious as they'd hoped their friend wouldn't be. They just thought this had to be some sort of practical joke and Kelly could return them to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of them continued across the cobblestone that surrounded the fountain.

She puts her shoes back on and we get squished under her feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" the other guy added in, \"Trixxy's got soft feet.

Obviously Kelly didn't want to be seen by the now relaxing Trixxy but she was eager to get these three guys over to where she could get at them. Her bare feet, giant sized to the tiny skateboarders, were sunk slightly into the soft garden dirt below the bushes she hid in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued along they realized just how vulnerable they really were. At any time someone could come along and pulverize them under a careless step. It wasn't that far now to get to Kelly though. They were worried however that the plush girl wasn't just coming out from the bushes to announce what had happened. There was something sinister about the way she waited for them to come to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when they realized someone was heading towards them. A tall girl with chestnut brown hair tied back in a pony tail, wearing a pair of flip flops. The soft spongy material supported each of her steps, with her feet sinking down into the padded insole. In sheer panic they realized even if she could hear them at their size, she was wearing a massive pair of headphones!

None of them dare more than a glance as they refocus back towards the huge jungle of a few giant bushes up ahead. Their legs burn with the exertion but they're confident they can make it. They have to make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The sandal comes down meer inches from their tiny bodies and all that slow motion euphoria suddenly splashes into full speed reality. Her giant step jars them with a shuddering thud, but they have no time to even think about it as the gust from her footfall sends them flying through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Each of the skateboarders land in the dirt just off the cobblestone, safe from the impending doom of that girls tread as she continues along in the background.

This is what she wanted anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The three tiny skateboarders gathered around Kelly's feet and began to jump up and down calling to her, presumably to help them.

In one moment hope had turned to panic as this colossal plush girl slammed her foot down upon their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his perspective, all the he could do was stare when he realized he was her target. The toes dug into the soft earth before him rose high into the air. Her foot hovered for a moment, gigantic toes wiggling as small boulders of dirt rained down from above. The muddy sole of Kelly's damp foot wrinkling with her motion. Finally, it sped down towards the helpless skateboarder who fell backwards and flug his arms up in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't do any good as Kelly's first stomp squished him down into the soft ground. It gave way and shoved him down into a deep footprint that compressed against his back, forcing the plush flesh from above to mould down over his body. The ball of her foot was right against his face, his legs held down by the top of the arch of her pudgy foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was up in the air again, the skateboarder taking in a deep breath as the pressure was taken off his chest. He scrambled to get back up and out of the ditch Kelly's foot had created. A crater in the loose dirt that had held him for a moment. In his panic he finally realized he should look up to see what she was doing as he flipped over onto his knees to crawl free from the girls huge footprint. Sure enough the huge sole was wrinkling again oh so slowly and a knowing smirk was on Kelly's face. She was going to stomp him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he tucked his legs up and wrapped his arms around his chest, left shoulder facing towards the descending foot. He couldn't do anything but take the brunt of Kelly's attack again as it dug him deeper into the damp spongy garden soil. The sensation of being compressed down further than the first crushing blow was made worse by the ground bending further down forcing the skateboarder in at a diagonal angle. Kelly's toes dug in around him and pushed on his shoulders as he was forced upon his back. Two of her toes pushing hard on him shoving him further into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain her foot raced into the air and the skateboarder weakly tried to climb free. It was no use this time. He wasn't sure how badly he was hurt but there was no way he could muster the energy to stop her stomping onslaught. He noticed how Kelly actually looked around her foot to see how badly her pounding steps had hurt him. She was happy so her massive sole must be doing a good job he assumed. Bracing for the impact again he forced himself down into the dirt hoping that eventually the spongy ground would cushion her blows enough that they wouldn't hurt at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends were in a panic above. They were yelling at Kelly to stop but mostly transfixed on the ditch that had been created by her footfalls. It would be impossible for them to stop her. It was the goth who first realized this and met his friends gaze. They had to get out of there if they wanted to survive.</span></div></div>",

Sure, we don't know how Trixxy will react but we sure know what this monster wants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in response the punk and the goth guy started to make their way back towards Trixxy. Their pace was slower now, visibly worn out by all the recent stress and physical activity. It was at least four football fields to them or more between Kelly's hiding spot and the fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of their past ideas raced through their heads as the sound of Kelly pounding their friend down into the soil could be heard thudding in the background. Surely he couldn't have survived all that. Instead of padding it was deep thuds they could hear now from each stomp. She was really pounding at the ground hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked to Trixxy's shoes and considered that option again. After all, Trixxy would have to pick up her shoes. It was that or they could wait at the edge of the fountain for her to spin back around. Hopefully she would notice them and they wouldn't have to try to hide in her shoes to get back to her place or where ever she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat and there was the constant threat of someone else coming by. They were so out in the open and exposed. They'd seen what happened to their friend, at least from above, and didn't want a similar fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was frusterating that Trixxy didn't realize their skateboards had been left behind. That something was wrong. She was too busy kicking her legs in the cool fountain water high above, looking at her pretty toenail polish, and slurping on her milkshake to give it a second thought. Then again why would she have a need to look around on the ground for her shrunken friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think we won't just get crushed in her sneaker?\" The goth guy asked his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging the punk just looked back over his shoulder, \"If we stay here, that girl is going to flatten us anyway. Unless you think Trix is going to notice us running around on the ground and not just freak out thinking we're bugs, then sure. Lets go to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for a long moment they looked back and forth from the overturned black sneaker with a damp rolled up white sock stuffed into it, to Trixxy who seemed to be becoming bored with playing in the water.

The giant girl wiggled her toes and commented to herself that she felt better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the perfect time to get her attention. She was looking down at her purple painted nails on her toes and focused on the ground in front of her. For all their tired legs were worth they dashed forward with reckless abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching Trixxy's feet the two guys waved their arms furiously and it startled them to realize with such a huge area, it still seemed like her eyes wern't focsed on the spot beyond her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had enough of this, and frankly not wanting to hear more debate about hiding in Trixxy's shoes, the goth guy lunged forward and grabbed onto one of her smaller toes. He was able to pull himself up on her nail and scramble up her arching toe towards the top of her foot. The other guy held back, staring at his friends progress and too startled to hop up on the giant girls toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixxy noticed that down around in the droplettes of water on her skin, something about the size of an ant was scurrying around. Maybe a little bigger. Still she didn't pay much attention to it. Instead to the goth guys dismay, she looked up and picked up her milkshake from the edge of the fountain, taking a long slurp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms fell to his side as the goth guy stared up at the girls throat so high above, eagerly gulping down her drink. Her powerful throat muscels working to consume her treat. Everything seemed horrific at this size with any casual motion of their friend. Her giant feet were intimidating, especially after they had just seen Kelly stomp one of their friends into the dirt. That throat could easily slide one of them down into her tummy that they couldn't escape from. This was horrible on so many levels. Every glance brought another idea of a horrible fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping down, the small goth guy started pounding on Trixxy's foot to get her attention. That action was instantly regretted when instead of looking back down the huge girl raised her other foot and brought on her other toes to scratch at the spot he stood upon. Stunned by the incredible massive size of her wrinkled sole behind her army of five eager toes, he couldn't react at all.</span></div></div>",

High above Trixxy was texting someone on her cellphone. Jamie looked curiously up. Everyone was here, who could she be talking to, unless she was messaging one of them. Would that even work? Maybe there was something in the way they were shrunk that didn't affect the characteristics of their electronic signals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed pretty unbelievable but Jame took out his cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What are you doing?\" Kyle asked as he looked at Jamie with his arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still the same signal right? Maybe it would still work. Do signals really have size? Maybe it would just be like being a few miles down in a valley from where we were. Just further distance from the satellite,\" Jamie was furiously typing away on the keypad hoping for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked up, also wondering whom Trixxy was texting. He vaguely recalled her getting a message. There was only one person she'd be writing to today.</span></div></div>",

That was until another message was received after a few minutes on her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been shrunken and we're down at your feet,\" Trixxy read aloud. \"That doesn't even make sense. What is that some kind of metaphor? Was I being too mean today guys? Too bossy? Grr!\" She began to furiously text back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked to the goth guy Jamie, \"She actually thinks we're making fun of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, I guess my message could have been a bit more explanditory,\" Jamie admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the weak signal of Jamie's phone a few moments to get Trixxy's rant. It's what they expected. Trixxy was telling them off for acting like she was being annoying. Jamie tried to be a bit more direct and wrote back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really, we're literally shrunk and at your feet right now. Look down,\" Trixxy mumbled to herself. Instantly her eyes darted upward and looked around the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie sighed in frusteration, \"Great, she thinks we're joking around. She probably expects us to run out and tackle her the moment she looks down at her feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was becomming a huge concern. Kelly was probably done with their friend by now and could make her way over to Trixxy to take care of the tiny guys before their full sized friend figured out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment however Trixxy actually did look down. Both guys gave a sigh of relief. Now hopefully she'd actually realize what she was looking at and they could be saved! It was that or worse off they'd be left behind and more than likely at Kelly's mercy. Jamie couldn't help but hope that Trixxy would take their skateboards if she left. It seemed like such an awkward thought with his life on the line, but it felt important to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm looking down guys, what am I supposed to be seeing?\" Trixxy questioned as she stared down at her feet, taking the occasional quick glance up to see if the guys were around.</span></div></div>",

None of them had actually assumed this may be their fate, they'd just figured everyone would have a good laugh and Kelly would change them back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slow lean towards the chaos before them, the goth guy was the first to look into the footprint before them. Their friend was actually tunneling into the soft dirt and curling up away from Kelly's big foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's still alive you know,\" Jamie started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle glared at the goth guy, \"I know he is! What are we supposed to do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that, the goth guy had no answer. Jamie just stared into the dirt and realized that if they didn't do something soon, they'd just end up the same way. The huge wiggling toes right next to them just added to the pressure. Kelly was distracted or at least trying to find their punk friend in her footprint. This had to be done now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, Jamie threw himself over the edge and ran through the mushy dirt toward his friend and began frantically clawing at the sides of Kelly's huge footprint trying to make a ramp as he pulled his punk friend free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, Kelly was raising her foot again for another round of stomping. Ahead and above the hole they found themselves standing in, Kyle was reaching down to grab their arms and pull them free from the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you leave me?\" Derek the other punk guy who had been stuck down there asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie shoved him hard towards Kyle, trying to get him out of the way, \"I'm not leaving anyone behind! We're going to get out of here,\" Jamie growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle managed to pull Derek free and the two of them went falling over out of the footprint. Jamie however was still down there right in the path of Kelly's eager toes. He turned to meet his fate has he saw the giant girls bare sole eagerly hovering over him. She was staring down between her spread toes at him with a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie didn't have much of a choice. Scrambling out of the hole probably wasn't going to be an option but Kelly's toes were just going to force him harder into the ground. Even worse they could just squeeze him tightly and squish him that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the punk guys knew there was no helping Jamie at the moment as they saw Kelly's foot lowering down back into the dirt towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above they heard, \"There's no use running little guys, I'm going to squish you all under my huge bare feet!\" from the giant plush girl.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps he could crawl out after her monsterous foot rose up out of the foot print again. He really didn't know. All he knew a huge dirty smeared foot was hovering overhead and ready to drop at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie fell. He got tripped up on the soft earth, oddly probably turned into damp soil off the moisture from Kelly's huge foot. His shoe sunk in and he fell flat on his face. Pushing his arms deep into the muck he was able to turn over to see the arch above him. Then he realized his legs were still under the massive ball of the falling sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling against the dirt Jamie squeezed his eyes shut realizing he wasn't going to get out of the way in time. With a massive thud Kelly's foot slammed down on him, pressing his legs down into the soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it didn't hurt, it just felt like an intense pressure. Then that soft sole above pushed down cruely and he felt a sharp pain and then completely numbess across his legs. Jamie looked down in fear as the plus sized girls foot raised into the air, her toes wiggling with grim satisfaction from stomping one of them once more. Dirt rained down on Jamie as he struggled to flip over and pull himself towards safty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a much more problematic issue now that his legs wern't responding at all. His clothes were caked in dirt now and he was struggling against the loose earth below. Above Kelly was laughing and calling him a pathetic tiny creature as she prepared to stomp again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie knew he couldn't take much more of this onslaught and his friends were no where in sight. He felt completely alone and his only comfort was the bare sole above him, the gigantic wide foot of this horrible girl that was delighting in stepping on him and squishing him into the ground. He was at least in the clear under where her arch should land but that still didn't solve the problem at all. There was no hope of him getting back to Trixxy now.</span></div></div>",

She turned her head to see a girl with brown hair tied back in a pony tail staring back at her questioningly. Dressed in a green camo tank top and black cargo pants, Kelly didn't reconize her at first. Then she realized it was the skate guys friend from the fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's foot was down in the soft soil, her toes scrunching in the dirt. Jamie was trying desperately to pull himself along but he wasn't making it much of anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, trying to squish this bug,\" Kelly gestured down to Jamie crawling through the muck of the footprint he was trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixxy raised an eyebrow and looked at the plush blonde girl oddly, \"You're making this much noise over a bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! It's just my thing. Y'know kind of like a game. I'm Kelly,\" She introduced herself, shaking Trixxy's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixxy. So you make a game of this kinda stuff? Usually I just stomp 'em and be done with it. What's so much fun about squishing a bug?\" The punk girl asked looking down at the dirt below, \"What is that, some kind of worm crawling around down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly glanced down to Jamie. Her mind raced trying to come up with some sort of lie so she could get back to squishing the tiny people at her massive bare feet, \"He's, uh, it's a rolley bug. You know, those little ones that curl up into a ball.\" Under her breath Kelly mused that he definitely would curl into a ball even if he was a shrunken human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, those things. I usually leave them alone. They tend to be out on the sidewalk I thought. I dunno, I don't go digging around in gardens much. Hey, is that why you're doing this? Do you work for the park gardening group or something?\" Trixxy asked, noticing that her own feet were in the soft dirt of the soil the bushes around them were planted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind racing Kelly didn't want to comit to anything that would cause any confusion later, \"Oh I just help out when I can. I'm not official or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixxy bent down, her massive body looming over Jamie's tiny frightened form that had flipped over to stare up at his friend that was giantess sized to him, \"So this lil' sucker won't just squish eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning Kelly realized she didn't know where the other two had gone, \"I had three of them, but this is the only one left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the TV remote for?\" Trixxy's words sent a cold shiver down Kelly's spine. She hadn't tucked the remote back in her pocket after she got caught up in shrinking the skateboarders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this thing? It's just something I found. I was going to turn it into the lost and found on my way home,\" Her lies were running thin. Kelly had to change the topic and fast.</span></div></div>",

Hopefully they wouldn't make it to anyone else but the blonde sporty plush girl didn't want to take that chance. That and she'd grown very tired of trying to explain herself to Trixxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hey Trix, two of these bugs seem to have snuck off and my feet seem too soft to finish this guy off, mind helping me out?\" Kelly offered, wanting to just get away from the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixxy wiggled her toes in the dirt and raised her right foot so she could look at the bottom of it, \"I guess these will do the trick. Mine are pretty soft too. It's weird, I do a lot of jobs where I'm standing around all day but they always stay so smushy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well give it a go, will you? See if you can make him go smushy instead,\" Kelly said down to poor Jamie as he looked distraught up at his huge friend Trixxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course down in Kelly's footprint, Jamie was weakly calling out to Trixxy trying to explain that he was a person and more importantly her friend. He couldn't imagine if he was even visible or just covered in so much dirt that he wasn't noticeable as a shrunken human. In his exhaustion the poor tiny goth was about ready to just give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's fine. I've got nothing else to do anyway until my friends get back. I just wanted to see what in the world was bothering you so much,\" Trixxy said as she wandered over and stood above Jamie, her feet sinking slightly into the soft soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'll see if I can find the other two,\" Kelly said as she wandered off towards the grass. She figured if it was her, the last thing she'd want to do is go back to the fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Trixxy was left with her task to do for Kelly and Jamie found himself in a horrible situation at the bare feet of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lil' guy, looks like you shouldn't be playing in the garden here. Kelly doesn't want you ruining anything here so I'm going to have to squash you under my big giant foot,\" Trixxy explained as she placed her hands on her hips and smiled down at Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing he could do. Even if he could do much more than crawl, Kelly's footprint was far too deep and smashed into the earth for him to climb out of in this state. The hole Derek had dug was still there but unlike Derek, Jamie wasn't currently hidden behind Kelly's stomping foot. Instead he was right in Trixxy's plain sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was his only chance. Get there and try to hide so his friend carelessly thinks she did ask Kelly asked. Otherwise he would just have to stare up at his friend and hope for the best that she wouldn't be so cruel and would leave him alone or even better help him. If be some miracle she did help him, he could explain Kelly's intentions and save their friends. That was of course if Trixxy herself didn't end up shrunk herself.</span></div></div>",

Her foot was quite a bit smaller than Kelly's, at least to someone at regular size. Trixxy was a regular sized girl however and Jamie was concerned that her relatively flatter feet may be just what it would take to crush him into the dirt. Kelly's feet were after all quite chubby, especially her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie didn't have time to make his daring escape. All he could do was watch his friend look down at him and think he was a bug. There was no way out of the footprint Kelly had mashed into the soft dirt, and the situation had become completely hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in one quick motion, Trixxy brought her huge foot down upon Jamie and press down. The ball of her foot shoved him to the ground and pushed him deeply into the soil. His back could feel the dirt tightening against the increasing pressure as he saw his friends foot taking over the whole area above him. The soft sole of this punk girl smushed down around his tiny body and Jamie braced for the final squish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Trixxy's foot raised up and Jamie found himself stuck to her sweaty sole for a moment. About ten feet up in the air to his tiny size, his weight pulled him free and he twisted through the air, landing on his face this time. He took three deep breaths, checking over his body mentally and trying to see if anything was broken. Was that it? Just a little pad down and she figured she'd squashed him already? Jamie didn't dare move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the ball of Trixxy's foot was back, pressing down upon Jamie's shoulder blades and squashing his chest down this time into the dirt. He turned his head sideways and hoped he wouldn't be pressed in too far. Just as he was about to be crushed by his friend again, her foot raised up. The soil, turning to sweaty mud from her foot, peeled away as Jamie was raised into the air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flipped over yet again and found himself staring up at Trixxy. He was in a slightly deeper footprint now and gasping for air. Meanwhile his friend had both her feet back on the ground. After a sigh of relief, Trixxy's smile was replaced by the huge sole of her opposite foot drifting over tiny Jamie and plunging down to try to mash him into the dirt this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching him right in the chest with a good thump, Jamie found himself staring up between Trixxy's toes at her grinning face. His tiny hands reached up to the underside of her toes and tries to pound them furiously to get the pressure removed. The dirt behind him wasn't giving way as much any more. Gritting his teeth Jamie prepared for this punishment to continue.</span></div></div>",

The forgotten skateboards, Kelly yelling at things on the ground, and worse off whatever she was trying to squish underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You monster!

Bending down she dug around in the footprint Kelly had made in the dirt until she picked up the tiny thing she was trying to squish. When Trixxy realized it was Jamie laying in the palm of her hand, she couldn't take any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly struggled to find any words to explain herself, \"It's not what you think. This is just an experiment! I needed your friends to help me so I shrunk them down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it Kelly. I came over here and now I find out you were trying to squash my friend into the ground. I don't think there's anything you can say that can make this better.

Otherwise, someone else was on the far side of the garden, next to the greenhouse that sat near the middle of the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadding her soft feet in the squishy mud, Kelly gently bit her lip. Either one of them would be a good start really. The guy working on his bike really didn't deserve anything, but the one near the greenhouse always shoved her around at school. He'd say stuff like, 'the hallway wasnt wide enough to walk by Kelly' and just regular fat jokes like that, only so he could run up and shove her against the wall or nearby locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's what she came here for, so Kelly grabbed her Sandals and wandered toward her target.</span></div></div>",

Sulev in a foreign accent, a young guy with Finnish-Estonian roots and a student at the same high school as Kelly as he was trying to fix his bike. Then he heard footsteps and turned around. It was Kelly. He's never really done any pranks on her, but there was a couple of times that she may not recall as anything nice in particular. He did consider her to be actually quite pretty, even if he wasn't that much into fuller bodied girls. Kelly asks him with a strange glee:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having a little trouble here or what?\" to which Sulev answers \"Little isn't the word here. The bikes chain's finally gave up today and there are a couple of other considerable problems... aww nuts, this requires a pro on this. You wouldn't happen to have a few spare parts for this?\" Sulev asks in a slight sarcastic tone, knowing that its not very likely. It was confirmed by Kelly's moving her head sideways.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of how cute he looks, since she's been having a little bit crush on him during the year he's been in school as an exhange student, she decides to ask one more question, even if it wasn't necessary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, you have got anything to do today?\" Sulev's reply is that he hasn't got anything in particular. But before he could ask why, he gets hit by the ray. Not knowing how, but the word around him and Kelly are starting to get bigger and bigger. Panicking and having a certain tendency, he is known to faint easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo does he do that now or can he remain concious? </span></div></div>",

Moreso, to show that guy that there was a time when he wouldn't be able to squeeze out of Kellys way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering around the side of the garden, the guy fixing his bike didn't even look over as Kelly walked by. She stepped, raising her feet a little extra and landing each step on the ball of her feet as she stumbled along through the taller grass. Her rolled up blue jeans were still above the grass however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly pulled her black tank top over her tummy and marched up to the guy near the greenhouse, remote ready. He was pretty average. Dark hair, some rock band tee shirt and a ripped up pair of jeans. He smirked as he looked down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're up to Colin?\" Kelly asked, jabbing a pudgy finger into his chest and then rocking back and forth on her heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed as her freckled cheeks blushed. \"What? Do you have a crush on me or something? I guess all the times I've shoved you out of my way has just made you hot for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at the crush comment, Kelly let her blushing grow. This was embarassing almost in a way. Standing before someone like this, scrunching her toes in the dry mud, imagining that if this works, he would be under those feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to see if this worked actually. It's just a music remote I have. See you just hold it out and press the keys to play it and,\" The device shook in Kelly's hand as a blast of light hit Colin faster than her finger poked the button. Staring in disbelief, a tiny Colin now stared up from the dirt path that was around the edge of the greenhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around confused, Colin stared for a moment at the huge wiggling toes in front of him. Light blue toenail polish shone brightly in the sun on top of each. Kelly's soft plush sole wrinkled up against the ball of her feet as she scrunched her toes, digging them down into the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin was frozen as she heard Kelly high above, \"Time to get the little bug.\" Surely she didn't mean him, he thought. But suddenly Kelly's huge bare right foot swung forward and started petting at Colin. His hands reached up to block against the descending plush sole of this giant fat girl, but her foot only forced him down forward to the ground. Rubbing him around a bit against the mud on his stomach, Kelly's dirty, grass stained foot toyed with him. Like a cat batting at a bug it had found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to just squish him. After all, he always shoved her around. Kelly rolled him over and began moving her foot around, grinding her wrinkled sole around on his tiny frame. The damp and slightly sweaty skin above him was impossible to grab on to, or force away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly started to raise her foot and pad it down against Colin, tugging him along his back toward her. He could only stare up in disbelief, seeing the freckled face of this huge giggling giantess, enjoying his torment under her muddy feet. Then all was blocked out by the soft moist surface of her bare foot above him as it pressed down firmly and drug him through the dirt closer to being under her massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling was doing him no good, but Colin didn't give up. Suddenly, Kelly kicked him toward her other foot a bit. Nudging him along through the mud she took little steps inward until he was pinned under both her low arches. The rolled up cuffs of her blue jeans bounced around her upper calves as he occasionally saw up along her smooth ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly continued to take little steps and pet at Colin with her bare feet. Finally when he gave up struggling she began to grind the arch of her toes into him and finally pressed down with all her weight again and again, mushing him into the damp earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her heart beating hard and her body slightly shaking from the rush going through her, Kelly wiggled her toes again. He was under there. Under her bare feet, so much bigger than him. Pressed into the ground under her gently increasing weight. Her hands were shaking too, holding her sandals lightly with her fingers, remote still in her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" Kelly began to herself, \"felt incredible.\"</span></div></div>",

As Kelly put her weight down onto that sandal, her foot sinking slightly into the spongy insole, tiny pebbles popped under her incredible weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what to my wandering eyes did appear,\" Kelly began in a mocking voice, \"but some girl squishing a man, and you're next dear.\" Her evil smile played across her lips as she took deliberate stomps toward Ray.

She drank in the growing fear in him as her sandal slapped against her foot with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally and casually, Kelly pinned him flat out under her right sandal. The solid surface against the brick ground was incredibly uncomfortable. The dusty scent of well worn rubber surrounded the tiny man as he grabbed at the ridges in the slightly damp sandals sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a crunch, Kelly pushed down with a cruel grin.

Congrats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy looked up, the massive sole moved over his body, like a ship flying through the air. The ridged surface was smeared with something new that he couldn't make out in the shadows. That was before the sky that was Kelly's flip flop fell upon him, smushing him flat.</span></div></div>",

Bending down ever so slightly a few locks of her blonde hair dropped into her freckled face as she gazed down at the bottom of her sandal. Blood spots covered the rough ridges of the sole, tiny limbs stuck deep into the grove looking more like specks of dirt than anything else. Letting her large round slightly doughy foot collide into the ground , the sole pushed out crushing the soft material of the sandal top flat as it contoured to Kelly\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026I won\u2019t even look for that last bug\u2026I can go squash so many more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomping off, Kelly\u2019s plush rolls escaped from the bottom of her form fitting shirt and pulling it down as she walked she didn\u2019t even take notice to her foot falling down to cover up the hole the last somewhat un-buzzed stoner had crawled into. He whimpered slightly as the heavy weight crashed down but stopped before it reached his body and he saw the massive form of Kelly waltz off as he slowly pulled himself up from the hole. He gulped deeply his world still in a gentle mix of swirls and colors and looked back to where his friends had run off to. Nothing was left\u2026save for a few blood speckles and a crushed lump of flesh and bone. Turning away from the ending spot of his former friends, The last stoner turned to look at the giant world before him. Little did he notice, the black clad girl walking towards him, her long purple mane of hair swaying with each of her massive steps the liner under her eyes done in small sharp curves around the pale plush of her cheeks and her form almost fatty.  The large black solid base sole of her boot loomed over the tiny man only for a second. Engulfing him in a shadow before the thick rubber material busted his body open, spewing organs and blood and a mixture of bone and muscle onto the ground. As she took another step unaware of the life that had just ended under her last foot fall tiny bits and pieces of the last stoner remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly came to the baseball diamond with a smirk as she held the remote tightly in her hand. She was idly playing with the dial upon the remote as she walked into the small rusted gate to the few kids playing out on the diamond. Her sandals made small dust puffs with each step, leaving a basic form of her sandal in each step. Walking up to the pitcher, he wore a simple white T-shirt with a black baseball cap and faded jeans. He stopped in mid-action of pulling his arm back as Kelly came closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey! You can\u2019t be standing that close unless you\u2019re going to play\u2026and from the looks of things..you couldn\u2019t if you wanted to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other kids out in the field heard the taunt and laughed to each other as they came in closer. As the small group of children gathered around their \u2018leader\u2019 Kelly smiled again without a word and charged up her \u2018trigger\u2019 finger. Then, lifting the remote up quickly she aimed and shot. However this time a new type of bolt came out, this one being of a high hue red. Shocking over and over again, the entire team of\u2026little rascals  stood before Kelly\u2019s feet and she loomed over them, looking down she put her thick hands on her plush hips pulling her shirt down with her index and thumb\u2019s at the same time. Then she spoke, her voice bellowing over the tiny crowd now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,Well\u2026if it isn\u2019t the little league team\u2026hmmm, seems your chances of winning this year are pretty\u2026small..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kelly cocked her head to the side and licked her bottom lip looking down\u2026from toying with the dial she had got a new effect on shrinking people\u2026shrinking them even more! The entire team now stood before her left sandal each \u2018dot\u2019  coming in at less than 1/8th of an inch. Kelly shook her head back and forth with how easy it would be to squash people now. Yet she wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to try something new now. Tapping her foot and causing a swirl of dust to her was a massive sand storm to the people at her foot as they tried to run covering little to no area to Kelly\u2019s eye. Then she poked her bottom lip a few times before nodding down at the little bugs below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea! I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

She lifted up her massive sandal clad foot, the white foam base going back to it\u2019s normal shape as the heavy weight was lifted. The roughed up sole of the shoe loomed over the entire team of children before they all spread out running as fast as their tiny legs would take them to get away from the lowering foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then, as Kelly\u2019s foot made contract with the ground she lifted her chubby heel up and twisted back and forth making small dunes of sand to each side of her twisting. One of the kids had just made it out from under the falling sandal and as the air was pushed out from under Kelly\u2019s forceful foot, he was swept up in the air current and landed on her big toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nail itself seemed like a large city block and looking up to the mecha of Kelly above him, he felt his legs go into shock. Unable to move himself he was rolled off the toenail as Kelly moved her toes lightly with each twisting motion. Falling towards the crotch of Kelly\u2019s toes, he was wedged in deeply between her massive toes and the skin consumed him. As his large deep colored afro was taking into the flesh his hands twitched a few times as if clawing at air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was unaware of the kid caught between her toes and wiggling them gently she could have sworn she felt a tiny bit of moisture. Shrugging it off, She removed her foot from the former baseball team to reveal a small crater in the ground with  a bunch of tiny red marks all over it. With a nod, Kelly toyed at her remote again. Maybe if she messed with it long enough on the other end of the reader\u2026she could make herself grow!!! Heading out of the Baseball diamond, Kelly saw many more people she hated from school that she could shrink down and crush\u2026but then she caught sight of a traveling hot-dog stand and her stomach seemed to growl on cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting her pudgy tummy lightly and looking to the few people walking back and forth Kelly lifted her free hand up to her smooth chin as she rubbed it back and forth, her foot tapping up and down crushing the remains of people even moreso under it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reaching towards the pocket which the shrinking remote what held in, Kelly patted it lightly and looking to small group of Goths and Punks hanging around near the front of the weenie cart, Kelly walked over slowly, twisting her foot out with each step grinding the remains on the bottom of her foot to nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Stepping up to the group, one of them stopped talking and slowly the rest stopped and looked to Kelly as she stood at the head of the pack with a cheap looking remote in hand, one of the Goths stepped forward. Glad in all black with some emo band t-shirt on and spiked black hair with blond tips. He licked his bottom lip stuffing his hands into his overly baggy pants and cocked his head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we help you porker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly sighed lightly as if she was hurt and without another word she let the shrinking remote go off quickly, the flashes unseen by any other eyes than hers and the now shrunken Goth group. Looking down to the add of her meal, She bent down on her pudgy knees and let her elbows rest on them. Tucking the remote away, her plush hand reached forward to the screaming Goth group and plucked them all up in her somewhat sweaty soft palm. Standing back to her full height, it seemed like to the goth group miles and miles high and they all had trouble standing on such a soft surface that gave away to every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Looks like you guys will be enough for a single hot-dog\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly snickered to herself and then licked her bottom lip looking down to the shrunken Goths.  Putting them down to her side, She went to the front of the weenie cart and ordered up one large hot-dog. Holding it in her hand she put a single trail of ketchup down the center of the dog and waltzed over to a bench off to the side behind a few tall bushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she held the Goths in one hand and her food in the other, Kelly looked down to them all and then made sure they made eye contact with the hot-dog. Screaming and running in random directions in hopes of escaping one was so bold as to jump from Kelly\u2019s palm. Landing on the bench with a solid thud to his ears he felt his legs give out and shatter under him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling onto his back in pain, he had time to watch the tight blue fabric on Kelly\u2019s rear fall towards him. As the pressure hit his body, he felt the bench give under him slightly before it was once more solid warm and his body expanded. His chest caved and he took a final breath out as he was turned to a speck of red on Kelly\u2019s behind. She wiggled her behind lightly getting into the bench and then held up the Goths and flipped her hand onto the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tumbled down quickly and soon became engulfed in the red heavy substance of the ketchup.  Coughing and spitting it out they looked up to find Kelly\u2019s mouth growing closer and closer, the deep hole In the back of her throat seeming to widen at the thought of the food coming into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen taking a huge chomp out of the front of the hot-dog. Many of the Goths were taken into Kelly\u2019s mouth. Being tossed around easily with the food, a few of them were smashed to red smears by Kelly\u2019s mountain sized molars while others were swallowed down with the moist lump of food. Finishing up her hot-dog quickly, Kelly burped lightly holding her hand over her lips and giggling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026I just need to find something to wash it down with\u2026.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Struggling through the grass they began to frantically search for their friend, unheard to Kelly, calling for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, comon man! This chicks mad at us. I think she like think's we're bugs or something. I don't know what her problem is!\" One rambled on as his friend ran by and kept falling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the confused, and basically ant sized stoners found their friend and dragged him out of the tunnel he was hiding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring down Kelly frowned, \"Now then. What do you two think I should do with your friend?\" She was laughing inside because she knew with how out of it they were, they'd do anything. \"How about this, you two hold him down and I'll squish him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot thinking, the two stoners who hadn't hid grabbed their friends arms and held him down in the middle of a clear spot. This was working out so great, they really would do anything she said. This could be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly slowly slid her right foot out of her flip flop. Holding it in the air for a second she wiggled her soft toes to get the dusty dirt out of them. The guys below ducked back as her giant bare foot landed with a thud on the ground before them, the soft sole squishing out gently under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold him tightly now. My big toe will get you if you get under it,\" Kelly remarked as she tilted her head to one side, blonde hair falling down the side of her beautiful freckled cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly raised her eager big toe over her prey, positioning the dusty textured toe over the pinned tiny stoner. The two others cringed at the scent but stayed still. Her soft dirty sole wrinkled as she flexed it, positioning her foot up on her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she lowered her foot down until her toe rested upon the struggling stoner that had run into the tunnel. Her eager toe wiggled as her arched foot brought it down and smushed the little guy under it, causing the two others to fall back in surprise as it hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinding her toe around in the dusty spot they'd drug their friend to, Kelly did her best to wipe off her toe before she slipped her flip flop back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you want to live, get running. Otherwise you'll get caught under my old flip flops. I'm sorry but this is too much fun. Don't you like them?\" She tipped her one flip flop on it's side. \"I love these. Wear them all around, and definately enjoy when I find something to get under them. Like you two! It's been fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began to run as Kelly took tiny steps forward, pressing the grass down as she moved on toward the fleeing stoners. Quickly the walls of white rubber caught up to one and he was mushed down as Kelly trod over the area she had toed their friend. Finally, she laughed and stamped the other one out with a quick stomp of her left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun, now, what else can I do?\" Kelly asked herself, looking up from her smushed playthings.</span></div></div>",

Kelly wasn't listening as her mouth opened him. He got a good look at the pearly whites that were about to chew him into pieces.....and they did. Each bite was an agonizing hell.

He screamed and screamed as blood poured profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm, I got ketchup too!\" she said with a grin, as she continued to casually bite into him.

He was pressed down into the damp ground. She twisted as she let her weight drop on that foot and continued after their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the ground the other guy cringed at the huge sandled foot that stood before him. Looking up he saw Kelly's smooth leg, stretching up into her rolled up jeans showing off her calves that were questionably more muscle than fat from supporting her 300 pounds or so. His eyes fell to her dirty foot, twisting against the surface of the white sandle. Her foot hit the shiney red strap of the sandle and a gritty grinding sound told the stoner that his friend probably wasnt going to be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds were ticking by, his confused mind realized. If he was going to do something, now was the time.</span></div></div>",

It didn't occur to him to dive off into the bushes and plants at the side of the walkway, he just continued on the path before the both of them. Kelly just assumed he feared that she'd just squash him the moment he tried to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed high above, \"Is that all you've got? You're barely making it over one brick in the pathway without taking several steps. That and you need to stop stumbling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft plap Kelly took a step forward, her huge plush sole gushing out slightly under her weight.

This time holding her foot in the air and wiggling her toes to wrinkle her sole and intimidate her prey. It worked as the guy glanced back over his shoulder and saw exactly what would step upon him if he didn't get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trouble was though, he was running, as fast as he could. Completely exhausted and in a daze he kept stumbling forward and hoping for the best.

Maybe that would finally get you moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem to phase Kelly that the tiny guy could actually be trying his hardest. Finally he gave up and just fell down on the ground on his chest. Trying desperately to catch his breath he watched as Kelly's shadow stretched further beyond him as she wandered closer to his tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make it easy on you little guy. Flip over if you want me to just step on you and get this over now, or lay there and try to crawl away and I'll eat you all up!\" Kelly happily announced to the small punk at her feet.</span></div></div>",

It was like the world's softest pillow, only the size of a house, and getting heavier. She padded her foot on him a few times for good measure, then took the weight off her other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH! In one second, the punk died from the unbearable weight.

If her foot wasn't so plush, Marie would have likely died from this torture after the first step. But if she saved others from undergoing the same experience, she could deal with Kelly's massive body as long as it takes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly yawned as she entered the room where her friends were all asleep. Catherine was on her side, snoring lightly, Sally was on her back, and looked like she was worried if she wasn't asleep. But Marie was gone... oh well. She might have just gone to the bathroom, but she did have to leave in the middle of the night before for reasons she wouldn't tell. Kelly was too tired to worry about it anyway. She crawled under her warm blanket snuggled it, but remembered that she was still wearing her fluffy slippers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
