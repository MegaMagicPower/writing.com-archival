Does everyone understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss Appletree!\" Replied the students as they disembarked from the bus into the factory doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside all the young children were in awe of just how big the factory was with dozens upon dozens of delicious types of candy bars,gummi bears,bubblegum,lollipops and of course chocolate in every size and description!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung Robyn of course was also in total awe as she had never seen so mhch candy in all her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Look at all this candy! It's even more than what Aunt Figg stores in her refrigerator back home!\"  It was then she noticed several pieces of candy set apart from all the rest marked as 'Testing Products Please Do Not Touch' but incredibly curious and despite her delicate,normally sweet-hearted nature,the eight year old blond decided to secretly take a piece of what looked like a small blueberry and snuck in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what will occur next? </span></div></div>",

B-but I really shouldn't eat it,Miss Appletree did tell us not to touch anything but...I...can't...resist.....\" As unable to help herself,the 8 year old slowly opened her mouth and dropped the candy into it,swishing it around for a bit,greatly enjoying the sweet,sugary almost heavenly flavor before sending it down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm delicious!\" The little girl moaned out loud rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was perhaps one of the most delicious pieces of candy I ever tasted! But I better get back with my classmates before they notice I'm miss..... HUH?\" She stopped midway as she noticed her cute little button of a nose,it was turning darker at first she thought it was merely her imagination but no,her nose was really turning darker and darker in terms of the shade blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Huh? M-my nose...what's happening to it?\" Robyn cried out loud as she felt it as it still felt surprisingly normal but what was going on? Then she remembered the warning on that particular table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it must have been that particular type of candy...it made me...Huh? N-NOW WHAT??\" She cried as it suddenly felt like her body or her stomach was starting to feel bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl looked down amazed as her belly contained by her traditional red shirt was slowly getting bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh....OH NO!!\" She cried. \"P-Please HELP.....\" But no one was able to hear the little girl who was surprisingly turning bright blue,from her head,to her blonde hair which was turning dark blue to her constantly swelling belly getting larger and larger and that wasn't the only thing that was alarming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it felt like there was tons of liquid like some type of juice was literally swishing around in her tummy! As Robyn tried moving around but found it difficult as she was getting fatter and fatter by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhh PLEASE HELP ME!! I-I'M GETTING FAT- NO Wait....\" As she remembered the strange piece of candy,her increasingly blue colorful body then it slowly dawned on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'M TURNING INTO A B-BLUEBERRY!! Pl.....\" Robyn screamed frantically as she was virtually unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-MISS STARLING? Robyn? M-My Word? What have you done to yourself?\" As trembling she as much as she could,she turned to see everyone,all her fellow classmates,her teacher and the main tour guide staring wide-eyed at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-Oh!\" Was all the young girl could say.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now? </span></div></div>",

Funny doesn't seem to be that big of a deal to me! It's just a old jar!\" Robyn muttered as she sought to toss away the glass jar,something caught her attention and she took a glance at the piece of paper that came with the bottle and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning,this bottle is rumored to contain a ancient and mystical curse to whoever opens it will be subjected to the indescribable horror within. OPEN AT YOUR OWN RISK!\" As the young girl giggled out loud thinking who would write such a silly notion on a dusty old bottle,she may have been only eight years old,but Robyn was incredibly wise and intelligence for her youthful age,she knew a joke when she saw one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was Daddy thinking? Buying something as simple as a dirty old bottle? A ancient curse? Yeah like I'll believe that....\" As she dropped the bottle to the ground and got ready to get started on her homework but soon picked up the bottle again,her curiosity overtaking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still I wonder if there really is something magical or ancient in this thing? Hmmmm couldn't hurt to take a quick peek!\" As Robyn hesitated briefly before unscrewing the cork and opening the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm nothing's happening! There's no such thing as curses! I knew it,this was simply a trick or hoax!\" She shrugged as she looked inside but saw absolutely nothing but invisible air then tossed the bottle aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy was wasting his time and money buying this thing for me. I better finish my book report.\" As she returned to her schoolwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day wore on,Robyn kept staring at the bottle now on her dresser,watching for any signs of some mystical,ancient curse but nothing out of the ordinary happened whatsoever and sighing as once her father returned home and tuckered her into bed,Robyn fell asleep immediately not suspecting once she fell into a deep sleep,a bright purple colored fog started to emerge from the bottle and like a puff of smoke,it circled around the small bedroom and whirled like mist,pausing briefly before entering right into the eight year old blonde girl snoring away logs,Robyn of course was totally oblivious to all of this or the bizarre transformation happening to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time morning arrived and she got out of bed Robyn upon entering into the only bathroom she and her father shared together,quickly let out a loud gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! W-What is That?\" She screamed staring at what would normally be her reflection but was now a bright green creature with her facial features staring back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what happened to me! W-What......\" She gasped when she saw she no longer had feet,only a ghostly tail and was literally hovering above the ground,at least five feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What Am I? A-A Monster!\" Robyn shrieked luckily her father still asleep couldn't hear a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...No wait I-I'm a ghost? No that can't be right! Ghosts are transparent and invisible,a dragon? No that can't be right either! Ohh how I wish I had a book to find out what kind of creature I have become!\" And as she said this,a book appeared surprisingly out of thin air as the girl stared flabbergasted at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How did I do that? All I said was 'I wish' Wait...A Wish....T-That's it I'm somehow become a genie!\" Robyn cried out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now to our mystical  transformed heroine? </span></div></div>",
