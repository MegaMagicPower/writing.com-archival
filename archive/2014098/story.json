When Adam touched it, it transformed into energy and was absorbed into his body. The little toddler immediately began growing, stopping at 500 feet tall! He now wore a red shirt with a golden emblem similar to Superman's emblem, but with an \"A\" instead of an \"S\", on the chest. He also wore a glowing golden diaper covered with 8-pointed stars and a golden cape. Adam's toddler mind somehow knew that he now had incredible powers. He decided to....</span></div></div>",

He crushed buildings, cars and people beneath his feet or diaper. It took him a couple minutes to reduce the town to smoldering rubble. As he sat amongst the rubble, he saw Chicago off in the distance. He thought that he destroyed the small town too quickly. He thought that Chicago would last longer if he was smaller. So he closed his eyes and shrunk himself to 200 ft. tall. He smiled and started walking over to an unsuspecting Chicago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people in the city could feel the ground shaking, but they didn\u2019t know what was causing it. Then they saw the smiling face of a giant kid standing over one of the building. It only reached his chin. Most of the people froze with fear. Adam smiled at the little \u2018bugs\u2019. He stepped forward, and smashed through the building. When the people saw that the kid was wearing a diaper, they started running and screaming. Adam just laughed at their futile attempts to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started stomping after them. Each stomp left a footprint in the street with cracks leading out from it. The people could hear the ground cracking. Gradually the people could hear the thumps and cracking as Adam was gaining on them. He lifted his foot up again and brought it down. He trapped several people beneath it. He gradually added pressure until they were squished into pulp beneath him. Adam just laughed at killing a few bugs. He then continued stomping after the remaining people. This time he reached down and started shoving people into his glowing diaper. After several handfuls, 150 people were squirming inside his diaper. He giggled at the tickling sensation of their squirming. After a while their squirming was getting in the way of his fun. He pulled out the front waistband of his diaper, and he yelled, \u201cStop squirming or be squished.\u201d The people complied and just sat in a giant toddler\u2019s diaper. Adam decided that it was time for a rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a waist level building next to him. He set his diapered butt on the roof of the building. He told the people inside to hold on and he sat down. The building creaked and cracked. The weight of a 200 foot toddler was too much and the building exploded into rubble. Adam fell to the ground with the building. There was a loud squish as most of the people in Adam\u2019s diaper were crushed. He giggled at crushing a building beneath his diaper, and crushing people at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and started stomping through building after building. Dozens of people got a glimpse of a giant diaper before it smashed through their building. Adam was just giggling at the fun he was having. The people inside were thrown about inside his diaper, but they survived Adam\u2019s rampage. Adam found another  good-sized building that only reached his knees. He just put his full weight on the building. It hardly put up any resistance. Adam opened the front of his diaper and smiled at the dazed little bugs inside. He asked himself, \u201cWhat should I do with the rest of you.\u201d  The people looked up at the toddler terrified. What does he do with these little \u2018bugs\u2019?</span></div></div>",

Luckily enough he now had the power to make himself grow to any size just by willing it! Soon he started shooting up, growing taller at an intense speed. His entire hometown was swept away by his growing feet as he grew miles upon miles taller. His head shot into the upper atmosphere, but Adam didn't have to care about the lack of oxygen anymore, as he was the most powerful being in the world. Not only was Adam capable of surviving without air, he was also completely invulnerable and invincible, nothing in the whole universe could hurt him even a tiny bit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Adam was so tall he could see the curvature of the Earth. He must have been more than 100 miles tall! As he looked down, everything seemed so tiny, with tiny patches of grey that were cities, a patchwork of fields and forests of green, mountains that looked like small mounds to him and tiny clouds around his ankles. Somewhere down there a passenger jet crashed into his leg, but Adam did not notice such a tiny event - he was too busy grinning from ear to ear in joy as he marveled at his new size. He thought about what to do for his first act in his new playground.</span></div></div>",

When he spotted one, he brought his right foot forward'big, completely blocking out the city from his view, and slowly ground his foot down on top of it. He grinned at how easily a \"big\" city could crumble to dust with no resistance at all. The child couldn't help but laugh when he moved his foot to the side and all that was left was a toddler-sized footprint (except on a much larger scale).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he needed to further prove his authority to these bug-sized people, Adam walked along until he had one of those gray patches in between his legs. Squatting down, the boy let his sagging diaper rest just above the little city, the enormous white fabric destroying the tops of several skyscrapers. Inching forward, the giant tot giggled again before falling back onto his butt and flattening an entire city beneath him. Pressing his weight further down, he wanted to make sure that nothing was left of this town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up, he brushed off his backside and contemplated his next move...</span></div></div>",

Adam made himself grow again, growing much faster than before, so that he soon left the Earth behind. He only stopped as the planet became the size of a toy ball to him. He grabbed it with both hands, spreading much destruction across its surface. He gazed intently at the small world in his hands. With his powers, he could easily lock his eyes into one spot and \"zoom\" in on it, seeing even the microscopic people on it clearly. Not only that, his ears could pick up sounds from anywhere on the planet, and with a bit of trying Adam found he could also read the minds of anyone he wanted! He was truely godlike. Adam tossed the planet upwards like the ball it was to him, and as the laws of physics obeyed Adam's whims now, it fell back down as if under normal gravity. Tossing the planet a few times like this, Adam caused quite a bit of damage to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, Adam got a bit bored and decided to grow some more until the Earth was the size of a marble to him. He then used his big chubby toes to \"massage\" the planet, accidentally crushing what was left of it into tiny pieces. \"Whoops!\" Adam thought. \"Well, it's no biggie. I can fix it easily!\" Indeed, with a single thought from the godlike kid, the Earth was fully restored, all damage to it undone and even everyone and everything that had previously died being revived. Then Adam thought: \"I wonder what it tastes like?\" He took the restored Earth and put it into his mouth. However, it didn't taste too good as he soon spat what remained of it out. He decided to make the Earth taste better. He recreated it, but this time he turned the whole thing into one giant candy! This time it tasted great! He munched on the candy-Earth a bit before swallowing it. This whole thing made Adam realize that with how powerful he was he could have as much candy as he wanted at any time! So he created multiple copies of Earth, all made of candy, and started eating them. After eating himself full enough on candy planets, he recreated the Earth once more and pondered his next choice.</span></div></div>",

I'm Adam, I'm only 2 but I have the power to do whatever I want! I'll crush anyone who doesn't worship me and obey me! I can see everything and hear everything, so I'll know!\" To his delight, he observed most of the Earth's population kneeling down and starting to fearfully pray his name, begging him to not crush them. But there were some who chose to be disobedient towards the mighty baby god. Two of special note were Adam's own mother and Peter, a 3-year-old from the neighborhood who used to bully Adam with his bigger size. But now Adam was the biggest and most powerful being in existence! With his omniscient hearing Adam could hear his mother trying to order her son to shrink back down and stop his shenanigans. She thought she still had power over Adam, but now Adam had power over everything! Adam teleported his ranting mom atop his index finger, her being lost amongst the mere grooves in his skin. \"I could crush you so easy but I have a different idea\" Adam told his microscopic mom before licking his finger with his huge tongue, lapping up his mom and eventually sending her sliding down into Adam's stomach even if at her microbial size it didn't really feel like anything to Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam then turned his attention to his despised bully, Peter. Peter refused to submit to Adam and instead yelled insults at him, angering the young god. He decided to give Peter a special punishment and teleported him straight inside the front side of his diaper. Adam then let it go and started peeing into his divinely powered diaper, drowning Peter in his hot piss in pretty much an instant. Nevertheless Adam kept peeing into his diaper, as he quite enjoyed the feeling. After he stopped peeing, the warm feeling of fresh pee lingered for a while before his godly diaper started cleaning itself, making the pee slowly vanish. For the rest of humanity who had dared to disobey him Adam had a more mundane fate in store. He lifted up his cute bare foot and teleported every human on the planet who hadn't worshiped him underneath it, before bringing his foot down, instantly crushing all the disobedient people underneath. Adam laughed and reveled in the worship he was receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Adam wanted to...</span></div></div>",

When he was still a normal kid he used to play by peeing on bugs in the back yard and watching them squirm in his pee. But now he was a 120-mile-tall god-kid, so he didn't have to settle with peeing on insects. Nor did he even need to drink to pee, he could just pee whenever he wanted! He untaped his magical diaper, dropping it down to his legs and unknowingly crushing a few towns underneath it as it fell. He laughed as he aimed his little baby penis, now larger than entire cities due to his immense size, down at the little gray blotches below he knew were big cities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam felt the pleasurable feeling of release as he started peeing, his golden pee flying in a long arc and hitting the first city dead-on. Adam gleefully observed with his super eyesight as his innocuous act of release completely flooded and destroyed the city, crushing and washing away skyscrapers like dust particles underneath his pee steam, and drowning countless people. He only had to pee a little before that entire city turned into a golden yellow piss puddle, so he turned to pee on other cities, drowning and crushing several more with nothing but his pee. Almost a dozen piss puddles soon formed, each formerly a city, slowly leaking out and contaminating whatever water supplies they got in contact with. Adam stopped peeing, satisfied with his work for now. He then picked up his magical diaper and taped it back on around his waist. Just because he liked the pleasurable feeling of release he got when peeing, he peed a lot more in his diaper, making it nice, wet and warm for a while before the diaper dutifully cleaned itself before Adam's pee could get cold in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Adam decided to...</span></div></div>",

A mischievous grin rose to his face as he recalled his dream, crushing everything under his feet. He decided to turn it into reality and started walking towards the city center, uncaringly crushing cars, houses and people in the suburbs as he went. In fact, he enjoyed the feeling of all the tiny fragile things going crunch underneath his gigantic bare feet. Numerous tiny screams were heard from below, but they were merely the peepings of mice to Jack the god-like 5-year-old. As Jack soon came to the central district, where all the tall buildings were, he was grinning from ear to ear in excitement. He looked down, and witnessed a screaming, panicking mob of tiny people in front of him. Jack raised his foot above the crowd and stomped right on top of it, crushing hundreds of people into paste in one step. He then turned his attention to the surrounding buildings and started destroying them as well with impunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his dreams Jack was not only gigantic but totally invincible, his skin not so much as tickled by anything he faced, and he found that that part of his dream was translated into reality as well. He could place his giant bare feet on anything, and his foot would crush it flat and come out merely stained by the blood of tiny people. Jack laughed as he stepped on buildings, making them crumble like sandcastles under his feet. For the taller buildings, he chose to kick them or simply tear them apart with his hands, amazed at how fragile they were to him. He played with some of the buildings by kneeling down to peer in through their windows, terrifying the tiny people inside, before smashing his hand trough the building and grabbing a whole bunch of tinies. He then poured the tinies in his mouth and ate them in one gulp, serving as his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack is enjoying destroying the city, something catches his attention.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From a very young age, Ryan knew he was not like the other children. His parents freaked when they saw him move vertically as a toddler, even more so when he began flying through walls or turning invisible. The concept of gravity was difficult for Ryan to understand, partly since he was completely unaffected by it, and partly since his telekinesis meant he could make anything float anyway. But being a fundamentally good-natured boy, he learnt to copy his parents and walk with his feet touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne wouldn't have guessed from his cute little smile that Ryan had powers beyond human imagination. He looked like just about any other boy - short brown hair, blue eyes and so on. He typically dressed in simple t-shirts and shorts, often whatever his parents could find in his size at the thrift shop. If anything gave him away, it was that he was a little taller than his peers and had some very faint outlines of his super-strong muscles visible, although his skin also retained its softness. Of course, if Ryan ever did want to flex his muscles people would stand back in shock, but as it stood he simply appeared sweet, cute and happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time Ryan's parents lived in a small townhouse, in a middle class suburb. His mother fell ill often, given the stresses involved in raising a boy who seemed to possess limitless power. Her family were religious nuts who would have been convinced Ryan was some kind of demon. His dad was forced to return to work to provide for the family. Ryan was always helping out around the house, but often he unintentionally caused more trouble than he intended due to his childish naivity and incredible array of powers. For example, when he volunteered to water a pot plant, the torrent of water he blasted was strong enough to instantly kill the plant, damage the wall on the other side, and flood nearly the whole house in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the pesky question of why Ryan had these supernatural powers in the first place. His parents literally consulted comic books on parenting advice, since nobody had raised a superhero before. As far as everyone else was concerned, superheroes didn't exist. Of course they hid him from the outside world, partly to protect him from what the others might think, but also to protect the rest of the world from what Ryan could do. Nobody seemed to know or understand why Ryan had these God-like powers, and sometimes that made Ryan feel sad, like an outcast. In truth, that was because nobody actually did know. Sometimes Ryan would read the minds of people around him for clues, but it was futile - there was no explanation, he simply had powers and that was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually his parents decided to send him to preschool. They kept warning him all week not to use his powers in preschool, and of course, Ryan promised he wouldn't. Within only an hour of his arriving, however, a little girl knocked over a tower of blocks Ryan had built and laughed at Ryan about it. Immediately the poor girl suffered third-degree burns from Ryan's laser vision in a barely-controlled fit of rage. Luckily, Ryan managed to stop himself and use his healing powers to heal the girl before any of the caregivers could see what happened, but the girl cried and told everyone. The center staff thought she had too much of an imagination, but of course Ryan's parents were furious when they heard. All the students, too, became very afraid of Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the first and last time Ryan was allowed to go to kindy. Since then he'd done lots of work to control his emotions, seem like he was obeying the laws of physics, and just behave like a normal kid. His parents, fearful of any scrutiny, moved to a small secluded block in a rural town of less than a hundred people. A single school served the community, with teenagers commuting to a nearby larger town. The whole place was dull, but it was a much more appropriate environment for raising a boy with super-powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time Ryan did become more and more helpful. When his father needed to fix the car, Ryan would lift it up for him, for example. He still struggled with some basic concepts such as the difference between \"heavy\" and \"light\", since nothing was heavy for him, but he was learning as well as he could. His parents also learned Ryan had a fun, playful side to him. On Halloween he'd turn into a ghost, possessing things and making spooky noises, for example. He'd also make his parents breakfast in bed every morning - working at super-speed it only took him a blink of an eye. On the whole, his parents thought that he was a handful, but they were lucky that he was earnestly trying to make the best of his powers for good. They even read him comic stories sometimes as he went to bed. Ryan enjoyed the stories, but his biggest wish was to just be a normal boy so he could play with others his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Ryan turned six. Deciding they couldn't homeschool him, and that both of them were incredibly burnt out after taking care of such a unique boy for six years, his parents reluctantly enrolled him in a local school. Ryan was extremely happy at the news, cheering excitedly. After more stern warnings from his parents, he sincerely swore never to use his powers at school, no matter what happened. He also promised to act exactly like a normal child while around other people - even pretending to fall or be hurt, if necessary. Ryan did his best. His parents were worried because apparently acting wasn't among Ryan's super-powers, but after a few weeks of practice he had the basics down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan's sixth birthday, which was on the weekend before he was due to begin school, was attended by his soon-to-be teacher, Mrs Rogers. She got him his own schoolbag, and helped his parents with the other equipment he needed for school. She told him how good it was that he was excited to start learning, which made Ryan very happy. He had a big chocolate cake with \"Congratulations\" iced on to it, and spent most of the rest of the day playing with the superhero action figures his dad got him. Both of his parents were happy that while Mrs Rodgers was there, he didn't make the figures come to life with his telekinesis or something. He was even running at the speed of a normal kid, stomping down on the ground appropriately as he did so, while holding up the figures and making wooshing sounds. Where most parents would have been upset at the boy running indoors, Ryan's parents both praised him for it afterwards. He was well on his way to learning how to act like a regular kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the morning of his first day in school, Ryan got up before dawn. Excitedly he had himself ready and packed some hours before he actually had to go. He was feeling a little nervous about meeting the other kids his age and making some friends. But would he be able to control himself and his powers?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before he knew it, Ryan was hanging up his red schoolbag in the back of the classroom on a coat-hanger with his name above it. His mother had walked with him to school. She was almost as nervous as Ryan was, hoping not to see a repeat of what had happened in preschool. Thankfully, Ryan was on his best behavior, smiling and looking curiously around his colorful new classroom with his cute blue eyes. His mother gave him a kiss goodbye before leaving the young superhuman boy in the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had she left the door than she heard a crash behind her. Immediately she dashed back into the class, afraid Ryan had done something terrible again. Instead, she saw two boys playing with monster trucks on the ground, smashing them against each other. Ryan was watching them with curiosity, but he wasn't involved in their game. Relieved, his mother left the room and went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" said Ryan shyly, walking over to the two boys \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"We're playing monster trucks\" said one of the boys \"I'm Alex, and this is Henry. Want to join in?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure\" said Ryan, practically leaping to the floor before picking up a large blue truck toy and rolling it along the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan, Alex and Henry had lots of fun driving around their cars and crashing them into things. They told little stories with their trucks and imagined they were real truck drivers. Ryan secretly hoped that when he grew up, he would have a normal job like being a monster truck driver, not having to give away his identity with his divine powers. He was having fun just playing around with the other boys like a normal kid. Alex and Henry had no idea that this new kid was himself well over a billion, billion, billion times stronger, faster and more powerful than any monster truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the school bell rang, spooking Ryan, although he managed to stop himself from immediately destroying the school's bell system. Alex and Henry groaned. \"That means we have to pack up and go sit over there\" he explained. Ryan nodded and helped the boys pack away the toys, before sitting down with all the other students. When put side-by-side with the others, Ryan's slightly larger, lightly muscular body was somewhat more apparent. He slumped down his shoulders and leaned back a bit to blend in more with the other students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Rodgers took her seat at the front of the class. After greeting everyone, she introduced Ryan as the newest member of the class. Everyone turned around and stared at him. Now Ryan had to seriously resist his natural instinct to turn invisible - he didn't like being the center of attention. He just wanted to be normal, like everyone else. Of course, as the new student, this would be impossible even if he wasn't the most powerful kid in the universe. Seeing the embarrassment Ryan was facing, Mrs Rodgers quickly changed the subject, getting the class started on practicing writing their letters instead. Ryan was more than a little annoyed with himself - the school day had barely begun and already he'd struggled to avoid using his powers several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt morning break, Ryan sat with the rest of his class beside the school playground. His mum had packed him some cheese sandwiches - Ryan would tear off a bite with his perfect white teeth, then use his heat breath to secretly turn it into a toasted sandwich in his mouth. The only evidence was a faint whisp of smoke from Ryan's nostrils every time he did it, but he was mostly left on his own while eating so there was no chance of getting caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after Ryan had finished his sandwiches and put away his lunchbox, Alex and Henry came over to him. \"Hey, what was your name again?\" asked Alex.<br>\r\n\"I'm Ryan\" said Ryan, grinning shyly.<br>\r\n\"We're just about to play ball tag on the playground\" said Alex \"Want to join us?\"<br>\r\nRyan's face lit up with enthusiasm. \"Yeah!\" he cheered.<br>\r\n\"Alright, you're in!\" chuckled Alex, before tossing a tennis ball at Ryan. Immediately Alex and Henry ran off onto the playground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan let them run off for a moment before softly throwing the tennis ball. Without really thinking about it, Ryan made the ball coast through the air like a homing missile, hitting Henry as he was trying to climb up a slide. The ball hit him so hard that Henry actually fell off the side of the slide, which surprised Ryan as he had tried to throw the ball \"softly\" ... but luckily a moment later, Henry got up to show he wasn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, great throw!\" called Alex.<br>\r\n\"I'll get you for that!\" said Henry.<br>\r\nRyan smirked. \"You can't catch me!\" he said, running off to some monkey bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Ryan was doing his very best to conceal his unbounded athletic talent, it didn't take Alex and Henry long to figure out that they were no match for Ryan. Every ball Henry threw at Ryan seemed to miss, and besides that Ryan was incredibly fast, strong and nimble for a kid. After a while Ryan would purposefully stand in the way of Henry's throws so that he'd have a turn being in sometimes, and deliberately miss a few of his throws. But even then, his natural strength and precision was impossible to ignore - even when he was missing a shot, it was somehow obvious it was deliberate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you get so good at this game?\" asked Alex, lying on the ground panting with exhaustion.<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" lied Ryan. But Ryan wasn't a very good liar, and both Alex and Henry knew there was more to him than met the eye. Ryan was worried they wouldn't want to play with him anymore.<br>\r\n\"We should play again at lunch\" suggested Alex \"That was the most intense game I've played in a while.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said Henry \"And it's so much better when I'm not being annoyed by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, somebody snatched the tennis ball out of Alex's hand. The figure stood above them imposingly, silhouetted against the sun.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I spoke too soon\" gulped Henry.<br>\r\n\"Well well well, if it isn't my little cousin\" said the big figure. Ryan guessed he must have been at least four years older.<br>\r\n\"Give me my ball back!\" demanded Alex, standing up. Henry and Ryan stood up too, behind him.<br>\r\n\"Maybe at lunch time - it's fun to watch you little midgets beg me for stuff\" laughed Henry's cousin, before gesturing at Ryan \"Who's your new friend anyway?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Ryan\" said Ryan, stepping forward before Alex or Henry could respond. Face to face, Henry's cousin was surprised at the courage of the young boy.<br>\r\nAlex, however, pushed Ryan back. At first Ryan was getting angry, but soon realized Alex was doing the right thing. Ryan needed to control himself, or else Henry would watch his cousin be vaporized in an instant. At the front of the confrontation was the last place Ryan needed to be.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about him\" said Alex \"Just give me my ball back or I'll tell the teacher.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly the schoolbell rang. \"Tell her and you'll never see your ball again\" said Henry's cousin, holding the ball up tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan read Henry's mind to see what he was thinking. Apparently this wasn't the first time this had happened. It happened all the time at home as well. Henry's cousin just loved teasing people to get a reaction out of them. He loved it when Henry cried or became angry. But of course, Henry was too small and weak to do anything about it. Alex was much better at dealing with bullies than Henry was - he was obviously a natural leader. That was why Henry always stuck as close to him as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan felt that he couldn't simply let this slide. He had to do something. A heroic instinct welled up inside him, to protect his new friends, without giving away his identity. Using his telekinesis, he very slowly manipulated Henry's cousin's shoelaces, first so they untied, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh!\" cried Henry's cousin as he tripped over himself.<br>\r\nAlex, Henry and Ryan had already started walking back to class when they saw the bully fall to the ground, dropping the ball in the process. All three boys laughed hysterically.<br>\r\n\"Darn shoelaces!\" said Henry's cousin, picking up the ball and dragging himself to class.</span></div></div>",

He knew he wasn't supposed to use his powers at school, and although it had felt really good to help Henry get revenge on his cousin, he still had to act just like he was a totally normal boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the three boys saw Henry's cousin eating a doughnut on his own. \"You midgets want your ball back?\" he sneered.<br>\r\n\"Yes please\" replied Alex.<br>\r\n\"How about right after I do THIS!\" said Henry's cousin, before throwing the ball as hard as he could at Henry. Ryan considered catching it, but realised that the ball was moving too fast for any kid to catch. All he could do was watch as the ball struck Henry in the chest, hurting him and making him fall over. Henry's cousin laughed as the ball bounced back into his hand.<br>\r\n\"Now one for you!\" he said, doing the same thing to Alex. In just a moment, both Alex and Henry were down on the ground, writhing in pain, while Henry's cousin laughed and turned to face Ryan. Ryan had hoped he wouldn't have to do anything. But how could he when his new friends were hurt. Even though he could faintly hear Alex groaning at him to run away.<br>\r\n\"Your turn, new kid!\" sneered Henry's cousin as he threw the ball straight at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sneer turned to shock as Ryan easily caught the ball with one hand. Alex and Henry had stopped wincing in pain and were looking at Ryan, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh ... nobody catches my throws you little twerp!\" shouted Henry's cousin in frustration, throwing a roundhouse kick at Ryan.<br>\r\nRyan calmly lifted Henry's cousin's leg up as it sailed towards him, causing Henry's cousin to lose his footing and fall backward to the ground. The older boy screamed in pain and humiliation at being so easily beaten by a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, and one last thing\" said Ryan, aiming the ball at the prone and defenseless boy.<br>\r\n\"No ... please don't ...\" begged Henry's cousin.<br>\r\n\"Doesn't feel so good when somebody's doing it to you, huh?\" asked Ryan \"Oh well, too late now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even with the greatest of restraint, Ryan's thrown ball delivered a bruise with his throw that was at least double as painful as those Alex and Henry had received. It was a miracle Henry's cousin didn't suffer any broken bones. He yowled and hollered, rolling about on the ground, entirely humbled by the infinitely superior little Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on\" said Ryan, helping his friends to their feet and handing Alex the ball \"Let's go play our game. I don't think he'll bother us anymore.\"<br>\r\nAlex and Henry just stared at Ryan, unsure of what to say. Behind them, Henry's cousin was squealing in pain.<br>\r\nEventually Alex spoke up. \"I'm still hurt a bit where he threw a ball at me\" he said, lifting up his Transformers-branded shirt to expose a tennis-ball shaped bruise.<br>\r\n\"Oh ... right\" said Ryan. He'd forgotten the other boys didn't have healing powers like he did. And he couldn't use his powers to heal them because he still wanted to keep his powers a secret ... or had that ship sailed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh ... how exactly are you doing these things?\" asked Henry \"I mean, you beat Alex in ball tag. Alex is, like, one of the best in the school. And now you just injured my cousin, the biggest bully in the school, like it was nothing!\"<br>\r\n\"I ... I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to ...\" began Ryan, upset with himself. Yet again he'd allowed his emotions to get the better of him. Although he was trying his best to restrain his use of powers, he figured he'd just messed it all up. Perhaps Henry and Alex would never play with him again.<br>\r\nJust as he was thinking these things, Alex rested a comforting hand on the superpowered boy's shoulder. \"Hey - it's ok\" he said, as Ryan seemed on the verge of crying \"There's nothing wrong with being talented at sport. I am too, I guess - I like playing ball tag anyway. Actually, to me, it's a GOOD thing. You can keep us safe from bullies and honestly, that ball tag game we played was so much fun. In fact, you should play on my soccer team, too.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Ryan, wiping a tear from his eye.<br>\r\n\"Yeah ... we're called the junior tigers. Just ask your parents if you can play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan felt very lucky to have found such good friends, even if he knew his parents would never allow him to play. After all, when playing sports against a kid like Ryan, there was much potential for things to go wrong. But it was the sentiment that meant so much more. Here he finally had friends, who seemed to accept him for who he was, not always growl at him like his parents did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" said Ryan \"Let's go find a nicer spot to rest\"<br>\r\nAnd so the three boys left Henry's cousin to recover on his own, taking their tennis ball with them. They shared jokes and laughed about how boring maths was. Ryan didn't want to admit he found it all really easy. Alex and Henry were still learning to count and read, after all. But Ryan found it a little easier to feign ignorance than clumsinesss or weakness, as he was still learning to control his overdeveloped motor skills himself. In the background, Ryan used his super-hearing to listen to Henry's cousin as he tried to explain to a teacher that he'd been beaten up by a five year old. The teacher had to suppress a laugh at the big bully, not believing him for a moment. Ryan was glad, because he certainly didn't want his parents to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the afternoon, the class was doing painting. Ryan drew a very rough picture of a monster truck for Henry to try to cheer him up, which somehow still seemed like a priceless work of abstract art no matter how \"bad\" he tried to make it look, but luckily the others didn't really notice - Henry drew a soccer stadium for Alex, and Alex drew a picture of some flowers for some reason. He gave them to Mrs Rodgers at the end of class, who seemed very happy about it. Nobody drew a picture for Ryan, but Ryan didn't mind too much. He was happy about finally having made friends. He knew that certainly Alex, and a to a lesser extent Henry, had wondered about his apparent physical power, but they weren't reacting like his parents would have. Instead they considered themselves lucky to be friends with such a special boy as Ryan, and Ryan considered himself lucky to have made such good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, Ryan's mother came to pick him up. Ryan smiled and waved goodbye to his new friends.<br>\r\n\"Did you have fun today?\" asked his mum.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" replied Ryan enthusiastically.<br>\r\n\"And did you ... behave yourself?\" she continued.<br>\r\n\"Mostly\" said Ryan.<br>\r\nRyan's mother wasn't terribly convinced by his response, but since everything seemed to be alright she didn't immediately question it further.</span></div></div>",

The first such people he found were some workers at a big construction site whose machines had broken down. \"Do you need some help, construction workers?\" he asked. \"Yes, we would love some help, Babyzilla.\" said the leader of the construction team. \"First, we need you to lift that big girder up to the top of the building scaffolding, since our crane is broken.\" \"Okay.\" Babyzilla said as he lifted the girder up to the top, where some of the workers took it from him and moved it into position. \"So, what's next?\" he asked once that was done. \"Now we need all this dirt cleared away over here, since our bulldozer is also broken. \"Oh boy, I love to play in dirt!\" the enormous baby hero cheered happily. He started pushing the dirt into a big pile, using his hands like the scoop of a bulldozer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping the construction workers for almost an hour, they managed to get their machines fixed, so Babyzilla went to find someone else to help. Soon, he found some old, crumbling buildings that clearly needed to be demolished, and his eyes lit up happily. \"I'm gonna wreck these old buildings, so they can build something new!\" he proclaimed in a playful voice. \"RAWR!\" Babyzilla roared as he began stomping the first old building. \"I'm a big baby monster, I'm gonna crush all these old buildings!\" Next, Babyzilla breathed fire onto another old building, burning it to the ground quite quickly. Then he charged right through a building that was as tall as he was, destroying that one, too. He crushed one building beneath his massive, diapered behind, and jumped through the air to come down and crush two more beneath his chest and belly. \"This is so fun!\" Babyzilla cheered happily. \"I wonder what they taste like?\" he wondered. To answer his quandary, the massive tyke broke off a piece of one of the buildings that was still standing and ate it up. \"Mmm, old buildings taste yummy!\" Babyzilla declared happily. He then snarfed down the rest of that building, and began eating a second one. After finishing that building he ate a third one, then a forth, and so on until he had eaten seven buildings, leaving only two tall ones. \"Boy, my belly is really full now.\" *BURP* the giant toddler hero said, patting his bulging tummy. Then he charged through one of the two remaining buildings, and destroyed the last one with his fire breath. \"There, now this space is all clear for them to build something new!\" Babyzilla declared happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, our massive toddler hero decided to... </span></div></div>",

Once he was far out enough, he submerged himself completely, not needing to worry about air thanks to his water-breathing power. As he kept swimming onward, he waved to a sperm whale and chased some sharks around for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant 2-year-old swam on and on through the ocean, until he reached the shores of his home, Babyzilla Island. He climbed up out of the water and onto the beach, where a giant-sized beach blanket and a flatbed truck with a huge sippy cup full of juice lay waiting for him. \u201cOh good, they set it out for me!\u201d the massive toddler cheered. He laid down on the blanket and relaxed on the beach for about 15 minutes, sipping his giant juice cup happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Babyzilla got bored with laying on the beach, so he got up and walked across the island, shaking the ground with his enormous, energetic toddler footsteps. In no time, he reached a gigantic building with one open wall. This was the play area the government had set up for him. Inside, it had white carpeting on the floor, and it was full of all sorts of toys built for a child his size There were building blocks, dolls, action figures, toy cars and trucks, and a trainset. The toys were made of a super strong plastic, just to make sure he didn\u2019t break them with his great strength. Babyzilla grabbed a toy firetruck and zoomed it around the room while making siren noises. \u201cWHEEEOOOOOO!\u201d He wheeled the toy truck up to a model house and pretended it was on fire. \u201cI\u2019m gonna save the burning house!\u201d he said as he pulled out the truck\u2019s firehose and pretended to spray the house with water. After he was done playing firefighter, he went over to play with his trainset. \u201cChoo, choo!\u201d he said as he pushed the train around the track. He made the train stop by the sawmill, the dairy farm, and the ironworks to pick up toy cargo that he loaded onto the freight cars with a magnet crane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Babyzilla was done playing with his trainset, he wanted to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is only six years old and has pale skin, green eyes, and long black hair that is tied to make it look shorter.

Everywhere her body touch where it is her hands, her feet, are all on buildings and cars, they all get crushed or destroyed in other ways.

However, when you opened your eyes again, your room was huge. Scared out of your mind, you went to go find your sister (who was in the 4th grade during the time). She was walking back to her room, unaware that you were on the floor. You screamed her name over and over, but she didn't hear you. Next thing you saw was her foot come right down on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought you were dead, but you noticed that you were still stuck to her foot alive. Moment's later you pushed yourself off of her foot and went back to your room. Thinking how on Earth you became this small, you remembered thinking about being small. This hinted that if you thought you were bigger, you would grow back to normal size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to think you were at a bigger size, you noticed that you began to grow big again. You thought harder and harder in excitement to return to normal, you saw that you grew faster. However, you stopped growing when you returned to your original height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring out how to become big and small was great, but one question remained in your mind. How you were able to survive being stepped on by your sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesting this again could be risky, but was worth trying. You heard your other sister finishing her shower (who during the time was in the 8th grade). You ran to the bathroom and quickly shrunk yourself down. When she opened the door you ran underneath her foot. Then when it came down on you, you realized that you were again stuck underneath her foot and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could unstick yourself, you heard your sister say \"What the heck is that\" then began raising her foot. You began freaking out on what she would do if she found you like this. You wished that you could turn in to an object like one of those gummy hand toys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt different all of a sudden and when you saw your sisters face she said \"Oh it's one of Luke's toys on the ground\". She went to your room and tossed you in there. Shocked about what just happened, you figured out how to turn back into a human and restored yourself back to your normal height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity filled your mind on what else you could turn into. You began thinking you were a pencil and suddenly turned into one. Then thought about turn into a toy car. Sadly you couldn't move yourself when you were the toy car. The next thing you wanted to see is if you could turn into another person. You thought about one of your classmates, Josh from school. Checking the mirror in your room to see if it worked. You saw Josh in the mirror and then turned back into your back into yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow lets get back to the present time shall we.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"HEY LUKE IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GET UP\"  you heard your mom's voice as you got out of bed. \"That's right today's Monday\" you said to yourself and got ready for school. After finishing getting dressed you headed down stairs, but it was only your mom down there and usually your sisters were always up before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey where's Anna and Winter\" you asked. (Winter was your oldest sister and Anna was your older sister). \"Winter took the bus to school and Anna walked to school already\" you mom said. Since you already lived near your elementary school you and Anna could walk over. However, Winter has to take the school bus, since the high school isn't walking distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well I'm going now then\" you said, but before you left you checked the clock which said 7:20. Luckily this was around the time one of your neighbors head to school. Her name was Erin, she was in your grade, and both of you had the same class together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out side you check around to make sure no one was looking before you shrunk down, so you could catch a ride on Erin. You saw a guy wearing a black coat looking the other way, so you shrunk down quickly. Moments later, you saw Erin walking by and immediately ran toward her shoe (Note: you don't have a foot fetish or shrink fetish, but this is the closest you can get to getting a ride on your friend). You jumped right on top, then shrunk yourself smaller and wrapped yourself under her shoe lace. Once you got on school campus, and began passing the restrooms. You quickly got off her shoe and ran into the boys restroom. This way you could restore your height without anyone noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reached one of the stalls in the restroom you quickly grew back. You found your stuff that you left there on Friday still in the stall. During after school times, you would hang back to steal the keys to the restroom (by shrinking of course). Then hid your stuff such as clothes and your bag for Monday; your other pairs of clothes you had on before you shrunk were left at your house. This way you could get a ride on Erin and have your stuff at school. After hiding your stuff you put the keys back in the janitor's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed again, you left the restroom and went to your class. Going through school was pretty easy, since you studied most of your work outside of school on the computer. During recess, you never really hung out with the other students, so you stayed inside classes doing homework or reading something. And for lunch, you had to go to the cafeteria to eat and when you went to the play ground you just sat down thinking on what to do after school. You never really played around with your power's to much during school, since you didn't want other people to start wondering where you went. However it wasn't like a lot of other kids came into conversation with you, so they wouldn't notice if you had left already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school you would hang out by the jungle gym until the janitors finished up and left. During this time is when you began leaving your bag which had you extra set of clothes for tomorrow with all of your homework finished, all in the restroom stall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you ______.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The store was already near your school, so it wasn't to far anyway. Both Anna and Winter didn't need anything, so you headed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting what you needed, you walked outside of the store and noticed cop cars around the bank. \"What's gone over there\" you asked yourself and began walking over. Once you got there a cop stopped you from getting closer. \"Sorry kid you can't be here right now, this is off limits, go back to your parents\" he told you. Police closing off a bank isn't something you normally hear about at your age, so you took matters into your own hands found a safe place and shrunk down to find out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you entered the bank you saw a person with a mask on holding a gun. You learned that guns weren't safe and could hurt people; the man with the mask began pointing the gun at people, which shocked you. On left of you was your mom. She went to the bank weekly to make a deposit and right now she looked like she was in fear. This angered you, for the fact that someone was threatening to harm someone one and especially when it was someone close to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran up quickly to the guy and morphed your hands into sharp daggers. And began cutting the guys foot quickly, then going to his next foot and began doing the same. \"Ow, what f*** was that, SH*t!!!\" the man said falling his  knees. \"Swearing is against the rules at school\" you said running up his back and turning your hand in to a hammer and hitting on the back of his head, knocking him out.After, the cops moved in, arresting the man. And you quickly rushed out to get your stuff and headed back to your house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoment's later you were in your room and heard you mom get home. \"Kids come down, I have a exciting story that happened to me today to tell you\" your mom said calling you all to the living room. \"What happened mom\" Winter asked. \"I was at the bank today and someone came in and brought out a gun, then began robbing the place\" your mom explained. \"Omg, are you okay\" Anna asked. \"Yes I am dear, thanks for asking\" your mom said. \"Wait, what is robbing\" you asked, this was an honest question, since the term never came up before. \"It's when someone is stealing\" she said. \"But that isn't nice\" you said. \"Well, some people don't care about what nice is or not. Anyway, out of no where the guy feel down and knocked out\" she said. \"What the\" Winter said and everyone began giggling. \"I know that's what I thought. It probably was something in his body\" your mom said unaware of the fact it was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your mom was done with her story everyone else and you returned to your rooms. You could hear your mom calling up everyone and sharing her story. You then opened up your window and went on your computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later _______.</span></div></div>",

Curious on who it was, You went outside to go check. It was a little dark outside, but you had your abilities to protect you if it was somebody dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around your house you saw a man in the shadows. \"Who's there\" you asked. The man began walking out \"You know, it isn't safe to trust a stranger. Especially at a time like this\" he said. The man had a eye patch over his left eye. \"I've got a few tricks up my sleeve\" you told him. \"Yes, I know all about your abilities Luke. And I know your a smart young man.  Your in the second grade number one and ahead in your grade class and already doing college level. Oh and by the way nice job at the bank today\" he said nailing everything on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you\" you asked. \"My name is Nick Fury, Fury for short. And your special set of skills is something we can use\" he said. \"We, whose we\" you asked. \"The Avengers\" he replied. \"You don't mean\" you pause. \"Yes the famous Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Green guy smashing things aka the Hulk\" he said. \"You're also forgetting Hawkeye and Blackwidow\" you noted to him. \"Now how do you know about them, that's classified information you know there little man\" he asked. \"Well I do have some other tricks I know sir\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, why do you need me\" you asked him. \"Because your unique, not many people have your kinds of powers besides Mr. Hulk's anger ability. Also you know some top secret information\" he said. \"Even if I come with you, how about my family\" you ask. \"We can send someone one to talk like them, don't worry we got that part all under control, now all we need is you\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what happens if I do\" you ask. \"You can stop even more dangerous people, like that man in the bank today\" he said crouching down to become eye level with you. Looking away back at your house and thinking for a moment about everyone else you look back to Mr. Fury and asked \"Okay\"...</span></div></div>",

During the ride you both talked stories and you shared information on what you've learned about the avengers and other classified stuff you knew about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the plane landed you both walked into the building and he lead down a hallway and stopped by a door label 001. \"This is where you'll be staying. You will have to go through some training before you're ready to fight\" he said opening the door to your room. \"Okay, I understand\" you said walking in. \"In the morning you'll have to head down to the training hall and that's where you'll get started. If you need directions just look on the wall where there will be a map or ask, good night\" he said closing your door. \"Good night then\" you said looking around at your room. There was file on your bed labeled with your name. You opened it up and it had a map of the place and what you'll need for tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou checked the list and it was labeled \"The Suit inside of your closet\". Checking your closet you found a long sleeves and short sleeved shirts with long pants that had a criss cross pattern on it, the colors of the lines were black and everything else was a dark navy blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put it on and it was made up of a stretchy material and you checked a paper that shared information on what it does. The shirt could shrink down with you. To test it you shrunk yourself down and saw how it followed your size. However when you morphed the shirt would just fall off of you. So you figured out a way for you to keep the uniform inside of you when you morphed. You guessed they didn't know about your full morphing ability yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then went to bed and awaited for what will happen tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

You we're able to get down most of the map down of the place and headed for the training hall. When you entered there was nobody inside, so waited to see if anyone one else would come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later Captain America walked in followed by Blackwidow \"AVENGERS ASSEM-, wait\" captain America aka Steve Roger's which you knew seemed a bit confused looking you. \"Uh, is this right\" he asked Blackwidow (Natalia Natasha). \"We probably checked the files first\" she replied. \"Well they did say only one, well lets just make sure\" he said turning back to you. \"Your a bit small there soldier are you sure your in the right place\" Mr. Roger asked. \"Yes. I believe Mr. Fury said training hall. \"Oh, so you already met him\" he asked. \"Yes, he came to me last night\" you replied. \"Okay well, here on your file it says you can shrink and change your body parts, is that right\" Ms. Natasha asked holding a tablet. \"Shrink and morph\" you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but despite his powers he's only 6 years old in the 2nd grade. Why'd he bring him here now; that's a bit young\" she asked Mr. Roger. \"Well in the 2nd grade your suppose to be 7; seems like he skipped a grade. What else does it say on there\" he asked. \"Um, wow! It says he studies college level work already and was number one in his grade level\" she said reading your description. \"Very impressive, so Luke would you like to show us what you know and what you can do\" Mr. Roger said crossing his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess to begin with I know your Captain America, real name Steve Rogers, of course your already in the books. And you are Natalia Natashe also known as the Blackwidow, you grew up training to be an assassin\" you told them. \"How do you know that\" she asked. \"I've done some computer work and due to the stuff I knew Mr. Fury said I had to come here\" you explained. \"Yeah, I can see why. Anyways, what can you do\" she said. \"To begin with I guess I should show you my shrinking thing\" you said walking up to them then shrinking to 1-inch tall. They both crouched down to look at you. \"Wow is that the smallest\" Mr. Roger asked. \"NO\" you shouted up to them. The both chuckled a little \"Okay, how about that morphing\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then ran in the opposite direction from them then turned in Captain America's shield. \"Cool, but I don't your made out of the same thing though\" he said picking you up. \"Okay, try shoot at me Ms. Natasha\" you said. \"You can talk while morphed that's pretty cool, but shooting you is a bit extreme young man. You have a life to live\" she said. \"Its okay\" you said. \"Okay, lets give it a go\" she said pulling out a gun and shooting it at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it worked, so you then transformed back into your normal self. \"The only thing I can't do is move, while I'm an object\" you told them. \"Really when did you try it\" Mr. Roger asked. \"When I was five, that was when I discovered my powers\" you told them. \"Well it has been 2 years, why don't you try it again\" Ms. Natasha said. \"Alright\" you said turning into a toy car. \"I was a toy car when I first tried this\" you said. You began pushing yourself with your mind. \"You aren't moving yet\" Mr. Roger said. \"Yes I know, I'm trying to feel like I'm pushing myself\" you explained. \"Try harder\" Ms. Natasha said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began pushing yourself as hard as you can using a lot of your brain power. You stopped for a moment and a thought came into your head, try feel like you're a real car that was moving. You began feeling as if you wheels were moving forward. And suddenly you began moving \"Whoa, I'm doing it\" you yelled. \"There we go\" they both said as you began moving around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright lets get to work\" Mr. Roger's said.</span></div></div>",

Were going to do some P.E stuff\" he told you. \"Okay\" responded. \"To start off will be doing some running\" walking on to the road, which went around the perimeter of the base. \"You ready\" he asked. \"Yup\" you said then quickly getting ready to run. \"Alright lets start\" you both began running. However you weren't to athletic, so you became tired quite fast, but still tried to push yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3rd person<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the headquarters.<br>\r\nBoth Fury and Natasha were looking out at Luke training with Rogers, but Natasha still had some question she had to ask Fury about Luke. \"Hey Fury\" she said. \"Yes, is it about our newest member\" he asked. \"Yeah, he's only seven years old. Why would you take him now, you could've waited till he was at least 18 or something\" she asked Fury. \"The government found out about him at a bank incident the other day, so I had to get him before they did something\" he answered. \"You think he'll last\" she asked then walked toward the window looking out at Luke. \"Well, what do you think\" he said turning toward Natasha. Natasha saw Luke having to stop for a break after running what seemed about half a mile. \"Sure\" she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2nd person back to you. <br>\r\n\"Hey, your doing good for your age. That was about half a mile you think\" he said. With your hands on your knee's you looked up to Mr. Roger's and asked \"So how far can you run\". \"Quite a bit, but this is about you right now\" he replied. \"Alright, I think I'm good\" you said standing straight up. \"Okay, lets finish this lap\" he announced then you both began going again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you guys were done running, you had to do some muscle training like push ups and other workouts till the end of the day. Once, you were done, you took a shower, then immediately knocked out on your bed.</span></div></div>",
