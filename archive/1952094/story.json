Sadly I did not save the rest of the storyline before it was gone, but, I'll remember what happened before. Mostly.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel decided that he would have to bring the S.S. Moomil to port himself. Good weather or not, according to Lugia a storm that would start the cycle of gluttony once more would come. He had to act fast. Two hours before midnight, he contacted the steward on board once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst. You still awake?\" Floatzel whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mister Floatzel. What is the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you...call off the repairs for a couple of hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're halfway done. Is there a particular reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would not believe me, but there's a storm coming. And it won't be pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The weather forecast says it's all clear. What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said you would not believe me. You all need to be safe on land, and I mean it. No one should be on board me until next morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, we have a schedule to keep!\" the steward stood up from his seat, prancing around the control room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you can do it. I beg you. Also make sure the people at the pier get to the city, and not linger around there.\" Floatzel pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Roger.\" The steward went silent, as he began to make arrangements to have everyone evacuate the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word, the crew members were soon disembarking the S.S. Inflatable in an orderly manner, and dispersing into the city via buses and other vehicles. It took a good thirty minutes before they were all gone, as Floatzel watched them exit the gangplank and in turn boarding other land transport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steward was the last to leave, and with a hand to his headset, he spoke to Floatzel once more. \"No one is on board you right now. I hope you know what you are doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll see you all in the morning.\" Floatzel replied, watching the gangplank retract itself back into his structures. \"Time to leave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where are you going?!\" Shouted the steward. \"Be honest with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm going to pay the S.S. Moomil a visit. Guide it back safely to port.\" Floatzel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just make her turn back! There isn't enough reason for her to cancel the test voyage-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" mumbled Floatzel, as he spun his tails as fast as he could, propelling him out of the port of Snowpoint City, and in turn cutting off communications with the steward. \"I need to go faster if I'm going to make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the way to Slateport, I believe. I hope I'm not lost...Oh wait, there it is!\" Floatzel exclaimed, as he spotted the black-white-pink blob ahead of him. The S.s. Moomil had departed, and was quite a distance off the port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the Miltank was starting out slow, and as such the obese river otter was able to encounter her just making her way out for the test run. He spun his tails once more, closing the distance between him and the Milk Cow Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I don't know what were they thinking, making me try and complete this run without the aid of an engine.\" The Miltank fumed, as she continously spun her flabby tail and kicked her massive rear legs, to push herself forward across the sea. \"I mean, it's good to be able to move about again, but at this rate it's miserable. It's not like I've got a pair of tails that scales well with my bulk anyways!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know that the very thing that she was made to compete with would soon appear right before her eyes, as she saw the S.S. Inflatable appear in the corner of her eye, growing larger as he quickly closed in on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow, what is that- Wait, it must be that Floatzel! No one else so far has been able to make the mark to be a Pokemon cruise ship, and I just barely made the grade with my weight and water mobility! What is he doing here though? I thought he was being repaired at Snowpoint.\" The Miltank spoke to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff, huff...Finally, there you are. You must be the S.S. Moomil. I'm Floaty the Floatzel, also known as the S.S. Inflatable.\" Floatzel paused to catch his breath as he stopped paddling, allowing himself to drift close to Miltank, massively dwarfing her when compared side by side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there, you scared me! What if you crashed right into me, huh?\" said the angry Miltank, as she struggled to paddle forwards against the sudden waves when Floatzel swam next to her, but she stopped for a while to let the water be calm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that. Listen, you need to turn back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not making any sense.\" the Miltank said, as the crew members aboard her turned to look at the massive orange flab of the S.S. Inflatable block their starboard view. \"I've made it out this far, and you want me to swim back now?! Not gonna happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"There's no time to argue with her, she won't agree to swim back to port. Not that she'll be fast enough, the storm'll be here before she's even quarter the way there!\"</i> Floatzel panicked, a sudden stiff breeze ruffling his fur, as he brought his tails around to wrap about the S.S. Moomil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, what do you think you're doing?! Put me down this instant!\" yelled the Miltank as she was ousted from the sea, while flailing her stubby limbs about. The remaining water dripped from her belly fur and massive udders, as she was lifted above the water by the massive river otter before her.</span></div></div>",

He loosened his tails which gripped tightly around the flab and cruise framework of the Cow Pokemon, the combined mass of which now directly weighing down on the river otter's colossal belly, forming a slight depression and pushing the top of his belly flab outwards a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Occupants of the S.S. Moomil, this is the S.S. Inflatable, or more specifically, Floaty himself, speaking.\" Floatzel spoke through the headset, hoping that the communication systems on board them both were integrated somehow. \"I apologise for the rude interruption, but please do not panic. I am just going to escort her back to port, for there is a storm coming. A really big one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you kidding, Floatzel? Despite the skies being dark in the night, I barely see any clouds within the vicinity!\" Miltank cried out in disbelief. \"I don't really know if it's true either, to be honest. But this is no ordinary storm. Better to be safe than sorry!\" Floatzel replied, as he brought his tails behind him, and began to spin them up to full speed, making a U-turn and now facing in the direction of Slateport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is outrageous, S.S. Inflatable! We were not informed of this sudden change in plans. But for safety's sake we will do as we are told, and stay put on board the S.S. Moomil.\" an angry crew member on board her spoke, and the headset went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Floatzel. Ugh, geez- Ah, I suppose I was gettin' a little tired of paddlin' with just my stubby feet and a sorry excuse of a tail, compared to yours, anyways.\" Miltank sighed, catching her breath. While she was quite cross with him for making her efforts to sail all the way out here naught, she was glad that she got to take a break and let someone else do the heavy lifting. \"Hey, don't mention it. I'm sorry about what happened just now, though.\" Floatzel replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any case though, you'd better be sure about that damned storm you keep flabberin' about. Otherwise it'll not be just me, but the company after your head.\" Miltank commented. <i>\"Punishment never really crossed my mind, though...what could they possibly do to hurt me at this size anyways?\"</i> Floatzel pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel realised he was paddling a little slower than before he picked up the S.S. Moomil, either it was due to the added weight from his baggage, or that he was quite worn out from going full speed to Slateport.<br>\r\n\"Um, if you don't mind, we could just chat for a while as I bring us back to port. You're a little heavy, even for my standards, and I'm still not used to moving with an extra mass doing on my belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you're one to talk. Shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how does it feel to be the second cruise li- I mean, Pokemon, within the company?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's surprisingly fufilling! Of course, I'm talking about the tonnes upon tonnes of gastronomic delights I get to devour clean every day.\" Miltank licked her lips. \"Of course, just like on the farm, humans are just trying to fatten me up, but at least it's part of my job description to be big and fat now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha, likewise, for me too. The stuff they serve up is simply amazing. How did you manage to land this job anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just shortlisted as one of the suitable candidates? They have a pretty strict criteria, you know. All thanks to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that so...\" Floatzel mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it's a long story. About two weeks back...\"</span></div></div>",

Please, take a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of them sat down in their respective chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Pokemon Cruises so far have been simply, in my opinion, phenomenal! I've been enjoying every single one of them since the first!\" June went about excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad to hear that. Now, I am a busy man, and my time is money. You did mention wanting to show me something?\" the President rested his hands on the table, and asked June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shan't waste your time, President. The view of the port is just right behind you, is it not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you- Yes, it is. How did you know about this?\" went the President, a tad puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tee-hee. Lucky guess!\" June giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe President simply squinted at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was keeping track of the general direction as I entered your company building, and came to that conclusion.\" she shrugged. \"Anyway enough about that. You should take a look outside your window...now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Okay.\" the President smiled, and drew open the blue curtains, revealing a view of the port behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing out of the ordin- Wait, hang on a moment. Is that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune stood up to confirm if that was what he should be seeing. \"Yep! You're looking at one of my lovely Pokemon over there, my adorable Miltank!\" she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Miltank was just floating about near one of the docking areas in the port, recently released from a Pokeball by one of her friends who sneaked into the compound. At this moment she weighed more or less six thousand tons, and how June got her that huge is...her well-guarded secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're talking about the campaign we were running, to seek out Pokemon cruise worthy, other than Floatzel himself, I have told you before that it's closed.\" the President dismissed, making reference to one of her letters submitted way past the due date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but the post office was closed quite a few times owing to harsh blizzards, where I live! That was why I could not have gotten it to you sooner...Pretty please, could you spare me a chance? For someone who's a loyal customer?\" June winked cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe President sighed. \"The other candidates that we have found are being screened at the moment. It would cost extra resources to sign your Miltank up, which I cannot spare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't chosen one yet, right? Tell you what, you could just give me a fraction of royalties the campaign mentioned about for selected Pokemon! You'll get another suitable candidate for your fleet, and if Miltank passes your tests it'll cost you less to upkeep right?\" June reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...see. Do we have a deal, then?\" the President held out his open right hand to June, holding it above the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Huh?\" went a dazed June, not expecting the President to agree to it so easily. \"Yes, sure!\" she exclaimed, as she answered his handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. My secretary will ready the contract papers. Once you have filled them up and signed them, Your Pokemon will begin testing as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaay! Thank you so much, President!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Note that this is not a confirmation that your Pokemon has been added to the fleet. The technology to build on them is actually rather costly, so we have to be sure that Miltank is suitable for the job.\" the President spoke, as he proceeded to exit the meeting room, but not before contacting his secretary over the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<u>Back to present day...</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...interesting. So you belong to a trainer.\" Floatzel realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Now that I think of it, though, you're not exactly mobile enough to make a good cruise ship. How did you manage to get chosen amongst the rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, I knew that question would crop up!\" Miltank bellowed. \"While it's true that during the selection they found others that were faster than me, some even larger than me- I mean, I thought at that size, I was the largest second only to you, but I got proven wrong! A really fat Wailord beat me! But that's acceptable, since normally Miltank are a lot smaller to begin with.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiltank continued, \"They tested us based on various factors: things like construction adhesion to our bodies all of us passed, and while I was like the third slowest of the bunch, with or without additional weights, I trumped them all in two parameters; rate of weight gain and inedible digestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that means you can eat everything, like me, too.\" Floatzel spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite all that practice June gave me on eating steel cans and broken wood, I still felt a little scared eating things like solid concrete and whole mountains of garbage, but I got over it. Eating everything and anything now feels great to me!\" the Miltank said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's the story on how they picked me. But you look quite trustworthy. I'll let you in on a little secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\" Floatzel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring your ear a little closer. I can't exactly budge an inch when out of water.\" Miltank said disappointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, and you think I'm more mobile. Let's see...\" Floatzel, remembering how Valerie manages to reshape herself at will, attempted to soften his chins and neck rolls. He managed to make them a little more mobile, shifting his head gradually and leaning close to the Miltank's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst...At the end of the testing, they made me eat everyone else. As a final test.\" Miltank whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, not so loud! The contract says that disqualified candidates will be released into the wild, to live their plumped up lives to the fullest, but I think the company was trying to waste not. It worked well for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's why you're so fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that you're not?\" Miltank shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Putting it more specifically they made me eat everyone in one sitting. I had to complete it within 24 hours, otherwise they said they would feed me to you.\" Miltank admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ridiculous! Even if I was to eat you, I would never bring myself to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought at the time too, until they announced 'Candidate Miltank, you're the winner, now eat everyone else!'. Without so much of a second thought, <b>all</b> of them went down the hatch, into my big, spacious, plump belly here.\" she patted it once, causing it to slosh about, giving her a tintillating sensation. \"Even that Wailord which I talked about. Came in cocky at ten thousand over tons. So confident he was until he realised he couldn't gain much weight despite eating as much as we all did, and when he was eleven thousand tons by the time they announced me queen of the lot, I was like eighteen and a half. He wasn't so confident any more. That spread of fat Pokemon, all mine to devour, was simply heaven, and exploded my tastebuds! The salty taste of Lapras skin and that craggy shell was surprisingly good, the divine flavour of a blubbery and bloated Dragonite along with his stubby wings was a taste to behold, and that Flygon, a tad dry but a nice change of pace, and oh my, that sweet sweet Wailord! Utterly beating and humiliating him made it taste so much sweeter!~ And I topped it off with a big great *BUUURRRRPPP!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have gotten a little too excited there, apologies.\" the Miltank mumbled, and hushed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay.\" While Floatzel himself was marvelling a little at this Cow Pokemon's escapades, he himself knew that he was part of...something on a far grander scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you not scared of me now?\" Miltank questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. It'll have to be a while before you can even dream of swallowing me whole!\" Floatzel laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That much is true...say, how far are we away from Slateport right now?\"</span></div></div>",

You should back off, I didn't say yes!\" Miltank shouted, feeling her territory being enroached upon, and a ticklish feeling coursing through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"T-this taste...awesome!\"</i> Floatzel thought, as he tasted the river of milk running past his tastebuds. He continued to drink for a full minute, drinking about five swimming pools' worth of the nutritious stuff, before stopping to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, you've had enough! Take me back to port already, and stop disturbing me!\" Miltank was really peeved now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel licked his maw clean of milk, and said, \"Miltank, right? You make good milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really...\" Miltank blushed as she heard that praise. Floatzel murred as he felt the nutrients in the milk add on to the fat on his body, making the ship structures tighter in some spots, but not by much. \"50% fat is underestimating it though. At your size it must be more like 90%!\" Floatzel joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, you're crazy! Who'd be nuts enough to milk someone like me at this size anyway? It's probably not even healthy for those humans any more.\" Miltank said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it'll be good for me, I'm sure of it.\" Floatzel smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeloading here, are we Floatzel? And what do I get out of it?\" Miltank smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my butt, lies some containers full of refuse. Hold on, not some, lots of them. Normally I'd clear them out as soon as I get the chance to, but I've been really busy lately. You can have 'em as long as you let me have a drink every so often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think it's worth it. How much garbage is there for me to feast on? From what I gather it still sounds like a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Floatzel himself stopped paddling for a moment, used his tails to grab hold of those containers he spoke of. He grabbed one and set it in front of the Miltank. It was positively overflowing with garbage collected during the S.S. Inflatable's operations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have more?\" Miltank asked, a feeling a little hungry already. Floatzel then took out all the containers and set them in front of her, stacked neatly on top of the other. Three of them was about her height, and there were dozens of them in between Floatzel's and her head, with Floatzel's own neck rolls partially covering some of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiltank was drooling right now. \"I'm not much of a fan of garbage, but...can I have all of that? Pretty please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all yours!\" Floatzel grinned, as he continued to paddle.</span></div></div>",

However he still needed to get home himself as he has promised Valerie that he would be home as soon as possible, It was already late in the afternoon and he still had a long trip ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel took to swimming close to the mainland, avoiding swimming to far out to sea, this method took him much longer, but it was the safest route, though as he swam home, the thought did cross his mind, what if he were to ignore Lugia's warning, what if he were to drink the entire ocean and become the biggest Pokemon in existence once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very tempting, but he couldn't. Not only had he promised Valerie that he would not go overboard with his eating, but Arceus had warned him that should he cause havoc due to his gluttony he would be severely punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do miss those days\" Floatzel said to himself as he paddled along \"I would love to be that big again, I miss those galaxy sized meals with Val, heck I even miss devouring and being devoured by Luxray, we escaped each others stomachs so many times...\" He added chuckling to himself \"I wonder how he's doing, I wonder if he even remembers our past life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel's thoughts danced about with past events as fantasies of growing bigger and bigger as he feasted on existence itself, but he also had a family to consider, his children and Val also meant the world to him, he wanted to look after them and spend time with them more than anything, yet this still did not fully quell his temptations. But for now he decided he would fight said temptations and selfish desires for their sake, rather than his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt struck evening, before Floatzel finally made his way back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they did live on the main land, they had constructed an undersea passage which connected to their home, the passage itself was large enough to accommodate both Floatzel and Valeries large bodies, however due to Floatzels recent eating splurge, the passage was a tight squeeze, however with some delicate swimming he progressed his way through the passage and finally into his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home\" Floatzel called out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're finally back!\" Valerie replied as she made her way over to greet him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I took so long\" Floatzel said, though just as he was about to explain what happened, Valerie interrupted him, placing a paw over his mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to explain dear, I already know what happened\" See said in soothing and reassuring tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lugia telepathically explained to me the whole thing, he warned me about the storm and told me to not go looking for you until everything was all clear\" Valerie elaborated \"Though he said I wasn't to expect to see you until tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of ignored his advice to stay put, and just kept to the mainlands instead, to avoid the storm\" Floatzel replied sheepishly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, you're home now\" Valerie replied with a gentle smile.</span></div></div>",

When that storm arrives, they will know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-kay then. Guess there's nothing to worry about!\" Valerie cooed, as she spread herself out lazily on top of the river otter's massive belly, trying to cover as much of her lover's cream furred stomach as possible with her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"End of first message. Second message will play in three seconds. Press [main] to cancel.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what this one is about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Second message. Voice message from Miltank of the S.S. Moomil. Message Part 1.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel heard a loud beep from the headset, before some noise was heard and the headset crackled to life once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*bzzt bzzzzt...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Floaty! It's Miltank 'ere! You know...thanks for bringing me all the way back to Slateport. Normally I find it a really tiring thing to swim by myself all the way back to port, much less being able to do it at your size, with someone as heavy as myself bearing on top with such ease. Where on earth do you get that kind of...strength for that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, you're a Water Pokemon, I guess, so the ocean's kinda second nature to you. Still though, it amazes me, and those fluffy tails of yours though, make me quite jealous! I wish I had even had a tail a fraction of that caliber, much less two, then I'll be able ta swim almost as fast as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway I think I'm kind of sidetracking here, so I'll just get to the *urrrrp* excuse me, *burrrpp* point...that pile of garbage you gave me earlier, all  tons of it? To my surprise I managed to greedily devour all of it shortly after you swam off, and boy was I really, really stuffed~ So I took a short nap soon after to let it digest, and an even bigger surprise awaited me- turns out I was packing on so much fat as I digested, that my belly threatened to climb up the port I was docked at!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(mumbling)Nothing beats a good supper to stuff myself after a long hard day though. Thanks a load, Floaty dear. *BURP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew woke me up in a jolt telling me I should fall back a little into the ocean, and so I did, only to be told the same thing a minute later! Turns out my body is packing on blubber more and more quickly as I grow, and I'm still growing outwards even as I speak...oh, here it comes again! *loud gurgling from Miltank's own belly, followed by the distant sound of fur scraping against pavement*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurrr, that felt sooo good! Sorry for my rambling. Maybe it could have happened to you before so it's no big deal to you, but it probably is to me. Should I be worried though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, talk to you later. I need my beauty sleep! See you around soon...I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Message Part 2. Time sent: About two hours later from Part 1\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floaty! Miltank of the S.S. Moomil again, although I'm not sure if I'll still retain this name for long. (She sounds flustered and excited at the same time; it is hard to tell.) Sorry to disturb you once more, but maybe I should let you in on this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ordered a temporary closure of Slateport...all because of me. Since the last message I sent you I outgrew both the company's and my own expectations, and smothered a good portion of the Slateport's port area while I slept! Now my belly is the only thing I can see for miles ahead of me. In my <b>massive</b> growth spurt the ship structures around me came off like the twigs they are now, so that prevents me from being a proper cruise ship til they get me repaired. Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the growth seems to have stopped, and I'm feeling a little hungry. Guess my stomach's painfully empty now after all that huh? The company told me to stay put until they can find a proper course of action, so I'm left on hold, with countless small tingling feelings on my belly area from all directions poking at it I can't quite put my hoove on what they exactly are. Maybe they're just other curious Pokemon, or workers moving away things that it run over...the sensation is quite tintillating indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turn of events today after meeting you is making my head throb. Can't say for sure what will happen to me, now that I'm large enough to officially become my own island of Miltank...but the prospect of them officially declaring me an island makes me warm and fuzzy inside, and my lips water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBye for now. Come visit sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End of message. No new messages at present.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's definitely staying safely at port.\" Floatzel sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty, naughty Floaty!\" Valerie teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you getting at?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sounded quite...close to you. Who is she really, and why have you hid this from me?\" Valerie demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just a coworker, nothing more. It didn't come up in my mind until these messages, honest! I've only just met her today.\" Floatzel explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you're not going to leave me and our children behind for her, given that she's so much bigger than I am at present (and possibly even you too Floaty?)\" Valerie asked, while hugging the river otter's chins tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not Valerie! Our love will remain true. Besides, I find Miltank a tad noisy at times...\" said Floatzel.</span></div></div>",

Chill it, yo.\" the Luxray stumbled backwards in shock, dropping a toolbox onto Floatzel's soft fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Fixed it all'? What exactly were you fixing?\" Floatzel wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was taking care of the communications and servers onboard you, silly! Never mind the shoddy electrical engineering on board, but the lack of maintenance is simply unacceptable-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it! I think these, say ship structures on me, are a technological marvel!\" Floatzel rebuked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pah, whatever you say, we Pokemon are serving humans all the same.\" Luxray sulked, before walking forward to pick up his toolbox with his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray was your standard everyday Luxray, except that he was wearing a leather vest adorned with electrical spare parts of all sorts and sizes, structured to suit his canine-like body. Also a quite obvious pot belly could be seen protruding under his vest, swaying a bit with his gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-could it...really be you, Lux?\" Valerie called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Floaty here I know, I've been working on board him for quite long fixing things here and there. As for you...*squinting* Nope, never quite seen you around before!\" Luxray replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...maybe you've just forgotten. You'll remember one day.\" Valerie cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think so, I don't have a habit of making friends with someone as corpulent as you, unless of course you're workin' as a cruise shippy like my river otter friend here!\" Luxray said, while turning to stare at Floatzel's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you little- Ah, I suppose that's true...\" Valerie blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone like you should be joining the company and applying to be a cruise ship too! It's a growing industry, literally, no pun intended. You could join your Floatzel lover here as you sail the seas, and never be apart again!\" Luxray beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've...thought of that before, but I don't think that kind of life's for me. I have our children to take care of. But I'll reconsider your kind offer.\" Valerie spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff...did everyone just knock off from work without me again?\" Luxray shouted, a little peeved finding out that his other co-workers were totally absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it was my fault. I told everyone to evacuate...well, it's a long story.\" Floatzel admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn announcement system's broke again, by the time I fix it, too late here I am! Never mind that! Was never really on terms with them 'friends' anyway. Guess I should just fall asleep on board you, Floaty mate, my eyes are virtually burning out now. Hope ye don't mind.\" Luxray said, going back into the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem!\" Floatzel said, as he heard the bridge door close behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...really was him...\" Valerie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, after so long we finally meet him. But he doesn't remember us.\" Floatzel agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it. Arceus can't have possibly wiped out his memory...that sounds a bit too cruel...\" Valerie sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right dear. We'll get it back somehow.\" said Floatzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since it's come to this, though, Floaty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Floatzel said, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have two choices now, either we stay put in our home and watch the incoming storm, or we could...\" said Valerie quite seductively, her eyes beautifully dimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, that? As much as I'd love to, but I think a dozen children's quite a handful already!\" Floatzel said, mistaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, get it together. That's not what I meant, dummy!\" Valerie smacked him softly with a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think it's just perfect, too perfect, that Lugia told the both of us? He could have just told you or me alone and that will get the job done.\" Valerie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he just wanted to be sure that we would stay home together...without seperating over an argument of any sort...\" Floatzel explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are always destined to be together, my dear little river otter.\" Valerie said, before kissing Floatzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we are. Isn't the ocean quite lovely under the moonlight?\" Floatzel mused, seeing the moon illuminating the waters before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if you'll think the same way, but I think we can make this night...even better than it is now, for the both of us? Just like what Lugia has implied with his 'warning', maybe?\" Valerie slurped, her tongue slipping out for a brief moment to moisturise her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can see where you're getting at, Val.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good! Storm's coming tonight, Lugia said. Let us make the best of it, I said. If you agree with me, I'll bring the children on board, and we'll head out together into the open sea. Then I'll merge with you afterwards, as I wanna feel how you feel being a cruise liner! Before we end up utterly bursting it inside and out, and devouring it of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...that'll mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, putting things short we're going to show the whirlpool and storm that we're ready for it. Both of us together should be enough stomach space to down the entire ocean- not that you or I couldn't do it alone, I just want us to be awake for the seafood feast that follows right after!\"<br>\r\n\"We'll sail right into the whirlpool and let it suck us in, and opening our maw will let us savour what it was intended to deliver!\" Valerie said, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're willing to risk Arceus' wrath...just to bring back the good old days?!\" Floatzel said, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be apparent by now that we both crave that, no? Yup, that I am. I'm not going to force you though, if you don't wanna risk it. If you say no, we'll just stay put and live the remainder of our lives in normalcy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soo, what do you say?\" Valerie tempted, her fat cheeks smooshing heavily against Floatzel's own.</span></div></div>",

There were plenty of opportunities where he could of gulped me down, but he didn't, He didn't even look at me with hungry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when Lugia had possesed him and forced him to absorb you, but even then when I guess I dove in after you, I could feel him trying his best not to gobble me up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo like Luxray I want to be that dedicated to my word!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will make Luxray break his promise, so you can break yours!\" Valerie said with a child like grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?

Now you're the one not making any sense\" Floatzel yelped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be fine, after all he used to eat universes with us, right now, we pale in comparison to his real potential, besides, I want to kill two birds with one stone, I want to see if this experience will spark his memory any, and on top of that... as odd as this is, wouldn't it be nice to meet each other in the place were we first met?\" Valerie said as she brushed a fat paw across Floatzels bloated cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust at that moment, footsteps could be heard on the bridge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind me\" Luxray called out \"I left one of my tools here on the bridge\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak of the devil\" Valerie chucked \"Oh Lux, can you come down here a moment, I need to ask you something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure ma'am\" Luxray replied politely, as he began making his way down to the ground to meet with Valerie and Floatzel. Despite his rounded stomach, he had much agility in his movements, and in no time at all he was down on ground level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lux, dear, this might sound like an odd question, but... if given the chance would you like to be as big as say Floaty here and myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pudgy Luxray stared up at the two bloated giants, as Valeries question rung about in his ears, his eyes widened, and his face went red, his eyes darted about trying to find the words<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do\" He wanted to say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to eat and eat and grow bigger and bigger and never stop\" He tried to say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he couldn't say a single word, but his expression said everything, of course he did, every day he dreamed about going off on a gluttonous rampage, devouring everything in sight, completely unaware that in a past life he had done just that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I said I could make that happen right now, would you say yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray was still in shock from the question, but he did manage to nod, dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie looked at Floatzel, with an excited grin on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, lets do this then\" Floatzel said, reluctantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Valerie cheered \"I'll go first, since I can should be more easier for him to gobble up, but when he's big enough, you should be able to join me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the boss\" Floatzel said as he glanced over to Luxray whom had no idea what was going on, his face stuck with that same goofy dumbfounded expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie turned herself into mist which at first was clearly visible, the white fog billowed throughout the room, and then it surrounded Luxray, leaving nothing but a silhouette of the lion Pokemon, before slowly fading away, leaving no trace of Valerie in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where did she go?\" Luxray asked a bit perplexed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out soon enough buddy\" Floatzel grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon enough Luxray did find out, at first it was very slow, and hardly noticeable, but Luxray could feel it, with each breath he could feel himself getting 'thicker' not only just his stomach, but his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" Luxray groaned, a bit wary of such a sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you've wished for\" Floatzel replied, still grinning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray's stomach hit the ground with a sudden thump, which in response caused the Luxray to sit upright to investigate. His stomach was expanding, swelling up like a balloon almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting fatter\" Luxray beamed, as his girth continued to increase, not only that, his arms, legs, feet and paws grew thicker and fatter too, so to did his cheeks, and his face in general, he continued to grow larger and larger, due to Valeries influence, his neck formed another chin, and then another. Surprisingly, Luxray's jacket which he had grown partial to, did not rip off or even show signs of shredding, it seemed to grow with him, though it obviously looked a lot smaller on him rather than fitting nicely like it had prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel couldn't help but watch in awe at Valeries handiwork, curiously poking Luxray's big rounded blue stomach, it was soft to touch, much like his own, he looked at the expanding Luxray and observed his expression, Luxray looked like he was having the time of his life, he even sounded like it as Luxray himself couldn't help but let out moans, growls and even purrs of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, all doubt was cleared from his mind, he had decided, after seeing Luxray so pleased with himself for growing to that size, imagine his own pleasure when the ocean itself is in his own stomach, and not just the ocean, but all the Pokemon who dwell in the sea too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll make Luxray break his promise, so I can break mine\" Floatzel said to himself aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Floatzel came to his conclusion, he was then confronted by a Luxray who was almost as big as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you feeling there buddy?\" Floatzel asked with an amused expression on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray had to take a moment to fully take in what just happened, he was huge, he never thought it possible to be this huge, but it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel amazing\" Luxray roared, much like he had done in the past when he had finished a 'big meal'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe i'm actually saying this, but... Ready for the second course?\" Floatzel asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Luxray asked, still a bit giddy from his experience<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well me, I'm going to be your second course, strange I know, but it's Val's idea, though we're going to be doing this one a bit differently, you're going to have to swallow me whole, since I cant turn into mist without Val's help\" Floatzel explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Floatzel, I promised I wouldn't eat you again\" Luxray replied, not realizing the implications or the origins of said promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you remember now?\" Floatzel gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what?\" Luxray responded blankly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our past life, our endless feasts! of Planets, and the Stars, and even Galaxies!\" Floatzel explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't a clue what you are talking about, I am pretty sure if we did something like that, I would remember for one, and two neither of us would be on earth, because we'd be too big for it\" Luxray laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then when did you make that promise not to eat me then, when up until now there was no possible way for you to even do so\" Floatzel responded, a little bit frustrated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Luxray paused for a second \"I don't know, you're right, there was absolutely no reason for me make such a promise, but... I do remember making it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lux!\" Valerie chimed from inside his stomach \"Gobble up my dear Floatzel anyway, it might bring back some more memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said to myself I would never want to be in anyone's stomach ever again, even if I can escape with ease, but I'll do it for you buddy, now open wide, S.S Inflatable is ready to set sail\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"W-what?\" Luxray said out, feeling quite dazed from the duo's attempts to bring back his memories. \"That Vaporeon you call 'Val' just weaseled her way into me, and ended up in my stomach? Maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, she just did, but trust me, she'll come to no harm.\" Floatzel reassured him. \"Just open up as wide as you can and swallow me up!\" The river otter said confidently, spinning his tails up to speed and cruising forward towards Luxray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge Luxray, despite his newfound size, was still quite shocked watching a ginormous, furry belly growing ridiculously larger as Floatzel surged towards him. \"I'm not ready yet! I'll just burst inside out if I try to eat you-\" Luxray screamed fearfully at the top of his lungs, his maw wide open, but was soon cut short by Floatzel's belly being shoved forcefully against his jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmff...gulp gulp gulp.\" Luxray went, as he responded almost instinctively, making rapid progress in swallowing the cruise-ship river otter. In a few quick swallows Floatzel's belly was halfway out of view, and filled his own painfully stretched maw. Luxray himself could feel the fuzz enter his throat, the combined effect of Floatzel's own propulsion and his swallowing loosen his throat, thus allowing Floatzel's blubber-laden belly to continuously flow down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Luxray, you've barely lost your touch.\" Floatzel said, amazed, reminding himself of the time he and Valerie were fused together in the same body while in space, and in that galactic feast they grew so huge that when a stray black hole was sucking everything else in, it got plugged completely by a single one of their belly rolls. It still continued to suck them in , but only managed to do so partially before it reached their maw, where they countered it with a bottomless cosmic vacuum of their own, devouring the black hole itself completely as well as the prizes it sucked up before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What...is this feeling..\"</i> Luxray thought, as some random flashbacks of the former 'fatapocalypse' began to play back in his head...something about Lugia, competition with Floaty...what?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray steeled himself again as he felt the rougher ship structures attached to Floatzel brush past his maw, his own stomach swelling out larger and larger as the river otter's belly completely entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing great, Lux, I can already see Floaty's lovely looking belly!\" Valerie cheered, whilst making herself comfortable in the closed confines of Luxray's stomach walls, feeling her own blubbery body make contact with her lover's warm fuzzy flab, as well as some bits of cold metal. \"Just a little more and I can see Floaty's chubby little face- oh!\" Valerie called out as Floatzel's head entered, with Luxray having eaten him up to his enormous butt by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very tight in here, as always. Hope this works out as well as we think.\" Floatzel commented, hearing his ship structures groan and creak louder as his body pressed against Valerie, as well as Luxray's stomach walls. \"Gahh~ Just like when we first met, Floaty dear!\" the Vaporeon squealed, as she brought her cheeks close to the river otter's, causing them to smoosh tightly together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*HHHHGGGGTHONKCLANG!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, there goes the cabins below sea level. And the bridge directly behind me!\" Floatzel lamented as he felt a slight sting from the ship structures experiencing structural collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Luxray's stomach, Luxray was almost done devouring the cruise-ship river otter, left with only his humongous twin tails to swallow, having stopped spinning by Floatzel himself to make things easier for him. A few good slurps made them disappear into the Luxray's belly like thick noodles, leaving a super sized, fit to burst Luxray floating on the ocean belly up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet Arceus, how did I manage to *BRAAAAAAAAAPPPP*\" Luxray mumbled, bewildered, before being cut off by a colossal burp escaping his system. \"What in the-\" Luxray shuddered, before he closed his eyes, focusing on the recollections entering his head, all the memories suppressed by Arceus being suddenly unlocked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that did the trick, Val!\" Floatzel said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you it'll work. Now let's get those structures off, they're starting to look quite uncomfortable on you!\" Valerie said, as she liquefied her own body in contact with Floatzel, diffusing gradually into the river otter. Floatzel could feel himself getting bigger and fatter as Valerie fused with him, the tightly binding though weakening structures snapping off or being crushed under his growing fats as they no longer suited his expanding girth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Valerie's body completely diffused into him, his body quickly changed in<br>\r\nform and appearance into that of a Floatzel-Vaporeon hybrid, Floatzel's belly began to shrink a little as blubber realigned to pack more on his hips and butt, his twin tails also lost their fluff and gained in mass, sprouting fins at the end of each tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white neck fin characteristic of a standard Vaporeon also shot forth from between his neck rolls and his own head, followed by dark blue spines  adorning their back, beginning from his head and working their way down to his tails, splitting two ways as they followed the direction of the twinned, powerful finned tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically while his body shape was transforming into that of a Vaporeon's, he still retained some of his own original characteristics, namely his floatation sac, which had just simply turned white and more tough and leathery, with rows of fins fully lining it. Whereas Valerie's body was mostly blue, his body ended up adopting the colour scheme, with his orange fur turning blue as well, although the cream fur on his belly only turned slightly whiter, still giving forth considerable accent to the appearance of  their own impressive showcase of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of the cruise structures finally came off as they completed their fusion into a hybrid of themselves, letting the both of them feel more free to spread out once more, despite the heavily confined space they were in. \"So, how did it feel?\" Floatzel asked. \"Actually, there was a lot of me to put in...I was planning to enjoy that feeling slowly, but it got quickly uncomfortable as they stressed against our body, so I sped it up to get them all off!\" Valerie complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given our combined girth, and change in body shape, well, guess it was no match, huh?\" Floatzel concluded, using his tails to slowly bring about the ruined structures close to their head. \"I don't think I'll be as good at the cruise job as you are, Floaty dear...I've always gotten that feeling that this ship of yours should taste better eaten than worn! Valerie said, while taking a big bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all yours then, Valerie dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should have some too, Floaty? It's been such a dear to you for so long, surely you feel some attachment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you say so, although I'm kind of relieved to be finally rid of this.\" Floatzel sighed lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's coming back to me now...Floaty! Valerie!\" Luxray called out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" they both replied in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot to tell you, Lugia also gave me that warning when I was still working as that electrician. Before I regained my memories.\" Luxray admitted. \"I just shirked it off, thinking it was a mistake...I'm guessing you're going to pay the storm a visit, right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! That's correct, Lux.\" Floatzel shouted. \"Glad to have you back! Normally we'd swim there, but...since we're in your belly right now...\" Floatzel droned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're expecting me to swim out into the open sea with this wide load in my belly?!\" Luxray roared, unable to believe his ears. \"Don't expect too much, I was never really good in the water.\" he said sadly, before beginning to paddle, inching across the water towards the open sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda...we're going to need some help though if we are to make it in time. Oh, I know! I think this could work...\" valerie spoke, closing their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's going on?\" Floatzel said, feeling a cool sensation on his back near his tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie turned their tails to mist, and caused the mist to diffuse through Luxray's own belly. Soon after, Luxray began to feel something growing alongside his little star-tipped tail, it was a plump thick finned tail elongating forth, identical to that of the Floatzel-Vaporeon hybrid's own! As it grew it extended into the water, allowing Luxray to feel a cool, almost alien sensation. Feeling the tail come under his control, he gave it a good stroke, pushing him a good distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I can only lend you one tail for a moment, it's really taxing to maintain one, let alone two.\" Valerie said, continuing to maintain the misting of their tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valerie, don't push yourself too hard, I don't wanna lose you again!\" Floatzel said, getting concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Luxray's a different type than we are so there's some difficulty in transferring features, thus I'm only letting him 'borrow' it for a short while.\" Valerie winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then. I suppose you know where to go, Lux?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..think I do.\" After reassuring himself, he began to swim away from land at a far improved pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff, huff..So what's the plan, you two? I am to drink the oceans with you inside me?\" Luxray asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much! We'll just be sitting back and relaxing as you take us there...hope that's okay with you.\" Valerie said, sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully I don't lose my way or this tail cramps up, then.\" Luxray joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be real stuffed from taking in you both, but I believe my breaking point's way above that.\" Luxray said, continuing to swim out towards the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit Lux! Don't forget if anything happens, give us a holler!\" Floatzel shouted, before being silenced by a mouthful of ship material which Valerie was practically shovelling into their maw.</span></div></div>",

I mean, when Arceus reset everything we were at least the size of a Wailord, even Lugia, whom instigated all of the destruction in the first place seemed to recall the past events, and Arceus left him with a sizable amount of bulk, from what we saw in our visions, so why were you left out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray stopped swimming, he had to pause to think about it, but nothing came to him, he recalled everything so far, even up to the point where Lugia had used Luxray as a means of funneling all of existence into himself, even up to the point where Arceus intervened and prevented Luxray from exploding, but everything past that was a blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know, but it's not like I did anything worse than you lot right?\" Luxray said, as he himself began to question why he was the only one who had forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look bud, don't stress about it too much\" Floatzel said \"Up until just now you didn't even recall being such a glorious size, you probably didn't think it was even possible, and right now, you're the fattest Luxray ever, if you've still got gaps in your memories, they are bound to come back eventually, and even if they don't, just enjoy what's about to come\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, the three of us are about to down the entire ocean, and soon the world itself!\" Luxray said confidently as he began swimming again, this time picking up the pace to make up for lost time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's the Luxray I remember!\" Floatzel cheered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though you are going to cough us back up when we do drain the ocean!\" Floatzel added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'll think about it\" Luxray teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better or else im giving you the biggest bellyache in the world\" Floatzel huffed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see, we'll see\" Luxray chuckled, as he continued on route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray scanned the location ahead with his keen vision, they were nearly at their destination, and everything looked clear, until Luxray's eyes caught sight of something big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guy's it looks like we've got trouble up ahead\" he shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see?\" Floatzel asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Luxray did not respond, as suddenly he was greeted by a massive water funnel, that shot up to the clouds above, as within the funnel a huge figure floated upwards from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's...

The four of us, remember how much we managed to do on our own, even when we were all fighting against each other, imagine our potential if we pooled our resources together, the four of us could be gods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sat there, playing Lugia's words through their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guy's, I say we go for it\" Luxray said \"Nothing ventured nothing gained, besides, none of us thought of a plan to deal with Arceus, as much as I hate to admit it myself, Lugia does seem to be our best bet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're right\" Floatzel sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also going to call Lugia out on his bluff\" Luxray said with a smirk on his face as he glanced up at Lugia \"He's not as powerful as he's saying he is, otherwise he wouldn't be trying to work with us, so if he does try anything funny, I know you two have got my back... or rather my gut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right you are Luxy!\" Valerie cheered \"If he does anything fishy Floaty and I will kick his butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The storm will begin to brew in one hour from now\" Lugia interrupted \"We don't have much prep time, but like I said, Arceus is not the only hurdle we will have to deal with if, so if you are ready, Open up Luxray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I wish it was this easy in the past life we had\" Luxray mused to himself as he opened wide for Lugia to make his way in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia began his descent, head first into Luxray's maw, he pushed himself down whilst lifting Luxray upwards with his psychic powers, Luxray was slightly taken back by how big Lugia was in comparison to himself, his own legs flailed instinctively in response, though even if his stomach felt tight, he knew that it would hold strong, even with Lugia cramming himself in, from the inside, Valerie and Floatzel, decided to help speed up the process by grabbing Lugia's wings and pulling him inwards, which he accepted without any hesitation, the whole situation, amused Lugia as he couldn't help but chuckle as he inched further and further into Luxray's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- o- -uny?\" Luxray asked, his speech was muffled by Lugia's body, whom was now half way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" Lugia spoke, still chuckling a little \"I never once thought I'd ever do this willingly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, Join the club\" Floatzel responded as he gave Lugia one final tug before the rest of him slid into Luxray in a sudden heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray fell back into the water, waves crashing about Luxray's enormous body as the rest of Lugia fell into his stomach with a ripe plop. Luxray couldn't help but also let out a monstrous belch in response. The lardy lion Pokemon sat there floating in the ocean, impressed with his now ever bigger girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Lugia\" Floatzel said staring at Lugia face to face, their stomachs pressed tightly against each other \"This plan of yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Lugia responded \"But first, we all need to be properly psychically linked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia's eyes glowed a deep bright blue, and suddenly they no longer found themselves surrounded by the linings of Luxray's stomach but in a giant pantheon, surrounded by countless galaxies. Valerie, Lugia, Floatzel and Luxray, all sat face to face with each other on thrones big enough to cater to their massive bodies, the four looked as they did in their past lives, bigger than universes themselves. The three  inspected their bodies, pleased with how big they looked, even Lugia himself looked rather content with his appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" Luxray said breaking the silence \"And why aren't you lot in my stomach any more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is my psyche manifested into a physical plane\" Lugia replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, In english?\" Floatzel chimed in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply put, this is kind of like a shared dream\" Lugia explained \"In the real world, we are indeed all still inside Luxray\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you really do dream big\" Luxray teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that for now\" Valerie interrupted \"So what do you want from us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Lugia replied \"I want the same thing you want, to just eat and expand, devouring everything in my path, be it this earth, other planets, the stars, galaxies, and universes, I want them all, I want to gobble it all up, and I don't ever want to have to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you aren't wrong there, that's certainly what I want now\" Luxray said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do we!\" Valerie responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My plan, is for us to become so powerful that we can defeat Arceus and create that reality where we can spend all of eternity stuffing ourselves silly\" Lugia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though to be absolutely honest with you, for the longest time, I only had this planned only for myself, but after failing against Arceus, time, and time again, I realized that I'm going to have to swallow my pride and share my glory, and what a better lot, to share it with than those who've become as big as I have in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is what you wanted all along, why warn us to stay away from the storm?\" Floatzel asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the time, I myself was trying to fight my urges, like you, but when, all three of you made the resolve to go ahead regardless, all self control I had myself broke and I wanted my cut of the cake\" Lugia explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old habits die hard deary\" Valerie replied with an amused sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though, the other issue is, there is now a lot more competition\" Lugia added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Luxray asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you lot remember in the past life when it was just the other Legendary Pokemon, trying to prevent me from succeeding, and you guys\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Luxray replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there are hundreds, if not thousands of Pokemon whom are out there wanting to claim the title of the biggest Pokemon, and will stop at nothing to see it through. To make matters worse, even the humans are finding ways to transform themselves into Pokemon just so they can devour everything, I regret to say it, but one human has gone so far as to obtain my DNA just to turn themselves into a clone of me, and not just me, but the other legendary Pokemon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news is, right now, everything is at a standstill, but once the storm hits, and we drain the ocean, all hell is going to break loose, that is the first hurdle, and I think we should focus dealing with rival Pokemon before we deal with Arceus\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have the advantage once we have drained the ocean though, right?\" Floatzel asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" Lugia replied \"We just need to ensure we keep our advantage of size, but for now, we play the waiting game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with those final words, the group woke up from their dream world, with Luxray sitting in the middle of the ocean with his hugely distended stomach, whilst everyone else was crammed inside his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luxray\" Lugia called out from inside \"Keep an eye out for any activity, let us know the moment you see anything unusual\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood\" Luxray said as his eyes glowed a bright red as he scanned the ocean around him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-Two hours ago-<br>\r\n\"The coast of Slateport, a coastal city in Hoenn, appears to have been overrun by a most unusual sight today - initial reports and footage point to that of an unexpected growth spurt by an already colossally obese Miltank docked at a port belonging to the leading cruise company of the world; which is responsible for one of the most successful yet hugely controversial 'Pokemon Cruises' business venture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miltank, coined the S.S. Moomil by the cruise company, had just returned from its test voyage due to an emergency, and was even delivered personally to port by the S.S. Inflatable, a similarly obese and much larger Floatzel who has been serving in place of the former S.S. Behemoth, which was put out of commission by the same Floatzel a few months ago. The S.S Inflatable then sailed off to an unknown location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cruise company has declined to comment on this matter, saying that investigations are underway, and they have yet to come to a conclusion. We will report again if the situation updates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime rescue teams have been scrambled to save those affected by the disaster, and those who are near the affected area can either assist with the relief efforts, or relocate immediately to another location for their own safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease be careful, everyone. This is the Pokemon News Channel, bringing you the night news!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune was in her own home, alone watching the news on her television whilst laying down lazily on a sofa. \"Ah, Miltank, I did the right thing sending you to that cruise company.\" she mused, whilst reaching for another bag of chocolate bonbons she had left on the table in front of her, amongst empty bags of various other snacks she had guzzled throughout the day at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*munch munch...* Mm. These are simply delicious, I must remember to buy more the next time I go out shopping again.\" June swallowed a mouthful of chocolate confection, licking her lips clean of chocolate as she continued to watch the next TV programme in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden influx of money from letting the company have her Miltank made her a lot more lazy than before, though it wasn't the entire cut of the original offer it was enough to stop her from needing to attend the daily commute everyday, which she hated. Hence she started to live more and more like a couch potato, rarely ever going out unless to buy necessities like food and drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever having so much money to hold on to in a long time made June go wild on her spending, buying lots of new clothes and treating herself to lavish feasts. It was a shame though, she felt, that her body soon outgrew the fancy new clothing she purchased, as her weight quickly sped past 65 kilograms, quite heavy for her height, and the plump trainer would only grow fatter...and wider...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as her own appetite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RIIIIP* * Snap* *Ping!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skirt which was already bursting at their seams tore open with a loud rip, and the night shirt she was wearing immediately lost another button, revealing her own chubby belly as well as her few love handles behind it.<br>\r\n\"Stupid June, told you it was high time to get new clothes!\" the chubby June scolded herself, as she struggled to close the shirt that was formally holding her tummy, but to no avail. Feeling somewhat defeated she scoffed another bonbon into her mouth, chewing it with delight as she felt the chocolatey sweetness brush her tastebuds, before swallowing. She reached for yet another, only for her hand to be met with an empty bag. She tossed the empty bag into the pile in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. It was about time I went out for dinner anyway.\" she switched off the television, and stared out into the nearby window, the moon shining brightly in the clear sky. \"Funny how I barely ate snacks before and now I'm still hungry enough to eat dinner after them! It's crazy.\" June complained, as she took off her shirt and changed into her sweater, which she virtually squeezed into in lieu of her growing chest and waist lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer hooked the plaid skirt around her waist, feeling it barely fit her as it dug in tightly into her own flabby flesh. \"Geez this is tight! But there's nothing better to wear...for now.\" June said to herself, before slipping into her boots, walking out of her door and locking it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chilling breeze blew past her, rustling her hair as she made her way to the main street, the sound of snow crushing beneath her feet.<br>\r\n\"So, I'ma get dinner first, then some fitting clothes...\" she started to counted on her own fingers as she walked.<br>\r\n\"And more snacks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she stumbled upon a buffet restaurant, on its grand opening. She had been monitoring it for quite a while now, and it was about high time it opened.<br>\r\nSo why not? She thought, licking her lips as the appetising smell of grilled meat wafted past her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Time to demolish them on their first day,\"</i> she thought as she gleefully stepped into the restaurant, welcoming the buffet spread and the crowd before her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for *BURP* demolishing them...\" June let out a belch, as she stumbled out of the restaurant, profusely rubbing her fat and swollen stomach after having ate her fill. The trainer walked her way to the nearby department store, her belly still showing from having her sweater retreating upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying and changing into a bigger set of clothes, she placed her old set of duds into the bag they provided her during her shopping trip.<i> \"Won't be needing them anymore, though I'll just keep them as a memento, or if someone wants them.\" </i> June thought as she descended the escalators into the food section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Chips, biscuits, chocolate bonbons, more chocolate bonbons...stop it June, that's quite enough.\"</i> she loaded her shopping basket to the brim and headed for the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune could not help but notice the stares and passing comments she got as she made her way back home with lots of bags in tow filled with nothing more than her precious goodies. \"Pff, as if they've never seen fat girls before, the neighbour living next door's definitely even wider than I am! They're lucky I'm not in a bad mood, unless I'll...never mind.\" she huffed, an breathing out an opaque mist in the cold air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the darkness of the desolate street, a single lone car drove towards her. The black car stopped in front of her, and out stepped two well built men, each in a business suit.<br>\r\n\"G-good evening...who are you?\" she blurted out, somehow knowing they had business to do with her. \"Miss June, correct? You must come with us immediately!\" one of the men spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh eh? What do you mean?\" she took a step back in retreat, while the men took two towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with us peacefully into the vehicle and you will not be harmed. We'll explain things along the way.\" one of the men assured her, while approaching the trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare touch me.\" she affirmed, while putting her arms up in a defensive position. June was clearly scared with the suddenness and mystery in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't much time! Look, the President is expecting you.\" the man asked again, almost about to reach for the taser in his pocket.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"President?! C-could it be...Fine. I'll come with you.\" June said, as she walked slowly over to the open door of the car, with the man closely following her, and the other one getting back into the driver's seat. She eased herself into the plush leather seat, and buckled the safety belt as the man closed the door with a solid bang. He then opened the door on the other side of the car, sitting directly on June's right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" On the man's word, the driver put his foot to the pedal, and they drove off. \"Right, Miss June, I am sure you are familiar with the Pokemon Cruise program that has been running for a good while now-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! And my dear Miltank's in it. How is she doing?\" June perked up. \"About her...Let's just say she's been taken off the program, perhaps permanently, until we can find a solution. I'm sure you've seen what's on the news...\" the man shook his head.<br>\r\n\"That bad, huh...I'm sorry to hear that.\" June said, a little dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth is, we have been working on a side project alongside this one, and you being a close partner of the President, he has personally invited you to be a part of it.\" the man explained. \"Normally it was kept under wraps, but there were...complications, and we are desperately seeking contacts to assist us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-assist you? What can I do anyway? I'm just a mere trainer. Maybe you've got the wrong person for the job, mister, shouldn't you be seeking out researchers or something?\" June sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those we have enough of...suitable test subjects, not so much...\"<br>\r\nJune gulped hard at 'test subjects', shuddering at the thought. What if they open her up or something, inject her with uncertified chemicals, or worse? She reached for a granola bar in one of her shopping bags, opening it and taking a big bite of it to calm her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are almost there. The President will discuss the terms with you.\" The man said, before they drove into an underground car park.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter the car was parked, June was led into an elevator by the same two men, and together the descended. How many levels deep down they went, she did not really know, but she could feel her ears popping a couple of times, giving her slight discomfort. One minutes later the lift door sprung open, and the two men exited the elevator in unison, with June following behind them, with her shopping bags still in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo June the place looked like one giant laboratory, the kind that one would normally see in that of science fiction settings. Things like glass windows, solid automated sliding doors were a dime a dozen here, as well as the indiscernable chatter of scientists discussing matters, and the constant whirr of machinery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, young visitor, you must be Miss June.\" The receptionist said, sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally someone with a little respect around here...\" June mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To avoid clutter in this facility you must deposit your bags you are carrying here. Do you mind placing them on this counter here? We will put them in utmost safekeeping.\" the receptionist lady said, pointing to a shorter part of her counter on her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune put down her shopping bags, as well as the designer messenger bag she always used to contain her personal belongings and Pokemon.<br>\r\n\"This is your personal bag, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune nodded. \"Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we scan it and clear it for entry, you may carry it with you.\" the lady said, as she picked up an electronic device in the shape of a long bar, sliding it across June's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, it seems you have Pokemon with you. Try not to take them out please, unless absolutely necessary. Other than that you are clear for entry.\" The receptionist said as she handed June back her bag, which she slung back onto her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The President will meet you shortly. In the meantime, gentlemen, please escort the young lady here into the waiting room.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiting area she was brought to wasn't really that all spacious, but it was pretty well furnished with sofa chairs surrounding a great wooden table. And on that table was a big glass bowl of sweets and other treats, which the plump trainer had her eyes trained on it the moment they entered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonbons!\" June almost squealed as she pushed aside the sofa chair, approaching the edge of the table while reaching for the sweet bowl at the centre, her belly softly squishing against the table. She dragged it towards her and sat down, picking out the ones she liked most, which was, well, almost the entire bowl's contents anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Limited Edition Velvet Red...\" she read the label on the packet before tearing it open and popping the bonbon into her mouth. \"Damn, it's really as good as the reviews say.\" June commented, closing her eyes in bliss savouring the confection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men in the room which brought her here said nothing as they stood guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening Mr. President!\" The two men got off their sofa chairs and bowed, their strong voices causing her to choke a little on the next bonbon. \"Leave us be.\" the man dressed in a more posh looking suit commanded, and they left the waiting room, the door closing slowly behind  them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"June. It has been a while since we last met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune only nodded, not sure what to do as she was in the middle of her bonbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they did not cause too much trouble to you.\" The President pulled out the sofa chair, and took a seat near June. At that moment she swallowed, clearing her mouth. June then shoved the wrappers into her skirt pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. President...oh, no worries. I got here just fine.\" she smiled. \"Let me fill you in on why you're here. I would like to seek your cooperation on this project. It is most urgent!\" The President said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...how can I help?\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth is, ever since that Floatzel showed up and became the S.S Inflatable, we have been trying to recruit other Pokemon to join the fleet as well, but none of them were really as successful or strangely cooperative as him. We were anticipating the moment of when he would get bored and leave, and it has happened. We need this project to succeed more than ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is this project of yours really?\" June questioned.<br>\r\n\"It is in fact, not as legal as one might think. It involves human experimentation, and as such finding willing members are difficult, even with our capital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you called me along?\" the trainer pointed to herself with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we think you are a superb candidate. While your Miltank may not have an excellent track record now, when you brought her to us I was sure you knew what made them tick. But understanding isn't the key now, we need results, and while the theory is sound the product is inconclusive. Unstable.\" the President explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our scientists have discovered a way to turn humans into Pokemon, and if done right not only will the subject be metamorphosed into a Pokemon of choice, but will also retain memories and mental stability, as well as full control over that Pokemon's potential powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What? Forgive me but that sounds totally insane!\" June said as she slumped into her sofa.</span></div></div>",

It is an urgent request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...right away sir. All right people get to work!\" the lab supervisor said before cutting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will guide you to the labs. Godspeed.\" Just as the President finished speaking the same two men entered the room. \"Follow us, Miss June. Don't leave anything behind.\" one of the men said, as June got up and walked towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Still not liking them.</i> June thought.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're the next 'volunteer' hmm?\" Said the lab supervisor as he came face to face with the chubby trainer, whilst taking notes on his clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. Here you go.\" June said, tossing the Pokeball towards the old man, who promptly caught it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a member of the newly discovered Fairy type species...couldn't believe we had to buy new editions of encyclopediae to make up for reclassifications of Pokemon.\" he sighed heavily. \"But enough of that. I will now send it out. Make sure it won't attack me?\" he said, a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, gramps. He won't hurt a fly unless he's battling.\" June shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\" the old man depressed the button on the Pokeball and it opened, sending out a bright flash of light, which quickly materialised into the form of that of a Slyveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnificent. Now he should be stepping into that chamber on the right. Tell him to relax and everything will be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe somewhat overweight Slyveon, brought up this way due to June's own fantasies, looked up towards his trainer, unsure. \"It's okay. Just relax and go in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slyveon stepped into the chamber, which closed soon after with a clang. \"And now your turn Miss, the chamber on the left.\" June put down her bag on the floor, and took a deep breath. \"Here goes nothing.\" she mumbled, and stepped into the chamber, facing the supervisor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will attempt to merge your Slyveon with your own self, using a technology based off the prototype by Bill himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it going to be painful?\" June asked, as the chamber closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, quite. But you won't feel it as we'll put the both of you under heavy anaesthesia while it happens. Trust me. You'll need it.\"<br>\r\n\"That's reassuring...ugh...\" June sighed as gas filled the chamber, making her woozy as she inhaled it, falling unconscious.</span></div></div>",

The barrier can no longer be maintained!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excessive power draw from Lab 6, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At a time like this? The subject is out of control! If we don't restore power soon- activate the Shadow Ball launchers! Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no good! They're locked down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emergency, EMERGENCY!!\" The scientists panicked, as the test subject broke containment with a powerful psychic burst, shattering the glass windows and sending the door flying, as well as anyone who happened to be in the vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the ensuing fire, smoke and destruction of the lab, out stepped a figure, it was a Lugia! The scientists had indeed managed to engineer a Pokemon-human transformation, but it was extremely hostile so they kept it caged, until now..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class 1 Alert. All personnel must evacuate immediately.\" rang a monotone voice from the announcement system. The living remaining scientists scrambled for the escape shuttles, gathering the wounded and whoever else they could save.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, wake up, you must wake up now!\" shouted a voice, which June heard ringing through her ears. Opening her eyes, she saw the lab supervisor trying to wake her amidst the chaos, clearly injured as he bled profusely from his shoulder, his labcoat heavily soaked in blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's...going on...?\" June asked, dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something...terrible has happened. The lab, not safe any more. There are escape shuttles to the west of this lab. You must get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about you...gramps?\" June asked, as she slowly got up, feeling a little weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind about me. I'm an old man now, and I won't last any longer with this wound here...the least I can do is cover your escape.\" he coughs heavily, as he picks up a pistol from the floor.<br>\r\n\"But, gramps! Gramps!\" June shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot...to tell you, it was a great success! Even if I were to pass away here it would have been worth it. You need to leave now. Everything you need is in your bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her own hands though, she saw that the old man was right - she indeed had a set of fuzzy, pastel yellow coloured paws! <i>\"Now's not the time to check myself out...\"</i> June thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay safe now. Don't let our efforts go to waste.\" he smiled weakly, as he reached out a hand to help June up, before heading out of the lab, pistol ready in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune gave her bag a brief check, and put the bag on her shoulder. She took a step only to find herself trip, not used to the gait of her changed body. \"Ow...\" she grimaced, as she picked herself up once more and set off for the escape shuttles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is. Step in, now.\" the old man motioned to June, who promptly stepped into the solid metal pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will take you back to the surface, everyone else who is still alive should have evacuated by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Climb aboard while you still can!\" June shouted, reaching out a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late...Oh no, it's coming!\" the old man shouted back, as he slammed the 'Launch' button on the wall, closing the shuttle doors and causing June to leap back in shock. \"No! There is still time...\" June pounded on the door with both arms, but it was no use. The shuttle launch sequence had been activated, and there was no turning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it comes...goodbye, everyone.\" the old man sighed, before aiming his pistol at the approaching figure, pressing the trigger a couple of times, and out from the pistol fired a few miniature Shadow Balls, causing the Lugia creature to faze for a short while, before shrugging them off and counterattacking him with a psychic grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh...uggg...\" he winced in pain, as the Lugia levitated him with a tight grip to his neck, his pistol dropping to the ground as he was being strangulated. The Lugia then flung his lifeless body against a wall, before dashing over to the escape shuttles, only to realise they had all taken off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...will stop...objective...\" the Lugia hissed, as he began to focus immense power, intending to break out of the underground lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, if only I was able to do something...*sniff*\" June sobbed, tears rolling down her cheeks as she laid back against the wall of the shuttle, feeling helpless as the shuttle continued to take flight, speeding upwards along the shaft to the surface at blazing speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cry, now...dry your tears and think of what to do next, June!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Who said that?\" June broke out of her trance, surprised. Wasn't she the only one in the shuttle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Slyveon, June! Open the bag, I'm inside.\" continued the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how did you...\" June opened the bag as she was told to, and found her Pokeballs still intact. \"So...you didn't die or anything during the process?\" the Slyveon morph said, feeling quite relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -was- kinda scared when I entered, but I don't think anything bad happened to me back there. It was like sleeping, but a dreamless sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, that's a load off my back. Sorry for roping you into this.\" she sighed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you getting used to your new...body, June?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it feels quite different to walk in, for starters.\" June replied, while reaching for a hand mirror she kept in her bag. \"I should see for myself how I appear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune could see in the mirror that her head was indeed that of a Slyveon's, her pastel red ears sprouting from the top of her head, as well as a cute ribbon with long straps attached to the left one. Checking out her face was a pair of pastel blue eyes, strangely shallow and simple in appearance compared to a lot of other Pokemon, which made her cringe a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is the new me.\" June said, as she continued to check out the rest of her body. Fur now covered her from head to toe, and her legs now resembled the hind legs of a quadpedal creature, characteristic of the Pokemon she had wanted to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pretty ribbon with long straps was also attached to her neck, along with a pastel red, flowing tail trailing from her tailbone, lifting up her skirt when it was upright. Top to bottom she was a Slyveon, but her body was somewhat elongated compared to one, and her secondary features, like her prominent chest and belly, were still there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not sure what to make of this, but...I look fabulous...\" June blushed, as she took in the adverse changes to her own form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you're done checking out yourself, lady, maybe I could show you a trick or two.\" the Slyveon chirped from the Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lugia soon broke free from the confines of the lab, taking to the skies. He took flight towards the ocean, ignoring the glowing escape shuttles as they illuminated the cloudless skies. \"Must...have what is...rightfully ours.\" The Lugia mumbled, his body glowing with a purple hue, as he glided off, flapping his wings.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Lugia let out a ear shattering screech as it set its course to the sea, more specifically to the exact location that Floatzel, Valerie Luxray and the real Lugia awaited. It was almost as if it instinctively knew of the impending storm and its potential of unfathomable power and size, however, unlike his actual counterpart, this cloned purple Lugia was rather skinny. During its time imprisoned in lab, its meals were harshly rationed, the scientists feared that allowing it to eat a steady amount would only serve to cause it to frenzy even more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow wrong they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must... have what is... rightfully ours\" It growled again, as it took a detour from its destination as something on the mainland had caught its attention, it was a factory, one that specialized in Pokemon food for larger Pokemon. This 'Shadow Lugia' let loose a hyperbeam blasting a massive hole at the front of the door, and it casually strolled inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no people inside the factory, as it was late at night, and it didn't take it long to find a cache of food, and it almost literally dived into it to guzzle down  the food's that were stored away. Various types of Berries super-sized, giant PokeBlocks, Poffins as big as cakes, as well as insanely huge Pokepuffs, which seemed to be a new food sensation, all of them the Shadow Lugia guzzled down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must... have what is... rightfully ours\" it said again as it stuffed itself with obscene amounts of food, its whole body expanding with fat in the process, as this food was designed to actually cause Pokemon to gain weight. With this 'new world' humans were actively encouraging their Pokemon to gain weight, as they noticed that not only did their Pokemon seem to enjoy the extra weight, but it made them substantially more Powerful, even if it was at the cost of some mobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the amount Shadow Lugia was guzzling down, it's whole body took up the entire factory in no time. Finding itself stuck, it instinctively chomped against the wall, finding itself able to eat it with relative ease, it decided to devour the entire factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... isn't enough\" It grunted \"I deserve more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Lugia without any effort, took flight once again, almost as if its massive girth was not even there. In a matter of half an hour it had gone from a scrawny looking thing to something that rivaled its original counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can sense it, it is coming, I must claim it, it is mine\" It spoke in human tounge <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Meanwhile at the location---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish this 'storm' would hurry up, I'm getting pretty sick of being in the water\" Luxray complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its not so bad Lux\" Valerie said in her usual cheerful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for you guys, but I'm no water type\" He grumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only fifteen more minutes, besides we're all inside your belly, so you have no right to complain\" Lugia chimed in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, though I could get used to this\" Luxray sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his eyes caught a glimpse of something heading straight towards them, it was something big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guy's you are not going to believe this, but there is a massive purple Lugia heading straight towards us\" Luxray shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY MINE\" It screeched as it shot another hyperbeam directly at Luxray, however fortunately for Luxray, Lugia had stepped in and put a barrier around Luxray to protect him from the powerful attack, Luxray let out a roar as it fired a massive bolt of lightning towards the Shadow Lugia. It responded in the same way by placing a barrier around itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall not take it, it is MINE\" it roared as it fired off hyperbeam after hyperbeam, which Luxray countered with his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you knew Hyperbeam Lux\" Floatzel said to him, whom due to his subtle link with Luxray via Valeries abilities, could see the battle unfolding from Luxray's perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, yeah, I learn't it specifically to deal with a massive Charizard who used to always pick on me, one hyperbeam to the face, put him in his place\" Luxray boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luxray, permission to take control of this fight?\" Lugia asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so\" Luxray panted, as the attacks he let out had already taken a lot out of him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia, using the same technique as Valerie, turned himself into mist and seeped out from Luxrays entire body, however he began to reform around Luxray itself, it almost looked as if Luxray was turning into Lugia himself, and in a matter of moments Luxray found himself the one inside Lugia's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's the big idea!\" Luxray growled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look just trust me on this one, This is only for the sake of battle, I promise once this is over I'll let you gobble me up again, I'll even sit in there for a while after we've drained the ocean\" Lugia reasoned, as he took flight himself and avoided another Hyperbeam from Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first, if I can avoid any conflict at all I will\" Lugia grunted.</span></div></div>",

But you must realise it's pointless when we could be working together-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia shut himself up to defend against another incoming Hyperbeam from their aggressor. \"We will claim what is rightfully ours!

Accomplishing this goal is impossible alone-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are supreme! Not even the almighty Arceus will defeat us!!\" the Shadow Lugia howled, the purple aura around him intensifying, causing the clouds in the vicinity to grow darker, blotting out the full moon in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Guess you've heard of him already too. Listen. He wields infinitesimally more power over the cosmos than any of us here, so you'll be defeated if you go so foolishly alone against him! And he won't just kill you or anything, he will either restart the cycle with a clean slate or simply grant your wish in a doomed, eternal fashion! We have experienced this before, and we seek to end it. If you join us, we will gain a greater chance to succeed.\" Lugia reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" the Shadow Lugia ceased his assault to consider his offer, much to Lugia's surprise. \"And how would you suppose I cooperate with you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall begin by draining this ocean, together, and consequently the cosmos and beyond, until we come face to face with the deity himself. By then our sizes should allow us to wield a collective power greater than him, and we will defeat him, creating a new era, new universes, with our purpose, will and name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This offer I find hard to refuse. Very well. I will join you and your company and scourge existence together. But if you double-cross me, do not expect you and your friends to escape with your lives.\" the Shadow Lugia growled, as he descended into the ocean, causing some huge waves as he immersed, with Lugia descending as well near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not make me change my mind now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I ask that you enter my stomach and join them within.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that is...\" the Shadow Lugia paused, but realised his words were no longer sounding illogical as he detected huge life signs in Lugia's belly, which were Luxray, Floatzel and Valerie. \"As you wish.\" the Shadow Lugia spoke, as he channeled a dark beam onto Lugia's blue engorged belly, causing it to swell out even more profusely as he transferred his physical form into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done...oooh.\" Lugia let out a short moan, as he felt his belly now extending large enough to brush the seabed. \"Welcome to the company, eh, Shadow Lugia?\" Floatzel chirped as he welcomed the new addition to their feasting party. \"Name too long. Better call me by...'Charos'.\" he affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charos...got it.\" the both of them nodded. \"Say, Lugia, that was amazing. Instead of making an enemy we made a friend in the process!\" Floatzel chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You flatter me. Oh, what's this...\" Lugia could feel another psychic disturbance, this time in the water. \"I sense it, it is fast approaching!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, already? We should get ready then! One ocean for us, and an enormous leap into the cosmos!\" Valerie shouted excitedly, drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you and Floatzel ought to take point. While inside of you we'll clear any blockages and enjoy the comfort inside...\" said Lugia, as he misted himself back inside while allowing the Floatzel-Vaporeon hybrid to mist out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such greatness after a long time...\" it's amazing. Floatzel said, as he allowed their tails and belly to contact the seabed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed! Let's do this!\" Valerie said, and just at that moment, a lightning bolt struck the sea to their right, causing a gigantic whirlpool to instantly manifest, pulling them gradually towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that a tingle I felt back there?\" Floatzel wondered. \"Me too, Floaty. That's where we have to go!\" Valerie said while pushing their tails along the seabed, bringing them to the edge of the still growing whirlpool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven their near-continental form was easily carried along with the might of the whirlpool as they entered, causing them to swirl into the eye of it in a spiraling motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they descended, they noticed several other Pokemon, all humongously fattened and attempting to claim the ocean for themselves, but when they were drawn into the centre they would inflate for a short moment before they painfully burst inside and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder were either sucked in courtesy of the duo, along with the seawater they were guzzling in by the cubic mile even without the aid of the whirlpool, or simply stuck against the deep folds of their own blubbery body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep the food coming you two!\" Luxray shouted, as they competed for the constant influx of smaller fat Pokemon and seawater.</span></div></div>",

You made it out alive!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What? Who are you, show yourself!\" June looked around, her, but she saw no one. \"Stay calm. Shortly after your transformation we surgically implanted a transmitter in your ear canal. I am speaking from a faraway location right now, safe from the disaster site.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\" June asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"June, human speak please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I- oh, was I speaking Pokemon all this while without realising it?\" June spoke, as she looked at the Slyveon that stepped out with her, pawing his neck with a yellow glow on his paw, coughing once loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune did the same, and spoke once more. \"Can you hear me now? Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better. This is the President. The situation has turned dire much faster than we expected. Our plans must adapt. The in-command will fill you in on the details on what you must do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"June.

What must I do?\"<br>\r\n\"Let's just say I used to be the steward on board the S.S. Inflatable. Used to, since he has gone rogue. We have confirmed that the storm has arrived, and it is no ordinary storm. Our suspicions are that he is going to use it to funnel the ocean into himself and cause a global catastrophe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just one bad news after the other...\" June said, as she picked up her bag and made her way out of the park, wading through the body-deep snow after recalling her Slyveon. \"So where do I fit into all this? Surely not going to fight that thing head on?!\"<br>\r\n\"You're right, that would be suicide...for now.\" the officer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now?! What the heck do you mean?\" June shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen closely. The world's leaders have declared, though reluctantly, that the only way left to protect ourselves is to fatten Pokemon to the point they can cover entire cities with their own bodies. Physical walls and conventional weapons as you can see are worthless and perhaps even beneficial for them as you already know, so we sadly have to rely on this strategy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So- great, you're implying I have to grow my ass huge enough to use my hometown as a seat?! Have you ever thought about my safety, future- and oh, all that shame?\" June screamed, totally flushed red and embarrassed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. No one is really there left to watch. They have all been evacuated underground, leaving you free to grow without hurting anyone. You should head for the port of Snowpoint now, where the S.S Inflatable used to dock at. There should be something there that can aid you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Then what of the other cities?\" June said, as she got on all fours to maximise her speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pokemon are now being grown to smother them...except for Slateport, which has already been covered by your Miltank, which is simply too happy to be of service, and your own hometown of Snowpoint. Godspeed.\" the officer finished before cutting off communications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...come back! Grrr...well, maybe I'll get to see my darling cow if I make it through this mess...just...not in the way I'd thought...\" June growled, as she dashed towards the port.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ah, here we are. June sighted the port buildings, docks and two oversized docks, one greatly bigger than the other, whose former purposes already made obvious. \"Don't even feel tired! This body is amazing.\" June said proudly, as she walked on two feet slowly towards the metal wire gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, it's locked.\" she said, grabbing the padlock with both of her front paws and forcing it downwards once- only to have the lock break.<br>\r\n \"Geez, don't even know my own strength. Oh well.\" June sighed, as she was about to toss the lock away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat it. Probably it'll taste like candy.\" the Slyveon spoke from the Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you gone crazy? This is not food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not back then, but you must now eat everything to survive!\" the Slyveon said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nngh..\" June groaned, as she grimaced at the thought of taking bites out of a solid padlock. \"Whatever...\" she said forcing the gates open, before putting the padlock to her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe padlock was long gone and in her belly before she reached the first warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it'll be here in the first building...who'd have knew being a Slyveon made everything taste like sweets?!\" June said chomping on the metal shutters, making a hole for herself to enter, her plump belly jiggling as she stuffed herself with normally inedible objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this feels really good~\" June moaned, as rubbed her fuzzy belly with a paw and walked into the barely illuminated warehouse. It was then a great blaze shot through the air from the darkness, which June barely managed to evade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pokemon here? What has the company been doing?!\" June shouted, squinting into the darkness she could make out faint figures of some Pokemon, obviously fattened up due to their rotund shape, and exceeding the size of the Slyveon morph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMultiple fires soon shot out as the Pokemon charged towards her, June dodging pretty much everything directed at her with sharpened reflexes and improved acrobatics, although one of them managed to score a hit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Crap!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought, when the fireball simply dissipated upon coming into close proximity with her fur, itself emitting an invisible barrier which protected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that happen? Perhaps...\" June walked towards the Pokemon which revealed themselves, now cowering before June. \"I...see now. You guys are all Dragons? Perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly. The rest captive with us were too afraid to break out, so we led the charge and helped them out.\" spoke a Dragonair, her body thickened like a bratwurst, only as large as a truck. \"Who are you, exactly? You're neither human nor Pokemon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm..what I am doesn't matter. I'm looking for something that will help save my city. Something to blimp me up to a size where I can do just that.\" June sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do not think we can help you. We have finished the food stores in here and we are moving on to find more.\" the Dragonair said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it has come to this...\" June shook her head, her ears flopping about as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here, if you don't help me, you all probably won't have a future to hold on to. Because either that thing going to guzzle the ocean will have you for snacks, or...I will!\" June smirked.</span></div></div>",

Even if you are superior in type, there is no way you'll fit us into your jaws at your size!\" the Dragonair laughed, with the other dragons mocking June in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Grrr, guess nothing ever comes easy. She's right, though, I won't have a chance, unless...ah, I've got it!\"</i> June thought, as she reached into her bag. \"Slyveon, come close. I've got something to tell you...\" June whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What is it?\" Slyveon said, bemused, his ears perked as he listened to his trainer. \"Oh? Mmhm. Gotcha. Be ready then.\" the Fairy Pokemon nodded, as he dug his hind foot into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what seemed like a fraction of a second, Slyveon-June drew out a couple of Heavy Balls from her bag, and flung them towards the group of Dragon Pokemon before her. \"What the-\" the Dragonair was caught off guard, as the incoming Heavy Ball came into contact with her, opening up and capturing her in a bright flash of light, alongside the rest grouped up with her. June's Slyveon then leapt forward, sprinting toward the scattered Heavy Balls with their catch inside and rounding them up, with June running towards the pool of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"One, two, three..\"</i> June thought as she knelt down, maw prone against the floor counting the Heavy Balls as Slyveon pushed them one by one into his trainer's gaping maw, the trainer swallowing them gleefully. <i>\"Six, seven!\"</i> She thought happily as she swallowed the last of the Heavy Balls containing her prey, with Slyveon backing a good distance behind his trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time no-\" Slyveon-June was interrupted with the Heavy Balls opening one after the other, causing her plump belly to blimp out as it attempted to contain the fat Dragon Pokemon that took form within the confines of her stomach. Her brand new clothes were soon no more, exposing her fur covered voluminous flesh as it expanded with reckless abandon. Her growth ceased when the Dragon Pokemon were finally inside her stomach, struggling and shouting as they attempted to escape their captor, but to no avail. \"That's what you get for- *URRRRP*\" the trainer let out a huge belch, as she pat her profusely swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, for you left over there- *BRAAAP*\" said Slyveon-June, as she practically slurped up her now useless clothing, leather boots, gloves and all, while waddling herself towards the terrified obese Salamance chomping on the wall of the warehouse, trying to make an exit. \"You're all mine now~\" she slurped, giving the Dragon Pokemon a good lick on the face before she chomped down on him, her maw stretching wider and wider as she gulped down the massive Salamance one roll at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uwaah, I feel so full!\" Slyveon-June sighed, as she slumped down on her back, feeling beat yet triumphant, as her belly took up a good portion of the huge warehouse, almost hitting the roof. <br>\r\n\"If it wasn't for this...body, I'd probably burst trying to fit them all in!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the Dragon Pokemon within her, fired off blasts of energy within her in an attempt to break free, but they harmlessly rebounded against her stomach walls - worse for them, a good fraction of which was absorbed and converted by her body into tons upon tons of fat instantly packing upon the Slyveon morph's body, filling her out into a more balanced and even heavier ball of fuzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune could not help but close her eyes and purr, enjoying the sensation as her body expanded outwards, her body completely covering the floor and having nowhere else to go, began to creep up the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, after the massive gain of permanent fat on her frame, her body's digestion rate shot up, and soon the Dragon Pokemons' wails were no more, as they were almost instantly digested into even more blubber on her fuzzy body, padding her butt, thighs, and her already ridiculous chestline as her belly emptied, smoothening itself out. At that moment her situation turned from a cozy sleaze into a tight squeeze, as the Slyveon morph's body took up the whole of the warehouse, with her enormous tail and some of her butt now poking out of the shutters of the warehouse whence she came in from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umph...I have to make more room for myself.\" June mumbled as her head and ears smooshed against the roof of the warehouse, creaking loudly as her weight gain continued to climb. Taking a massive chomp out of the metallic roof, the ceiling burst open outwards, spilling forth the fuzzy, bloated mass that was Slyveon-June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune's Slyveon that had escaped the warehouse, in reaction to her growth spurt, saw the roof suddenly burst outwards, barely dodging a hunk of debris and metal beams. <i>\"Whoa, my heart skipped a beat there.\"</i> he thought, as he kept an even further distance from her. It was good for him to, though, as the walls of the warehouse came crashing down at once soon after, with the obese Slyveon-June's fat form now free to spread outwards, totally smothering the fallen walls with her blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that the situation has finally calmed itself down, Slyveon himself leapt up the body of his now even larger trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel, June?\" Slyveon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Slyveon, I feel like I'm on top of the world, literally! I could live like this forever~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it happen, then, you're on your first steps to greatness!\" Slyveon said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true...although it seems I'm really far away from what I need to achieve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"All of you who struck me down for how big I was, look who's living the life now.\"</i> June smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would-you-all-just STOP trying to EAT me?!\" Miltank (formerly the S.S.Moomil) roared, as she butted heads with another similarly fattened Swampert, who had just eaten some of the Pokemon that was intended to smother Hoenn - the Cow Pokemon did eat a good portion of those as well, but that was in defence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be the one and only one to cover this world, none of you are even good in the water!\" the Swampert howled back. \"The world will be better off with you all in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't really want to do this, but since you all struck first...in my belly you go now! Along with all you troublemakers before!\" Miltank shouted, as she butted away the Swampert, and opened her maw wide to engulf his enormous flabby face, with the rest of his slimy, blubbery body and fins following soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who's...*BRAAAAP* N-next?!\" Miltank growled, exhausted and feeling near to her breaking point as she downed the seemlingly last of the challengers. No one answered. Feeling that she was in the clear for now, she heaved a huge sigh of relief...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was because, there were no others left - she had eaten all of them in the resulting chaos, leaving her only to smother the continent on her own. \"I hope I didn't overdo it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is the situation? Did you really go on ahead and- Ah, you really did!\" snapped the Steward over her communications system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was so not my fault! They started it!\" Miltank rebuked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well. Hey, you might want to speak to your trainer, June. Patching you through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, June? Really? This is some sort of joke ain't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*bzzt bzzt*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Miltank? It has been a while, isn't it?\" June chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...is that you? You sound so different...! So clear too, despite being on the radio!\" Miltank said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfeh, that's probably because I'm not using their stupid translation system. I'm talking to you one on one, in Poke-talk. I turned myself into a Slyveon with their help, and now I'm helping them out, too.\" June spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junie dear, it has been a lifelong dream of mine to be able to communicate with you on this level! I have to say this though, I am a little scared. I want to eat, but I don't wanna be eaten! ..So where are you now? Are you safe and sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly. *CRACK MUNCH GULP*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, is that...are you eating everything too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, I sure am. *slurp* Soon I'll be joining paws with you all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But good grief, you're all continents so quick!~ It'll take forever for me to catch up!\" June groaned, as she polished off the remains of the first warehouse, and yet she would barely fill one of the berths at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One step at a time, June...\" Slyveon himself shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to help you out, June! But you're so far away at the moment, and I can't leave my post, so it's either you grow your way here, or I do so!\" said Miltank, as she gazed upon the choppy, stormy ocean ahead, the blue mass of Floatzel's and Valerie's tail having just grown big enough to poke her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway into emptying the entirety of the ocean, the flow of water slowed down enough (or was simply on par with their size now) for Floatzel himself to catch a break.<br>\r\n\"You doing well, Val?\" Floatzel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still am! It's a miracle we haven't been attacked once though. What is going on, Lugia?\" Valerie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem that they have joined hands and began covering the land masses, in order to slow down our growth.\" both Lugia and the Shadow Lugia, Charos, responded together. They then turned to stare at each other with mild annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my line.\" Lugia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, but that was mine too. We are both Lugia, and we think alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Lugia sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Covering them? With what?\" Valerie wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None other than Pokemon themselves. They have taken to the roots of pure gluttony, just as we have...it will only be a matter of time before they start devouring the continents into themselves, and we can make short work of them!\" Lugia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! More for us!\" Luxray said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so hasty though. Maybe we could recruit some of the willing ones into our ranks.\" Charos interjected.</span></div></div>",

In almost perfect sync, the five 'combined' Pokemon let out a belch that shook the entire earth to the core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing\" Valerie exclaimed, exhilarated that she, had drained almost the entire ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not wrong there\" Luxray added as he let loose another belch that caused Floatzel and Valeries stomachs to rumble and by proxy force them to let out another belch themselves. The lion pokemon was twice the size of both Lugia's by the end of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't of left some over for us, I mean we were doing the hard word for the last leg of it\" Charos growled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... um, Sorry\" Luxray grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry about it\" Lugia said as he gave Luxrays stomach a firm pat \"We'll have plenty of opportunities to catch back up, and probably leave you the small one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Luxray was about to retort on Lugia's statement, the earth beneath them began to tremble, fissures on the damp earth cracked from all around them, there was something below them, something big. The tremors got more violent and a lot of Pokemon that had escaped being sucked into the whirlpool, fell through the cracks in the earth, some falling to their doom, whilst the more larger Pokemon merely got stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance a jet of lava shot up from the ground, showering Floatzel and Valerie in clumps of red hot magma, which to them felt like being under a warm shower, the lava suddenly dissipated leaving a massive hole in the ground, which suddenly started growing larger and larger, suddenly a head emerged from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Groudon?\" Charos uttered, sensing its presence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like the sound of that at all\" Lugia snarled \"Quickly, everyone inside my stomach now, I'll deal with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Floaty and I can do this\" Valerie declared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not leaving that up to chance, please let me deal with this\" Lugia insisted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, you better deal with this quickly\" Valerie warned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray and Charos obliged, as they allowed Lugia to gulp them down swiftly, the Lugia's stomach rapidly expanding in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bit of deja vu going on here\" Luxray commented as Lugia finally crammed him into his stomach, slurping his tail down like a long noodle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright now you two\" Lugia called out to Valerie and Floatzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\" Val said, as she turned her massive bulk into a thick mist and, funneled herself and Floatzel into Lugia's open maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia wanted to sit back and enjoy this swift expansion, but with Groudon emerging from the earth itself being a potential threat, he had to keep focused, but that still couldn't prevent him from giving off a stupid grin of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get used to this kind of treatment\" Floatzel reminded him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\" Lugia said as he shook his head, as the last of the mist that was Valerie and Floatzel poured into Lugias stomach, reforming, to join Luxray and Charos. As they reformed back onto a solid state, for some reason both Valerie and Floatzel unmerged, Leaving Floatzel the same size as Luxray, whereas Valerie was more closer to Charos size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why did we unmerge?\" Floatzel replied in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, but just shooting in the dark, the sea water probably has something to do with it as well as our size, I'm sure once our bodies get used to being this big again we'll be right.\" Valerie suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so\" Floatzel said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Lugia watched as Groudon continued for force his way to the surface, eating the ground around him to help. But as he got bigger and pushed his way closer to the surface, Lugia noticed that it wasn't Groudon at all, but instead it was a massive Arcanine, which only served to confuse Lugia even more, since he could definitely sense groudons presence. That's when it dawned on him. This Arcanine had probably devoured Groudon, and the two were working together much like how he, Luxray, Charos, Floatzel and Valerie were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one sudden burst, the Arcanine caused an eruption of lava from beneath him to push himself to the surface, his size literally rivaling that of Lugia's. Lugia finally got a good look at the Arcanine, and on closer inspection, both the Arcanine and the Groudon were merged as one, the Arcanine wearing Groudon's scales as some sort of armor, and unlike most Arcanines whom sported a black stomach, this Arcanines stomach matched its face and tail fur, being a light cream color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lugia! Yet again the feast has begun!\" Groudons voice boomed \"And you've fattened yourself up quite nicely for me, as I do enjoy \"Foie gras a la Lugia\" you see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia simply growled at such a comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does sound wonderful\" The Arcanine replied back \"When do we eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be so hasty\" Groudon replied \"You see I'd hate for you to eat a meal that isn't even cooked properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you even get to that size?\" Lugia interrupted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lava\" Groudon replied flatly \"For your ocean of water, above, there was an equivalent ocean of lava below\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Groudon spoke, the Arcanines stomach began to churn and swell. From what Lugia could gather, Groudon was powering up the Arcanine by pumping even more lava into the Arcanines belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we are done with you Lugia, the two of us will devour the rest of this world\" Groudon declared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And from there I, 'Fenrir' will live up to my name and devour the sun itself, but not just this sun, every single sun in the universe\" The Arcanine declared, as Groudon continued to pump him up with more and more lava.</span></div></div>",

Never have I felt so <b>huge</b> in my entire life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside Miltank was a similarly enlarged Lapras, her rolls upon rolls of underbelly easily smothering the region of Kanto below. She had just finished her personal task of 'uniting' the Pokemon on the job of protecting the region, her belly completely full of blobs of all sizes, from houses to cities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lapras' long neck was also thickly clad in blubber like the rest of her body, giving it the appearance similar to that of a children's stacking toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a well-deserved belch that caused quite an earthquake, she managed to catch the attention of Miltank through the air as well as jiggling their blubbery bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, didn't notice you there, was too busy downing that massive fish. When did you get here?\" The Miltank shouted in surprise at the newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, it seems I finally caught up to you, o big bovine. -URP- Excuse me!\" The Lapras grinned back at the Cow Pokemon. \"I was just watching you take on all the Pokemon earlier all by yourself, so I thought I could do it too!\" she continued, confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that so...Actually I was just going to take a short break. That Swampert tired me out.\" Miltank sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry to disturb your rest!\" The Lapras said, flushing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's okay. I have to be on my guard anyways.\" Miltank replied, as she brushed aside a faceful of Lugia tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, my name's Lyssa! One of Lorelei's champions in  the Kanto Elite Four! Or, at least used to be. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I don't exactly have one. My trainer June just calls me Miltank, as do my other friends. There was also another name given to me recently, 'S.S. Moomil', but that's largely defunct now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no good! Even if you aren't as majestic as a Lapras like I am, a fine lady like you deserves a name to go by!\" Lyssa said, in a serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...what would you call me then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, um...\" Lyssa paused, as she took a good hard look at the Cow Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...Mari? How's that sound?\" the Lapras stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mari...a short simple two syllables. I'll take it.\" the Miltank smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrific! Congrats on getting a name, Mari!\" Lyssa exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohkay...now back to business. While we were busy the ocean just turned into a strange colour-changing blubber mass. What do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah! That's tragic. It would seem we are way behind, what kind of resistance can we put up against that thing..no, <b>TWO</b> things of that size?!\" Lyssa groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't do, we'll be gobbled up the moment they turn their attention to us! I think we should...increase our odds...\" the Lapras said, as she turned her head around to face the neighbouring region of Johto, her frame easily dwarfing the tallest buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, hang on a second! I thought we were supposed to be <i>protecting</i> the regions!\" Miltank yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This region is unprotected, and I don't have enough fat to spread around for it.\" Lyssa replied, as she gazed upon the region below, laden with countless blobs of Pokemon, none of which are any larger than a city block. \"I get more coverage in the end when I eat it all up, plus...Johto'll be much better off in my belly...\" the Lapras said with her maw wide open, her drool flowing onto the region like a waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I suppose that makes sense...\" Miltank rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you going for it? Sinnoh? That region below you?\" Lyssa said, whilst making up her mind on which skyscraper should she swallow first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Lyssa- I'm sitting on Hoenn right now. Sinnoh's being handled by...my trainer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not doing a very good job now on her own is she?\" Lyssa slurped up her drool, while rubbing her belly with a front fin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because she <i>is</i> on her own! She got turned into a...Slyveon, I think, to join us.\" Miltank said, taking sight of a pink coloured blob smothering the port of Snowpoint, who let out a soft burp soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd better pick up the pace, or I might have Sinnoh, along with her for dessert after!\" the Lapras chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could just, pretty please, help her out. I can't do anything from where I am right now.\" Mari begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, perhaps when I'm done with this second course here...\" Lyssa dismissed, as she took a mouthful of skyscraper, it making a noticable bulge in her blubber-clad neck as she swallowed it down.</span></div></div>",

As the queen-sized Lapras (though puny in comparison with Lugia over there, who was battling the Arcanine-Groudon monstrosity known as Fenrir, the two parties being at a deadlock with a clashed Hydro Pump and Solarbeam.) devoured the region below her, leaving voids in the earth where cities once stood, she was being offered a great belly rub as well, what with her expanding underbelly rolling in like an ocean tide as she packed on the tons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umph...\" the Lapras murred softly as her underbelly moved in to occupy the spaces. Lyssa's ensuing pleasure drove her to eat up the region of Johto even quicker, advancing from eating a city block at a time to trying to fit an entire city in a ridiculously stretched maw of hers. \"Strange, I feel kind of full already.\" She mused, quarterway into the region when she felt her belly gurgle in slight protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her attention away from the semi-eaten region, she turned towards her Miltank friend, Mari, who was still loafing on the region of Hoenn, her enlarged butt and enormous flabby belly engulfing the land mass below. \"Say, Mari, I hope you haven't dozed off just yet!\" Lyssa shouted, trying to hide her mild displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way Lyssa, I'm still trying to digest this huge fish over here.\" Miltank replied, as she smacked her belly with a front hoove, hearing the remains of that Swampert she ate slosh loudly within. \"Well, I know it's only been ten minutes or so since we met, but as a friend, I'd say you go for it, Mari!\" the Lapras shouted back, before she made the Tin and Burnt Towers disappear at once into her belly. \"Seriously, oh, I suppose I could...one of my four stomachs does feel sorta empty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-four stomachs?! Did I hear wrongly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait, make that two now. Moooaarr...\" Miltank felt her belly grumble as one stomach full of digested Swampert emptied, before murring in pleasure as it quickly transformed into more fat, smothering the remaining part of Hoenn as far as her eyes could see with more of her delightful blubber. \"Oh no, I better get to it before my body covers it all.\" the Cow Pokemon said worriedly, as she shifted her body around, getting in position to graze on Hoenn. \"I won't *crunch* lose to you Lyssa! Not once have I lost an eating contest June brought me to! A pack of Snorlax, the largest Swalot, and even a Wailord *burp* I have all brought to shame!\" she claimed proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to thank you for giving me the head start, then!\" Lyssa grinned, hoisting the remaining half of Johto up high as she brought her head upright, the land tightly clenched in her jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRACKACOOOM!* Went a deafening cracking noise below the Lapras' underbelly, sending shockwaves pulsing through her colossal body, making for a tintillating massage. \"Did eyth mreak ze schkale I was loungingh on sho quickly?\" (Did I break the scale I was lounging on so quickly?) she mumbled, as she struggled with her mouth full, then proceeding to fold the region into half so she could vore it all down in one gulp. She could feel her neck and throat straining against the sheer weight of the remaining Johto region, as well as the dream-like sensation of an entire half continent forcing down her throat making a significant bulge. The heavy feeling of the land mass weighing down on her stomach wall soon sent her peristalsis into overdrive, and it entered her digestive system double time, her belly now swollen enough to push her four fins off Kanto below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA final series of continental cracking caused by the Lapras' greatly increased mass soon spelled its end, leaving no more than a crumbled, broken region crushed beneath her truly glorious underbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" *BUUURRRRPPP* This just keeps getting better and better...\" Lyssa belched, as she laid down her head and neck against the grey flab of Lugia's for a break. \"Don't stop eating my dear Mari, this, I believe, to be only the start of a great feast.\" she sighed, defeated but happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? You had a job, S.S. Moomil. why are you turning your back on us now!\" the steward shouted over the communications system. \"There isn't any more hope now. It's either us or them, and I chose Lyssa and myself. Goodbye. It has been an honour to serve you.\" Miltank said, as she finally slurped up the derelict mass of the former S.S. Moomil's cruise installations, along with her headset, cutting off ties with the cruise company forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been waiting to do that, it made it so much sweeter.\" Miltank smiled, before scoring a nearby beach area into her waiting stomachs. \"I'll *huff* leave Kanto to you, if that's okay.\" Lyssa said, catching her breath. \"You said something about..helping your trainer?\" \"Why yes, pretty please! Thanks a ton!\" \"I'll see what I can do then!\" Lyssa exclaimed, moving slowly but stately towards Sinnoh, where Sylveon-June grew a lot more visible since her last gaze, but was still frantically munching on things to catch up to the oversized duo.</span></div></div>",

But why are you so...'Pokemon'? You even smell like one!\" Lyssa wondered. \"There was this experiment I willingly participated in...I still happen to be human in more ways than one!\" June grinned, as she wiggled her voluminous body, causing her ridiculously huge breasts to sway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you anyway?\" June asked. \"Oh I'm- I'm Lyssa! I made friends with your Miltank, and she sent me here to help you.\" The Lapras frowned, looking down upon the Slyveon hybrid, a tad jealous of her assets, despite being so much larger herself.<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you Lyssa. Hopefully you won't see me as a tasty pink snack or anything!\" June responded, feeling awkward. \"T- That was not my intent at all!\" Lyssa blushed, turning her head away. \"Right, you said that you were here to help me out! When do we *gulp* start?\" June muttered in between feasting on another crushed building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once? Please open wide then, June!\" Lyssa declared. \"Dish ohkay?\" June muffled, her maw as wide open as she could. <i>\"Let's bring you up to speed, little sprout.\"</i> Lyssa thought. The Lapras then lowered her maw into close contact with June's, before gagging once and regurgitating the partially digested remains of her continental meal into the waiting Slyveon hybrid. <i>\"What the- Oh!\"</i> June was shocked at first, her eyes wide open as Lyssa poured it down her throat like a raging river, before she began to realise her intent and dimming her eyes to enjoy the free meal. Her fluffy pastel belly began to balloon out rapidly, from an initial mere half a kilometre to 5, 10, 15...overtaking her already ridiculous chestline  and crushing the next nearby city blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack, *cough cough*\" June coughed, taken surprise by the rapid influx of food from Lyssa, as well as her belly feeling a lot more taut. \"Did I overdo it?\" Lyssa paused her feeding to show concern. \"No, you...didn't...my belly just went from E to F and way beyond, so...\" June groaned, as she rubbed her enlarged belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see! Let me know when you want the next course- but don't wait too long or it'll permanently become a part of me!\" Lyssa joked, as she took a great big bite out of the region. \"Mmph...\" June murred in pleasure as her stomach got used to the wide load. Gradually her belly shrank as it digested the remains, padding her body with much deserved blubber all around, though it mostly went into her chest and butt, allowing her enormous, fluffy mammaries to once again take the leas as they grew larger than a mountain each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slyveon hybrid let her blooming chest weigh her body down, causing it to flow into the landscape below her, better suiting the shift in her body's mass. (Along with the fact that there was someone around to feed her, so she needn't be in the position to do so herself.) With her front body now in intimate contact with the disturbed region, smothering it with lovely, fuzzy flab. \"Dive bomb!\" June's Slyveon yelped, as he plummeted face down into her soft chest, allowing himself to sink in like an oversized mattress. \"Nngh you little- ah well...\" she let the fact that she was a bed to her Pokemon quite literally sink in, continuing to enjoy the sensation of her body packing on ton after ton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming through! Ooof!\" Mari yelled, as she slid down the ocean of fat and colliding with Lyssa's enormous butt. \"Since when were you here- my, you've grown huge!\" The Lapras exclaimed at the Cow Pokemon's newfound size. \"I thought I'd never say this, but I couldn't eat another bite...*URRRPPPP* excuse me, maybe another island more perhaps.\" Mari chuckled. \"Needless to say I took care of Hoenn there!\" the Miltank said triumphantly, as she allowed herself to flow around Lyssa's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, June, to think you were as skinny as a string bean back then!\" Mari cooed, as she finally came face to face with her trainer. \"I'm glad I found you again, Miltank, but please lay off the hugs, I had enough for today!\" June said, a little peeved. \"I hope Lyssa here has been doing a good job.\" Mari said, whilst starting at the Lapras. \"I was just waiting for the missy to finish digesting,\" Lyssa nods. \"All right I'm ready for the next round!\" June called out, Lyssa instinctively continued feeding her. \"So that's how you're spoiling my trainer eh? Me next if you don't mind!\" Mari called out, and they both continued to eagerly shovel treats into the ever larger Slyveon hybrid...</span></div></div>",

Just get back in and shield us all.\" Floaty replied from within his belly, and Lugia allowed the both lovers to manifest in his current position. Once they had fully formed, the Vaporeon Floatzel fusion shot out a tsunami of a Hydro Pump to douse the invader. Fenrir was supposedly stunned by the attack, flinching for a couple of seconds, before boiling away the water into an enormous cloud of steam, shooting out from his volcano shaped vents on his skin. \"No amount of water we have...is going to work...\" said Valerie, worriedly, as she witnessed their supposedly effective attack easily shrugged off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother?

I'll let you commune with him telepathically.\" the Shadow Lugia closed his eyes, connecting Slyveon, Valerie and Floaty on a mental level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be, you're one of our children!\" Floaty said, shocked. \"I was wondering where you ran off to, ya little rascal.

Where are the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then something struck Valerie as amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My children...your brothers and sisters...I forgot all about them...I am sorry!\" Valerie said, weeping. \"That's...No turning back the clock now, Mother.\" the Slyveon said, whilst shedding a tear. \"W-what should I do...how could I be so careless...\" \"I have met June and the others, and they have been like a family to me. But it won't be for long unless you come and save us. That thing...is looming ever closer.\" Slyveon said, pointing towards Fenrir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pack up! It's a fool's errand to fight Fenrir, he is wearing us thin.\" Charos interrupted, alerting them to the criticality of the present. \"And just where will we go?\" Lugia said, puzzled. \"Somewhere far away where we can rest and prepare. Trust me.\"<br>\r\n\"Just a sec, I need to pickup someone!\" Valerie shouted, as she turned her body to face Lyssa, Mari, Slyveon June and Slyveon himself. \"All of you need to get in right now! No time to waste!\" Valerie said, as she opened her mouth wide to swallow them all whole, fat Pokemon, half eaten Sinnoh and all. \"Brace yourself!\" Charos yelled, as a purple bubble encapsulated their form, and vanished them in a puff of shadowy smoke.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFenrir was then left alone with the remains of the Pokemon world.<br>\r\n\"They are not as foolish as they seem.\" said Groudon.  \"No matter.

Of course normally I can usually do damage to Pokemon regardless of that ability, But you've given him a lot of protection, he can just guzzle down my fire like its nothing.

Never in all his days, did he think that he would ever live up to his name.

June was about the same size as Lyssa, too, and she wasn't at all the cherry as compared to them last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're awake Mari! C'mon, we have quite a lot of catching up to do.\" Lyssa chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMari blinked. Were they all in someone else's stomach? She remembered being eaten with the rest of them earlier, but she blacked out midway. Plus there were also two unfamiliar black, blue and white blobs sitting in the other corner of the stomach, none other than Charos, Luxray and Lugia respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up Mari! Don't make me keep feeding you like the time you were asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. right.\" Mari nodded, and kicked herself off the slimy wall of the stomach.

Just our luck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have no fear, I know the cosmos well. We will not be lost.\" Charos assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? What's a pair of twin Vaporeon tails gonna do? I know it grows with us, but it's grown so fat that it takes two minutes to complete a single paddle!\" Floaty fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't forget Charos and I are also pushing us along! Give us some credit at least.\" said Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, it seems we might need to borrow our friends...Gifts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie smiled as she focused her energy, feeling the Lapras within their belly. Lyssa begins to liquefy. She is none too pleased at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's happening to me?! Didn't you promise not to digest us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you're just merging with us. You ought to be thankful as this is a VIP seat!\" Floaty joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lapras before long disappears completely into the stomach wall, and Valerie's body (for convenience, since it is mostly her form) begins to mutate. Her miniscule front and hind paws flattened and changed into Lapras fins, and huge ones at that, as they were now able to scale along with her body unlike her paws which were more meant for land. She feels them and gives them a good paddling, and she smiled as their speed greatly increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, is this...Am I seeing everything you see?\" Lyssa resounded in their mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. In exchange for your, uh, fins you get to see and feel everything. You might feel strange so take a while to get used to it.\" Floaty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to eat and move around while we're asleep. As long as we're together we can keep moving and eating 24/7!\" Valerie smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, I heard Miltanks have four stomachs, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little voice chirped in their heads. Valerie grinned as it was none other than Slyveon himself. Her face immediately turned into a frown though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, it might be difficult, she's not a water Pokemon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a try, mother. At least a stomach is something we all share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMari soon disappears into her stomach too, leaving June alone to happily savour the planet and a lot more which were lying around. The merged trio could feel their body's belly expanding as the new three stomachs formed, each as spacious as their current one. Lugia and Charos were right below the hole to a new stomach when it formed, and so they fell in, rather disgruntled, but appreciative of the fact it wasn't so cramped any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Luxray though, he was fast asleep, so he didn't notice anything amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what have I exactly become...\" Valerie sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A carrier to us all! We must eat and grow faster than this Fenrir, and this is the only way.\" Lugia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right, though. In the weeks ahead they steeled themselves for a non-stop feast, the merged four taking turns moving around and devouring anything they could possibly eat in their path, while the remaining three fed on some of the things they ate...</span></div></div>",

I think Arceus is at work here as always. Surely he would be watching our every move, waiting for us to slip up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're afraid of Arceus, is that it? I'm not exactly afraid of him, Floaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am...you've seen what happened to Lux over here. We can't afford to lose each other, much less our memories of those precious moments!\" Floaty said. \"We should just give this new world a chance this time. We're not exactly caught in a war of who's the biggest unlike back then, so we should just sit back and relax, taking in what life has to offer.\" the river otter admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...I too, think that we were meant for the water, and make sure it stays that way. Floating about in the cosmos doesn't quite cut it, to be honest.\" Valerie grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, there's also our children to take care of. We can't throw away their future just for our petty desires.\" Floatzel commented, gazing upon their children napping on the coast, though some were awake to hear their parents converse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As my dear Floaty wishes then. Love you.\" Valerie took the moment to sneak a quick kiss, before allowing herself to slide down her river otter lover's massive belly, her moist skin oiling the plunge back into the ocean. \"In that case, I wanna see how large you can get while working with them, too! Should be interesting to watch their reaction, watching a whole continent move on its own terms and will!\" the corpulent Vaporeon chuckled, her belly upright against the air as she floated easily in the sea water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a plan. I need a break for today. See you in the morning, Val?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'll probably just sleep in as always. *yawn* You have to work, I have to parent. That makes us kinda even.\" Valerie replied, before a mighty stroke of her tail propelled her to the coast where their children were, and curling up beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Val.\" Floatzel mumbled, before closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little chilly as always, but not as cold as it was last night.\" Floatzel spoke to himself, headed for Snowpoint with the artic air ruffling his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we're getting back into the action eh, Floaty?\" Luxray said, in an upright canine pose, enjoying the cool breeze and sunrise. \"Yep. I'll keep working for as long as I can.\" Floatzel said confidently. \"Did you have something to eat though? It's no good working on an empty stomach.\" Luxray reminded, taking a bite out of an energy bar that he kept on his vest. \"Ah, you remind me! When you're this size, though, you'll be confident with your fat lasting a lifetime that you don't feel the need to eat anymore..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's funny though. I'd thoughta it'd be the reverse. You need lotsa energy to move around, and considering you can eat anything, doesn't your appetite stir in the slightest upon seeing all sorts of things?\" Luxray questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, it'll be bad for business if you end up shrinking instead of growing constantly, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well -that- is true, but it seems that edible food still has the greatest appeal in me. 'Inedibles' are second on the list, which is good I suppose. At least it stops me from eating up ports, islands and the like at first sight.\" Floaty smirked. \"That being said, though, I think I'll have breakfast now. Perhaps you should head back into the bridge, Lux.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting a trash container out on my back, and it's <b>huge</b> in comparison to you right now. I don't want to get you crushed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. Catch ya later then.\" Luxray said, as he picked himself up and walked into the bridge quarters, the door closing behind him as he continued to eat his energy bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, he could hear a loud clang as well as some loud chomping, gulping and gurgling noises coming from the outside. The trash container obscured the frontal bridge windows from what Luxray himself could see, and it wasn't long before the river otter emptied the entire container, and started to chomp on the rusty metal container itself! Luxray cringed a little as he watched him gobble it all up with ease, but also a little fascinated himself. <i>\"That's what they keep you for, I suppose...Though I wonder if every Pokemon is capable of that, and just don't know it?\"</i> Luxray pondered, putting up a paw to his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, S.S. Inflatable. It's good to see you reporting back to work on time.\" the steward's voice boomed across the bridge's announcement system, as well as Floatzel's own headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goshdangit! Forgot to turn down the volume after testing again!!\" Luxray cowered, his ears ringing while he covered them with his front paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning *urp* Sorry, was just finished with breakfast.\" Floatzel replied, continuing to paddle as the sight of the Snowpoint port grew larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray crawled out of the bridge to avoid the amplified announcement system, and sat down beside Floatzel's chins, which smelt of trash and rot. It wasn't exactly the most comfortable place to be with stench around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have investigated the matter, and unfortunately your predictions were actually correct. There was a strange whirlpool that manifested somewhere near Hoenn, but there were no casualties or other problems reported, thankfully. The company will just be placing you under observation.\" the steward said, reading some papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...good to hear. Could I get a recording of any news programs that covered the whirlpool?\" Floatzel requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can be arranged, after you port and we get you cleaned up, S.S. Inflatable. Your shift doesn't start til 9am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\" Floatzel replied, as he slowed his tail spinning, allowing him to fit snugly into the wide berth, the fur at the sides of his belly brushing against concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also to let you know that an incident put the S.S. Moomil out of action, too, so you'll have to do overtime until we get a proper replacement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww crap. Didn't think it'll be that bad, sir.\" Floatzel groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're also using her as an exclusive garbage disposal for now, so any trash you have stored on board in the future is going straight to her.\" the steward coldly announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?! That's- So be it then.\" Floatzel said, disappointed. \"Get me cleaned up then, I want to watch the news soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger that. Steward out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the communications cut, the Luxray took the opportunity to head back into the bridge and turn down the speaker volumes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is a little outrageous...first they take away my bonus food supply, then they make me do extra work. I'm gonna have to confront that Miltank sometime when I'm free, and make sure she narrows her intake, or else...\"</i> Floatzel fumed.</span></div></div>",

You seem kinda...down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you're right, milady!

With your help we could get him back on his feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Miltank's been taking your food supply away? Tsch, I knew she was no good from day one! I'ma go teach her a le-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please don't do that, Val.\" Floatzel pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that you both are co-workers, but, you see, this is why you get pushed around so easily...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, actually. They're gonna be making that cow into an island of some sorts, since she took up the coast of Slateport and isn't moving anywhere around fast, they decided to make her a tad more useful. Building towns and stuff on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable. So Floaty doesn't get to be one too? Is that it?\" Valerie fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go about feeding him though. They'd know. Something about sensors and some technobabble.\" Luxray sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I gotta preserve your image too, hmm? This is troublesome...Aha!\" Feeling an idea springing to her head, she dived straight down, swimming away from the coast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Val, where are you going?\" Floatzel wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a good rest, my lovely river otter! I'll have a gift for you sometime at your workplace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever that means...\" Luxray shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRRPPP! Feed me more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miltank, now having immobilised herself on the coastline of Slateport, was now being converted by the cruise company into a fleshy, Pokemon island of some sorts. Construction sites and cranes adorned nearly about every single massive fat fold of the Cow Pokemon's titanic girth, each fold having enough area to house a city. A multitude of lift shafts attached from the ground clearing in front of her led directly to her maw, constantly bringing in tons of things to consume every so often. It was simply the perfect setup for her to gain, gain, and gain...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you're definitely enjoying yourself, S.S. Moomil. You're making great progress.\" said the steward over the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still going strong! Though I have to admit, I'm getting a little sleepy from all that eating. *CHOMP*\" said Miltank, as she crunched up another container of garbage and swallowed it, looking up into the night sky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk, such an elaborate operation...\" mused Valerie, as she swam closer towards the towering Miltank. She dived down deeper so as not to be seen, swimming over to the unilluminated behind of Miltank's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie then reached out a pudgy paw, making contact with the cow's butt. \"Let's see if this works...Oh yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporeon slowly melds into Miltank, leaving only her huge belly and what's below it floating in the water, attached to the Miltank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccessfully tapping into that of Miltank's consciousness, Valerie slowly begins to also sense what the Cow Pokemon was experiencing. Sight was the first to come in, with her looking upon a huge round mountain of white, black spotted lard, and a couple of rail structures bound to it. Her feel of touch then kicked in, and it was simply overwhelming, due to the construction works constantly brushing her fur throughout as they worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph...\" Valerie moaned deeply, as she felt the ecstasy almost overwhelm her. She could control it, but having this much hit her in such a short timeframe was unusual even for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're mine now, let's put you to sleep for the time being. At least until  I've sought revenge for Floaty.\"</i> With that said, Valerie mentally knocks the Miltank out, and takes the reins of control of her body, allowing her to experience everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S.S. Moomil? Have you fallen asleep?\" the steward's voice echoed through the headset as Miltank closed her eyes. The trains that were bringing in food then stopped in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? No, I was just basking in the light, the floodlight!\" Valerie coolly replied (albeit in Miltank's voice).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's continue to get you all fed then.\" The trains then resume their course, bringing another container to her face. She chomps it and swallows it with ease, feeling it only have a tiny, tingling effect when it hit her enormous stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She hasn't grown that big, has she? Even that would somewhat fill me up on my current size...On the bright side, her body is fully prepped to take more than this in.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...I could use some more! *urp* Because that felt like a little peanut to me. Make them go faster.\" Valerie said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm going to savour this, being fattened by humans to become one of their cities...Floaty would definitely want a piece of this.

Sure enough it wasn't her own body, but she could feel it in every single way Miltank normally could, from the churns in her tummy, her belly stretching along the entire landscape as it grew, and the waves that constantly crashed against her butt cooling it down. Not to mention the tightness of the city constructions and that huge ass udder, too. Valerie could swear that she felt herself let out rivers of milk whenever there was a growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week passes, and Miltank's body surpasses one mile wide. Valerie had not returned to Floaty so he got worried, and he started taking care of their children during work in her absence. It got even tougher for him. Indeed, in Valerie's neglect he had descended into a living hell, while she got to enjoy absolute heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the big day. Having reached the size quota and the city was built, the first ever Pokemon floating city was ready to go. The Miltank was now a white and black blob dwarfing the entire town of Slateport and then some, with five miles of pure blubber extending in every direction, with one mile of udder extending in front of her belly. City structures like skyscrapers were riddled all across her landform body, covering the top half while leaving the below half free for the ocean. Hundreds of ships all gathered behind her butt, tethering cables to it and pulling her slowly into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloaty watched all this happen with the rest of his children on board. His jealousy was at its peak, along with his anger. Valerie had promised him a solution, and she had not been sighted for a month since announcing it, even leaving their children behind. Where had she gone? And that Miltank managed to reach city status too, while he was still a measly cruise ship. The company was screwing him over real bad, and he hated it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, about time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie commented as right after the briefing she was being hauled out to sea, feeling her butt inch slowly into the cool water. She could have easily usurped the Miltank's position and claimed the city for her own enjoyment as well as getting into the ocean faster, but she didn't want to alarm them. It was quite a charade that had gone for quite a long while, the humans not suspecting that she had latched on and took Miltank's place all this while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her butt landed in the ocean it got easier for them to pull her. Her body bobbed up and down as it tried to stay afloat with the city on top, and it soon did as they expected. It was quite a roaring success!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"WOW. They're not that stupid in that aspect.\"</i> Valerie mused. She looked around as much as she could, enjoying the cool sea breeze, the salty air and the white clouds in the sky. It was then she spotted Floaty watching in the distance. Crap! Had it really been that long? Valerie had completely lost track of time and forgotten about Floaty and her children. He must be raging mad now, she thought. She would have to do something to remedy the situation.</span></div></div>",

The clouds were growing dark and dropping from their usual place down low ominously, the air was growing colder, and the temperature of the currents was changing. Above all, this meant a potential end for his new home. An end to his family and a return to endlessly glutting away on galaxy sized meals. It was tempting to return to his past life, but he had responsibilities as a husband and a father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, he loved his family, and was willing to give this new world a chance.  He supposed if worst came to worst and Lugia or some other Pokemon did drink the ocean, he could just head over into one of their rolls of flab and bum around with his family for a few months. Maybe take that post his dad offered him as a mineral diver. Oh gods, what a dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, at least for now, Floaty could take solace in the fact that his wife, Valerie, and his kids were safe and sound on the island of which he was rapidly approaching. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nFloaty waddled his legs across the soft sandy slope of the island, before sitting his rump down on the beach where his kids were napping. Letting his legs rest weightlessly in the water, he leaned onto his back to relax. A few of the children woke up to Floaty's form crashing right up against them and snuggled up a bit into their father's fat folds. Floaty smiled, but he couldn't help but feel worried about tonight. As promised, Floaty and Valerie kept their end of the bargain and had promised to stay on their secluded little island for the night of the storm. But what if Lugia didn't? What if Lugia turned their backs on everyone and repeated the same events that happened before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloaty didn't honestly trust Lugia. Sure, he said he was sorry about eating the whole Earth thing, but he said so casually and so forcefully as if he didn't want to say that Floaty had a hard time knowing he was out there in the deep blue.  Most of all, he could expect Lugia to always be secretive about his actions. He hadn't heard from Lugia in forever, and now he finally made contact with them, and he tells Floaty and Valerie to stay away from the whirlpool. But how does Floaty know that he just wants them out of the way for when what happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So distrustful, Floaty. That actually hurts my feelings, you know.\" A voice in Floaty's head teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Floaty cocked his head around like an owl, wondering where the voice came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to ask Valerie and the kids if they heard that, when all of the sudden, the sound of splashing water snapped him out of his thoughts. He hoisted his large body upwards as to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I thought you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would be at the whirlpool repeating history?\" Lugia interrupted, giving the Floatzel a fake hard time. \"Well, it's a funny story, I actually seriously considered it. But I decided that there are more things to life than just eating and getting impossibly fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmn? Oh! Hello Lugia!\" Valerie looked up from her children, who were currently playing with her chubby foot paws, to cheerfully greet the Sea God. \"This is an unexpected surprise! Floaty, scoot over and make some room for our guest.\" Floaty's wife commanded, inviting Lugia to come sit down on the sand with them with a wave of her paw. Before Floaty could even protest or get a word in, he found that Lugia did not want to wait for him to make room, and sat in between him and his wife, mushing the three of them together as soft fat collided with more soft fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" One of the Eeveelution children, a Jolteon Floaty and Valerie named Dynamo, ran around his mother's fat from to see the stranger that had rested his huge rump on their beach. \"Mom, Dad, there's someone who's even bigger than you guys!\" He smiled wide with a childlike sense of innocence and wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Floaty exclaimed with a small smile at his son. \"Are you trying to say that your old man is 'small', shortstuff?\" To this, Dynamo just giggled. Valerie and him rarely ever got visitors, so when someone came, it was a big production for the kids. Thankfully, they were all tuckered out from playing all morning and afternoon, and were snoozing against their mother's pillowy, blubbery thigh. Save for Dynamo, who had enough energy to power a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia looked down at the small, small Pokemon and smiled with a genuine warmth. \"Well, hello there little one.\" He politely greeted with a smile, making his already huge cheeks laden with fat puff out even more. \"My name is Lugia, who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Dynamo, and your really fat!\" The young Eeveelution bounced up and down on the trampled sand as all three of the obese titans blush at the child's bluntness. Of course, growing up with Valerie and Floaty as parents, Dynamo had grown to believe that being fat was a great thing! You get to be so soft and huge, you could eat whatever you want, and you always gave the best hugs! Thankfully, Lugia was not insulted in the slightest, and actually inflated a little with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, yes I am,\" Lugia chuckled, feeling conscious of his impressive girth. \"Thank you for noticing~\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, can I play with Mr. Lugia please?\" Dynamo turned to his father, who was content watching his son just talk to the legendary bird. He looked over Lugia's fat to see Valerie give a nod of approval, with Lugia himself looking more then happy at the suggestion. So trusting, that women he thought.. Had she forgotten that this was the Pokemon that had tried to turn her and him into more fat by eating them? Nevertheless, he relented. \"Sure son, go right ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDynamo the energetic young Jolteon gave out a cheer of delight and began to run towards the incredibly fat stranger that was sitting between his parents. He crashed heavily into Lugia\u2019s gigantic mound of belly paunch, making it jiggle and quiver like crazy, and promptly nuzzled, cuddled, snuggled and groped the downy blubber in between his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia, Happy to have the electric type eeveelution play with him, gave out a low putt of delight as the small thing rubbed his entire body into his fat. \u201cMrrrr...this is what I was talking about Floaty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-huh?\u201d Floaty asked, taken aback by the question. He wasn't really paying attention to the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d Lugia gestured to Floaty\u2019s son currently trying to climb the blue surface of his stomach like it was a mountain, which would not be an inaccurate description, \u201cIs why I don\u2019t wanna try to eat the world. Ever since Arceus gave us all a second chance, I\u2019ve begun to truly experience life in all its majesty. Like the setting sun,\u201d the legendary bird pointed to the beautiful scene in front of the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr the innocence of a child~\u201d Lugia cooed as Dynamo continued to climb his stomach like a hillock. His Yellow furred paws sunk knees deep into the cushiony adipose, to which the Jolteon could only laugh and paw at. \u201cYou can\u2019t get any of those things if you eat them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...you have NO interest in trying to eat the world anymore?\u201d Floaty questioned, still not sure whether or not to trust Lugia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia smiled a big, fat smile and placed a lard laden wing-hand on the back of Floaty\u2019s back. \u201cNot at all, my friend, if I may call you that. I came here to spend some time with the two who I used to consider food, but now see for amazing parents and people. I love being fat, but I think I love life a little more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly dawned on Floaty that, maybe, just perhaps, the old sea bird had changed. They're was a certain type of gleam in his sapphire eyes as he eyed his child bury his little muzzle into his blue belly paunch. There was a newfound appreciation of the little things in the Legendary, the slightly less fat river otter could see that now. He gave a sigh of relief and felt relaxed enough to lay his huge back onto the warn osand of his island home, content to watch the setting sun sink into the ocean and past the horizon.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This is a summary of the previous parts of the storyline, which have vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Prologue</u><br>\r\nIt all started when a Lugia went out for a swim in the ocean. All of a sudden, he got trapped within a whirlpool that appeared out of nowhere, and the ocean's water got funneled into him, swelling him out like a balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to his surprise, the whirlpool did not cause him to burst, but rather, caused him to drink up the entire ocean dry without much harm whatsoever. The ocean's Pokemon soon beckoned out to him for their loss of habitat. The crafty, ocean-sized Lugia suggested they all take up residence in his stomach where the ocean once was, and swallowed them with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was intent or by accident, Lugia's stomach began to digest the entire ocean, and soon the ocean was no more but blubber padded on his once insignifcant body. The legendary Pokemon of each continent soon went after him with the intention of revenge for his crime, but his psychic powers proved too much for them, and they were all defeated - Groudon, in particular, got to enjoy eating cities for a while before being devoured by Lugia, and Rayquaza fired an ill-placed Hyperbeam when he was being swallowed by Lugia, blimping him up to cover the entire surface of the planet, as well as considerably augmenting his powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Brief Respite</u><br>\r\nWhen the rest of the legendaries came to, they were being imprisoned by Lugia on top of his chins. Only Ho-Oh, Entei, Raikou, Suicune, Moltres, Zapdos and Articuno were left as the others were seemingly eaten by Lugia as snacks. Lugia forced Ho-Oh to swallow Articuno, but the show was interrupted by Victini who happened to pass by to settle the score, challenging him to eat the world - then see who would come out on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the size difference between them, Victini felt himself still up to the challenge and attempted to make his way down to the covered world below, but got stuck in between Lugia's butt fat. Lugia dispatched Ho-Oh to seek him out and bring him back to him, which she did, but as Lugia fell asleep, she swallowed Victini herself in a gamble, which worked. Victini performed a V-Generate within her stomach, and the immense amount of energy absorbed by her stomach caused Ho-Oh to put on a massive amount of weight, allowing her to rival Lugia (as well as sending the rest of them flying off in all directions.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Victini realised that his escape move had backfired, he made his escape by cutting a hole in her stomach and swimming through her newly formed fat. Lugia began to sleep talk in his dream, and Ho-Oh played along, almost scoring him in her stomach without a struggle, but he woke up halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awakened Lugia realised that she was immobile and therefore no threat, and began to eat the world himself. Ho-Oh, powerless to stop him, got the rest of the legendaries to ally with her to distract Lugia, while she attempted to swallow him by the tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Victini makes allies</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini soon made his way to the surface, and there he met Celebi and a pair of surviving trainers, June and Purple. After unsuccessfully convincing Celebi that he was not out to eat the world himself, Purple captured Celebi himself with the notion that she was a legendary Pokemon - soon realising he had ran out of Pokeballs to catch Victini himself. With Celebi gone, Victini convinced the trainers instead, and managed to get on June's good side, allowing him access to her Miltank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini used the same technique earlier in Ho-Oh to fatten up the Miltank massively, boosting them upwards to the surface and interrupting Lugia and Ho-Oh. Once there he took the Pokeball containing Celebi, and ate the Pokeball. Tricking the scared Celebi into using her powers to escape he managed to gain some considerable weight himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendaries with Ho-Oh did not give up. They attacked the two trainers on Miltank, and recalled Miltank back into her Pokeball, leaving a great big void below them, with the legendary birds bringing them and the trainers to safety. Lugia and Victini began to continue the feast of the world, but were forced to stop by Ho-Oh's gut expanding to fit the swallowed Pokeball with the Miltank, covering the world and ousting them upwards. Lugia rolled down like a massive boulder, and in the momentum he was swallowed whole by Ho-Oh, giving her two gut-popping continental meals in less than a few minutes. Victini however just managed to hold on, with Ho-Oh herself taunting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune sought retribution for her lost Miltank, and tinkered a device that could fire a beam to fatten Pokemon near instantly. Purple then set out his Pokemon to trick Ho-Oh's company into coming to their location, in which June ordered her Clefable to sing, putting them to sleep, then bloating them to immobility with the beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia avoided being digested by Ho-Oh with his psychic powers, and tricked her into eating the remains of the planet, inciting the wrath of Unova's legendaries, Reshiram and Zekrom. Zekrom broke Ho-Oh's trance with a lightning bolt, then they set out to find June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>An old friend!</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ho-Oh was overturned by Lugia upon failure of his plan, Victini landed onto Unova, and was about to get ready for his next meal - until he saw a pair of massive tails coming out from a building in the distance. Victini soon found out that it was his Floatzel friend, Floaty inside, who had taken up residence inside the abandoned shopping complex, and ate his way to bigness, getting himself stuck in the building. After exchanging some friendly banter Victini pulled him out from the building, and has the building for a meal himself much to Floaty's shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloaty soon got over it though, and was beginning to eat supposedly inedible objects with no problems just like his friend. With the aid of Victini he snacked on the ruined Tubeline Bridge, but their reunion was cut short by Lugia, who shifted his weight around and destabilising the region they were on. Floaty and Victini were then seperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloaty himself ended up in a massive cave network, where he got stuck in the entrance. Meeting a lone Drilbur who was tunnelling through, he convinced the mole Pokemon to free him in exchange for some food caught in his chin folds. Once free the Drilbur accompanied the Floatzel, eating ice cream while the river otter chomped away hungrily at the cave rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Strange Discovery</u><br>\r\nAs Floaty ate the cave he stumbled upon an underground city. It was ancient in appearance, but massive. Mountains upon mountains of food were piled up there for some strange reason, giving him reason to feast further, but a similarly fat Luxray was already there before him, challenging him to an eating competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloaty himself lost the competition, being devoured by Luxray. However as he went inside, a statue that was trapped in his fat came to life in the damp environment, revealing itself to be a normal-sized Vaporeon. While she was initially scared by the Floatzel's appearance at first, she introduced herself to be Valerie, the greatest Vaporeon who landed the entire world in her belly two centuries ago. She soon convinced Floaty to get her up to speed with regaining her size, and they soon warmed up to each other, becoming (quite massive) lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing Valerie's abilities they escaped Luxray in a mist, but they ended up conjoined in the same body as they reformed! It was not a setback at all however, as they could easily take turns eating and resting. The shrunked Luxray soon pleaded for his life, but Floaty swallowed him in lieu of his hostility earlier in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The contest continues</u><br>\r\nFloaty soon came belly to belly with his friend Victini as the Luxray's energy caused his weight to instantly multiply. Valerie overheard their conversation, and it turned out that they were mortal enemies in a previous life as Victini betrayed her, eating her offspring. She took control and confronted Victini, and as he charged a V-Generate and attempted to annihilate the both of them, Luxray intervened, sacrificing his weight to nullify the attack against them. The exhausted Victini soon fell unconscious, and Valerie let Floaty himself do the honours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peace did not last long, however. After Valerie took control of their body her tail slammed down on Ho-Oh's belly, causing her to regurgitate Lugia. Once escaped he devoured the dazed Ho-Oh, and challenged Valerie who was just about to resume feasting. Lugia saved Luxray from the Drilbur who devoured him whole by accident, and after force feeding him, made him his champion in a show he would sit back and watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia himself soon grew impatient as Valerie began to gain advantage, devouring the both of them and the region itself. The planet was now no more, leaving him floating in space, as well as Zekrom and Reshiram who had escaped to space too after rescuing the trainers in a vessel ship they found in the ancient city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuxray, Floaty and Valerie formed an alliance within Lugia's belly, eating everything that Lugia happened to devour. Once they had eaten their fill they made their escape, and the angry Lugia attempted to counterattack, but Valerie shifted their body in a way that made it difficult to swallow. Then something happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Lovers' Luck Out</u><br>\r\nThe Victini they swallowed earlier was fully digested leaving a sphere of immense energy in its place, turning everything in their belly into pure energy in the ensuing pyroclasm. The energy was then instantly absorbed into fat on Floaty and Valerie's shared body, engulfing the rest of them within their folds as well as fattening them to the point their tails came into contact with the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing with each other that their dinner date had truly begun, they took Luxray along as an ally, and began to feast upon a seemingly endless buffet, moving on from stars to entire galaxies...</span></div></div>",

After what seemed like months of feasting he rears his ugly head, using his powers to seperate Valerie from Floaty and using her powers to make his escape. Luxray helps out by siphoning some of the mist himself, allowing Valerie to be saved with loss of most of her girth. As Lugia attempts to reform Floatzel eats as fast as he could in the hopes of outsizing him completely, but he manages to reform and takes control of Luxray's mind, causing Valerie to disappear into him. Floaty lets himself be devoured and follows after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>End of All Things</u><br>\r\nFloaty and Valerie discover Lugia's plan with the help of surviving Legendary Pokemon inside Luxray's belly. Lugia intended to overload Luxray by forcing him to devour universe upon universe and upon his explosion, funnel all of existence into himself and somehow infinitesmally multiply the mass he would gain, and effectively destroy everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus intervenes, questioning the rest of them, before Floaty poses a burning question: to as whether Arceus himself has planned for additional backup universes. After getting over Floaty's audacity and listening to his request to restore everything to the way it was before, so that Valerie and he can return to start a family, Arceus restarts the universe, and things were seemingly back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lovers bid their goodbye to Luxray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Back home and living the life</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to his generosity Floaty and Valerie started off slightly larger than a Wailord each along with their memories, with the condition that they did their best to prevent a repeat of the incidents. The two of them soon settled onto a remote island and started a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>An unexpected cruise career</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloaty's love for eating and growing fatter did not diminish one bit however. After their children were born he took to the seas and simply bobbed around on his huge blubbery body. Cruise ships would come and go as he watched, and he would follow a particular one, devouring garbage as they dumped it every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis soon continued until they noticed the river otter that floated behind them, growing ever bigger from junk they threw away. Over the course of a month he outsized the massive cruise ship himself and owing to customer complaints of scenary being blocked by Floaty, the company had to do something - build a ship out of Floaty himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey offered him the cruise ship he followed, to savour all by himself. The river otter fervently chomped at it day and night, with people watching the extraordinary spectacle of the great S.S. Behemoth being decommissioned by the grossly obese Floatzel. After a few days he finished the house-sized rudder of the ship, releasing a long, huge belch from himself as he triumphantly rowed out to the ports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cruise company would then construct a full cruise suite adapted for a fat Pokemon such as Floaty, and put him on a lifetime job being a cruise ship, bottomless gourmand for both banquets and refuse alike. The cruise suite, of course, was being constantly refitted as he grew bigger and bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Trouble Returns</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie takes their children along and began to follow Floaty around for his escapades. One night though, she questions Floaty on his future with the cruise company, and realises he might be a little too attached to it. The Vaporeon then threatens him, telling him that he should retire and return back home. Floaty manages to reach a compromise with his lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloaty sails back to Snowpoint for repair after the damage Valerie caused. He receives a mental message from Lugia who tells him he should not head out, for the whirlpool that caused the previous events, would manifest tonight. Floaty himself could not find evidence to believe Lugia through the weather channels. The river otter was planning to stay at port until it blowed over, but after seeing the news report that a new cruise ship, based on a Miltank, was heading out, he acted immediately, evacuating everyone on board and heading for Slateport, hoping he would not be too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the story continues from here...</span></div></div>",

It would be too obvious and too easy to be caught by simple force-feeding, somehow she had to convince Ellie that gaining weight was good.<br>\r\nThat's when it hit her, a new plan that could make the old plan work perfectly! She scampered off, plotting her devious plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, Ellie was frolicking in a field, when Ufie came in, smiling wide.<br>\r\n\"Heya, Ufie!\" Ellie smiled, \"How're you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.\" Ufie responded, \"I just wanted to ask...\"</span></div></div>",

She looked back up at her sister with a smile, \"Okay! What are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Ufie wasn't certain about the identity of the berries. While she was getting away from Sylvia's usual annoying doting over Ellie, she came across a bush that held this mysterious fruit just sitting there, rather depressingly. It looked like it hadn't received attention in a long time, but fruit was still growing on it rather abundantly. She picked one and took a closer look at it, soon deciding to take a small bite. It tasted oddly creamy for a fruit. Soon after though, Ufie felt pressure building up in her stomach. It was only a little bit, but Ufie had definitely gained weight. Thankfully, no one noticed, so Ufie had forgotten about it for a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie took her sister's silence as an 'I don't know' and simply resorted to figure out what these berries were by trying one. She took a small bite, similiar to how Ufie approached the situation, but seemed oblivious to the bloating that the fruit caused. She then ate up the rest of the berry she took a bite out of, and laid back, allowing her belly to expand slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUfie smiled, believing Ellie was going to keep going with this. She picked up another berry and placed it in front of her, \"You want another, sis?\" Ellie held a joyful expression at the proposition.</span></div></div>",

She didn't know what to do about it though, since this was such a strange phenomenon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie was currently eating more of those berries that Ufie had been bringing home when Sylvia came back with something in tow. Despite having become a blob of an Eevee that you would expect to focus on nothing else when food was in front of her, the sight of Sylvia was always enough to catch her attention. She waved a pudgy paw at her sister, \"Hiya Sylvia!

She then nodded, before finishing her thought, \"To be honest, I was pretty worried about how much you've grown lately, but I've thought of a way to soothe my mind.\"</span></div></div>",

In fact, just like humans, Pokemon had all manner of different dreams and ambitions. You, for one, simply dreamed of winning every Pokemon contest in Kanto! Being a ninetales, you were well known for your beauty, grace and power, and you\u2019ve managed to participate in over a hundred different contests undefeated! Indeed, everyone knew you were the coolest, cutest, toughest, smartest, and most beautiful Pokemon around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one problem: a new type of competition was getting popular. Eating contests. At first, you loathed them. How crass, you thought! How disgusting! They were all mindless displays of gluttony, devoid of the class and showmanship of true contests. Why would any Pokemon want to get bulky and fat, after all, when they could be gorgeous and sylphlike like you? However, as time went on, people started paying more and more attention these eating contests. They were new! They were novel! And thus, people stopped paying attention to you. The seats at your contests were almost empty. People didn\u2019t consider you the best anymore; they considered you stuck-up and boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you weren\u2019t about to be left in the dust! After much deliberation, you\u2019ve decided that if you can\u2019t beat them, you were going to join them. Sure, eating contests might not be within your realm of expertise\u2026 but you were certain you could conquer them with the same ease with which you\u2019ve conquered every other type of contest! You had stars in your eyes as you imagined yourself rising to the top of the leaderboard, everyone in Kanto awed by your seemingly limitless skill. Thus, you\u2019ve signed up for your very first eating contest, with even doing any preparation first. I mean, it\u2019s just eating. You eat things all the time. It can\u2019t be that hard, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your place beside the three other contestants; a nidoqueen, a lopunny, and a delcatty. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cPsst. Hey. You don\u2019t happen to be Maura, do you?\u201d</span> The nidoqueen beside you leans over and whispers. She was about a foot taller than you, and looked to be on the plump side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAh! I see my reputation precedes me!\u201d</span> You smile. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAre you a fan? I\u2019d be happy to give you an autograph after the contest.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cTo be honest? I hate your guts. Always prancing around on TV like you\u2019re all that,\u201d</span> she growls. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you join an eating contest\u2026 but I\u2019m glad you did. I look forward to humiliating you.\u201d</span> She cackled, and you turned your head away in disgust. How incredibly rude! Before you can respond, though, you hear the announcer speaking over the loudspeakers,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cEach contestant will be provided with one hundred hot-dogs! You win by being the first Pokemon to empty your plate!\u201d</span> He explains. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cThe only rules is that you will not leave your seat until you\u2019ve emptied your plate, you\u2019ll eat the dogs and the buns, and you will not interfere with your contestants in any way. Failure to follow these rules will result in immediate disqualification!\u201d</span> He seems more stern all of a sudden. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cThere is no time limit. Once the bell rings, the contest does not end until a Pokemon clears their plate.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reel back in shock as a ursaring emerged from offstage, and placed a huge plate on the table in front of you, boasting an entire mountain of hot dogs. One hundred? Surely, he can\u2019t be serious! You\u2019ve never eaten half this much in your entire life! You look at the other contestants to see their reactions, only to realize they\u2019re all licking their lips, seemingly delighted by the meal. For the first time, you were starting to think you\u2019re outmatched. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</span> All your fellow contestants nod eagerly, while you\u2019re filled with nervousness. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cBegin!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your awe, all the other contestants immediately start chowing down, sending hot dogs down their throats in seconds. Meanwhile, you nervously lift a hot dog to your mouth, trying to swallow it like they do, only to realize you can\u2019t even fit the whole thing in your mouth. You have to chew half of it before swallowing the rest. You hadn\u2019t eaten all day, and still, your hungry was sated by a single hot dog. By the time you reached the fifth one, you were already starting to feel full. To maintain your perfect, skinny figure, you usually didn\u2019t eat much, so your stomach wasn\u2019t used to being stretched out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you\u2019ve eaten a quarter of the hot dogs on the plate, you already felt like you were about to throw up. You gag as you swallow another one, your belly feeling like it was on the verge of bursting. You try your best to pull through and win this\u2026 only to suddenly hear the bell ring again! You almost choke on the bun in your mouth in surprise, as you look over to see the nidoqueen rubbing her full belly, her plate emptied of everything but crumbs. She\u2019d already eaten all 100 hot dogs? How is that even possible? Even the other contests seemed to have mostly cleaned their plates. Your heart sinks as you quietly dread the results\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cLast place!?\u201d</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWell\u2026 yeah. You didn\u2019t even manage to eat half of the hot-dogs,\u201d</span> the ursaring who ran the contest shrugged, walking curtly away from you while you followed him around like a puppy. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhat did you think was going to happen?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI can\u2019t get last place in a contest! I\u2019ve been undefeated for years!\u201d</span> You whimper, panicking. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAll my hard work and dedication\u2026 down the drain, just like that!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cNot my problem, lady,\u201d</span> he groans, hoping you\u2019d get the hint to leave him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cPlease! There must\u2019ve been some kind of mistak- mph!\u201d</span> The nidoqueen from before was walking by, and while chasing after the ursaring, you accidentally ran into her. You practically bounced off her big, round belly, falling to the ground in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going!\u201d</span> She yells, only to look down and smirk when she realizes it\u2019s you. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh! Well, look who it is. The wannabe celebrity again,\u201d</span> she taunts. You see the ursaring hurry out of sight in the background. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cGotta say, that was the most pathetic display I\u2019ve ever seen onstage. I don\u2019t know what you even thought you were doing.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears flatten against your head. To be honestly, her words stung. A lot. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2026 I tried my best\u2026\u201d</span> You whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMaybe that\u2019s good enough in your lame \u2018beauty contests\u2019, but here, you\u2019re going to have to try harder than that,\u201d</span> the nidoqueen cackled, her stuffed belly jiggling as she bent over so you were at eye-level. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIf you want to compete, you better put some meat on your bones. Otherwise, I suggest you don\u2019t show your face around here again.\u201d</span> She laughed loudly as she walked away, leaving you there, miserable and humiliated, humbled by the incessant laughter of the audience...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2504\u2504\u2504</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you\u2019re sitting at a cafe with your friend Lucian, a mismagius.

You call that Lucian is one of those \u2018feeders\u2019 - Pokemon that like helping other Pokemon gain a ton of weight. He\u2019s fattened up plenty of girls you knew over the years, and even asked you a few times, though you\u2019ve always turned him down. You just didn\u2019t see the appeal\u2026 and after all, you have to maintain your perfect figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou just want to fatten me up, don\u2019t you?\u201d</span> You glare at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201c... maybe.\u201d</span> He chuckles, and you roll your eyes, growling at the perverted mismagius. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that! Do you want to win or not? \u2018Cause if you do, I\u2019m an expert in this sort of thing. I can be your coordinator!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider it.

I know you\u2019d like to keep your figure, but you can\u2019t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, as they say.\u201d</span> You shudder, his words reminding you of what that nidoqueen had said yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want to gain weight\u2026 but the weight could be worked off. The shame of losing again, on the other hand would last forever. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUgh\u2026 alright,\u201d</span> you sigh, <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cbut I better win this contest! I\u2019m trusting you, Lucian.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWell, I\u2019ll help you the best I can, but winning this sort of contest depends on your dedication,\u201d</span> he smiled, leading you over to the table by the paw. He grinned as he sat you down on a chair. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYou gotta be in it to win it! No matter the consequences!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff, grimly. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cLet\u2019s just get to the practice.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re surprised as he pulls out a whiteboard, covered in various notes and numbers. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cAlright. Now, I looked over the recordings, and that nidoqueen cleaned her plate in 3 minutes and 11 seconds,\u201d</span> he said, gesturing to the board. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cThere\u2019s another hot dog eating contest in two weeks. To be prepared, you have to have at least beaten her score by then. Otherwise, we might as well just give up on this whole thing.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2019d never give up.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d</span> He chuckled. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cAnyway, before we can even get started on practice, we have to answer one simple question; how quickly can you eat one hundred hot dogs?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, he levitated a huge plate of hotdogs over to you, dropping it on the table before you. You shuddered as you looked at the veritable mountain of sausages. Remembering the stomach ache you got from just eating a quarter of this amount of hot dogs, you immediately feel nauseous. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh\u2026 dear\u2026\u201d</span> You whimpered. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cDo we have to start out with a hundred?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWe only have two weeks, so our training regimen has to be rigorous,\u201d</span> he says, revealing a little bell. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cNow, when I ring the bell, I want you to start eating like your life depends on it! Pretend you\u2019re in a contest, and that snobby nidoqueen is sitting right next to you!\u201d</span> You sigh, getting ready to chow down. Might as well do your best. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cReady? Set? Go!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you acted without a moment\u2019s hesitation. Now that you knew what you were capable of, you were able to gulp down hot dogs much faster than before. You still had to eat each of them in two bites, of course\u2026 but it was something, at least. You devoured the first ten hot dogs with relative ease\u2026 but by the time you reached 20, that familiar, full feeling was starting to set in. When you reached 30, you could see the sausages making a visible bulge in your belly, and you were beginning to feel nauseous. By the time you reached 40, you already felt like you were about to throw up. All the while, Lucian watched with an excited grin on his face, enjoying the sight of you stuffing your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn 50, you were panting and coughing, your stomach feeling like it was stretched to capacity.  Worse still, after all that eating, you felt like you had barely put a dent in the huge pile. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cLucian...  it\u2019s too much\u2026</span>\u201d You whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cC\u2019mon! Don\u2019t give up! You\u2019re halfway there!\u201d</span> He insisted, but this fails to reassure you. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYou\u2019re a champion, Maura! You went undefeated for years! You can do this, just hang in there!\u201d</span> Suddenly, you remember that nasty nidoqueen. She didn\u2019t know a thing about showmanship\u2026 about the craft\u2026 about dedication. She couldn\u2019t imagine all the hard work you\u2019ve put in to get to where you are. And yet, to get so smug and mighty, over a hot dog eating contest? It made you furious! Lucian cheers as you immediately start chomping down again, driven by primal rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire in your eyes, you don\u2019t even breathe as you wolf down more and more hot dogs. Before you know it, you\u2019ve eaten 60\u2026 70\u2026 80! At 90, though, your second wind subsided, and you start to slow down.  At this point, your belly was so round that you looked pregnant, and you didn\u2019t know if you could fit any more food in there. You brought a hot dog to your lips, but you just couldn\u2019t bring yourself to bite down. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cOnly ten more, Maura! You can do this!\u201d</span> Lucian said, egging you on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</span> You whimpered, dropping the hot dog, already stuffed to capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cLet me help, then!\u201d</span> Before you could respond, the mismagius levitated the hot dog in the air, and stuffed it into your mouth! Almost by instinct, you started chewing, and the the ghost-type slowly worked the hotdog down your throat. Just as you swallowed it, another was levitated into your mouth\u2026 and after that, another, and then another. Quickly, you were gagging and chewing as fast as you could as the mismagius force-fed you, feeling the skin of your belly stretch more and more with every additional hotdog. Finally, you let out a gasp as the last of them was slipped down your throat, leaving the plate empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so much, was it?\u201d</span> The mismagius smiled. Meanwhile, you groaned, rubbing your paws over the taut skin of your sore belly. Your furry tummy was about the size of a beach ball at this point, and was gurgling and churning loudly as it go to work processing your huge feast. You could feel each and every hotdog inside of you, shifting around and squishing together with your every moment. Meanwhile, the mismagius looked at his stopwatch. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cHmm\u2026 you cleaned your plate iiinnn\u2026 nine minutes and twenty-six seconds. Not terrible\u2026 but we\u2019ve got a lot of work ahead of us.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUgh...\u201d</span> You loudly groaned, feeling like you might pop at any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cOh! Uh...\u201d</span> Lucian looks up, noticing your discomfort. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWell, that\u2019s it for today. You should get some rest for the rest of the day \u2014 let it all digest.\u201d</span> He helps you dizzily walk over to the couch, your huge stomach swaying to and fro beneath you as you walked. You let out another groan as you laid back on the comfortable sofa, your stomach jiggling and glurping at the movement. The mismagius turned on the TV, letting you have something to watch while you processed your meal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan was no stranger to stories about humans. Some of the Pokemon in the Ice Path would often have the most outlandish tales about fearless trainers, structures high enough to reach the heavens, and metallic machines built for travelling long distances called cars and trucks. Ethan never put too much thought to these claims, in case they were little more than rumors, but seeing what appeared to be a truck in front of him was more than enough to pique his interest. Approaching somewhat hesitantly, Ethan noticed several boxes in the back of the truck, each one loaded with berries. But wait, some of these berries were in shapes and sizes he had never seen before. However, Ethan was unable to just stand there in awe; his gurgling stomach was also aware of the berries, and needless to say, it wanted some. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing onto the truck, Ethan was overwhelmed by the sheer number of berries neatly arranged before him. His first thought was to try one of the strange foreign berries he had just noticed. Grabbing a red, spiky berry, Ethan cautiously smelled it. A wise decision, as his nose detected tremendous heat. Looking around a bit, he found a green, slightly prickly berry that smelled sweet. Probably sweet enough to balance out the red berry's heat. Taking a deep breath, Ethan took a bite out of the red berry, and one out of the green berry immediately afterwards. Chewing both bites of berry simultaneously, Ethan was surprised by how well his theory worked. Sure, the mixture tasted a little sour, but sourness was never an issue with him. As he swallowed, Ethan was taken aback by another growl from his pudgy belly. Naturally, it makes sense that he's still hungry. He technically only took two bites, after all. But the timing of that growl seemed almost like his stomach was trying to tell him something. While this phenomena has happened to him before, it only ever happens whenever he has a food-related idea. So why would.........!!! That's it!!! If the two berries he tasted worked so well together, there's bound to be other combinations he could try! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following afternoon was spent experimenting with the various berries the truck had to offer. Some combinations left him craving for more, others made him want to gag. Ethan could've gone on like this forever, but suddenly, a large hand had grabbed hold of him! Almost immediately, Ethan was face to face with an angry human. \"Who do you think you are, eating up my inventory!\" the human shouted in a deep, gruff voice. Ethan was terrified, to say the least. Sure, he could've attacked the human, and ran off, but he was paralyzed in fear. Noticing the berries clutched in Ethan's claws, the human's expression changed from anger to surprise almost instantly. \"No way.....\" the human said. \"Tell me one thing: were you mixing berries together to see how they'd taste?\" Ethan nodded quickly, still fearful of what the human could do to him. \"I see......You seem to be a little smarter than most Pokemon, seeing how you got the mental capacity to recognize and experiment with different flavors.......\" Softening his grip on Ethan, the human continued. \"Listen, I need some help around my restaurant, but critics are giving me a hard time since I don't have a Pokemon. If you come live with me and lend a hand, I'll let you have all the berries you want. Whaddya say?\"</span></div></div>",

I at least didn't eat any one of the other berries though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" The Sunflora said. \"As soon as I can eat all of them, I can finally outgrow and defeat my rival Lopunny. She may be the size of a truck, but after I'm done eating all of these berries, I'll be the size of the city at least!\" After hearing that the Sunflora would become the size of a city with the berries, Heather thought she could probably join in with the Sunflora and maybe even surpass her, so she stayed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sunflora was about to eat her first berry...</span></div></div>",

The last thing he remembered was a hard piece of plastic smacking his flank before he went ibto some sort of cryogenic sleep; but he had been let out again in completely different surroundings.  He recognized that he was in Mauville City, but he had no idea where. Suddenly, he heard a human voice call out, \"Manectric!  Use Thunder Fang!\"  Manectric suddenly looked up, saw a Wailmer, and attacked it with a Thunder Fang.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another human sighed, called his Wailmer to return before a stream of red light appeared, making the Wailmer disappear into a small red ball, similar to the one Manectric had been smacked with a few minutes before.  Manectric looked up at the human who had smacked him with a the ball and wagged his tail before he was congratulated with a short pat on the head.  Mabectric was then put back into the cryogenic sleep that he had been put ibto before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Manectric was released again, he saw a gaint manor house.  Then, he heard a familiar voice call out, \"Go on inside, Manectric, the master is waiting for us.\"  Manectric had no idea what was going on--he was disoriented and unfamiliar with his surroundings.  He also felt like he was being watched.  No, he was not being watched, but spied upon.  This was a new sensation to him that made Manectric deeply uncomfortable.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The house was massive, with a complex grid of corridors and rooms that Manectric could immediately tell would take some time to learn to.navigate.  Left, then right, then left again; then up a flight of stairs, then right again, then down a long corridor was Manectric led until the man who had caught him, before the duo reached a set of double doors that Manectric could tell was a study.  The man knocked thrice before a man inside answered, \"Yes, Andrew?\"  The man, Andrew answered, \"Sir, I have the Manectric that you requested.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric heard the man inside grunt before he ostebsibly stood and opened the door.  When the man opened the door, Andrew handed the other man Manectric's Poke Ball and explained whose it was before the man thanked Andrew and dismissed him before calling for Manectric into the study.  But before Andrew had moved out of earshot, the man in the study called to the butler, \"Gather the other Pokemon.\"  Andrew nodded and left.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The man called Manectric over in soothing tones before he gestured to a bowl of food.  Manectric wasn't sure whether he wanted the food.  Then his stomach made up his mind by grumbling rather loudly.  So Manectric took a bite.  The food was better than anything he had ever eaten; so Manectric took another bite; and then he took another.  Soon, he had finished a bowl.  The man chuckled, giving him another bowl full of food.  Manectric was still unsure whether he wanted more, but he didn't feel too full; and his taste buds still wanted more.  So he ate more, and he finished a second bowl.  Now the man openly laughed, but Manectric wouldn't eat any more food that moment.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, someone, probably Andrew, knocked at the door.  \"Lord Gregory,\" called Andrew's voice, \"as requested, your other Pokemon have been collected and brought here.\". \"Excellent, let them in.  Thank you, Andrew.\"  Andrew then opened the door and let in three other Pokemon: Mightyena, Arcanine, and Lycanroc, a diurnal one.  Manectric smelled only male phermones in the room, which mildly disappointed him.  The Lycanroc's face contorted slightly before he shrugged and sat quietly.  The Arcanine smiled and ran up to greet Manectric, and the Mightyena rolled over excitedly and began to pant excitedly.  \"Good afternoon,\" smiled the Arcanine politely, but that was as far as Manectric got to hear before Mightyena tackled Manectric and began licking him enthusiastically and too warmly.  \"Mightyena,\" Arcanine barked, \"really?\"  The Mightyena looked up and immediately got off Manectric.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry. I just get so excited,\" Mightyena apologized.  \"I understand and forgive you,\" Manectric laughed after his punctual statement.  Manectric walked over to Lycanroc and sniffed him.  Lycanroc sat and nodded before Manectric greeted him, \"Good afternoon.  How are you?\"  The Lycanroc then spoke, \"I'm fine, but quite as extroverted as those two.  I'm kind of awkward around new people and Pokemon.\"  Manectric laughed at the other Pokemon's sarcastic honesty; he liked this guy.  While Manectric had been talking to Lycanroc, Mightyena had followed and intejected: </span></div></div>",

That's a bathroom; there's a storage closet, and a lounge.  Let's go downstairs.\"  Having descended the stairs, Manectric noticed a spacious foyer that led into a ballroom, according to Mightyena.  \"They like to host parties regularly; one will be in a few days, apparently,\" stated Mightyena, wandering off topic a bit, \"I think that you'll have fun.  I certainly did at the one I went to a couple of weeks ago.  Oh, there's the kitchen.\"  Mightyena salivated a bit before Arcanine nudged him gently, hissing, \"you're drooling again, doofus.\"  Mightyena snapped back to attention again, \"Sorry, the cook is just generous to us with spoiled leftovers.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Having finished the tour of the house, the group went out to the patio where Manectric saw a pool and an orchard with various berry plants and the like.  \"Do you wanna go swimming?\" Mightyena asked Manectric, eagerly anticipating an affirmation.  \"Is the pool saltwater?\" Manectric inquired in turn.  \"Yeah, why?\"  Manectric looked disappointedly at Mightyena, \"do you have any idea what happens to electricity in saltwater?\"  When the Mightyena shook his head, Manectric continued, \"Electricity gets carried through the water by the salt, meaning that anything else in the water gets zapped.  And because of my static, I don't want to hurt you.  Sorry.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mightyena pouted for a moment before he continued more sulkily, \"Fine, feel free to do what you want.  The other two are afraid to go swimming also.  I'm going to the kitchen.\"  Manectric thought that that plan sounded like an excellent idea, and Arcanine and Lycanroc agreed.  So off they went to the kitchen.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The chef was a rail thin, eager man, who was short with short brown hair, a shaved face, but kind, warm eyes that belied his firm exterior.  When he saw Manectric, he laughed, calling one of his sous-chef to come have a look at the new addition to the house and to prepare for him a welcome dish.  Manectric was at first excited before he realized that the sous-chef was merely geeting more Pokemon-food.  Although he ate it happily, he was really expecting some human food.  Arcanine had walked over to his food dish and began eating from it.  Lycanroc had stayed back, away from the food.  Mightyena called him over, inviting him to come eat.  Lycanroc politely declined, saying that he was still full from breakfast.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mightyena then began eagerly chowing down on his food while Manectric wandered over to what the chef was making.  When the chef noticed Manectric, he smiled and rubbed the Pokemon's belly with his foot when Manectric rolled over.  When Mightyena had finished his bowl, he sighed and padded over to the chef, and looked  with pleading, pathetic eyes that seemed almost immediately to melt the chef's heart, prompting the chef to call the sous-chef to scrounge in the refidgerator for expired leftovers.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sous-chef then went over and pulled out an almost full tray of party sandwiches--turkey, ham, roast beef, egg salad, and Magikarp salad sandwiches.  Then he alternated giving them to Manectric and Mightyena.  Then Arcanine joined the mix and Manectric left the mix, stuffed to utter capacity.  Then Lycanroc joined and Arcanine left the mix.  Then Manectric went back in, but Manectric noticed that Mightyena never left the sous-chef's feet.  Even when the other three had had enough, Mightyena still continued to eat until all the sandwiches were gone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is he fed enough?\" Manectric whispered to Lycanroc.  \"Yes, but he hadn't been when we found him.  He was, I think, one of some Team Aqua grunt's Pokemon.  They didn't feed him nearly enough.  Arcanine was a Magma officer's Pokemon, so he was never fed enough either.  You and I are the only ones straight from the wild.  When Brendan, the Pokemon League Champion, beat Magma and Aqua, those two were released; and Master Gregory adopted them.  I was his first Pokemon.  I've known him for a few months now, but the other two only have been here for a few weeks.  They've made good progress on regaining deficient body mass.  Lycanroc sat down, his glistening light-brown fur sat nearly perfectly on his back.  But Manectric noticed a small fold of what appeared to be skin forming above Lycanroc's stomach when he sat.  He had noticed something similar in Mightyena and Lycanroc.  It really wasn't a big deal, but it was noticeable.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Having decided that he wanted a nap, everyone plodded heavily outside and lay down on the concrete for a nap.  Manectric did the same; but while everyone else was in a food-induced comatose state, he decided that he needed to go around the house to check out more of it.  His stomach sloshed around, and the midday sun on top of it didn't feel too pleasant.  It was the middle of summer and quite hot, so Manectric began to pant, so he went inside, where he found\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, Manectric,\" called Andrew, \"just what I was looking for.  Where are the others?  We need to round them up for super training.\"  So Manectric led Andrew to the others, who all, especially Mightyena, grimaced when Andrew declared what he intended for them to do.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, what is this 'super training'?\" Manectric turned to Mightyena.  \"Super training involves the use of these stupid toys designed to improve certain battle staistics for us.  It's a form of EV training.  It's grueling and difficult, and I'm terrible at it all.  None of us is good, but I'm the worst.\"  Manectric nodded, understanding Mightyena's frustration at his own failure.  Manectric could also hear the food still sloshing around in Mightyena's stomach, which would make Mightyena uncomfortable at best.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The group arrived at the training room of the house.  It was a spacious room, only a bit smaller than the kitchen, with dumbells, treadmills, and various balls of all sizes and shapes.  In the corner was a punching bag and some targets for practice.  Manectric was still surveying the room when Andrew suddenly called, \"Ok, who wants to go first?\"  When no one came forward, Andrew eventually called out, \"Come on, you lazy bums, let's go.\"  Eventually, because he felt likw he had betrayed his group, Manectric decided to go first.  \"Good, we have a volunteer.  Let's do some Attack training first.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andrew then told Maectric to try and hit the bag as hard as he could.  So Manectric did, repeatedly, until Andrew called time.  The punching bag must have had an instrument inside it to measure force with which it had been hit, because Andrew called out, \"56.3 Newtons per square meter, slightly below average for a Manectric of your age and level.  Don't worry, we'll get you there.\"  Manectric nodded, feeling his stomach pulsing.  He now felt nauseated mildly, but he staggered over to his peers and flopped down.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Exhausting, huh,\" Mightyena whispered gloomily.  Manectric could only nod his head in agreement.  Lycanroc went next, and he pleased Andrew with an apparent marked improvement over the previous week.  Then Arcanine went, after whose attempt, Andrew's face appeared ambivalent.  No serious change in Attack was noticed.  But Lycanroc was a physical attacker, and Arcanine was not; so these results were not terribly surprising.  Then up lumbered Mightyena sluggishly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mightyena tried to jump before he barely managed to hit the bag.  And after that sorry attempt, Mightyena looked visibly shaken.  He tried again.  This time, he managed to land a more convincing hit on the bag.  And for half the time, he managed to buildon each successive attempt, successfully hitting the bag harder each time.  But such efforts visibly drained Mightyena, who didn't appear to have the stamina to carry on.  After his sixth attempt, Mightyena fell clumsily on his right hind leg.  He tried to stand, but his leg wobbled too much to be of much use; so he collapsed again, completely this time, utterly defeated.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Although his hits had been decent, Mightyena's  stamina thoroughly disappointed Andrew.  \"Allright, your laziness, let's see you do defense training first.\"  Defense training was effectively just holding dumbells above one's head for as long as one could.  Mightyena managed to do fine on this one, but again disppointed Andrew, \"Come on, any average fighting type could beat you in two hits, and the best at you level could in one.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To Manectric, Mightyena looked ready either to cry or vomit, Manectric couldn't tell.  \"It's ok,\" Manectric reassured Manectric, \"You're being held to a high standard on a full stomach.  I'm sure you're better than these scores indicate.\"  Mightyena nodded but appeared to take little solace from Manectric's words.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But in Special Attack training, a mix of accuracy and power, Mightyena scored well above average for his breed and level, a boone given that Shadow Ball and Dark Pulse were his two favorite moves, and the ones that Gregory most often used.  Special Defense training, which consisted mostly of dodging rubber balls, Mightyena was about average when everyone else was below average.  Then came the Speed trainig.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was just a treadmill that Andrew gradually accelerated, but Mightyena hated the thought of running on a full stomach.  He asked everyone to go before he went, and all obliged him.  Things went off without a hitch for the first three.  Speed was mildly above average for all the other three.  When Manectric jumped off the treadmill, he laughed with Mightyena and chuckled, \"Come on, you big lug, it's your turn.\"  Mightyena nodded nervously, obviously not wanting to be ridiculed by Andrew or to lose his afternoon meal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Things started off well for Mightyena, seamelessly transitioning from a walk to a jog to a run.  But everyone could hear Mightyena panting by the time Mightyena was breaking into a sprint.  He looked green with nausea.  And in his nausea, he began to totter until he tripped.  He tripped and was flung into the wall on his back.  There was a crater where Mightyena had hit the wall and a tremendous thump had followed.  Andrew rushed over and check for broken bones.  Fortuneately he found none.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upstairs, Gregory heard a muffled thump below him.  In the gym?  He decided to go inspect it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andrew managed to help a dazed and stunned Mightyena up to his feet, but not before he heard the heavy, deliberate steps of his employer.  \"What the hell is\u2026my Arceus\u2026Andrew, what did you do?\". After the butler had explained what had happened, Gregory stood up, his young, bearded, and stout face stern with resolve.  \"No more of that, Andrew.  For any of them.\" \"But, sir,\" Andrew equivocated, \"what will we do for their Speed EV's?  It's far too hot for them outside, and not all of them can use the pool.\"  Gregory stared patronizingly at his butler, \"Andrew, don't tell me you can't think of some other exercise for them.\"  Andrew nodded, but honestly couldn't, not for a gym anyway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gregory fumed out of the gym and up the stairs.  Over the next few days, Lycanroc broke four punching bags, Manectric dropped dumbells on his chest five times, and Arcanine and made the plaster of the wall scorched from missing the targets with his Flamethrower attack.  The first time, all these things had happened by accident, but the next few times, they were deliberate; so Gregory decided, against Andrew's advice, to stop the EV training.  That decision suited everyone, especially Mightyena, just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Preparations for the party the next day were well under way.  Food was beginning to be ordered to prepare, decorations were set up, the house was made immaculate, and none of the Pokemon were allowed to go outside together.  They weren't even allowed to go out alone with a leash and a human escort because they had been groomed, and Lady Sarah didn't want to ruin that.  Manectric liked the glossy sheen and the soft feel of his coat after he had been groomed, as opposed to the shaggy mass of fur he was used to.  The party was coming.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Last minute preparations were being made, but everything was practically ready for the party.  Everyone seemed absent-minded, rushing to and fro to get things done.  The Pokemon were given a steady stream of sample food throughout the day from the chef.  And the Pokemon food flowed more freely than it ever had before.  Everyone took advantage of that, especially Arcanine and Mightyena.  But that flow of food died down by two in the afternoon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everything was ready by seven o'clock, an hour before the guests were set to arrive, because Gregory anticipated that some guests would come early--some always did.  Sure enough, at 7:45, the first guests arrived.  They were obviously from Gregory's parents' generation, and Manectric found out that the two were indeed his parents.  They were built like their son, and Manectric could trace most of his master's features from them.  The man was heavyset like his son, perhaps more so; but his wife was thin and elegant for her age, with sharp eyes and an aquiline nose like her son; and Manectric learned that his smarts had come from her.  But his father was the sweetest, most compassionate man Manectric had ever met.  He pet all his son's Pokemon until the other guests arrived, doling out treats as he went.  Mightyena explained that this had happened the last time too.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gregory's father, Dave, grunted and wheezed as he stood, laughing that he was too old to be bending down like that.  His wife silently rolled her eyes, saying that she could have bent down like Dave had just fine.  It was because he was fat that he couldn't do it.  Dave merely laughed and shrugged, \"That could be too.  I don't know, dear.\"  As guests strolled in and the foyer filled up, Gregory suggested that the party move to the hors d'oeuvres table in the dining room.  Manectric had no idea what an \"hors d'oeuvre\" was, but it sounded promising.  Lycanroc saw the confused expression on Manectric's face and whispered: \"'Hors d'oeuvre' is Kalosian for 'food away from the table.'  It's just a fancy way of saying 'food before a meal.'\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lycanroc turned out to be right.  Gregory's announcement meant food.  \"Ok,\" Mightyena whispered to Manectric, \"spread out, and don't beg too often.  That's how Lycanroc has said that he's gotten the most food from people.  It worked pretty well for me.  So I'll go over there, Lycnanroc and Arcanine have already chosen corners.  Let's split up.\"  Manectric agreed and went his way from Mightyena.  Manectric was careful to note who he had begged food from, who had been watching him, and how frequently he begged from people.  Food seemed to flow in a steady stream as if people were expected to feed the animals.  Some people evwn sought Manectric out to dump food on him.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, Gregory called for everyone to move to the main table to eat.  In the same manner as with the hors d'oeuvres, the four Pokemon each took a side of the square table and began to beg from it.  People were just as generous, if not more generous with their dinners after they had filled up with hors d'oeuvres than they were with the hors d'oeuvres.  Manectric even saw Mightyena get whole plates of food for himself.  By the time everyone had finished eating, three of the four Pokemon, the exception being Mightyena, met at the middle of the table, under the table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't eat any more,\" huffed Manectric.  \"I could still go for desert,\" sighed Arcanine.  \"Yeah, but you outweigh us two to one.  So no wonder.\"  Lycanroc laughed.  Mightyena was still begging for food, despite that there was a slight distension to his stomach from all the food he had eaten.  \"Man, Mightyena sure likes to eat,\" Lycanroc chuckled, \"but how can anyone blame him.  He was starved by those Aqua bastards, after all.\"  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After desert, Mightyena slowly plodded over to the others and lay down gingerly, ready to pass out.  He had been asleep for a few minutes when everyone heard Gregory's voice call out, \"Is anyone ready for some battles?\"  He got some hearty laughs and a few words of support for his motion.  \"Well, it's decided then.  There are\u202632 of us.  Perfect!  That's just enough for a perfect single elimination tournament!  Let's draw numbers to see who battles who first.  1 against 32, 2 against 31, et cetera.  So let's draw numbers out of a hat then, shall we?\"  \"I don't know for whom you're stalling!\"  Everyone laughed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When everyone had a number, Gregory's was 29.  That meant, according to Arcanine, who knew that Gregory owned four battle-pitches; so Gregory would be one of the first eight up.  \"Someone needs to wake him,\" Arcanine joked, gesturing to Mightyena, who was out-cold.  \"It's fine.  It's three on three; so if he wants to sleep, let him,\" countered Lycanroc.  Arcanine shrugged.  Forcing his exhausted body up and over to his master.  The trio found Gregory, who looked befuddled.  \"Where's Mightyena?\" he asked hurriedly.  The trio of Pokemon turned when Gregory smiled and beamed, \"There you are!  I'll need you.  Lycanroc, you can sit this one out.  I'll need you next time, so you should rest.  Come on guys, return.\"  Thus began the short cryogenic sleep.</span></div></div>",

And begin!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lady, Jeanette, called her Pokemon first, \"I choose you, Gyarados!\"  Gregory scoffed, \"You're so predictable.  Go, Manectric!\"  Manectric stood, staring at a twenty-foot tall monster, an intimidating one, to say the least while he had a full stomach that churned when it saw the Gyarados.  \"Gyrados, Dragon Rage!\" shouted Jeanette.  \"Manectric, dodge and use Thunderbolt.\" countered Gregory.  Manectric didn't manage to evade the attack, launched from close range at a full and petrified target; but he did managw to launch the best Thunderbolt he had.  The Gyarados contorted with rage and pain before it fell over, unconscious.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gyarados is unable to battle.  The winner is Gregory.  Lady Viscountess, state your next Pokemon,\" declared the referee.  The viscountess was too stunned to answer for a moment before she stammered, \"Ah, hm, I think it'll be Gardevoir.\"  The referee nodded, \"will you switch your Pokemon, sir?\"  Gregory considered for a moment, \"No, sir, I will not.  I have full confidence in my Manectric.\"  Manectric beamed with pride.  \"Very well, then.  Begin!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gardevoir, I need you now tonight!\" Jeanette pleaded.  \"Manectric, Thunderbolt!\" Gregory shouted quickly.  Manectric then let out another Thunderbolt.  \"Gardevoir, Psychic!\" Jeanette barked, regaining her composure.  The attack hit Manectric like a brick wall of energy, sapping him of all power.  But he didn't faint.  \"Manectric, one more time!\"  \"Gardevoir, Calm Mind!\"  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric was astounded when the Gardevoir didn't faint.  \"Draining Kiss!\" shouted the Viscountess.  The damned Gardevoir was on top of Gardevoir before everything went black.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lycanroc watched as Manectric was sapped of all his strength and as the Gardevoir regained some of its own (Lycanroc had to refer to the Gardevoir that way because it was androgenous, not because he deemed it an inferior life form).  \"Lord Gregory, what Pokemon will you send out next?\" inquired the referee.  \"Mightyena,\" stated Gregory in reply.  \"Lady Jeanette, will you change Pokemon?\"  When the Viscountess shook her head, the referee began the match again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mightyena, Shadow Ball!\" ordered Gregory.  Mightyena obeyed immediately, landing a direct hit; but he caused little damage.  \"Gardevoir, Draining Kiss,\" the Viscountess sneered, demanding her Pokemon obey.  \"Mightyena, dodge,\" screamed Gregory in panick, knowing that Draining Kiss was very effective against Mightyena.  But Mightyena, still full from the banquet beforehand, responded poorly and sluggishly; so he got a direct hit scored on him.  But he didn't faint.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Allright, Mightyena, way to hang in there!\" Gregory cheered, trying to encourage his weary partner.  \"Do you really think he can survive another Draining Kiss?\" Jeanette laughed, deriding Gregory's optimism, \"Gardevoir, Draining Kiss.\"   Gregory didn't utter a command.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gardevoir was closing, but Gregory still said nothing.  Then, just before Gardevoir reached Mightyena, he yelled, \"Shadow Ball, Mightyena!\"  Mightyena instantly obeyed, just in time to smack Gardevoir with it before it could get out of the way, and knocking it flat on its back.  \"Now, again, Shadow Ball!\"  Mightyena again obeyed instantly.  Gardevoir did not get up afterward, having been knocked out.  \"Winner!\" shouted the referee; and Mightyena collapsed, unable to continue.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh,\" stared the referee, \"Mightyena is unable to continue.  Each party will now cast out their third and final Pokemon!\"  Lycanroc was amazed.  Mightyena had never showed that kind of endurance before that battle.  To do so now was amazing for one so uninterested in battle.  \"Go, Arcanine,\" cried Gregory with sheer glee.  \"Go, Lucario!\" smiled Jeanette, in a seeming concession of defeat.  \"And begin.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Arcanine, Flamethrower,\" commanded Gergory.  \"Lucario, dig,\" whispered Jeanette.  \"Damn it,\" fumed Gregory.  Jeanette laughed jovially, \"My dear Duke, did you think honestly that I would let you off so easily?  You're not a damned fool.  But neither am I.  Now Lucario.\"  Gregory panicked, \"Arcanine, beneath you, now, Flamethrower!\"  Arcanine's speed of reflexes surprised Jeanette, especially because of Gregory's uncomposed flailing.  Arcanine hit Lucario just as he was coming up; and the two collide in a meaty thud that sounded quite painful to all who heard it.  Both Pokemon dropped to the ground in a heap, not moving.  \"Because neither Pokemon is able--\" he stopped suddenly; and Jeanette and Gregory watched as Arcanine struggled to his feet when Lucario did not.  \"Lucario is unable to continue; therefore, the victroy and the game go to Arcanine and Duke Gregory!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The small crowd that had gathered to watch the only match still going on erupted in cheers and applause, before they quickly went back to soing what they had been doing before, including Grand Duke Dave.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of the matches went off without much serious competition, so Gregory was worried about the calibre of his opponents for the fights to come.</span></div></div>",

His second match had been a clean sweep with Lycanroc, Manectric, and Mightyena steamrolling opponents.  Gregory had comforted the poor man he had beaten the beatdown had been so one-sided.  With his match having ended, Gregory looked around and saw his father preparing for his next battle.  His father's Salamence had cruised through the first battle with barely a scratch.  But his second opponent wouldn't be a pushover, Gregory knew.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dave's next opponent would be Baron Eddie, a man about Gregory's age.  Eddie had chosen as his Pokemon Torkoal, Magneton, and Quagsire, a match if Gregory's father had ever seen one.  Gregory was about to offer his father some encouragement when a referee walked up and told Dave that his match was about to start. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gregory hurried over to his father's match and managed to catch it from the beginning.  \"Grand Duke Dave, choose your first Pokemon.  Now you, Baron Eddie.\"  When each had chosen his Pokemon, the referee whistled; and both threw out their Pokemon.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gregory looked at his father's Salamence more closely now that he could get more than fleeting glances of it.  Gregory knew immediately that something seemed off.  He knew Salamence was a naturally blocky Pokemon in its physique, but Dave's Salamence's stomach barely cleared the ground when it stood.  It also seemed to have a bit of trouble getting to its feet.  But with one Dragon Pulse, Eddie's Quagsire had fainted.  The other two Pokemon of the Baron's faced similar fates equally quickly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After the battle, Gregory went up to congratulate his father, \"Dad, Salamence was great as usual, even though he seemed exhausted by the end of it, though he barely suffered any damage.\"  Dave looked concerned, \"He seemed fine to me.  Why?\"  Gregory smiled, \"Dad, your Salamence looks like he needs a bit more training time.  He seems to be going a bit soft.\"  Dave laughed, \"Your mother says the same thing, and that he should be as heavy as he is.  I always tell her that they never feed the Salamences that they put in the Pokedex enough.  Salamences are supposed to be blockier than the Pokedex's deceptive entry would lead you to believe.  The space between his belly and the floor should be minimal when he stands.  Besides, Salamence had no trouble flying the last time we went flying.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Four months ago,\" chimed in Gregory's mother.  \"Dave, admit it; your Salamence is fat and needs to lose weight, just like you.\"  Dave went red in the face, \"The jokes about me I can take, but I would appreciate if you didn't insult my Pokemon, Nancy.\"  Nancy was taken aback at her husband's inclemency. She was trying to be gentle, but gentility was not her strong suit.  \"I'm sorry, dear.  I won't offend you like that again.  I didn't mean to affront you.\"  Dave nodded, \"I'm sorry I snapped at you dear.  I shouldn't have.  Forgive me.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dave rolled his eyes at the mushy sentimentalism that his parents loved to share with each other, but he endured it with a silent chuckle.  The third round should have been  about to begin, thought Gregoty, and told his father so.  The third round went well for Gregory, with Arcanine, Lycanroc, and Manectric battling, and only Arcanine fainting.  In the third round, however, Dave decided to use his Zebstrika.  It was a beautiful creature, with a barrell-shaped chest, with sleek skin, and ribs covered in a svelte layer of fat completely, so much so that the Pokemon's back made a crease in the middle.  It stood stolidly and destroyed each of its opponent's Pokemon.  The fourth round passed without much fanfare either, with Mightyena, Arcanine, and Lycanroc all beating their opponents.  And Dave's Salamence beat all of its opponents lying down.  Nancy whispered in her son's ear that Salamence was lying down because it was too tired to stand.  The crowd loved the Salamence nevertheless.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before the final round between father and son, everyone went to go get desert and refreshments.  Dave even let his three Pokemon out of their Pokeballs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After Dave had brought out a piece of cake and a bowl of ice cream for his three Pokemon and his son's four and had left, the seven Pokemon began to mingle.  Salamence and Zebstrika were both outgoing and friendly, if calm and laid back.  But Dave's third Pokemon, Swampert, was more aloof and standoffish.  He barely said anything, but he at least listened intently to what everyone else was saying eventually.  Lycanroc didn't appear to know Swampert, either, so it was clear that Swampert was a new addition.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric was also surprised how heavy Dave's Pokemon were.  He had seen a Salamence once; and although he knew that they weren't slender to begin with, the one Manectric had seen had been able to lift his belly off the ground more than the couple inches Dave's Salamence could.  Perhaps that was just a result of domestication, Manectric thought, because all Dave's Pokemon seemed to be more massive, especially at the waist, than any Manectric had seen in the wild; but he didn't bring up the issue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric glanced at Mightyena, who looked like he had put on a few  pounds just in the past several days Manectric had known him.  Manectric then looked at himself.  He knew the shape of his torso before he had been captured, and he saw that the very pronounced hourglass at his waist had grown less pronounced since he had arrived.  That was just the result of being fed properly, Manectric reasoned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0These things weren't pressing issues in Manectric's mind, but they were amusing.  Manectric then looked at Swampert's torso.  The usually thin form Manectric was used to with Swamperts was not there, usurped by a pendulous  mass that hung to just a couple of inches above Swampert's knees.  It was mildly adorable, Manectric mused to himself contentedly.  Dave then returned and snuck everyone a second round of dessert while he ate his own.  Manectric saw why Dave's Pokemon adored their master.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon after Dave had thrown away the trash from the paper plates, while he stroked his Salamence's generous underside, eliciting a contented purr from the dragon, the referee came up and told Dave that his final battle was about to begin.  Dave nodded, returned his Pokemon, and called his son over before he told his son the news he had just been given.  Gregory nodded and called back his Pokemon to himself.  He took Lycanroc, Mightyena, and Manectric, allowing Arcanine to sit and rest, digesting the desert it had just devoured.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gentlemen, select your first Pokemon,\" called the referee.  \"Now, ladies and gentlemen, I announce to you the battle between Grand Duke David and Duke Gregory; let the battle begin!\"  Gregory then summoned his first Pokemon, \"Lycanroc, I choose you!\"  Dave smiled, amused that he had become so predictable, \"Salamence, you're up.\"  \"GO!\" shouted the referee, and the match began.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lycanroc, Rock Slide,\" ordered the Duke.  \"Salamence, Fly!\" countered the Grand Duke; but Salamence didn't.  It tried, but its weight bogged it down, so it was too slow.  Consequently, it got slammed with a mass of rock.  \"Ok, Salamence, Iron Tail!\"  Salamence then tried to run up, but once again, its bulk slowed it down to such a degree that Gregory could counter, \"Lycanroc, Rock Tomb,\" and hit Salamence dead-on, knocking Salamence out.  \"Salamence is unable to continue, Lycanroc wins!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyone stood shocked in a dazed silence at what had just happened.  The immortal Salamence had just fallen to a Lycanroc, one single Lycanroc.  \"Sir, pick your next Pokemon,\" urged the referee, galvanizing Dave from his stupor.  \"R-right,\" he muttered, \"Swanpert, I choose you.\"  There sat Swampert, with Gregory looking perplexed, \"Ok, Lycanroc, return.  Go, Mightyena!\"  \"Allright, then.  Battle, continue!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Swampert, Earthquake!\" barked Dave, breaking from his usually serene demeanor.  Swampert immediately obeyed, not jumping to its feet, but coming close, it sat and used the move in the laziest way possible, \"Mightyena, Dark Pulse,\" countered Gregory, as soon as the Earthquake had stopped.  \"Swampert, Waterfall,\" demanded Gregory, more calmly, but no less intensely.  Swampert then slowly rose to its feet, but moved afterward with amazing speed for such a bulky Pokemon, smacking Migthyena, causing Mightyena to flinch.  \"Again, Surf!\" laughed Dave, in a cold laugh that Gregory had only ever heard his mother use, at least among his parents.  After the wave had passed, Mightyena lay knocked out on the ground.  \"Mightyena is unable to continue.  Swmapert wins!\" proclaimed the referee.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyone cheered again.  Gregory was now white with fear.  He now had nothing against which Swampert didn't have a very-effective type-advantage in Swampert.  \"Ah, go, Manectric,\" he called timidly, with a wobble in his voice.  \"And, continue,\" the referee announced.  \"Swampert, use Earthquake,\" and, again, from a reclining position, Swampert launched his attack.  With devastating effectiveness, Swampert, in one move, pulverized Manectric, knocking it out like a light.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"'Manectric is unable to continue, Swampert wins!\" cried the referee.  Gregory saw the futile hope of this, but he ordered out Lycanroc anyway, which was swept away by one Surf attack.  Gregory laughed and conceded defeat, \"Dad, you're as good as ever; and Swampert is amazing!\"  Dave blushed, \"Well, that's why I had Professor Birch send me that Mudkip a few months ago, to beat you.  \"It's so regal,\" Gregory added, \"I mean, it didn't even have to stand to beat Manectric or Lycanroc.  But is Salamence ok?  I mean, he used to be able to dodge Lycanroc's Rock Slide with no problem.  What happened?\"  Dave smiled wearily, checking to make sure his wife wasn't lurking, as she was wont to do, \"Contrary to what your mother says, he's just getting old, like me, I'm afraid.  He also doesn't fly me nearly as many places as he used to.  So it's, I think, just a combination of age and lack of recent practice.\"  Gregory nodded, not seeing anything wrong with hsi father's assessment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And Swampert, ever since he evolved from being a Marshtomp has been averse to exercise, which is fine given that I want a docile inside pet.  But we still have to make sure he doesn't jump in the pool--he's been known to muddy it up.\"  Gregory laughed at his father's half-joking attitude.  Nancy then approached, \"Dave, we ought to be getting home soon.  It's late, and we have a long day tomorrow.  Did you make the arrangements for the Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dave looked sheepishly at his wife, \"No, I'm afraid not.  But I was getting there.  Gregory, we'll be out of town for a couple of weeks on a cruise to the battle frontier's beach resort; and unfortuneately, I can't take my Pokemon with me, could you look after them for a couple of days while we get to the Battle Frontier?\"  Gregory\u2026</span></div></div>",

She nodded politely, with what Gregory could tell was a forced grin.  Gregory gave her a glance before he asked, \"Mom, Dad, could we have a word for a moment?\"  Dave and Nancy nodded, aware of their son's predicament then.  \"Is everything ok, Sarah?\"  Sarah nodded but replied, \"Gregory, these Pokemon your father has are not small.  Where will we put them?  We already have four Pokemon as it is!\"  Gregory nodded, \"But it'll just be for a few days.  I'm sure that we can make the best arrangements.  Dad will, I'm sure, bring their food.  And we can give them a couple of guest bedrooms to them, it's not like we haven't quite a few.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah finally conceded in disgust. \"Come on, dear.  It'll be just us for a while afterward.  You know how much I like to be around other people,\" Gregory pleaded.  \"Fine, go ahead; but they'd better not cause trouble,\" Sarah warned.  When Gregory relayed the news to his parents, they sighed in relief, \"Ok, we'll take them home tonight; but thanks so much for this!\" Dave gushed.  And with that, Gregory's parents left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At 8:30 the next morning, Andrew heard a knock at the door, \"Coming,\" he called as he unlocked the door to see Dave and Nancy at the door.  \"Ah,\" Andrew grunted, recalling what Gregory had told him last night about his parents, \"You can leave the Pokemon with me.  I'll be sure to take good care of them.\"  Nancy looked rebuffed at the butler's bad manners before Dave gestured that they had to go, they had a taxi waiting.  \"Right,\" Nancy remembered as she walked down the steps to the car.  \"Tell my son thanks!\" Dave called as he was leaving.  Andrew nodded and went inside.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who was that at the door?\" inquired Gregory.  \"Your parents, sir, to drop off your father's Pokemon,\" Andrew replied flatly.  \"Well, let them out!\" bubbled Gregory like a small child getting a present or his first Pokemon.  Andrew rolled his eyes amusedly, but did as he was told.  Dave's Pokemon all emerged from their Poke Balls looking rather sleepy from last night's festivities.  Mightyena popped his head in through the doorway to see the commotion and saw Salamence, Zebstrika, and Swampert, who were all crowded around Gregory's feet begging for food and getting none.  \"I see that Dad's up to his usual tricks,\" Gregory chuckled playfully, \"feeding you all table scraps.  Well, since you're not my Pokemon, whatever.\"  And he proceeded to shovel the leftover's of his breakfast evenly into the three Pokemon's mouths.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mightyena was immediately jealous, and he felt stupid because he had never thought to ask Gregory for food because he felt guilty doing so.  But once Gregory finished, the other three Pokemon stood and walked away.  Only Salamence noticed Mightyena as he struggled to hoist his behemoth stomach off the floor.  Doing that took a few moments of shimmying and scrambling before Salamence was successful.  \"Ah, Mightyena,\" he called, greeting the Dark-type, \"before you ask, yes, I'm fine.  I'm just getting old, according to my master.  Lord, my knees hurt.\"  Salamence oscillated his stomach from side to side as he walked, keeping his stomach two or three inches above the ground at all times.  \"Shall we go get breakfast?\" Salamence asked Mightyena, who was taken aback by the request, because Salamence had presumably just eaten.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, sure, sir,\" Mightyena sputtered nervously, \"if you aren't full.  I wouldn't want to bore you with my eating or tantalize you with something you couldn't have.\"  \"Nonsense,\" cried Salamence, \"I'm famished, and Lord Gregory's treat was delightful, but only an hors d'oeuvre for me.  I'm also quite sure that my master has brought my food over here.\"  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And indeed he had, a whole giant bag of it, enough to last even Salamence a week.  The others had joined Mightyena and Salamence when they heard the bowls of food being prepared--the first two were on seconds each, and Salamence almost to thirds.  Everyone ate at least one bowl of breakfast that morning, but only Lycanroc ate one, but he said that he would be back later for more.  And he waited in the back while Salamence and Mightyena finished their fourth bowls of breakfast each.  After he had eaten, Salamence plopped down where he was for a nap in Gregory's office, breathing silently but deeply.  Mightyena thought Salamence had the right idea and joined the dragon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The daily routine for Manectric was simple: get up, go outside to relieve himself, eat breakfast, explore, nap, and watch Gregory read and shuffle papers.  But today was different because Gregory was out of town on a business trip to Lilycove City to check on how Captain Stern's ferry, of which Gregory was a chief shareholder, was operating.  Manectric watched Mightyena and Salamence breath deeply and quietly on the rug, digesting breakfast.  Lycanroc and Arcanine were talking and digesting breakfast with Swampert and Zebstrika.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Things were going pretty well, but they were also quite boring.  Manectric decided to go downstairs with the other four.  That was until\u2026</span></div></div>",

It's the funniest thing!\"  Manectric stared, being dragged along practically by Mighyena.  'The poor dragon,\" was all Manectric could think, stultified and speechless by Mightyena's announcement.  Manectric arrived at the study to find that, to his horror, Salamence was indeed not able to lift his undercarriage off the ground.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Salamence was rightfully blubbering in a state of sheer terror at being unable to move without scraping himself on the hard floors.  \"Give it some time,\" Manectric suggested timidly, \"I'm sure you're just full and need some time digesting.  You'll be fine, I'm sure.  You just ate too much in one sitting, that's all.\"  Salamence snapped his head around, gazing in sheer terror that someone else had seen him in so compromised a state, \"Please,\" Salamence begged with tears streaming down his cheeks, \"I supplicate before you to ask that you not tell a single soul of this encounter today.  Do you hear? No one!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric nodded, and Salamence calmed considerably, \"Sleep it off,\" whispered Manectric reassuringly, \"you'll be fine.\"  Salamence nodded, pacified by Manectric's advice.  Salamence then proceeded to drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric turned to Mightyena, and the two finished off the food in their bowls before they went outside to talk with the others.  Manectric, walking behind the energetic Mightyena, could not help notice, however, that the Dark type of the house's abdomen swung from side to side with each step Mightyena took, and that any hourglass figure that Mightyena had once had was now gone.  Mightyena also appeared to have a rock of food in his stomach from breakfast.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the two arrived, Mightyena was panting from the short walk.  \"I ate too much at breakfast,\" he murmured to himself giddily.  \"Where's Salamence?\" asked Zebstrika, with a flash of worry crossing his face before Manectric smoothly replied, \"Oh, he's taking a nap.  He says that he needs some time to digest his food.\"  Zebstrika nodded, having the worry evaporate from his face, \"Ok, man, Swampert, he does seem to do that often.\"  Swampert nodded, \"Yeah, I wonder whether he's doing ok sometimes.\"  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zebstrika nodded, closing the conversation on the matter.  \"I'm starting to get hungry again,\" muttered Zebstrika, despite that he had had a breakfast little more than an hour before.  Manectric chuckled and determined that was the cause of the absence of ribs Manectric was used to seeing on Zebstrika.  \"We just had breakfast an hour ago, though,\" laughed Manectric, voicing his own thoughts.  Zebstrika heaved what he could of his torso between his legs and forced himself up with a small grunt, \"As Lord Dave says, there's no such thing as wasted food so long as it gets eaten.  He also says that it's always better to have an excess than a shortage.\"  Everyone laughed at that nugget of wisdom, but Manectric still chided, \"But seriously, Salamence was asleep in there last time I checked.  Is there perhaps anything else you'd like to do?\"  Zebstrika chortled before he stated, \"With these old bones?  Are you joking?  No, I'm afraid that I'm not as athletic or as into athleticism as when I was young, and I'm growing a bit tired of talking right now.  You all are great company, but I do like some time to myself once in a while.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric shook his head and laughed with amusement, \"Maybe we can get the chef to give us some of the party's leftovers.\"  Zebstrika's and Swampert's ears perked at that, \"Leftovers?  Show us!\" Swampert huffed, \"Why have you been withholding them?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mighyrna laughed, \"Because we're greedy and selfish bastards.\"  Zebstrika snorted in mockery at Mightyena's failed sarcasm, causing Mightyena to go quiet in shame.  \"No, but seriously,\" Manectric laughed awkwardly, \"Mightyena was just being sarcastic.  We honestly didn't think to ask.  We usually wait until after Mr. Gregory has had his midday meal.  But I'm sure we can ask the chef for some sort of leftovers.\"  Zebstrika nodded with enthusiasm, \"If we're going to do this, Salamence would be offended if we didn't ask him to tag along.  Someone should go wake him.\"  Mightyena looked at Manectric quickly, \"Oh, Salamence told us that he didn't want to be disturbed, and that he would come down when he was ready,\" Manectric covered, scrambling for an explanation.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And now I'm good and ready,\" came a deep, sonorous voice behind them all.  Everyone watched as Salamence landed gracefully, if heavily, on his feet in the middle of the circle everyone had made.  Salamence grunted and pushed his undercarriage off the ground, but leaving it dangerously close.  \"Shall we be off then?  I'm ready to go get these leftovers!\" exclaimed the dragon, seeming to salivate at the thought.  \"That settles that then,\" proclaimed Arcanine with glee.  The group then rose and mozied comfortably to the kitchen area, where the chef, whose name, Manectric had discovered, was Gus.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, look at my favorite little Pokemon,\" the wiry man cooed in a demeaning fashion fit only for newborn Pokemon.  The four hosts then walked away and allowed the three guests to cleave some bits and morsels for themselves, especially because they had a knack for it.  Gus initially managed to hold out before he gave in and fed the three Pokemon.  In prudence, however, Salamence wandered away the fastest, allowing Mightyena to get a chance at some leftovers.  Quickly, however, the font of leftovers, because of the newness and freshness of said leftovers, dried up, meaning that no one but the three guests, Mightyena, and Arcanine got any.  Lycanroc didn't seem too devastated, but Manectric was a bit annoyed.  But he didn't allow his irritation to show, knowing that more would come his way once the guests had gone.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But not feeling full, however, Zebstrika decided to go to his normal food bowl upstairs and to gorge himself from it.  Swampert joined him, as did Mightyena and Arcanine.  Lycanroc even drained another bowl, a rarity for Lycanroc.  But Manectric decided to wait until everyone was lying on the floor napping to finish his bowl and another.  Salamence was the only one who didn't eat more, a fact of which Manectric was proud.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next couple of days passed, and Salamence managed to control his diet for that time, but no one else did.  Zebstrika and Swampert each seemed to gain about five pounds between their arrival and departure times.  Even Mightyena and Arcanine were not immune to these trends, putting on a solid three and seven pounds respectively.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even Manectric and Lycanroc noticed subtle changes in their own and each other's figures.  Their shape was becoming more tubular, more rounded generally.  It was a trend of which they neither felt giddiness, like the others, nor contempt and hatred, like Nancy.  It was pure ambivalence, so long as they could run around and explore, they were fine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Each day seemed rather similar and boring to Manectric after a while.  The grounds were pretty, but very static, even to the point of seeming to Manectric to be stagnant.  Manectric had learned all of the paths and rooms by heart by then and found them so boring from day to day.  Gregory never took him or any of the other Pokemon anywhere, few people visited, and when they did, they seldom had any Pokemon and never wanted to let them out to play.  So that reduced Manectric and the other Pokemon to the three things that were always changing: food, themselves, and their thoughts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That meant in practice that all they seemed to do was eat, sleep, perform necessary maintenance, and talk.  Their one source of positive human attention was Gus, who loved them, played with them, gave them treats from his cupboard, and stroked them in turn.  Responsibilities for feeding the Pokemon were also delegated to him by Andrew, who had lost all interest in training the Pokemon.  Consequently, over time, the Pokemon, especially when Gregory was away, spent more and more time with Gus.  Mightyena especially did this, and Arcanine usually joined him while Lycanroc and Mnectric went outside to play and even battle each other once in a while.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We need to leave,\" whispered Lycanroc to Manectric.  Manectric did a double take, \"What?  Lycanroc, don't joke about things like that.\"  Lycanroc shook his head, \"No, I wasn't joking.  We need to leave.  Look at what this life is doing to us.  My torso looks like a sausage, yours is no better, and look at Mightyena's the next time you get the chance--or Arcanine's!  They're massive globs of fat!\"  Manectric was appalled, \"Lycanroc, sure they're a bit heavy, but--\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He got no further when Lycanroc growled, \"A little heavy?  Manectric, are you blind?  We are 'a little heavy.'  Their bodies shake with each step they take.  The other two get winded from even the smallest physical exertion.  Look at them.  My mother, may she rest in peace, always said that an adult's body should always have its waist significantly narrower than either its shoulders or haunches without having ribs showing.  Look especially at Mightyena.  When he sits, maybe not yet when he stands, but he's awfully close, his waist is wider than his shoulders and his haunches, even when he hasn't gorged himself for a while, look when he gets up in the morning, for example.  And when he has just stuffed his face silly, it's even worse.  And Arcanine is only a step behind Mightyena.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lycanroc stood easily, and Manectric mirrored him.  They both stood far more easily than the other two did, who had to rock their weight onto the ground beneath their legs--at least, what they could with the rest spilling over their legs--and rock themselves and heave themselves up off the ground in a slow, laborious process.  Manectric knew that Lycanroc had a point, but it hurt him to realize that reality.  \"They are 'a little heavy.'  You're right Lycanroc.  They're obese, but why should that drive us to leave?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because what's happening to them will happen to us more slowly.  It already is!  Just look at yourself and me.  We're both fatter than we ought to be.\"  \"Right,\" countered Manectric, \"but why can't we just control ourselves better and lose the weight?  I mean, if we will become like the other two, why hasn't it happened yet?\"  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know,\" Lycanroc admitted, \"but I think that we are less food motivated and eager to please than the other two are.  And I know you say that you can control yourself, but the fact remains that in practice--and I've seen this happen too many times to count--you won't be able to restrain yourself.  If you want some evidence, I heard Gregory on the phone with Dave the other day, saying that\u2026\" he paused, obviously trying to contain and check tears, \"They put Salamence down because he was too fat to move without assistance that Dave and Nancy were incapable of giving.  You may remember that he promised to stick to a diet.  That obviously didn't happen.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric's knees buckled, and he collapsed at the news.  Salamence had been so strong-willed, so determined.  How had this happened?  \"Those\u2026those bastards,\" was all Manectric could choke through his sob.  Lycanroc came over to comfort him, \"Now do you understand?  These people are nefarious and dangerous.  We have to leave.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No,\" Manectric stormed, \"that's not the solution either.  The solution is to lose weight.  I can convince the others and hold them to account, I swear!\"  Lycanroc nodded, but replied, \"Your valor is notable, but you can't.  Just go ask Mightyena to go run around with you when he's not eating or sleeping, or Arcanine.  I'll bet you they won't because I've asked them and have been rebuffed on numerous occasions.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine,\" declared Manectric, \" I will.  And I will succeed; just watch.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric found Arcanine and Mightyena relaxing and chatting in the shade of the verandah.  It was a pleasant autumn day, about 70 degrees Fahrenheit, not too humid, and breezy.  Despite all these things, the two were sitting in the shade contentedly.  \"Hey, Manectric,\" called Mightyena with a laugh, but not bothering to get up.  \"So what are you guys doing,\" asked Manectric innocently.  To which Arcanine lazily responded, \"Not much.  And you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then Manectric got to the critical question, \"So, Lycanroc and I were thinking about having a tag team battle between the four of us.\"  Mightyena's face lit up at the suggestion, \"Yes, please,\" he said, beginning to breath more quickly with excitement; Arcanine grimaced, but having heard Mightyena's response, and not wantingg to be a buzzkill plastered on a fake grin and replied wearily, \"Why not? I'm in.\"</span></div></div>",

Man, he'll tire hinself out before the battle at this rate,\" Arcanine replied, marking his final remark with a gesture toward Mighyena.  \"He may well, but I'm happy to see his enthusiasm that he hasn't seemed to have for much but food these past few weeks,\" Manectric pointed out, subtlely hinting to Arcanine that something was wrong.  But Arcanine merely shrugged, \"If you say so.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I do say so,\" insisted Manectric, letting the slightest touch of irritation show.  \"I wonder why,\" Arcanine wondered, seeming to genuinely question.  Manectric softened his tone, \"Look, Arcanine, Lycanroc and I have a theory.  And it concerns you too.  You've also seemed sluggish these past few weeks.  You've been reluctant to play or do anything but eat, sleep, or talk.  Lycanroc and I are worried about you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Arcanine scoffed, \"Come on, you must have guessed that we've been bored and unable to do much else but eat, sleep, and talk, as you say.\"  Manectric let more irritation back into his voice, \"Arcanine, Lycanroc and I think that you and Mightyena are dangerously overweight.  Look, Salamence\u2026Salamence is dead because he was too fat to walk by himself, so the humans had no choice but to surrender him to euthanasia.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"At least he died with some dignity and less pain,\" Arcanine reasoned.  \"That doesn't erase that he is dead!\" Manectric bellowed, with more ferocity than he had meant, \"And dying with 'dignity,' if you insist on calling it that, is a screwed up notion humans invented for killing any undesirable humans and Pokemon.  Do you think that such a thing is good?  They killed him!  They killed him!\"  Manectric raged, \"You insufferable moron!  Look at yourself!  You have troubled even standing, and I can hear your labored breathing from here.  And, look, Mightyena needs to take a break from the jog he just took to Lycanroc!  You're pathetic!  He's pathetic!  And you'll end up like Salamence if you don't change!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So I see that this is the purpose of the battle.  If you win, you'll want me to diet and lose weight.  But if we win, you'll leave us alone and not bother us about our weights again.  Deal?\"  Manectric nodded, \"that was the deal I was going to propose to you.  Do you accept?  Mightyena will be your partner.\"  Arcanine nodded, with his tongue lolled out the side of his mouth, panting from the short walk that wouldn't have tired him at a run when Manectric had met him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric and Arcanine walked over to where Lycanroc stood and Mightyena lay.  \"Did you propose the deal?\" Lycanroc asked Manectric.  \"Yes,\" Arcanine butted in, \"And I accept.\"  \"Good,\" panted Mightyena, struggling to his feet, \"because I did too.\"  When Mightyena had gotten to his feet, the two teams separated and Lycanroc called out, \"we're giving you two a couple of minutes to prepare a battle strategy and tactics.  Use them well.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Arcanine and Mightyena nodded.  \"So what do you want to do?\" Manectric quietly asked Lycanroc, \"Mightyena and Arcanine have some powerful moves between them, and I have no doubt that the two will team up on me.\"  Lycanroc nodded, \"No, I expect so.  I'll deal with Arcanine, and could you deal with Mightyena?\"  When Manectric nodded, Lycanroc continued, \"Great, thanks.  Remeber, tire them, make them run at us.  Use moves like Thunderbolt that have great range and accuracy.  Stay to the side of Mightyena.  The stadium is big enough to allow for that.  Run as fast as you can, and hope he doesn't hit you.  Then just launch attacks.  But try staying out of range at first and see how that works out.  I'll use Dig and get behind Arcanine.  Let's see how that works.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Manectric and Lycanroc looked up, they saw the other two Pokemon staring impatiently.  \"What's taken you so long?\" called Mightyena.  \"I assume you two are ready then?\" rejoined Manectric.  \"Ok,\" called Lycanroc, \"is everyone ready?  3\u20262\u20261\u2026Begin!\"  And with that, Lycanroc dove into the ground.  Mightyena and Arcanine looked at each other and smiled.  Arcanine launched a Flamethrower and Mightyena a Shadow Ball.  The Flamethrower was pathetically short, and the Shadow Ball was easily dodgeable.  Manectric then countered with a Shock Wave that hit Mightyena dead on.  Mightyena howled in pain and got up to move closer; and Arcanine, frustrated at the pathetic range of his attack, also forced himself to his feet to moobe closer.  Manectric released another Shock Wave, again aimed at Mightyena, who this time shot a Dark Pulse and countered effectively, knocking Mightyena flat on his back.  Arcanine then used the Extremespeed attack to get close to Manectric to launch a Flamethrower when Lycanroc jumped up and delivered a Rock Slide, too late to save Manectric but soon enough to bury Arcanine.  Both Arcanine and Manectric limped off the battlefield, no longer able to continue the battle.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good battle,\" chuckled Arcanine, \"but I'm sure Mightyena can win.\"  Manectric laughed, \"Look at him, you doofus, he's exhausted from my attack and from walking across the stadium and launching a few attacks.\"  Arcanine swatted at Manectric playfully, \"Maybe, but Mightyena knows far more powerful attack against an evenly matched opponent than Lycanroc.\"  \"Lycanroc knows Earthquake and Rock Slide.  Don't lecture me on powerful moves,\" Manectric countered jovially, happy to have his friend back.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't lecture me on exhaustion.  Look, Lycanroc's out of breath from one attack,\" Arcanine sniffed.  \"Look, Arcanine,\" Manectric argued, realizing the gravity to which the conversation was turning, \"Lycanroc and I need to go on a diet too, and we all agreed to lose weight to get to a more proper weight, but we thought that we should all diet together.\"  \"But us especially,\" Arcanine supplied for Manectric.  \"No,\" Manectric countered, \"I mean, we would all hold each other to account, yes, but it's not just you and Mightyena.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric turned in time to see Lycanroc get slammed with a Dark Pulse.  But Manectric could see one of Mightyena's hind legs wobbling spastically.  Manectric was just thinking about how funny the leg's collapse would be when the leg buckled and folded, collapsing Mightyena in a heap, seeming to knock the breath out of Mightyena.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing this weakness, Lycanroc ran to Mightyena rear and used Earthquake, knocking Mightyena out.</span></div></div>",

So, no, just no.\"  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But, Lycanroc,\" Mightyena complained.  \"Shut up, you stupid tub-of-lard.  There will not be another battle today between us.  Do you understand?\"  Mightyena's face contorted and triaged among sadness, anger, and hurt.  Lycanroc paused and tried to calm himself before he managed to fight back another outburst, \"I'm sorry, Mightyena; I shouldn't have said that.  You aren't stupid--fat, tremendously fat, and obstinate--but not stupid.  Listen, I don't want to seriously hurt you; and you know that if you continue, you will get hurt, right?\"  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mightyena shook his head, \"So you say.  Look, you won't get me to agree to the terms of your agreement if you won't fight me again.  Arcanine, are you with me?\"  Arcanine flinched, hating to decide between his friends whom he would support, \"Look, I think that both of your plans have good cases and merits.  You two are too emotionally charged right now to see it though.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric barked a demeaning round of laughter and scoffed at Arcanine's blatant refusal to take sides, \"Arcanine doesn't have values; does he?\"  Arcanine whirled around, \"Damn you, Manectric.  I don't need hectoring.  I'm confused, ok?  You're right, I don't have a value judgment on this issue.  I don't know whom to side with.  But you mock me and laugh at my confusion.  Explain, damn it; don't mock me!  You know what?  No, I won't take part in your little diet because you have attacked me.\"  Mightyena smiled with relief, apparently pleased with the result of Arcanine's decision.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn it,\" Lycanroc seethed at Manectric.  \"You had to speak.  You had to get your damned two cents in, didn't you?  Now you've probably damaged our friendship irreparably.  Way to go, you blundering dunce.\"  \"Lycanroc, I know that saying sorry won't get me very far,\" Manectric started.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do better then,\" Lycanroc snapped in retort.  \"But,\" Manectric continued, \"I think that I can smooth our relationship over with the other two.  We just need to lose weight ourselves and show how competent we are in battle.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lycanroc shook his head, \"Manectric, you really are a great obtuse dunce sometimes and so intelligent at others.  You really don't understand that no evidence will convince the other two, do you?\"  Manectric shook his head, \"I'm not talking about against them, I'm talking about at the upcoming party that Master Gregory is having in a couple of weeks.  If we show far better resutls there than the other two, maybe they'll come around to our side.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Again Lycanroc shook his head, \"Again, you're being na\u00efve.  Those two won't accept any evidence that contradicts their position.\"  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" countered Manectric, \"it's worth a shot for us.\"  Lycanroc agreed enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The exercising part of the weight-loss regimen was the easy part, but not one that contributed to substantially fewer calories on a day-to-day basis.  The diet, which was the substantially more important part of reducing their caloric intake, proved the far more difficult part.  Manectric would occasionally catch Lycanroc snacking, Lycanroc would have to remind Manectric not to take leftovers from Gus, the chef.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lycanroc shed his excess weight easily, having been merely a few pounds over his ideal weight limit, according to himself; but Manectric found the weight loss more challenging.  Manectric was about ten or fifteen pounds over his ideal limit, Lycanroc, who had been  a mere five pounds overweight, estimated.  But Manectric could feel a couple of pounds melting off himself in the couple of weeks he had been at the diet.  He was now somewhere between five and ten pounds overweight, according to his partner's estimates and losing weight quickly.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric felt a pang of regret when he noticed Mightyena walk into the room.  Lycanroc had been right; the two's relationship had cooled considerably.  Mightyena, who had once spoken in warm, bubbly tones to Manectric and Lycanroc noe spoke in more subdued and terse ways.  Replies were shorter, more curt than they had once been.  Arcanine had done much the same thing to the two on a diet.  Mightyena and Arcanine had never been unfriendly, Manectric had commented to Lycanroc.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right,\" retorted Lycanroc quietly, \"but they were never this subdued toward us before.\"  Manectric sighed; he knew Lycanroc was right--he seldom wasn't--but the realism was nevertheless discouraging. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Good morning, bubblebutt,\" Manectric greeted playfully.  \"Good morning, Manectric,\" Mightyena replied tartly, as if he were lost in a train of thought, before he plodded slowly, not cautiously or deliberately, but slowly, as if hampered by some sort of baggage over to his food bowl where he flopped noisily and began eating.  \"Look, Mightyena,\" who pretended not to notice.  \"Mightyena,\" Manectric hissed.  Mightyena turned, stared angrily for a moment before he went back to stuffing his face with the food in front of himself.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look, Mightyena, we need to practice tag team battlling.  I overheard Master Gregory say that out tournament is going to be double-battles at the next tournament.\"  Mightyena turned balefully before he sighed, \"Look, we'll be fine.  You're panicking too much.  We don't really need to do much.  Can I at least eat in peace?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manectric looked down at the Pokemon lying spread eagle on the floor with an abdomen that looked like a pear and that was slowly heaving itself up now.  \"Ok, that's fine, it was just a suggestion.\"</span></div></div>",

Of course they don't wait by the paved road for someone to come, but anyone who went off the main path, deciding to take the scenic route, would be welcomed by the local Pokemon. However, this only applies to the west side of Pinwheel Forest; due to how much darker the east side of Pinwheel Forest is, introverted Pokemon are the ones who make it their home, such as Maria the Snivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was not fond of socializing; she enjoys nothing more than the quiet that comes with being alone. Although she does have friends, it is because they have a mutual liking for tranquility, so they mostly spend their time together sharing blissful silence. But Maria doesn't tell her friends about the best places she found to get some peace. Whenever no one is watching, Maria sneaks off to somewhere deep in the forest where she can relax by herself. If other Pokemon knew, there would be more of a risk that someone would spot them going there, find it, and promptly blab about it to everyone, ruining it for Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough one day, when Maria was searching for a place to unwind like she usually does, she came across a waterhole. Maria was surprised she hadn't discovered it sooner; Maria thought she had already seen everything in the forest by that point. Curious, she dipped her foot into the water. For some reason, the water felt like an otherworldly type of amazing on her skin. She soon began submerging her entire body in the water, except for her head. Since Maria is the only one who knows about the waterhole, she is able rest in silence. Unbeknownst to Maria though, her body was slowly growing thicker while in the water, but she was too busy enjoying the peace and quiet to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the sun began to set, so Maria was best off going home; you never know what kinds of Pokemon might be lurking around during the night. Maria attempted to get up, but found it oddly difficult. At first she thought that she just underestimated how much the water clinging to her body weighed, but she glanced her eyes downwards at the water and saw in the reflection that her own face had somehow plumped up significantly. Maria sat there in shock, soon realizing the reason behind her difficulty moving. She tried desperately to lift her now much heavier body out of the water, wanting to see if the rest of her body had actually gotten fatter as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finally managed to get out of the water, Maria looked over her now large body. Snivys are typically 18 lbs., but Maria had to have been at least 50 lbs. now. Her originally slender body was now covered in rolls of fat, her belly now sticking out several inches in front her. Her limbs were practically flat like real leaves before, but now, they were like lumpy tubes. This would certainly surprise anyone who knew Maria, but she didn't care about that since she was alone most of the time. All she cared about is if she herself was fine with being fat. Maria continued to examine her now flabby body, trying to determine how she felt about her new, rounder shape.</span></div></div>",

She certainly was bigger than before, and the jiggling feeling of rolls of flab on her body was a strange and new sensation for the once-little Snivy.  Strangely enough, Maria was starting to like the idea of being fat.  Even though her larger size would make it harder for her to sneak around Pinwheel Forest, being bigger would give the impression that Maria is stronger and would make other Pokemon think twice before trying to mess with her.  The extra weigh would make it more difficult for Maria to move around, but her leafy limbs were vestigial anyways and would become useless once she evolves and becomes more snake-like later in life.  Also, the sensation of having her flabby body jiggle and wobble felt nice to Maria, and she wouldn't mind gaining more weight just to feel more that sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is settled; Maria decided to be big and fat, and she would have to keep the special waterhole a secret.  Maria looked at the waterhole and wondered about the effects of the water.  If bathing in the water made her this fat, then what would happen if she <i>drank</i> the water?  Would drinking the water make her even fatter than letting it absorb through her skin?  Maria wanted to test out this theory out right now, and she was currently thirsty for a drink, so that would kill two birds with one stone.  The fat Snivy kneeled down close to the the waterhole, her mouth close to the surface of the water, and she began to drink up the water.  Maria took more gulps of the special water until she felt full, and she stood back up, waiting for the water to affect her.  Suddenly, Maria felt her body begin to gain weight, and the rate of the weight gain was:</span></div></div>",

YES now drink it! Maria replies. Zorua downs a glass of it and she lets out a moan of pleasure as a warm sensation fills her body. Maria watches as the pounds pile on, her stomach starts drooping toward the ground as it grows larger and bigger, her legs and thighs start to grow as well forming a thin layer of pudge with a bigger butt to accompany it. <br>\r\nThe growing stops as she starts to ponder if the water could do this alone what could it do with other stuff?

I think I should try out my new auto cleaner. it says to just \"line up the area you want to be cleaned and watch the magic happen\". after setting it up it activates a giant bubble covers the kitchen and perfectly cleans everything in a few minutes. <br>\r\nWow, this really works. says Zorua. all of the sudden Ding! The first batch of brownies was finished Maria takes them out carefully and they cool.<br>\r\nLet's see how they taste, and if they have any \"other\" effects. they both take a bite of the brownie with a flurry of flavor in their mouths thick, rich, chocolate and sweet, creamy, caramel on top a perfect blend. They stand for a couple minutes and savor the flavor in their mouths as they finish the brownies.Mmmm, I couldn't make anything this good even if I took a year to perfect this recipe. Said Zorua. So did we gain any weight? they explore themselves for a few moments and find that a bit of extra pudge has formed on themselves. So you want to have some more. said Maria. Yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent more time eating brownies and each time something new had come out it was gone momentarily afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBURP* oh excuse me, man I am stuffed I haven't eaten like this in well, ever.said Zorua.  Yeah, I agree this was great food maybe we could sell it. but we would have to find a way to take out the \"side effects\" for the people who wouldn't like it. maybe Chikorita could find a way. Probably but first let's see how much the \"side effects\" affected us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both weighed themselves at the scale Maria 427lbs Zorua 469lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I weigh more than you now huh.said Zorua.  I guess so, however, don't expect me to give up so easily. Oh, I won't but lets sleep off this food maybe in the morning we could find out something new about this magic water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Author speaking what do you think Do they gain more while they sleep or not?

You're ON! <br>\r\nThey rushed down as fast as they could, opened up the food storage and got out a Boatload of food and set it out.

It had been largely unsuccessful until Meloetta's 1,118th birthday, when something in her biology seemed to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta suddenly began gaining weight, and fast. In two weeks, she had put on 20 pounds, gone up two cup sizes, and added a couple of inches to her hips and bum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother two weeks, a cup size, and 20 pounds later, Victini broke up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirizion, Meloetta's had been a bit concerned about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been in a slump for a few days after the breakup, which she had spent frequently at Virizion's place, stuffing her face and putting on even more weight. It didn't make much sense to Viri, to be honest: Meloetta was pouting about her weight, fretting over her tightening clothes, yet she continued to eat like a starved Snorlax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust've been the hormones, thought Viri, who remembered her own hormonal fluxes back then. Of course, as a 200 pound Virizion she wasn't one to judge her friend's eating habits. But she had never seen someone grow as fast as Meloetta was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it didn't help that she had found a new boy: an overly-generous legendary musketeer named Keldeo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well someone's in a good mood\" grinned Viri, as Meloetta walked into the kitchen with a spring in her step. Or rather, a bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViri had to admit, the weight Meloetta had put on over the past few weeks since her birthday settled in all the right places. Though definitely a lot thicker looking than Viri was used to seeing Meloetta, the 1,118-year-old legendary was looking downright voluptuous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, he's the sweetest\" smiled the now 170 pound Meloetta, whose massive G-cup breasts wobbled in her low-cut top as she set down a box of pastries she presumably had taken home from her date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViri's eyes gravitated to her friend's cleavage, which was bulging out of her top's neckline. They were even bigger than Viri's at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised he can look anywhere but there. Did you really have to wear your tightest possible top, Boobzilla?\" chuckled the chubbier legendary, as Meloetta bit into one of the pastries, her arm unavoidably pressing against the side of her bosom and pushing her cleavage out even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a break, they're not THAT big\" grinned Meloetta with a roll of her eyes, though she tugged at the cups which were clearly too small to contain her huge breasts. \"Thanks for lending me your bra by the way...my D-cups just wouldn't cut it anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and neither can my DD's, girl. Those things are out of control. You're like, 2 cup sizes bigger than me and still 30 pounds lighter! How is that fair?!\" gawked the Virizion at her friends wobbling melons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got the bouncing booty though\" said Meloetta, still eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What do you call all this then?\" said Viri, slapping her friend's equally large (if not a bit larger, damn it!) ass, which filled out her dress to the brim as it stuck out proudly behind her. \"I'm surprised he isn't sporting a permanent boner when your around, with you bouncing your assets all over the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keldeo is a proper gentleman, FYI. And so generous with the food too...*URPP*, excuse me!\" blushed Meloetta, parting her dress to release her properly stuffed gut, which Viri had only just noticed. Meloetta's tits and ass tended to grab most of the attention, being the largest parts of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart boy. Probably knows where most of those calories end up\" joked Viri, blatantly squeezing Meloetta's giant breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\" laughed Meloetta.</span></div></div>",

Other than that enjoy the crazy scale of the story. Thanks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome guidelines down here:<br>\r\n- Pokemon from all regions, types and sizes may be involved in this story, at the writer's leisure!<br>\r\n- This is a Pokemon-based story, so while human beings are allowed, try to keep expansion of them to a bare minimum.<br>\r\n- Try to keep chapters and plot development PG-rated.<br>\r\n- That means no explicit things like sex, violent/gory descriptions etc. If they are implied however, that's fine.<br>\r\n- Keep within the themes of Weight Gain and Inflation. (No pregnancy allowed, please.) You may mix them up as you wish.<br>\r\n- It does not matter how fast or how the Pokemon expand, as long as it is described and justified.<br>\r\n- Vore is acceptable, as well as digestion, but don't be too graphic about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, enjoy your stay!</td>",
