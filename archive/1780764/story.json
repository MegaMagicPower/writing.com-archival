And as one of the side effects of boredom: Nick started to get hungry. So he went downstairs into his kitchen and made himself a sandwich. It was a very light meal consisting only of bread, mayonnaise, and a single slice of Bologna. He took it back up to his, room sat down on the edge of his bed, and turned on his TV that his parents let him keep. Nick slowly  eat the sandwich bite by bite until it was all gone. His hunger was satisfied for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until another hour passed and Nick got hungry again. So he went downstairs and repeated his food order, went back upstairs and ate while watching TV. The soon after the third time he got hungry, he thought he would instead make two sandwiches this time. Maybe that will finally make him full and stop being hungry for the rest of the night. So he made his two sandwiches, sat down on his bed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for the third time that night, he ate. And this finally made him full. He soon realized that in order to not feel hungry all the time, he would just need to eat a little more than he usually does. But as we all know, a little soon turns into a lot.</span></div></div>",

He felt his stomach growl with hunger. He ran down to the kitchen to grab a bite to eat. He looked in the pantry and grabbed a poptart. He quickly gobbled down the poptart and washed it down with milk. That was not quite enough to fill his stomach. Nick figured that if he was allowed out of his room to eat, he could spend some time there cooking and preparing a meal. He fill a bowl of cereal, scrambled some eggs, fried some bacon,and had some toast and butter. His older brother came into the kitchen as Nick was eating on the kitchen island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little bro, shouldn't you be in your room? Aren't you grounded?\" his brother, Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm allowed to eat, Mike,\" Nick replied, \"Mom and dad aren't going to starve me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you certainly don't look like you're starving,\" Mike commented and went to open the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just so bored,\" Nick replied, \"Videogames, TV, and food are all I have, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, dude. Don't turn into a fatass,\" Mike said poking Nick's slim stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick shrugged it off and took the rest of his food and a bag of potato chips to his room. Nick sat in his room watching TV and finished off his breakfast. A half hour passed and he realized that he mindlessly consumed the entire bag of chips as well as several sodas. He rubbed his swollen stomach and wiped off the crumbs that covered his shirt. He finally felt like he was full for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his stomach growled again. He couldn't believe it. Something about his boring, sedative day while grounded just made him ravenously hungry. Nick decides to...</span></div></div>",

Spoon by spoon he ate all of it while he was playing Xbox. He suddenly felt tired from all the playing and eating, so he decided to take a nap. He was woken up by his growling belly. He was quite amazed how much he could ate lately. He went to the kitchen to make some burgers. He made four of them to make sure he wont be hungry again. he ate them as he was watching TV. It was already late when he finished the eating, so he decided to go to the bed.</span></div></div>",

He tried to get into his tight jeans, but he couldn't get them over his butt. \"What the hell is wrong with them?\" he asked himself. He gave up on them and went to the bathroom to take a shower. When he saw himself in the mirror he was surprised. He must had gained about 15 pounds from all the eating he was doing lately. His midsection bigger, with little moobs forming on the top. His cheeks were fuller, and his butt was softer. No wonder he couldn't squeeze himself into his tight jeans. After he took the shower, he put on a light grey sweatpants which fit him fine and went to the kitchem to make a breakfast for himself. He decided to eat..</span></div></div>",
