The Team was shocked to find that instead of a crater there was a massive structure that looked like a massive wasp nest, it was dotted with numerous holes all around it. The structure also seemed to be partially made out of advanced machinery. What surprised Team Seven the most though was the different creatures that were emerging from the structure. All of the creatures seemed to be insectoid in makeup but their body structures greatly differed. The first creatures were like wasps but were about the size of a horse. The Wasps seemed to be flying patrols around the nest. The next group were humanoid wasps who walked upright. They seemed to be the ones who were giving commands. The final group was the strangest and most shocking to Team Seven. These creatures seemed to be the different then the Wasps and the Masters. While they had the same chitonous skin and arthropod eyes they came in all different shapes and sizes. Some of them even looked human like. All of them were naked, but their sex organs were hidden behind the chiton. These creatures were working and being commanded by the Masters in a Slave-like manner. Many of the Slave creatures also had bulging stomachs. Just then one of the human-like Slave creatures with the largest bulge stopped working and bent squatted over a patch of grass. The Team was horrified to see the chiton over its groin open revealing an insect-like penis and vagina. They were even more horrified when the Slave began to squirt out an organic substance that looked like the organic part of the hive all over the ground using it's cock and pussy. After covering several yards with the organic material it then began to lay a dozen baseball sized grey eggs. After the process was done one of the Wasps flew down, picked up the Slave, and carried them back into the Hive. The Team noticed that this process was being repeated all over the clearing until much of the area was covered in the same material that made up the Hive. The Team was so engrossed in what they were seeing they didn't noticed something creeping up behind them. </span></div></div>",

After Sasuke told Naruto this they used the teleportation jutsu to bypass the Wasp sentries and enter the Hive. Inside the Hive was a maze of tunnels full of Slaves, Wasps, and some Masters. The duo had to use all their skill in stealth to ensure they were not detected. After several minutes of walking in circles they came upon a massive chamber filled with green tinted pods. Naruto then spied Sakura unconscious inside one of the pods.<br>\r\n   \"Sakura!!\" Naruto screamed in both relief and worry as he ran towards her.<br>\r\n   \"Shut up Dobe.\" Scolded Sasuke.<br>\r\n   \"Come on Sasuke we have to get this thing open.\" Naruto said frantically<br>\r\nJust then Sakura's pod began to fill with a dark green liquid that in a few seconds completely submerged Sakura. Naruto and Sasuke frantically tried to pry the pod open but it would not budge. All of a sudden they heard a large mass enter the chamber behind them they turned around in shock to find a massive Wasp-like creature, most likely the Queen of the Hive. Naruto and Sasuke prepared to fight, but the Queen did not move towards them.

The first thing that they noticed was that she was naked her cloths having dissolved in the pod. They quickly forgot about that when they noticed that much of Sakura's skin had been replaced with chiton. The chiton was concentrated around her back, groin, shoulders, hips, breasts, stomach, and neck. The skin that had not turned into chiton had become a dull green. Sakura's hair had remained pink, but her face had become a dull green, she had two antenna poking out from her forehead her eyes had become arthropods like insects. Sakura had gained small mandibles on the sides of her mouth and her teeth had sharpened. The most disturbing thing was what happened to her arms and legs. They had become segmented like an insect and were covered in green chiton. Each arm had two fingers and one thumb while the legs each had two toes in the front and one in the back. The duo was horrified of what happened to their friend. \" Sakura\" Naruto said nervously looking around as more creatures gathered. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The creature that had become Sakura stood there. First looking at the pair, then towards the Queen, then back towards Naruto and Sasuke. \"<span class=\"clgreen\"><i>I'm Fine Naruto, better then fine now that I've been Converted</i></span>.\" Chittered Sakura in an unnatural voice that sounded like a combination of a human and an insect. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"What happened to you Sakura! What did they do to you!

Next came the dreams, happy dreams where his belly was filled with the beautiful babies of the hive. As a breeder he had nothing to do but lay in sweet honey and let his belly grow and grow, until, well, it hurt a little as the he pushed the eggs out of him, but it didn't matter, because soon those eggs would hatch, and his babies would become workers for their hive. Maybe they would be strong workers? Dedicated warriors? Happy breeders like him? And he would be bred again, his belly would grow, and he would lay happily in the sweet honey...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquid of the pod was drained away, and Naruto awoke from the deep slumber, but the warmth and happiness remained. He felt a little dizzy and unsure in his new form, but even that was secondary to the bliss and happiness of being a breeder for his hive. He needed a cock in him, he needed his belly to grow with the hive's young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Sasuke didn't notice him; they were too busy fucking and rolling around on the sticky, honey covered ground. Naruto once thought it was mucus, but now he knew that it was honey made by the workers. It was sweet and made your skin tingle.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto awoke to the sounds of clicking and muttering. Tiredly, he tried to open his eyes, but only darkness greeted him on that front. A machine started beeping faster, parallel to what he felt in his heartbeat, and the lights suddenly turned on. Whatever it was that had captured him - they knew he was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't focus his vision - despite the light his eyesight swam and convulsed about him. He had no idea if there were people in the room, but right now, he was hopped up on something serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human.\" He heard - a deep, guttural, almost metallic voice hailed him. \"Welcome to our humble abode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the words to come out rather easily, he spoke back. \"Whatever your humble abode is, I can't see anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other person seemed to agree. \"We had it that way, while your body adapted to the changes we made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to sit bolt upright, but found himself restrained. \"What changes?!\" Now that his adrenaline was pumping, Naruto found his vision was coming back to him. He could make out his captor, and a he was surprised, shocked, and scared, for it was nothing he had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creepy monster before him - one that he found strangely attractive, was somewhat humanoid in stature. Its skin was silver, like its surroundings, and it stood at over seven feet in height. It was definitely feminine in shape. Naruto tried to avert his gaze from the eight massive breasts on its - no, her - chest, each of which put even Tsunade's bust to shame. The alien laughed, a strange yet somewhat pleasing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly human, we have no need for your kind's petty customs here. Among my species, our sexuality is embraced, not hidden away. Indeed, look at yourself, you are not clothed either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down at his body, and indeed, he was naked as the day he was born, but there was something else that bothered him. \"Augh! I'm different!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I mentioned that before.\" The alien commented. \"You have been engineered to be the progenitor of the new Kalapos race.\" The bonds on him came undone, and she directed Naruto to a mirror in another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at himself - he had been fused, in a way, with the alien species that he was talking to - only he was still distinctively male. His skin tone had changed slightly, becoming a bit grayer, but the skin itself was much thicker and armor-like, despite being as elastic as human skin. His muscles had all expanded to the point where there was toned and corded muscle everywhere, from the twelve-pack abdominals on his belly to his rather large biceps, he could see every detail on pretty much every muscle in his body. It wasn't a terrible look, if he did say so himself. Looking down further, he noticed something very different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have four cocks?!\" From his hips hung four massive, veined manhoods, each one hung over his huge balls and straight down past his knees. Speaking of which, he now seemed to have eight balls as well, each of them just over the size of a basketball, and all of them hanging perfectly in one sack. How did he not notice all of this weight he was carrying over here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the progenitor - it is only right to have you be as efficient as possible in sexual matters. That is why we picked you, of course. Out of all of the humans, you were the most endowed, despite your age, which is an interesting matter in itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is most likely due to that foreign energy we read in his body.\" Another voice arrived, and Naruto turned to see another alien enter. She was similar in height to the first, but she only had four breasts instead of her partner's eight. Also, looking down, Naruto noticed that she had two cocks as well, though they were not as big as any of his cocks, and below that cock was a vagina, indicating her gender. \"I am Lana, by the way.\" She said. Naruto looked to the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am Ana - I apologize for not introducing myself earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine.\" Naruto said. Now that he thought about it, his voice seemed incredibly deep and guttural as well, yet it still retained its human smoothness. \"Well, what are you going to do with me now that I'm here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two alien girls looked at each other - he was cutting to the chase now. \"Our race, the Kalapos, perished two millennia ago. We are the only survivors. As two females of the Kalapos race cannot reproduce - yes, even a hermaphrodite like me cannot reproduce with a female - our only choice was to create a new male. Since there were no more males left, we would have to create a new race based on a fusion of the male gender of one race and our DNA. After much deliberating, we chose your humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning that every woman I have children with - they'll come out like me?\" Naruto asked, looking at his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the plan.\" Ana said. \"In fact, you humans have some perks of your own, such as your inherent energy inside of you.\" Naruto assumed she was talking about chakra. \"That will remain unchanged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interestingly, you are the second four-set Kalapos to occur in over ten millennia. The first is standing right next to me.\" Lana spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna waved. \"A four-set Kalapos has four sets of their sexual organs. It's very rare, and it was an accident in you. A two-set, like Lana, is much more common.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto only nodded. \"Are you sure this isn't a dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls laughed. \"Yes, we're sure.\" Ana reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we test him now?\" Lana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Ana answered. \"That would be ideal. But how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana said...</span></div></div>",

He could feel the little bump just beginning to rise on his lower belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Master began to draw his tendril away from the woman. Her breathing quickened, and her legs trembled. In his hazed mind, it seemed to Naruto that it took forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long...Master is so long,\" Naruto giggled. Sasuke giggled, along with him.Master was long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Master pulled out completely. Wrapped in his grasp was a wiggling little thing. It looked like a starfish, but it was a dark green, and had far many legs. In his hazed mind, Naruto couldn't count how many legs it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's her baby,\" Sasuke said. \"It's so cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video cut to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke, is that what our babies look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. We're gonna get so big,\" he giggled. The he yawned, and snuggled deeper into the couch. Naruto yawned as well, and soon he too was fast asleep. </span></div></div>",

His hair had turned purple-black and his eyes now had purple irises that glowed a faint blue against red sclera. At least that's what she had seen when they had brought him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he wore something that had formed over his skin less than an hour ago: a skintight full-body jumpsuit that was primarily black and dark blue in color with skeletal features, along with dark orange Phazon energy markings, suggesting his suit had more organic components than hers. This all made him look quite menacing. Yet it also had clawed fingers and small hooks or claws on the forearms, curved scallop blades reminiscent of Metroid 'teeth' or the hooks on the arms of the Chozo; it also had three small purple spheres on the middle of the upper back where his shoulder were that were similar to a Metroid's internal nuclei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Samus found it looked like a cross between her Zero Suit, Fusion Suit, and that Phazon-generated clone of her's, Dark Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, the boy seemed to study her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a fair-skinned woman had blond hair that was up in a short ponytail, with two front bangs reaching her shoulders and fraiming her face. Her eyes were blue-green and she wore a skintight full-body jumpsuit made out of material that looked to be some sort of firm polymer, or latex, something that allowed her to stretch in different positions, but still hold together. Her outfit didn't have any zippers or belts on it, making how she got into and out of it a mystery, it had a few symbols on it that were all light pink outlined with darker pink that was almost red. Four rectangular lights exist on the back, surrounding a middle circular one. Next, a symbol was on the back of her left hand, and a symbol on her left breast. The one on her hand resembled a circle with two points protruding from the top and bottom, four rectangular lines circling it, and a zig-zag pattern on the circle. The breast sigil featureed a triangle pointing diagonally right down, with lines running be<br>\r\nlow it, and another triangle pointing to the left. She had an empty holster on her thigh, clearly her weapon, if she'd had one, had been taken from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aliens seemed to notice the two were awake and began jabbering in their native language. They sounded excited from the way they were yammering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to sit upright, but was forced back down by one of the aliens. He could make out his captor, and he was surprised, shocked, and scared, for it was nothing he had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creepy monster before him - one that he found strangely attractive, was somewhat humanoid in stature. It's skin was silver, like its surroundings, and it stood at over seven feet in height. It was definitely feminine in shape. Naruto tried to avert his gaze from the eight massive breasts on it's - no, her - chest, each of which put even Tsunade's bust to shame. The alien seemingly laughed, a strange yet somewhat pleasing sound. Looking at the rest of the extraterrestrials, Naruto noted they were ALL female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one holding him down then grabbed him and brought him over to the woman and slammed him onto the bed next to her, grabbing his face and turning it to look at her, before resuming speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to froce the alien off of him, but needless to say, it was at least a hundred times stronger than Tsunade was. \"I can't understand what you're saying!\" he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus narrowed her eyes, while she was likewise unable to understand the aliens that had abducted her and the young man, apparently, the survey team had recorded the native language - or languages - of the male's homeworld, because her translator implant allowed her to understand him. That was something, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien woman seemed to stop at his words, if she didn't understand them, then she understood the meaning. Letting him go, the aliens left through a door they hadn't noticed before and it slammed shut after the female aliens left. Trapping the two in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus looked around, No windows, and the door control was most likely on the other side of it, or the technology responded to mental commands from the native race. She turned to her cellmate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus Aran.\" she said, then resumed looking around for a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was confused for a second and he then realized that what she said was actually her name<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Naruto Uzumaki\" he answered her introduction in kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus' musings were interrupted, as Naruto tapped her shoulder. \"Hey, are you a ninja?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus raised an eyebrow. \"A what? I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned. \"Lady, you been living under a rock or something? Everyone knows about ninja...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus shrugged. \"There are no ninja where I come from - There are warriors, certainly, and hunters. I'm a hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow. \"A hunter? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a bounty hunter. People post bounties, usually for criminals, and I find them, for a price. Some hunters will go after anyone if the price is right, but I only track crooks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded. \"So...what do you think these aliens want with us?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus shrugged \"No idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked himself over and was, needless to say, shocked. \"Wha...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hazard a few guesses as to why you're like that, but we need to get out of here first.\" Samus said offhandedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded at that. \"Just so long as there's no probing.\" he muttered. Samus nodded. She had never encountered this race before. So she had no idea what they wanted the two for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded. Then froze. \"Gas!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus froze at that and sure enough, she heard a faint hissing sound and looked up to see what looked like the utters of a cow hanging from the ceilling releasing a steady stream of pink vapor into the room. She couldn't afford to be impressed that this Naruto kid obviously had training to do things like enhance his senses, meaning that whatever he was, a 'ninja' as he called the word, he was soldier. The gas took up too much of her concern for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took a deep breath and held his nose shut before Samus did the same. The room quickly filled up compleatly and the pair's hungs started to hurt. They gasped as they could no longer hold their breath and  instinctively tried to refill their lungs, taking in the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Samus said, blinking in surprise \"It's not toxic?\" If anything, it smelled like thick perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scrunched up his nose \"Dosen't make sense...are we supposed to be labrats or something?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus shrugged and they looked at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT was a mistake because...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Hinata returned to consciousness she immediately knew that something was wrong. Her training took over instinctively as she forced herself to calm her breathing and keep her eyes closed. Despite how groggy and confused she felt, Hinata quickly started assessing her situation. She subtly tried to move her arms and legs so as not to let anyone know that she was waking. She felt a jolt of fear however as she found her limbs where shackled down by metal restraints. Pushing past the fear and the grogginess, Hinata forced her hearing to its max in order to find any indication of where she was. What she heard surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure this is the best option?\" She heard a voice not to far off ask. It was a strange sounding voice. It held a clear tone of femininity to it but, it just sounded... wrong. Whoever was speaking was clearly not use to the language if the odd accent was anything to go by. \"I know that our species is dying but, must we real sink to such lows to insure some form of survival?\" Hinata wondered what this person meant by their species dieing. Last she remembered the human race was doing just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have been over this countless times my friend.\" said another voice that held a slightly different quality to its voice yet, still sounded very much like a female. \"There are no fertile males left of our species and despite our best efforts no child born from a female coupling has lived long enough to reach proper breeding age.\" Though confused Hinata couldn't help but feel rather sad for whoever these people where. For all she knew, this was the last remnant of some old clan that was dying out. That still didn't explain why she was here, or what they planned to do with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that but, why these creatures? Why theses... 'Humans'? I know that they look very similar to use but, we've already tried breeding with them. You saw it yourself that we can not interbreed.\" Now Hinata was very curious. These people spoke like they weren't human. That also made her feel rather scared as well. \"It is true that we can't interbreed naturally but, that isn't because we are compatible. Neither body can support the growth simply due to a lack of proper understanding of the genetic differences. We have seen however that we can merge some of our genes to their bodies, creating an artificial hybrid. This hybrid could then produce children with both us and the humans.\" Hinata was stunned by that. She clearly understood what they wanted with her now. They planned to turn her into some kind of Hybrid without even asking for her consent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why this one? We had plenty of others we could have used. And what about that male we have been observing? The one with the hair of this systems star and eyes like the liquid that covers much of this world. The one from the very place we took this one from. Wouldn't a male hybrid have been better choice? They could have simply impregnated us and been done with it.\" Hinata felt anger and fear blossom in her breasts. She knew of only one boy in Konoha with sun-kissed hair and clear ocean blue eyes. \"We have no fertile males to use as gene donors, so we will need to hope the process for converting a male into a hybrid that we plan to encode into her genes works right. As for why this one, she holds the best chance of accepting our genes successfully... And she appears to hold feelings for the very male you are speaking of.\" The owner of the first voice seemed to consider this before speaking again. \"You plan for her to seek that male out as her other don't you? You plan for her to take him inside herself and change him into the first male hybrid before using him to produce many children.\" The last part wasn't a question but, a statement. And it was one that chilled Hinata to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl will take a long time before she can birth her children but, yes. I fully expect her and the male to become the progenitors of a new race. A race that will have the qualities of both our own and these humans.\" Answered the second voice. \"It's only a shame that we couldn't figure out some way to fix the genistation period. How a creature can carry child for so long is beyond me and these changes will sadly only increase the time till birth comes.\" \"How long?\" Asked the first. \"Normal humans carry for nearly 9 of their 'months?' Anyway, the time will likely increase to anywhere from one of their planets star journeys to up to three of them. The fact that unlike her children, this one will have three birthing caverns; one of which will be occupied for a time as she makes the changes to her chosen mate and that alone could take up to a half of their planets star journey. We can only hope that she will not be miserable while carrying other lives inside her for so long.\" Hinata heard as the sound of the voice grew closer and closer as it spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata tried her hardest to not respond as she felt something brush against her cheek in an almost loving manner. \"These 'Humans' are so odd yet, so beautiful in their own way. And this one is a perfect example of the beauty the female half hold. It is a shame that we can't properly breed naturally for I would have gladly taken this one as my bond mate if we could. And if she had brought the male one back with her it would have given a chance for a big family to form.\" Hinata heard the longing and sadness in the odd voice but, made sure to not response despite the gentle touches that stroked her skin in such a loving and fond manner. \"How you could have fallen for being not even of your species is beyond me. I admit that this one is pleasant on the eyes, even if she is rather small by our standards in the feeding glands. However the curves are more pronounced and would bet that they offer as good handles during intercourse and wouldn't have been against having some fun with her.\" Hinata felt slightly sickened by the first voices comment, not to mention annoyed at being told she had small breasts if that is what they meant by feeding glands. She was after all quite a bit larger then even the older girls. She was soon brought out of her thoughts by more of those gentle touches from the second voices owner and tried to keep from shivering at how pleasant the touches were. \"Yes, I can see that. Now please put your pleasure shaft away. We don't need it hitting something it shouldn't.\" Chided the second voice. \"Don't be so uptight. You seriously need a good fuck to relieve yourself and mine is already out and waiting for use.\" Hinata felt more then heard the second move away and could swear she heard a soft 'my quarters later' whispered to the first. Hinata could only think that she needed to get out of here before they changed who she was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata couldn't help but, gasp at seeing such a beautiful creature. From their own remarks they did indeed look strikingly a human. There where however, enough differences for a person to realize that they where anything but. Letting her eyes travel up and down the being before her, she took note of its long and strong legs, which were not overly muscled and held gentle curves to them. The legs lead to a set of amazingly wide hips that looked as though they'd be perfect for bearing offspring. It's waist was thin but, clearly muscled and the chest it had clearly out did her own without looking out of proportion to the rest of its body. Deceptively thin arms lead to hands with amazingly only three fingers. Each finger was larger, then Hinata's own, allowing the creature full use of its hands much like a humans would. On its neck was an intricate yet somehow, simple looking set of tattoos that spread out over its neck in a manner reminiscent to a flower and it's vines. The face however is what really surprised her. All in all, it looked like a normal human face with lightly tanned skin and soft curves of the cheeks, full kissable lips, a small nose and two eyes and a head full of shoulder length black hair that reminded her greatly of her own teachers hairstyle. The pointy ears would where even miss due to Hinata's fascination with its eyes that seemed to glow a memorizing silver. It wore loose cloth and long flowing fabrics that reminded Hinata of the dancing gypsies see had meet once on her way back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello dear. How do you feel?\" It asked in the same voice as the one that had been lovingly creasing her skin earlier. Finally seeing the creature and hearing its voice at the same time caused something to stir inside of her. A desire, or even a need to feel this creatures body against her own and a need for physical pleasure. Hinata if course blushed so much she wouldn't be surprised if her whole body was flushed. She tried to push out the desire she felt and answer but, only succeeded in sputtering stupidly as she continued to practically eye hump this creature. \"Don't worry child. The lust you feel is due to your new hormones balancing out as we finish the last change. Before that though, please take a look at this picture.\" An image suddenly sprang to life in front of her eyes and what it should made her moan in want and lust. An image of her beloved Naruto was before her and she wanted nothing more then to rip off his clothes and ride him till his hips snapped. There was another feeling though. This one confused her to no end. She wanted Naruto inside of her but, not in the sexual way. No, she wanted him completely inside of her body. She could feel her love juices leaking out of her at an amazing rate as she thought on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject is responding positively in all areas! Her body is producing high levels of the human sexual stimulating hormone and the encoding seems to be working fine.\" She heard, snapping Hinata from her thoughts at the sound of that first voice. \"And what of the birthing chambers?\" Asked the creature of beauty standing near her. \"Her primary chamber appears to be producing the enzymes need to create the change in the male once she traps him inside it for a time. Amazingly, the other two seem to be doing the same but, not quite on the same level. She could effectively convert three humans into hybrids allowing a much greater chance of a population boom... Pending she captures and changes another bonded pair that is.\" \"Perfect! This is beyond expectations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful creature, that now thinking on it looked a lot like the elves from the old stories her mother use to read her, turned back to her and started caressing her cheek with its hand. It was so soft and left a wonderful tingling in her body. \"Now child. I know this all very hard to take in but, I need you to listen closely. I'm sure you've notice that your body has undergone some physical changes.\" She accented that statement by fondling one of her newly enlarged and apparently sensitive breasts. \"Not much has change of your outward physical appearance. Only the increase to your feeding glands and the widening of your... 'Hips' I think you call them. This is done so you will have the room needed to bare lots of young and so you can take your chosen mate into yourself so your body can make the necessary changes to him. Such changes will that time of course but, that is to be expected. Your body is much stronger now then ever before and any wounds you take will heal amazingly quickly. Not only that but, your stamina has been greatly increased from the change, though that is for something other then fighting.\" The being paused  for a moment to make sure Hinata was listening. \"Now the first thing I want you to do when you wake back up is to find your chosen and claim him. Then stay safe as you wait for you body to slowly make the changes to him. Next, once he exits you, you are to start producing young as quickly and numerously as possibly with him.\" Hinata suddenly found herself feeling very sleepy. \"Remain safe child. And raise the new species well.\"</span></div></div>",

Fragments of images, feelings, and sensations flit through the murky edges of her mind. Slowly, the kunoichi managed to piece together a portion of what had befallen her to put her in this situation. She remembered being alone in bed late at night. Something had awoken her. She tried to remember what it was, but could only come up with a deep droning noise that she had felt more than heard and a blinding light before her room had vanished around her and everything had gone dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimly, she became aware of a nagging pain in her extremities. Forcing the sensation aside to try and concentrate on the situation proved fruitless. The ache soon spread up her arms and legs and into her torso. Soon enough, the feeling dragged her up into the light and she awoke. The pain was even worse now, a constant torment that made her want to retreat back to unconsciousness to get away from it. But the peace would not come. Steeling herself, she tried to gain some information about what was happening in the hopes of improving the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dim reddish orb floated above her, where she laid prone. Everything beyond the scope of the light spilling from the orb was lost in shadows, but she could tell that there were things hidden in the darkness even if she couldn\u2019t tell what was out there. Fighting against the pain, she tried to rise, but found that she couldn\u2019t. Craning her head, she managed to make out small circular bonds extending out of the table she was apparently lying on. Gritting her teeth, she tried her best to tear through the small amount of crystalline material, but was surprised that even her considerable strength had no effect on what was holding her down. Judging from how she couldn\u2019t move her legs either, she assumed that her ankles were likely similarly held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb above suddenly flared brighter for a moment, and she cried out in pain as a sharp spike of agony drove between her eyes. Then the spike seemed to shatter within her head sending flaming shards into every corner of her mind. The shock almost made her slip back into oblivion, but something fought against it and dragged her back up out of the blissful darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was several moments before Tsunade realized that the pain had stopped, not only the one in her head, but also the one that had filled the rest of her body. Above her, the orb had dimmed again, releasing so little light that she could barely even see her bust as it rose and feel with her breath. She could somewhat make out the sheen of sweat that had broken out there as well as across most of her body as the movement caught what little light there was. She lay there, letting her eyes drift shut and savoring the peace that spread throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChittering noises made her snap her head to the side to try and see where it came from. There, barely visible in the darkness, she could see a shape moving slightly. A vague shape beside it moved then, adding another set of chittering almost as if in conversation. Several more back and forth noises came from the two shapes. One of the shapes then seemed to turn around but she couldn\u2019t be sure. A loud clanking noise above her made her tear her gaze away from what laid beside her to what was moving around above her.</span></div></div>",

Scattered along the length were quite a few half foot long needles. The one right in the center was different though, almost twice as long and looking thicker than the others. Again, the blonde haired kunoichi tried to break free, but it was futile. Another string of chittering come the direction of those two shapes. She didn\u2019t look over though, too intent on the machine hovering above her ominously. Some small part of her mind noted that the arms and needles weren't even connected to each other or the center part. Instead they were all free floating without anything visible between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep thrumming noise similar \u2013 but not quite the same \u2013 to what she remembered from before started up. Along with the noise, so did a pulsing violet glow within the center device. The arms shifted around. She saw with mounting fright that they were aligning the needles with points along her body. As quick as could be, needles started dropping from their positions. As they hit, they pierced her body in many spots. Around each location, a blazing heat started to build within her muscles and bones. It felt like fire was being driven right into her veins, flowing outward from the injection points. It took much of her willpower to resist screaming as the pain streamed through her body. It became too much when the largest needle finally plunged into her, straight into her heart. She started to scream but it cut off. She finally received the release she had been wanting and passed out completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea how much time passed, but when she awoke again, the pain was gone. In its place, she had an unclear sense that her body felt\u2026<i>different</i>. It was the only way she could describe it, she wasn't able to place how though. Her throat felt rough and parched. She found herself coughing for several seconds. When the fit passed, she opened her eyes and took in her surroundings.</span></div></div>",

Glancing around, Tsunade saw numerous other trees looking much the same, as well as other more slender trees. Looking back up at the leaves, she now saw that something wasn\u2019t right here. Purple leaves with black veins waved in the wind, while over there was a tree with blue leaves. The grass beneath and around her was off colored as well. Purples and blues splattered along the length of the waist high blades. Sitting up, she saw that all the plants around her were unlike anything she had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some caution, she rose to her feet, unsure of what had been done to her. She paused when she saw she wasn\u2019t wearing her usual sleeping outfit any longer. In its place was a skintight outfit that ran from her shoulders down to her knees, as well as leaving her forearms exposed. The material was odd as well, nowhere near anything she knew of. She also noted that most of the material was transparent, only a few patches weren\u2019t to preserve a minimum of modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking her exposed limbs, as well as peeling back the outfit, she saw no sign of where the needles had driven into her. Her fair skin was completely unmarked. She was puzzled by this because there was no sign of anything being done to heal the wounds that she should have received. It was just another in a long list of oddities she had encountered since this all started\u2026whenever that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around again, she called out for anyone but received no answer at all. Behind the tree she had been lying beneath, she saw some water. Setting off towards it, she had the sense that she was being watched, but could find no sign of whomever or whatever was observing her. She kept her senses trained in the hopes of spotting an ambush just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odd grasses grew right up to the edge of the water. This almost completely hid the muddy shore that lay beneath. Stepping carefully, she managed to get close enough to get a good view without losing her footing. Nothing seemed off about the water, but considering everything else around her\u2026 She shook her head, despite the risk, she was obviously thirsty and getting dehydrated wouldn\u2019t do her any good. She just hoped that if there was anything wrong with the water that she could counteract it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a tentative sip to test it, she gulped down several handfuls of water before her throat was finally soothed enough. Stepping back from the water, she cast another glance around the strange environment, wondering what she had been brought here for.</span></div></div>",

She knew she would have to get something to eat, but with how odd everything was around her, what were the odds of finding something edible? Eyeing the water behind her, she amended her thoughts that maybe she would be able to find something after all. A sudden whiff of something sweet caught her nose. Realizing that she had no better idea for now, Tsunade set off towards where the delicious smell seemed to have come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, she came to a bush clustered around the base of one of the thinner trees. Peeking out from under the oddly colored leaves were something that somewhat resembled berries. Like almost everything else she had seen though, they weren\u2019t like anything she knew of. In shape, they looked a bit like blueberries, but they were clustered more like a grape. The biggest difference though was that each berry was nearly the size of an apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cautious sniff revealed that the berries were indeed the source of the smell. Despite how appetizing they looked, the blonde hesitated just on how abnormal they looked as well. Grasping one of the berries, she gave it a squeeze. In response, it all but exploded. A wave of even sweeter smelling juice flowed across her hand and dripped to the forest floor. Another even stronger hunger pain dispelled her uncertainty. Before she realized what she was doing, she plucked the cluster off of the bush and bit into one of the berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe juice filled her mouth and washed over her tongue. The flood of juice washed away the last of her willpower. Berry after berry was wolfed down without a thought. A small portion of Tsunade\u2019s mind was concerned over this. The vast majority however was too intent on the wonderful flavor filling the hungry void in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually, she flopped down on the ground and let out a ringing burp. Her mouth and chin were stained with the dark berry juice, as was both of her hands and arms nearly to her elbows. Even the \u201ccloth\u201d covering her torso was wet and sticky from the overflow, outlining her breasts and the slight bulge of her filled stomach beneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was licking her fingers and lips to try to get some more of the taste, she realized that she hadn\u2019t stopped because she was full. She thought she should fell sick from how much she had eaten, but there was merely a satisfied pressure instead. She had actually stopped because she had picked the entire bush clean of the berries. Only a few wrinkled and withered stragglers remained in the dirt surrounding the roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyelids grew heavy as her brown eyes became unfocused. Despite the situation, she felt content for now.</span></div></div>",

The juice staining her was already starting to dry, becoming stickier and even a bit irritating where it soaked her skin. Hopping up from the bush, Tsunade turned around before quick stepping back to the pond. Kneeling down at the edge again, she plunged her hands into the cool water before rubbing her hands over her arms. Scooping up more, she turned her attention to her face and her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ripples in the water faded away, she looked over her reflection. A quick nod followed due to her satisfaction in on cleaning up as best she could. She then started scooping up further handfuls of water and slurped them down one after another. The cool weight flowed down around and through the stomach load of berries, further bloating her stomach with each gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she lay back in the multicolored grass with a satisfied sigh, she let her hands idly rub her rounded belly. Some portion of her mind screamed that she should have been more concerned about this. A far larger part focused instead on the pleasure and relief that flooded her body. Wherever here was, she felt more at peace than she had in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade woke with a jolt. Fear flooded her mind upon seeing the unfamiliar surroundings before it faded away to the background. She still had no idea where she was or what had happened to her, but the peace fogging her mind seemed even stronger than before. She soon came to think that being far away from anything she had ever known was a blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows and putting a slight chill in the air. Sitting up, the blonde yawned and stretched her arms up high. An idle scratch down across her stomach caused a frown to cross Tsunade\u2019s face. Looking down over her bust, her frown deepened as she saw that her belly was no longer bloated. Instead, it looked a bit soft. It felt more than a little soft too. As did her whole body. It was hard for her to say for sure, but even her breasts little a hair bigger as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat small portion of her mind yelled that something was wrong here, but it drowning it out was a larger portion saying that it was fine. The more she thought about it, the more she came to realize that she shouldn\u2019t be worried about it. Why shouldn\u2019t she enjoy herself after everything she had gone through?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight grin on her face, she hopped to her feet. After gulping down several more handfuls of water, she turned back to face the strange trees. Wandering under the strange colored boughs, she soon came across another enticing scent. This one was more savory than the sweetness of the berries. It triggered another hungry grown in her stomach, and she licked her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the scent deeper into the forest, she found a tree that had vines thicker than her forearm covering it. Dotted along the lengths were small violet flowers and seemed to somewhat glow. Far more interesting were the orbs that looked somewhat like melons. Each was larger than her head, and the biggest at the bottom of the vines looked to be twice that. The tough and rough filling skin was striped blue and gold, and as she touched one her nose was overwhelmed with that savory smell. There was a subtle sweetness to it as well, but it was almost hidden by the stronger part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade\u2019s hesitation lasted for only a moment. She grasped one of the higher melons and plucked it from the vine. She licked her lips again before digging her thumbs into the side. Almost immediately, a flood of thick fluid welled up from the opening. Before she realized what she was doing, she tipped the melon up over her face and guzzled down the ooze, finding it to be rather tasty. As the flow slowed to a trickle, she resumed breaking apart the melon. The flesh inside was deep blue and still leaking plenty of the fluid, but not for long as she lapped it up. She then turned her attention to the flesh itself. It was even more savory than the smell had been. It tasted almost like meat but with a definite more fruit-like texture. She had her face buried in a second one when a gasp coming from behind her made her freeze. Turning around, she saw\u2026</span></div></div>",

The youngest of the pair frowned as she looked over the melon. Tsunade then took the lead, jabbing a thumb through the thick skin and letting the ooze well up again. She then upended the melon over Hinata\u2019s mouth and let it dribble down the other\u2019s throat. The effect was immediate. Her pale eyes snapped wide open and she snatched the melon from Tsunade\u2019s grasp before sucking down as much of the goo as she could. She then tore into the melon itself, and started devouring the wet flesh within. Tsunade returned to her own melon and finished it off in no time at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was brushing the horizon when the pair of woman laid back in the strange grass, each of them letting out a satisfied sigh. Hinata\u2019s face crumpled for a moment before she let out a loud burp. She clapped a hand slick with melon goo to her mouth, her cheeks blazing bright red. Tsunade grinned and let out a laugh before an even louder belch burst from her guts. Hinata let her hand loosen a bit and gave a little chuckle as the blush started to recede.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata\u2019s embarrassment returned with a vengeance as her stomach let out a hungry grumble. \u201cH\u2026how\u2026? I shouldn\u2019t be hungry\u2026not after\u2026after all that.\u201d She stared down at the bump of her belly, worry puckering her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, I ate plenty of these berry things earlier. Then I found these things, and we split them, so you being hungry again isn\u2019t that bad,\u201d Tsunade said. She grunted a bit as she got her feet under her and she hoisted her own bulging stomach. Sniffing the air, \u201cOoh, speaking of the berries, I think there must be some around here.\u201d She licked her lips in anticipation as she wondered off, following the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB\u2026bu\u2026but, we ate\u2026\u201d she trailed off as she watched Tsunade continue hunting the berries. A quiver passed down Hinata\u2019s frame before she struggled to her feet and trailed after the older woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir journey took them only a short way further. In an instant, Tsunade plopped down in front of the thick bush around the base of another tree, and started plucking the enormous berries from it. She scarfed down some of them before holding the rest of the bunch out for Hinata. The younger woman took a step backwards, fear again washing over her, making her already pale skin blanch further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade wasn\u2019t having that though. \u201cCome now, Hinata, if you thought those melons were tasty, they\u2019re nothing compared to these. Try one, go on, try it,\u201d starting to add a bit more force to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stepped backwards again, but ran right into another tree. \u201cN-n-no, something is wrong here. We should\u2026I should\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade forced one of the berries into her mouth cutting off the rest of whatever Hinata was trying to say. The juiciness exploded in that instant, drops running down her chin and onto her outfit. Another berry followed the first, as did another, and another. Hinata tried to push Tsunade away, and then tried to get away herself. Tsunade was too strong for Hinata though. Before long Hinata\u2019s mumbled protests and futile struggling became half-hearted, and then stopped completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that bunch was packed away in their stomachs, Tsunade grabbed Hinata\u2019s wrist and led them back to the bush. Their feast resumed, and while Tsunade still ate quite a few of the berries, she let Hinata take the lion\u2019s share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Hinata slumped back from the bush cradling her rock hard gut and panting and gasping for breath. Her tongue darted in and out still, lapping at every gooey remain of the berries and melons that clung around her mouth and to her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade leaned back onto her arms, starring down at Hinata. Strange thoughts started to whirl through her head. She couldn\u2019t stop her eyes from tracing the swell of Hinata\u2019s breasts stretching the shear sections of her body suit. Nor the bulge of her stomach below. One of the few times she could tear her eyes away, she found herself drawn towards those pale orbs. Looking deep in them, Tsunade thought she could see a hint of desire there. <i>No, that\u2019s absurd. There\u2019s no way Hinata thinks of me that way</i> Tsunade chided herself. And yet, trapped together in this strange place, perhaps their relationship could become something more.</span></div></div>",

She knew that lying wasn\u2019t good, she couldn\u2019t lie. Why would she lie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich was your favorite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe berries...I loved the berries. I loved how they felt in my mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, very good, subject one. Let us see, subject two,\u201d he turned to Hinata. Tsunade actually felt a little sad when he took away his hand, \u201cdid you enjoy the fruit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...\u201d Hinata\u2019s eyes were far away and calm, her shoulders limp and she slouched slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you seemed hesitant to eat? Why is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was afraid, I didn\u2019t know what was happening and Tsunade was acting odd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you liked the fruit after you tried it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a good girl you are,\u201d he said as he lifted his hand to pet Hinata the same way he had done with Tsunade. Hinata\u2019s face changed ever so slightly. She seemed happier, a slight smile to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is for subject one,\u201d another said. \u201cDo you notice any changes to your body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy belly feels bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you, subject two?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy belly feels tight.
