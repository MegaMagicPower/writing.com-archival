Good to see you! Can you meet us at the lab where Professor Jameson works? They have some blue kryptonite there and they're curious to find out how it affects you!\" she said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well! I'll fly over there and meet you at the entrance!\" Superman said. Then, the Man of Steel raced down the hall, leaped out the window, and flew to the lab where he waited for Lois to arrive in her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois and Superman then met Isaac jameson, who took them into the room where the blue Kryptonite was stored behind a glass display covered with lead walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel anything?\" Lois asked Superman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really...\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mr. Jameson took his keys and unlocked the display, opening the cover and exposing Superman to the blue rock, which was the size of a human fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock was oval shaped and it had a teal color to it, and the surface was shiny and smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's so pretty!\" Lois said, holding the blue Kryptonite in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Superman! What are you feeling now?\" Dr. Jameson asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Umm... I feel like... I'm getting... bigger and... stronger!\" the Man of Steel replied, as he flexed his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Superman's chest began to push out while his shoulders expanded a bit. His biceps appeared to be inflating as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmmm.... Arrrhhhhh!\" Superman growled softly, while Lois held the blue Kryptonite close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman's calves became harder and thicker while his quads grew wider and deeper. Then his growth spurt stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Superman! You had a growth spurt!\" Lois exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman looked more muscular than ever! he had put on at least thirty pounds of muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remarkable!\" Dr. Jameson said, as he put the stone back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I feel stronger!\" Superman smiled, as he flexed his bigger biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now we know how this affects you! Thanks, Superman!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois and Superman then left, happy to have completed the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Superman wasn't done growing yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He grinned at the thought of having experienced this nice little growth spurt thanks to his brief exposure to blue Kryptonite. Who would have thought that any exposure to this type of rock would have a positive effect on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to put on his bathrobe so he could watch TV in the living room, when he was suddenly overcome by that intense, weird tingling sensation in his muscles. It was the same thing he felt earlier that day, when he was in the lab. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened! Superman had a strong urge to flex his arms all of the sudden as he closed his eyes and tilted his head back, letting out a loud moan. Then, while he was standing in his living room, his pectorals inflated to the size of basketballs; his calves in his legs grew to the size of soccer balls, and his quads became even bigger than sewer pipes! Furthermore, his arms and his quads were now covered with thick, long veins that were as thick as ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Superman had looked like a bodybuilder before, then he began to resemble a muscle freak now. His shoulders grew even wider, with mighty lats and delts growing on them as a huge six pack formed over his abdominal muscles. He actually grew four inches taller, getting close to seven feet tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great sons of Rao!\" He gasped, when he stared at his reflection in the mirror. In fact, he was too big for the mirror! \"This can't be good! I had another growth spurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man of steel loved being big and strong, but what if he kept on getting even bigger than this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get that rock and examine it so I can create an antidote!\" Superman thought out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up his cell phone and started calling Dr. Jameson, only to crush the small device under his great strength! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I'm too strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he tried typing an email on his laptop, only to demolish the laptop keyboard with his super strength and speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm too big and too strong for this! I need to fly to the lab and get the blue Kryptonite! But, what will happen if I get exposed to it again?\" He wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he leaped out the window and soared across the sky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tried to concentrate, but the feeling became stronger until he couldn't hold it any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body started to expand. \"Oh my-\" Clark whispered scared that somebody would hear him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs pushed out of his shirt ripping it and tearing it. His suit pushed almost out of his shirt when it stopped. His biceps gained a few inches and his triceps teared the sleeves revealing a pair of muscled arms in his suit.<br>\r\nHis eight pack slowly turned into a ten pack tightening the suit against his body. His back bursted out of his coat revealing his suit a little. Oh shit, what's happening to me!\" Clark moaned softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I have to get out of here, now!\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, not my-\" he started but his muscles grew too big and ripped his jeans. His quads expanded and his already muscular calves bulged more and all over his body started to pop up some veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no...no!\" he yelled. \"I have to go, bye!\" he said to Lois who just came around the corner. \"Wait I just got-\" Lois started. \"Nevermind.\" she said staring at Clark, suddenly noticing that Clark's back was way more muscular then before and actually Clark's whole body seemed bigger. She knew something wasn't right, but she couldn't put a finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He scanned the lab where he saw Dr. Hamilton and some of his assistants were making notations on their electronic devices after the wave passed through the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly changed into his Superman uniform and quickly flew over to STAR Labs to see if they had discovered anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hamilton looked up from his work and saw the Man of Steel standing there.  \"What a pleasant surprise, Superman.

He may have paused for just a moment outside Lois' office window, but that was pretty typical of Superman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time, Lois looked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark continued his flight into the sky, thinking about the concern on Lois' face as she looked at him through the window of the Daily Planet. As the top reporter on Superman, Clark had seen Lois in scarier situations than this where she had never faltered, so he knew this had to be pretty big if it was shaking her nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached Earth's atmosphere, he used his telescopic vision to hone in on the meteors. They appeared to be some sort of shining green color, shining as if made out of polished emeralds despite their rough, rocky texture. They were fairly sizable, too; the smallest was about the size of a beach ball, give or take, and the largest looked like it was as wide as a football field, easily able to crush multiple buildings in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis really <i>was</i> serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to rush towards the meteors, Clark started to feel a tingle on his skin. As he quickly got closer he felt the sensation go deeper, becoming less like goosebumps and more like a dull ache in his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until he smashed his fist into the first meteor seconds later that it dawned on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kryptonite</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clark blasted through the rock his fist suddenly cramped, a dull throb starting in his hand and slowly creeping up his arm. It quickly spread into his shoulders, from their branching out into his chest, his abs, his legs, his back and his other arm. Even his head wasn't spared the dull throbbing as he could feel the blood pumping in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the painful throbbing changed into a strange sort of soreness, the kind that almost felt good. As if he had been working out and got a good pump. He felt all the muscles in his body tense as he suddenly felt his body expand, going taller by at least four inches. The sensation didn't last long, and the strangely good ache disappeared immediately. His suit, already designed tight, seemed to be doing its best at accommodating his new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily after the experience, Clark looked down at himself in shock. He'd never had <i>that</i> sort of reaction to kryptonite before. This had to be some sort of new, rare type. So far, his body seemed to be exactly the same save for the added height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Clark was so preoccupied with his sudden growth that he didn't notice the larger meteor hurdling toward him until it smashed against his back, immediately cracking and falling away into harmless fragments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Clark recognized the dull throb that immediately spread over his back and shoulder muscles simultaneously. It spread through his body more quickly than before, and his breathing grew quick as that pleasurable ache seeped into his muscles and his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped as this time he felt his back lengthen independently of the rest of him, his lats and chest growing proportionately to the added length. He felt his head follow suit, and suddenly he realized that he wasn't just growing taller but was growing <i>proportionally</i> taller. If this kept up, he'd be a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms quickly lengthened, and Clark watched as his biceps stained the cloth of his suit, stretching it as far as it could go. His legs both lengthened and filled out, and Clark groaned as the front of his suit was suddenly stretched too tight over his groin. It wasn't an entirely unpleasant feeling, Clark couldn't help think, but he knew that the suit wouldn't stand too much more growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother, smaller meteor rushed passed Clark as the growth stopped, and suddenly he realized that in order to save Earth and the areas that would be hit by the meteors he would have to destroy each meteor one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't bode well for Superman's suit.</span></div></div>",

He needed to destroy it but couldn't risk exposing himself to its touch again.<br>\r\n\u2028<br>\r\nThinking fast, Clark turned his heat vision towards the meteor headed towards Earth's atmosphere, hoping to destroy it with his vision's blast. As soon as the beam of heat struck the rock's side, though, a wave a green light blasted out of it in all directions. Before Clark could react it struck him with a force strong enough to knock him back and straight into the next oncoming meteor, shattering it immediately.<br>\r\n\u2028<br>\r\nEvery hair on Clark's body felt like it was standing on end as he felt a strong pulsing under his skin. He could actually feel his heart rate increase, and with each pump of his heart he felt his blood rush through his veins. Gasping, Clark felt all of his muscles ache again.<br>\r\n\u2028<br>\r\n\"No, no, no... I can't! Not... ugh... again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark watched in horror as he felt every muscle on his body flex and relax of their own will, growing and swelling with each pump. His muscles began growing as he felt another, more pleasurable ache in his muscles with each contraction as he began to grow taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if one type of growth weren't enough, now he was experiencing <i>two</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark grunted as he felt his body lengthen, his muscles continuing to swell all the while. He felt his shoulders and lats widen together, his chest swelling out even further, stretching the shield on his suit. His thighs and calves twitched as they tightened and expanded and grew along with his lengthening bones. Clark couldn't help the moan that slipped out as he felt his glutes clench before swelling outward, stretching out the back of his suit even more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe only twenty seconds had passed before his muscles and his bones stopped growing. Panting, Clark looked down at himself in shock and awe. He couldn't deny it now, he was <i>massive</i>. His muscles had been large before, but at least he merely looked like a strong human. Now there was no way he could pass as a normal person due to his muscle alone. Add that on top of being around eight feet tall and Clark knew that there was no returning to civilian life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to stop these meteors and find an antidote, fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark looked back at the next wave of meteors and then down at himself. The more he grew the more he wished he had a chance to explore his new physique. There was no denying how much such a physique on a person with Clark's powers could help the Earth. Superman, enlarged and possibly even more powerful? Clark couldn't help but think of the possibilities. But even if he was stuck like this, he'd have to find a new suit soon. Even though it seemed to be stretching well,  his suit's sleeves were beginning to ride up his massive forearms, and the the suit now left even less to the imagination than before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus, Clark!\" he muttered to himself, shaking his head as if to clear it before looking away from his body and back to the oncoming meteors. Using his telescopic vision, he could see that they would be coming in waves, with time in between each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed a plan. There was no way he could continue deflecting him. Some would go past him. And then there was the side effect problem; if he physically destroyed them himself he grows taller, and if he blasts them with his heat vision they let out a wave that makes his muscles enlarge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark <i>really</i> needed a plan.</span></div></div>",

What would happen if some of the meteors slipped passed him while he was struck helpless, unable to do anything while growing? What if he was somehow able to catch up to them in the Earth's atmosphere and destroy them? Would his own larger, denser mass send <i>him</i> hurtling to the Earth like a meteor, causing damage and death as he lands?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark saw no option but to risk taking on the side effects of the meteors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the next wave, he speed towards them. As he flew faster than a speeding bullet he knew it would only be moments before he hit the first meteor. In the few seconds it took him to reach it he had decided to take a risk and annihilate as many meteors as fast as possible to ensure than none escaped past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he'd regret it, but what chance did he have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark's fist immediately pulverized the first meteor, and in seconds he was bearing down on the second while simultaneously kicking out at a third with his foot, both exploding apart into smithereens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't even take seconds before he felt the now familiar, pleasant ache, but this time it seemed more intense than it had before. Letting out a gasp of shock that quickly became a groan of pain, Clark bent over double, wrapping his arms around his torso as if he could force the growth from happening. He felt his muscles constrict over once-again lengthening bones in no time. He growth was faster this time, seemingly accelerated by destroying three asteroids at once. In two seconds alone he grew four inches. After ten seconds he was two feet taller than <i>that</i>. He grew at least another three and a half feet on top of <i>that</i> before it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow somewhere between thirteen and fourteen feet tall and more than a few hundred pounds of muscle, Clark really couldn't ignore his body anymore. A part of him realized that the more he grew, the more his natural instinct was to focus on his body. He had never felt so good as he did after the growths, and each one made him feel better than the one before. Feeling a bicep with his hand, he felt the muscle swell and move under the straining fabric of his suit. Flexing it, Clark watched as the sleeve gave up the ghost and ripped right across his bicep. His skin had been like steel before, but now it looked like it, too. Veins stood out under the stretched skin, and the muscle visibly shifted with each movement his arm made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved his large hand to his chest, grabbing an enlarged pec in his hand and feeling the large muscle flex and jump under her hand. Sliding his hand down he felt each ridge of his abs and was shocked to find how deep they were. Looking down he could see past his hand to the front of his groin, suddenly realizing just how tight it was; apparently he was enjoying exploring his new size more than he had expected as he felt the front of his suit grow tighter and tighter with each second that passed. Clark could actually <i>see</i> just how much down there had grown with the rest of his body as he watched his cock slowly engorge and force itself down the already tight leg of his suit. It went more than halfway down his thigh now. Clark slowly ran a hand down to feel himself when a meteor shot past him, bringing him back to his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging his attention\u2014and his wandering hands\u2014away from his body, Clark rushed towards the meteor that had passed him before quickly realizing that it was past hope to catch it. There was only one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was already nearly a fourteen foot muscle giant, what harm could a few more pounds of muscle do to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Clark turned his heat vision to the meteor, exploding it into small, harmless pieces that fell to Earth. This time he was ready for the wave that came towards him, pushing him back again.</span></div></div>",

In fact, as he flew, his gut was actually <i>growing bigger.</i> Putting in more effort, he tried to continue flying, but he found himself struggling, and for the first time in his life, sweating. Not only was he flying lower, but his speed was also slowing down, going from as fast as a plane to a car to the speed of a old lady with a walker.

Looking down at himself, all he found was a sea of flab that was once the strongest muscular body in the world. His taunt abs was replaced by a huge doughy gut with love handles stretching the sides. His proud pectorals were now two fleshy moobs that stretched out his trademark S into a distorted mess. His thighs were thicker, now rubbing against each other.
