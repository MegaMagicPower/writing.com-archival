You've been using the Transformation Station again, haven't you? It has to cool off every 99 days after usage. The last time it was used was 97 days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails: Make that 98.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic: This is bad. The results will be rendered PERMANENT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails: PERMANENT?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic: Anonymous people may want to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight: What's happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic: 99 DAYS AFTER USAGE, YOU USED IT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight: (My waistline! Hey, what's going on?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic: Hey! I didn't set it up! (Her bustline is growing, and her belly...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight: Turning... Evil...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic: Do we HAVE to go over this concept? THERE'S! NO! MARE! IN! THE! MOON!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight: Hahaha! Your stupid Transformation Station rendered my badness permanent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic: Has your voice become more villainous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight: Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic: Transformation Station.</span></div></div>",
