            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A bundle of energy and emotions, Chie Satonaka is the most athletic and (with the possible exception of Kanji Tatsumi) the most physical member of her investigation team. Preferring to keep her brown hair short, Chie is an avid fan of martial arts movies, and has sought to emulate them as much as possible in little \"training sessions\" she puts herself through each day (many under the supervision of the team's leader, Yu Narukami). On her off days she loves nothing more than to laugh with friends and enjoy some tasty steak! This has given her a very toned body, with a flat stomach, firm butt, and of course a lovely pair of legs. While her chest is the smallest out of her circle of friends (something she is no doubt painfully aware of!) her lovely and perky breasts are nothing to be scoffed at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder most circumstances Chie will be wearing a typical Yasogami highschool uniform, including a white and blue undershirt with the school emblem on the collar, a yellow \"sailor\" sash tied around her neck, and a short black skirt, and a pair of white socks and thick brown shoes (probably steal toed, as they serve as both her footwear and weapon of choice in battle). In addition, Chie has added her own touches to the outfit. Under her skirt she wears a pair of tight black exercise shorts, around her neck she wears a small necklace and she is seldom seen without her green and yellow jacket with a few whimsical buttons pinned on the outside. Out of school she likes to similarly dress in greens and yellows, sometimes equipped with colorful armbands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was a normal high school student before the mysterious murders began to plague her town of Inaba. She had heard a rumor about a so-called \"Midnight Channel\" that would show one who gazed into a TV at midnight their soul mate. Eager to try out the rumor, Chie incidentally began the chain of events that would lead to the formation of the investigation team. She was present for the initial \"discovery\" of the TV world, and was a part of the original team to save someone who had been thrown in by the mysterious killer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie is in many respects the opposite to Yukiko Amagi. Where Amagi is calm, polite, and a bit withdrawn Chie is enthusiastic, impatient, and outgoing to a fault. She will be the first to rush into danger, fearless and passionate. At the same time, she seldom looks before she leaps, meaning it is often the job of the other members of team to reign in her well-meaning but occasionally shortsighted behavior. According to Chie's shadow the girl has purposefully tried to garner an impression of superiority and domination over her long time friend Yukiko to make up for her own perceived lack of feminine charms and inability to accomplish anything alone. After attaining a persona Chie sought to become more self-reliant and strong, wanting to become the protector in truth that she had always claimed to be. However, she remains extremely self-conscious about herself, especially when it comes to her body and her perceived lack of feminine qualities. No doubt this will make her impending nudity all the more mortifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are other questions about herself Chie has thus far avoided thinking about. Prominent amongst them is her true feelings over Yukiko. Why was SHE specifically so very important? Was it all a matter of jealousy and manipulation on Chie's part...or something else? And what about her shadow's final \"berserker\" form? Did all those whips and chains, gaudy yellow leather \"dominatrix\" wear, and the throne made out of subordinate school girls imply some heavy handed symbolism from her subconscious? Or are there some passions Chie has yet to fully grasp about herself? Only time will tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's embarrassing day began...</span></div></div>",

Just... training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko looked at her friend curiously. \"You've been spending a lot of time training with that new transfer student,\" she noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yu?

That's pretty annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie flushed. \"W-what are you doing?!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko sighed.

Why do you wear such a short skirt? You don't seem to be the sort who likes showing off their legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gives me good mobility in combat,\" Chie exclaimed, throwing out a few lightning fast kicks into the air. \"You can't do that with pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko sighed, placing her head in her hands. \"I think I've identified the first problem,\" she said. She pointed at Chie's shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie walked along, clutching at the hem of her skirt. Why did her skirt suddenly feel so short?

Yosuke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Yukiko is pretty cute, but her figure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh. Yosuke and his friends were discussing girls in the class again. Yu wasn't anything like that.

She was about to launch into a lightining fast kick to Yosuke's head, when a swish of air between her legs reminded her that her shorts were missing. She squeaked, holding down her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke flinched involuntarily. Chie regained her composure and began to throw a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, what are you doing?\" Yukiko called out sweetly behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie whirled to see Yukiko and Yu. \"Ah!

And another. \"Hey, if you keep doing that, I'm going to be able to see your pan-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad idea. Yosuke caught another kick that sent him flying. He landed on something hard. Suddenly, it started to rain. Or was it rain?

She inhaled deeply, savoring the aroma of a freshly cooked steak piled high with spices. She could hear the faint sizzle of the meat so recently taken off the grill. Before her was an enormous bowl, the specialty of the little shop known as Aya. Not quite as grand as their legendary rainy day meat bowl, the Beef Bowl was still a substantial amount of delicious meat over cooked rice and assorted vegetables. This was a rare treat straight from Heaven, and it should be savored. Chie stared at the platter before her a moment longer, than clapped her hands briefly together in a prayer of thanks, stanched her chopsticks with lightning speed and began to feast as if there was no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances, the Beef Bowl was a rare treat a little too expensive for Chie's meager allowance.

Ya know, Chie, there are hyenas in Africa with better table manners than you.\" he said in his usual tone of exasperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie glared at him, raising a general noise of protest, although words were impossible with her mouth filled with steak and beef. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really helping your case here.\" Yosuke said snidely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie growled and swallowed her food. \"Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up. Your not going to spoil this moment for me, no matter how hard you try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't dream of it.\" Yosuke said, a smug grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie glared at him. This wasn't as much fun as it was supposed to be. Pestering and goading Yosuke into paying for her food was usually a blast, especially watching the despair in his eyes as his paycheck disappeared one bite at a time. Steak was fantastic by itself, but it was extra good when it was free and provided by a bemoaning friend. Why exactly Chie took particular delight in tormenting Yosuke over any of her other friends was anyone's guess. Just part of the quirky dynamic of their friendship. But lately he had been really generous, offering to treat her several times in the past few weeks. And he wasn't acting reluctant or angry or anything. If anything, he seemed to be relishing all of this as much as she was. It was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yosuke, I've been meaning to ask...why all the generosity lately?\" Chie said between mouthfuls of her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? Oh, no reason. Guess I'm just trying to balance out my karma.\" Yosuke said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Since when are you so into Buddhism?\" Chie asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you. So far this year I had my bike destroyed, my nads smashed by a psychotic girl over a broken CD, poisoned by Mystery Food X, kicked off a cliff and vomited on for calling a girl cute,  had my money stolen to pay for Tedd's outfit, and my face was smashed with a million buckets because I wanted to use the hot springs during the MEN's time to use them.\" Yosuke said, glaring at Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....yeah, well, you were the ones who signed us up for the beauty pageant!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. And who turned around and sighed US up for the drag show?\" Yosuke shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I....anyway, what does this have to do with your karma?\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much. I just figured I had a lot of good karma stored up. So might as well 'spend' it.\" Yosuke said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...wouldn't spending it mean doing something bad rather than treating a friend?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Yosuke said as the check was delivered. \"But that's what is so great about our friendship, Chie. We let little things slide. I prank you with the pageant, you prank me with the crossdressing. You secret use my money to buy Teddie some clothes....and I pretend to buy you food while secretly running up an enormous tab at Ayas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie had split her attention between the conversation and her Steak Bowl. She froze in midbite, her chopsticks clamped around a juicy piece of meat, the last part of Yosuke's words sinking in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wha-\" She started to say, only to find Yosuke's seat empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya Chie! Good luck with the bill!\" Yosuke sang as he ran out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little-! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was about to rise and give chase when she felt a hand come down on her shoulder. She turned to find the restaurant owner standing over her, a rather thick looking folder of receipts in his hand.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Chie just wanted to sprint home and end this already, she just couldn't work up the nerve to do it.  After being forcibly exposed and made a laughingstock at Aiya's, the possibility of even more people humiliating her like that was horrifying.  To be stuck on the streets surrounded by people like that naked as she was, especially if she ran into anyone who knew her personally, was too much to bear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she dashed around from the restaurant entrance to the alley in between buildings and ducked behind a dumpster.  Crouching behind her smelly safe spot, she shivered as she waited for the voices she had heard earlier to pass by.  After what felt like minutes, two old housewives eventually walked past, gossiping along without a care in the world.  After waiting a while until the voices faded away, she finally stepped back into the alleyway, looking towards the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it... getting so scared over a couple of old ladies,\" Chie berated herself.  \"I know I gotta keep it together, but if anyone sees me like this, I'm toast.  Come on, Chie, think!  How are you going to get out of this one?  Any cover in here?\" she asked out loud as she lifted the dumpster lid, and was overwhelmed with the odors of spoiled, bagged-up spicy food.  \"Hurk!\" she gulped, choking back bile as she closed the lid.  No way was she going to cover herself in garbage; especially <i>that</i> rancid crap.  She still had <i>some</i> pride left, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with a focus on getting back home unseen, Chie thought it over and over, but no matter what she came up with, there was no route that she could guarantee would be clear of people at this time of day.  And the longer she stayed like this the more likely it would be that someone would find her.  And that certainty was dragging her down.  It gnawed at her deeper and deeper until she couldn't take it anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh!  This isn't working!\" she groaned, tugging at her hair.  \"No matter what I do someone might see me... and if I can't keep people from seeing me, then-\" her eyes suddenly lit up.  If she couldn't stop life from punching her, then she would just have to roll with the punches as best she could.  \"-I just have to make sure as few people see me as possible!  Heck, if I'm fast enough, they may not even realize it's me.  Now, what route to take...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she began to consider her options, she heard voices drawing near again, and it was more than a pair of housewives this time!  Chie began to feel cold once again, but caught herself this time.  \"Don't think... feel... don't think... feel...\" she chanted to herself as she took deep breaths and calmed her racing nerves.  With her resolve restored, she made her move, dashing deeper into the alley as she set out on her course homeward.  Having decided to trust her instincts, Chie felt that her best chance of getting home without being seen was by-</span></div></div>",

Besides, the flood plain would be a quicker route home! Chie nodded intently, and as soon as she found the next recognizable side road, that was exactly where her feet swiftly took her. With a quick catch of breath, she approached the long path as stealthily as one could. The nearest bush provided a relatively safe vantage point from her to survey the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was certainly less populated, it had a few problems that Chie hadn't considered. For one, the wide-open space would make anyone passing by as clear as day. For another... it was still broad daylight.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wide open space of the main route was too much of a threat.  If anyone else was using the road they would see her and immediately realize she wasn't wearing anything; even if they were too far to do anything but gawk.  Chie wasn't going to back down, but if there was even a slim chance she could somehow get through this with no one else seeing her, then she still had to take that chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final scan to make sure her path was clear, Chie quickly crept down off the main roadway to the riverside.  Keeping her head down, she made her way upstream along the beach.  As Chie pressed on, she couldn't help but notice, between the feel of her bare feet on the dirt and rocks of the shore, to the warm sunlight beaming down on her body, that it was like she was out for a day at the beach.  Without any people around, Chie started to feel the tension lessen somewhat... only for it come right back as she saw something in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead, there was something splashing about in the water.  Instinctively, Chie winced, covered herself, and edged toward the streetside hill as she eyed the disturbance cautiously.  As she looked at it, the splashing almost looked like someone was... thrashing about in the river!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph!  H-Help!  Grbblbl!\" a child's voice shouted out, choking on water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\" Chie shouted, immediately covering her mouth with a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  Someone!  A-Anyone!\" the child cried out.  They seemed to have heard Chie, but it was hard to tell as they were drowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" said Chie.  That kid was drowning!  She dashed towards the water, ready to leap in, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eee!\" Chie shivered as the water covered her hips.  \"Crap, I forgot I'm naked!\" she gasped, coming to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her moment of hesitation just that, a moment.  The kid in front of her was starting to sink, but she was still downstream from them.  There was still time!  With a yell, Chie dove into the river and swam towards the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" she shouted, grabbing the kid and pushing them to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! *glub*  Who?\" they sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab on!  I'll save you!\" Chie said, turning around so that they could grab onto her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't respond, but Chie could feel the kid grabbing onto her.  First their legs around her waist, and then the arms up on her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eek!\" Chie squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" the kid uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's fine!  Just, don't let go!\" Chie flinched, making her way back to shore.  It wasn't easy, but the young martial artist's tenacity proved to be stronger than the river's current.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... we made it,\" Chie panted as she crawled onto shore.  \"Hey... are you alright?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child didn't say anything, but their arms were still wrapped around Chie's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Chie spoke louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid started to move, and fell down, having slipped off of Chie's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Chie gasped, as she moved to get a good look at the kid.  He looked like a young boy dressed in normal clothes, not a swimsuit.  <i>\"Did he even know how to swim?\"</i> Chie thought.  <i>\"How long was he in there!?\"</i>  Worried, she felt his body, checking for signs of life.  The boy's skin was almost numb, (she herself was feeling quite chilled from the river as well,) and she couldn't quite tell if there was a pulse or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... come on, come on...\" Chie pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cough* *Cough*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy suddenly lurched, coughing up water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  Is he-?\" went Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Hack* *Cough* M-Miss...?\" the boy asked, weakly looking in Chie's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm here!\" Chie replied.  \"You're all right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you...\" he trailed off, before closing his eyes yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie drew a short breath, and put her ear towards the boy's mouth.  She could hear the sound of steady breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...\" Chie sighed a long sigh, sitting back upright.  \"First streaking home thanks to Yosuke's prank and now rescuing a kid like this?  What a day this has been!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she made to get back on her path, but then realized something.  Was it all right to just leave him there?  The sun was warm enough that even she was starting to dry out already but, while he seemed to be stable, but if he was alone when he fell, it could be hours until someone finds him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie looked toward the boy, then off towards her path.  It still would be really, really bad if she was seen, but was it all right to just leave him here by the shore?  No, she couldn't do that!  But if she stayed on with him, then she would be- but what if they could help?  She was just in the river after all... maybe that could work too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking water droplets out of her hair, Chie decided to-</span></div></div>",

Even if she was at the risk of being exposed a little while longer, at least she could avoid getting sick. Cautiously she descended from street level and made her way to the river bank. Fortunately for her, no one was nearby at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great anxiety, she stood out by the river in an area that was encompassed by the sun\u2019s rays. While this was the fastest way for her to dry herself out, she was buck naked in broad daylight. The river bank was, for the most part, a wide field with virtually no coverage, anybody passing by would have little difficulty spotting her in the buff. Realizing this, Chie decided to lie down on a grassy area of the bank to minimize visibility. With her back to the ground, the front end of Chie\u2019s body was exposed to the outside air. With her heart hammering in her chest, she lay with her arm and legs spread apart, waiting for her body to dry. This entire situation was humiliating, and she was sure to give a certain June\u2019s employee a piece of her mind when this was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs minutes passed Chie\u2019s strategy began to pay off as she felt the droplets on her skin dissipating.  Slowly but surely, she was getting drier by the second and was no longer cold or shivering. Instead, she felt good\u2026..really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun\u2019s rays, the warm breeze, as she basked in the glow of the sun she enjoyed the sensation of warmth that caressed her body.

As she was about to drift into unconsciousness she looked down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nipples were erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her face burning red, Chie snapped out of her daze as she was suddenly reminded of the severity of her situation. Oh my God\u2026 What am I doing? <br>\r\nWith her backside still damp, Chie turned around so that she was lying on her stomach. She let out an involuntary yelp as she felt the blades of grass tickling her vulva and stimulating her nipples. Ashamed of her body\u2019s reaction she scolded herself. Come on Chie, you\u2019re a big girl, have some control!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was bad enough normally, but bugs crawling on her in this state?  Out of the question!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the ants gone, Chie caught her breath, then lost it again when she heard a buzzing noise, followed by something landing on her buttock.  \"W-W-What's that?\" she whimpered.  Could it be a cicada?  Dragonfly?  Just a nasty old fly?  Whatever it was Chie hoped to God that it would just leave.  She was just swimming after all, why would bugs be attracted to her!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug soon flew away, and Chie sighed and slowly blinked in relief.  \"Ha... what was I even afraid-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes opened to see a grasshopper leaping right towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!

But all good seams must come to an end, and Chie's powerful kick had finally strained the fabric beyond the breaking point. And it was no small rip, alas. The poor shorts virtually exploded, leaving behind nothing but tiny shreds of fabric too small to provide even a modicum of cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore's the pity that Chie had come to treat her shorts as de facto underwear. Not at all hygienic, but she had gotten so used to wearing the shorts under her school uniform that it just seemed like a waste to wear something else under them. Besides...there was something of a naughty thrill having nothing on underneath what everyone else could see. And an even naughtier thrill from the way the fabric would sometimes rub against her nether regions during a particularly intense workout! Not even Yukiko knew about that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, soon a lot more people would know. Chie was still wearing her skirt and jacket, of course. But her skirt was shockingly small, another factor that had motivated her to wear something more substantial beneath it.

The math book sat there, open to the latest chapter, its pages filled with incomprehensible notations and questions that had begun to blur together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid studying! Stupid homework! Stupid brain!\" Chie growled, taking her frustration out with a series of kicks aimed at her nearby punching bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin teenage girl paused a moment after the flurry of motion, breathing heavily and heart pounding. This was absolutely the worst thing she had ever experienced. Bring on berserk shadows and creepy serial killers any day! Her real opponent, the unbeatable final boss in her own personal hell of a shonen anime, was most certainly the incomprehensible school work her teachers mercilessly bombarded her with. What was worse...from what she had heard about college, mathematics only became more intricate and complicated from here. She was facing an unbeatable enemy, and this wasn't even their final form!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a dejected sigh Chie slumped down in her chair. She'd never particularly cared for her studies this much in the past. She was well aware that academics were her weak point, and had been content to lean heavily on her long time friend Yukiko for tutoring to help her scrape through the tests when all else failed. But that of course had all been before she had met a certain Yu Narukami, before her whole world had been turned absolutely upside down with the introduction of the TV world...and of course before her self image had been rather mercilessly torn apart by her mocking inner self. Ever since Chie had been determined to stop relying (abusing, really, if her shadow was to be believed) her friend and become self sufficient! Not to mention she had a new goal and purpose in life- to join the police academy and officially protect the innocent as she had behind the scenes as a member of the Investigation Team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here she was, new and improved self sufficient Chie, protector of the innocent...slamming her head against the brick wall that was her math homework! Life was incredibly unfair sometimes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Forget this. I've been at this way too long and I'm not getting ANYWHERE anymore. Its okay to take a break for the day, right? Let my poor brain recharge just a little?\" Chie asked the empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay. But what kind of break?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie paused, then popped on her laptop. She found her answer in a listing of her local movie theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naked Fist III: Naked Fury! Holy crap! I had no idea they were making a new one!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie had her mission.

There's no need to shout.\" Akihiko Sanada scolded. \"But yeah, that was a pretty great for an action movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been an incident, not long after the investigation team had confronted and defeated the god of Inaba responsible for the existence of the TV World. The details were somewhat convoluted, involving robots and other persona users and an attempt to destroy the world. But most important, it had resulted in Chie meeting the former boxer turned lone wanderer, Akihiko. He was clearly as serious and passionate about fighting as Chie herself, and had years of experience pursuing his craft to boot. The first time Chie had laid eyes on the half naked, battle scarred fighter she knew she had found him at last. Her role model. Her hero. Her Master on the road to becoming a martial arts hero of justice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, a guy trying to get into the police academy who liked fighting movies and training as much as she did! A natural companion for enjoying the epic that was the Naked Fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That last fight was incredible! The way they were just wailing on the hero back and forth and just when you think he can't win....'BUT YOU SEE, BLACK SCORPION GANG, I'VE BEEN WEARING WEIGHTED CLOTHING THE ENTIRE TIME!' And then...BA-BOOSH! Whips off his clothes, and beats the crap out of em in less than a second!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm. It was impressive.. Its mostly CGI these days, of course. No doubt their stunt people could dodge a real bullet like that.\" Akihiko mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was still cool, though!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose. But in real life actually dodging something that fast doesn't leave you time to smirk at the camera. It doesn't leave you time to think at all. Its pure muscle memory. By the time your brain has a chance to think about what you did beyond pure instinct, you've already done it and counter attacked....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your really that fast, master?\" Chie said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that. But yeah. You might be too, for that matter. Training your persona helps train your body beyond what a normal person can achieve on their own. Plus, I've spent my time training up my arms and upper body. If gives me power, but also slows me down. If I was fighting someone like you on my level, your focus on your feet would probably give you a huge speed advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...you...really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. But don't get cocky. I've been training way longer than you have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but like you said, all my training goes to my legs! Those are naturally more powerful than the arms anyway since they get more exercise daily just from walking. So I'm probably already faster. No offense, Master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Akihiko whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething to note about both Chie and her so called master. Action movies excite them, but also leave them feeling restless. Seeing super human feats done with such ease makes them think about their own training. As energetic and athletic as they are even as their default personality, the level of competition and desire to throw themselves back into their training was now at a fever pitch. In contrast, their tendency to throw themselves recklessly into an endeavor in defiance of common sense, while always a danger, was also at an all time high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me. From here to the Amagi Inn! Loser pays for our next meal at Aiya's tonight. And just to warn you, I hear its gonna be stormy in the evening. Hope you have enough for two Mega Beef Bowls, Master!\" Chie proclaimed in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your on. Just so you know, I'm not one to hold back. I'll be looking to beat not just you, but my own best time! Put your all into it, or your going to lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you!\" Chie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the great race of Inaba began. It would be a day the two would not forget...no matter how hard they tried.</span></div></div>",

All of them had their school supplies in front of them as they half-heartedly asked each other questions out of their coursebooks. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So...why is it just us girls here again? I mean, I don't mind a girls night, but this isn't exactly my idea of a good time.\" Chie said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...we were originally going to study with everyone tonight, but then Teddie said he had 'something planned' for the guys tonight so it ended up being just us.

In it there was a scene where the girl who would have been my character and her boyfriend were studying and every time she got something right he had to take something off, but every time she got something wrong <i>she</i> had to take something off...\" Rise finished.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...\" Chie said, her cheeks flushing slightly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That sounds like it could be interesting,\" Yukiko said thoughtfully. \"What do you think, Chie?

But if <i>you</i> get it right before I answer then Naoto has to strip.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-what? I don't...\" Naoto protested.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But,\" Yukiko pressed on, \"if you get the question wrong and then <i>I</i> get it wrong too, then I take something off you, Chie. And I guess I can ask Rise-chan questions too and the same rules can apply there. If Rise-chan gets it right, then I have to take something off, but if both she and Naoto get it wrong then Naoto takes something off her. We play until two of us are naked and then they have to do what the other two say for the rest of the night.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I...I um....huh...\" Chie stammered, at a loss for words.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not so sure...\" Naoto began again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, that <i>could</i> be fun. I'd play if that's what everyone wants to do,\" Rise piped up. \"<i>Buuuut</i>, why don't we see if we can invite the guys instead and play the same kind of thing with them? I mean, doesn't that interest you more?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-what!?\" Chie blanched. Naoto's eyes widened in fear too. Yukiko merely looked curious. Chie had to admit, there was at least <i>one</i> of the guys she might consider doing this kind of thing with, but she wasn't sure she was ready for that kind of thing yet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's simple, we call the guys here for study night. We spring the strip idea on them and we make it girls vs guys. Teddie would be on-board before we finished pitching it and it probably wouldn't take much to convince Yosuke and Senpai. Kanji would probably take some prodding, but he'd fall to peer pressure in the end. Then maybe we can come up with some kind of scheme that gives us a big advantage over them. Wouldn't it be kind of fun to do that to them? I know I'd like to see it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chie thought about this. In a certain way the idea was appealing, especially if Rise's ideal version of events played out. But if their plan somehow backfired and the girls ended being naked, she wasn't sure if she could handle the embarrassment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"U-um...guys...\" A small voice from the corner piped up as Yu's young cousin, Nanako, approached. Apparently she had entered the room without anyone else noticing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh! I'm sorry Nanko-chan! I almost forgot you were here. You've been so quiet doing your schoolwork it kind of just slipped my mind!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...I heard you guys talking and...I could use some help studying too,\" she said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-oh...well, I'm not sure what we're talking about here is...\" Chie trailed off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I thought it sounded fun!\" Nanako said brightly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-oh...\" Chie floundered, at a loss for words.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have a voc-ab-u-lar-y test coming up,\" Nanako explained. \"And I was thinking each of you could give me a word, and if I got its meaning right you would take something off, like in your other idea, but if I got three wrong I'd have to take something off. And if I got all four wrong I'd have to take <i>two</i> things off. If you guys lost everything first, then I'd win and if I lost everything first, then you'd win.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh....\" Chie began. \"Well, I guess that's an idea, too. I don't know about all this, though. I know I Said I was bored but...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I don't care very much what we do. All of them sound interesting to me, and I'd like to have some fun too,\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm...I'm still not sure about this...is this really what you guys want to do tonight?\" Naoto asked, nervously unconsciously adjusting the front of her shirt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I made my preference clear, but I'm fine doing whatever. Why don't you pick, Chie-Senpai?\" Rise said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chie wondered how this became <i>her</i> decision. She supposed since she was the one who said she was bored in the first place, this had somehow fallen to her. She thought about the three ideas and decided to suggest...</span></div></div>",

Not that Chie needed complete privacy, but not too many people passed by the area, and she said that it was good to get out once in a while.  She did find it odd that Yukiko would want to just watch her train sometimes instead of doing something else, but Yukiko assured her that it was okay.  Seeing Chie go all out in her training sometimes served as a stress reliever for Yukiko as well.  And that is normally how it went, Yukiko spectating Chie's workout before they went off and did something else.  Today, however, Yukiko had some plans of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm gonna get started now,\" said Chie, starting her stretches.  \"Need a drink or something while you watch, Yukiko-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm not going to be watching today,\" Yukiko replied, as she set her bag on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it,\" Chie sighed, shaking her head. \"It's starting to get boring isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  No, no!  It's not that!\" Yukiko stammered. \"You're not boring me, or anything like that, Chie-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha!  Relax, I was just teasing,\" Chie laughed. \"So, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Yukiko said, rummaging through her bag.  \"Actually, there's something here I've been meaning to try here for a while, and being here with you during your training is the perfect timing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something you've been meaning to try?\" Chie asked, curious.  \"Is it anything I can help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, if you'd like to.

But why now, all of a sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been on my mind for a while now,\" said Yukiko, picking up her fan from her pack.  \"But after what happened recently... Remember when we last went in the TV and got ambushed by all those shadows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... yeah,\" Chie groaned.  \"Not our best moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you were able to fight back.  I got knocked down in just one strike.  If you all weren't able to pull through-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry about that,\" Chie interjected. \"Sometimes bad stuff like that happens.  What matters is that we're still alive and kicking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I was just so... weak,\" Yukiko said, looking away. \"You can't deny that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you're not wrong, but,\" Chie hesitated.  \"Come on, you've got your own kind of power.  Those Agi skills of yours would knock me senseless as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter how strong my magic skills are if I get destroyed before I can use them!\" Yukiko suddenly shouted.  Realizing her outburst, she quickly composed herself and added, \"So please, Chie.  Help me get stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko,\" Chie said, looking her friend in the face.  \"Okay.  You got it, one Satonaka Strength course coming right up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you!\" Yukiko replied, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to work on first?\" Chie asked, starting to get pumped. \"Endurance?  Arm strength?  Leg strength?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking more like a sparring match,\" Yukiko stated simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, a one-on-one friendly duel, just like in your favorite kung-fu movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that!  But, sparring, right off the bat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard it's the fastest way to get stronger, Chie.  So please?  You said you'd help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.  Fine,\" Chie sighed.  \"But let's warm up with some stretches first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, after some quick stretches, the two friends took their positions in front of each other.  Yukiko had her fan at the ready, while Chie was wearing her normal clothes, fighting boots not equipped.  But Yukiko knew that even with just her normal shoes, Chie was still a force to be reckoned with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Yukiko,\" Chie said, hints of trepidation in her voice.  \"Come at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko immediately went in, swiping at Chie with her fan.  Normally, Yukiko would throw her fan at Shadows to fight them, but it was her close game that needed work, so she chose to go into melee.  And her need for improvement was apparent, as Chie easily slid around her strikes, strafing and circling around her.  This was going nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, my turn!\" Chie said, taking the offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Yukiko gasped, scrambling to put her guard up.  Luckily, she was able to bring her fan up in time to help deflect Chie's kicks as she was pushed further and further back.  Each kick was more intense than the last, but Yukiko would not be broken so easily.  Chie wound up for another kick, and Yukiko moved her fan to intercept-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Chie didn't attack immediately, it was a feint!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's guard was out of place, as Chie followed through and unleashed a powerful spin kick at Yukiko!

You?\" Chie asked quizzically as she stared at the fishing rod in Yukiko's hands.  \"Where did this come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got the rod myself,\" Yukiko said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, what's with the sudden fishing craze?\" Chie clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, you know how my cooking's always been kinda... awful, right?\" Yukiko grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Chie gave a sympathy wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I figured out the problem.  A good chef uses only the freshest ingredients, right?  What's fresher than getting it straight from the source?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Yukiko?  I don't think catching fish straight from the river is any different than just buying some at the store...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think so, right?  But get this,\" Yukikok said with sudden energy. \"Yesterday, while we were exploring the TV, Yu-kun was looking pretty bad after a battle, but before I could heal him he just whipped out this huge fish, ate it all in a few bites, and was fully restored!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" said Chie.  \"You've gotta be kidding me!  An entire fish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I almost couldn't believe my own eyes, but that's what happened!\" Yukiko replied. \"I asked him about it afterwards, and he told me that he sometimes fishes right here on his free time, and that's how he got that fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?  Wow... of all days to not be in the main group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These fish are definitely special.  If I use one of these in my cooking, it'll definitely improve the meal I make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about that,\" Chie said nervously.  \"But what the hey, count me in,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Chie,\" Yukiko said warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, come to think of it, I think I remember seeing Yu-kun standing on that pier over there sometimes,\" Chie pointed to a stone dock. \"Think that's his magic fishing spot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks as good a place to me as anywhere,\" Yukiko shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRod in hand, Yukiko walked over to the pier, with Chie close behind.  Standing at the edge of the pier, Yukiko peered down into the mostly-clear water rushing on by.  She thought she could see something swimming about.  \"Okay, here goes,\" Yukiko said, swinging back with the fishing rod and casting into the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" Chie said, letting out a whistle.  \"So, what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have to wait now, until I catch a fish?\" Yukiko ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, gotcha,\" Chie nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls stared at the bobber intensely, waiting for something to happen.  Five minutes passed.  Which soon became ten, then fifteen.  All without a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, we've been waiting forever.  Something happen already!\" Chie complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is quite odd.  Which bait did you use, again?\" an elderly voice popped up behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAH!\" Chie and Yukiko screamed, with Yukiko almost dropping the rod.  Glancing around, they saw an old man hunched over staring at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez!  Don't sneak up on us like that, you almost gave me a heart attack, old man!\" Chie shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you want with us?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your concentration's good, it seems,\" the old man continued, seeming to ignore Chie's outburst.  \"But I think there might be a problem with the bait you're using.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bait?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just reel in your line, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Yukiko complied while Chie stood on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's your problem,\" the old man pointed at the bare hook.  \"Your bait's gone and fallen off the hook.  You haven't run out, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bait?\" Yukiko asked, confused. \"Chie, am I forgetting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, but maybe...\" Chie shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No bait!?\" the old man stood up straight as a pole.  \"Is this your first time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if it is?\" Chie said, eyeing the old man with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so!  Then what you two need are the basics! ...\" he suddenly rambled into a long explanation about fishing before either Chie or Yukiko could say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that should be all you need to know, understood?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Chie blinked, clearly having lost track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think I get it now,\" Yukiko said.  Though a lot of the mechanics he mentioned such as the gauge bar, weather patterns, and Diligence escaped her, she thought that she was able to grasp the gist of what he said.  \"Um... you wouldn't happen to have any bait that we could use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why it just so happens I do!  Ten of these aught to do you just fine for now,\" the old man grinned, handing Yukiko a bunch of strange meaty blobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks...\" Yukiko said, taking the pack.  \"So fish actually eat this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's all from me, unless you need any refreshers.  Oh!  And if you'd like to trade me any fish you catch, I've got some nice items I can give.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all right,\" Yukiko said.  \"I'm just here for the fish, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, spoken like a true angler.  I'll leave you to it then!\" he said, and shuffled off downstream along the riverbank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a wierdo...\" Chie said eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... though he did give us plenty of bait,\" Yukiko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko place a piece of bait on the hook and wound up for another cast, the baited hook landing in the river with a plop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how long do you think it will be until you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*whizz* the fishing line suddenly reeled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I have one!\" Yukiko gasped, grabbing at the reel to start pulling it in.  \"It's pretty heavy!\" she grunted, struggling to pull it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Yukiko, you can do it!\" Chie cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko pulled with all her might and... the line snapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK!\" Yukiko squawked, falling backwards flat on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, ow...\" Yukiko winced, rubbing her head.  \"I think I pulled a little too hard on that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're gonna be okay?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, really...  Let me just get another hook,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith line rebaited, Yukiko tried for attempt number 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've caught something!\" Yukiko shouted with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!  Remember, carefully this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great care, Yukiko slowly reeled in her line.  It was quite arduous, but Yukiko succeeded, reeling in... an old boot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" said Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This just isn't fair,\" Yukiko grumbled, tossing the boot onto the beach behind her.  \"It even used my bait and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did- wait, we probably don't want to know,\" Chie said, eyeing the booth with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko sighed as she baited her hook once more.  She could already see the sun start to head towards the horizon.  Fishing was a lot more difficult and time-consuming than she thought it would be.  She was already feeling drained; this was probably the last attempt she had in her for the day.  Flinging her line into the river once more, she waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the telltale tug of the line was felt once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got one!  I hope this is it!\" said Yukiko pulling in the line once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line suddenly pulled back.  She wasn't dealing with a boot this time.  \"Whoa!\" Yukiko yelped, as she was pulled to the edge of the pier.  \"Ch-Chie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it!\" Chie sprung up, dashed towards Yukiko, grabbed hold of her and pulled back.  The struggle was great, but the pair was slowly making progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph!  Almost there, you think?\" asked Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think so,\" said Yukiko, giving one last heave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end-</span></div></div>",

The girls were breathless for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  We did it, Yukiko!\" Chie cheered, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Chie,\" said Yukiko, taking in the marvel in front of her.  The fish was indeed huge, its length reaching down from her neck to her knees.  \"This is definitely the same type of fish Yu-kun had the other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so big,\" Chie said, staring longingly at the fish.  \"But eating it like this without cooking it first?  That's crazy,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the plan.  Oh!\" Yukiko gasped. \"It's that late already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was already low in the horizon.  When did it get to be so late?  Fishing really does take it out of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  But it feels like we barely did anything at all!\" Chie said as they went back onto the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Chie.  I didn't mean to take up your whole day like this...\" Yukiko said remorsefully.  \"Ah!  How about you come over and I can cook this up for us to have together?  It's the least I could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!?  Uh, no, no that's fine,\" Chie suddenly paled.  \"I gotta get home and, you know, study and all that.  We can walk together on the way, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course,\" Yukiko answered, busy with wrapping the undulating prize in newspaper she brought in her bag.  She had hoped to treat her, but if she was busy, she was busy.  She would just have to store it for later.  Unfortunately, it seemed that the fish was too big to put inside her bag.  At least not without folding or cutting it up, but that would ruin everything.  \"Guess I'll just carry it,\" she said aloud to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, pride in her head and wrapped fish in her hands, Yukiko set off for home with Chie alongside her.  She noticed the telltale odor of fresh fish start to come up after they walked for a while, but she paid it no mind.  As they continued through to downtown Inaba, making small talk along the way, Yukiko couldn't help shake a forboding feeling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Meow*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Yukiko gasped, turning around, seeing that a small orange cat was following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Oh!\" Chie turned as well.  \"Hey there little guy,\" she reached to pet the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat shrugged off Chie's pets and meowed again, staring up at Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he want with me?\" Yukiko said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, the fish,\" Chie said in realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't have that, we worked hard for this!\" Yukiko said, clutching the fish defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but he looks so hungry,\" Chie said sympathetically.  \"I feel kinda guilty just leaving him to starve like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we don't have any other food to give them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Oh, wait!\" Chie had a sudden burst of inspiration.  \"Maybe you can give them some of that extra bait?  The fish went for it, and cats eat fish, so maybe they'll like that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, that's brilliant!\" Yukiko nodded.  It made perfect sense after all.  After a little digging around in her back, she brought forth one of the strange meaty blobs the old man gave her.  \"Here you go,\" Yukiko said, presenting it lovingly in her hand towards the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat crept forward and gave the bait a sniff.  It wrinkled its nose, seeming to flinch back, but soon leaned back in and gave the bait a lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*HISSSS* it went, crouching down and baring its teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't think that worked Chie...\" Yukiko grimaced.  \"We should just go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Meow* *Meow* *Meow* *Meow* *Meow*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of meows suddenly echoed around them.  Instead of one cat in front of them, there were now ten cats all around them!  Did that leader just send out some sort of cat signal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Yukiko...\" Chie whispered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they're mad?\" Yukiko asked, stating the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant, the cats all leapt towards Yukiko, claws and teeth bared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAH!\" Yukiko screamed, first out in fear, then out in pain as their tiny cat claws sunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko!\" Chie cried out, springing into action and pulling away at the cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe felines' attack was ferocious, scratching up and tearing all over Yukiko.  She did her best to shake them off, but the advantage belonged to the hungry horde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Yukiko screamed.  One bad grab knocked the fish out of her hands!  No sooner than it hit the ground, the cats immediately detached themselves from Yukiko and clamored over the parcel, clawing away at the wrapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess they only want the fish!\" said Chie.  \"Let's go while they're distracted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Yukiko shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko, don't be stupid!  They've messed you up a lot already.  Do you want them to take another bite out of you!?\" Chie said, pointing at Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko glanced down at herself and couldn't help but gape.  In the short time the cats had attacked her, they quickly caused a lot of superficial damage.  Frankly, she looked like she had been put through a blender.  Her pantyhose was severely shredded with some red lines running along her legs as well, and several rips have been made along her skirt and sweater, in addition to the buttons having been torn out of the latter.  She was a complete mess.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Yukiko just shook her head.  This wasn't just about the fish to her.  This whole exercise was meant to improve herself, which would be made useless if she turned away now.  \"I'm not giving up to this!\" she yelled, and dove towards the fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cats had torn away most of the newspaper and had almost reached the fish when Yukiko charged into them and picked the fish back up.  \"Get off!\" she shouted, reclaiming the prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only made the cats angrier, as they readied themselves and pounced towards Yukiko once more,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HII-YAAA!\" Chie shouted, bursting in and delivering a devastating kick to one of the cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*MREEOOWW* the cat cried as it was knocked far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some of this?  Bring it on!\" Chie yelled, standing between Yukiko and the cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie!\" Yukiko gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!  I'll be right behind you!\" Chie said, wincing as the cats began to cling to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Yukiko replied, clutching the fish and running away, cats, Chie, and more cats in hot pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sun nearly fully set, not many people were out at this time.  But there were still a few passersby witness to the strange cat chase.  Yukiko was running fast enough to avoid getting cornered, the cats continued to leap at her and deal glancing damage to her.  Unfortunately for the girls, the further they went, the more cats seemed to be joining the fight.  Just how many stray cats were there in Inaba!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Yukiko was no longer focused on running home, just on running away, and hopefully finding some shelter.  Miraculously, her aimless fleeing found herself at a familiar location, which even though it wasn't the Inn, it would at least be an improvement.  She found herself at-</span></div></div>",

Continuing her mad dash, she paused in front of the automatic doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ting* the doors opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, YEEE!\" Yukiko squawked as a pursuing cat took the opportunity to latch onto her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off!\" she grunted as she went inside, shoving the cat away with one arm, holding the precious fish in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the lobby, Yukiko immediately turned to the stairs, instinctively heading for the rooftop food court that had become familiar to her and her friends.  Normally she would have taken the elevator, but normally she wasn't being hounded by a swarm of angry cats.  Her heart pounding from exhaustion, she continued to urge herself up the stairs two at a time, the constant meowing behind her adding extra incentive.  It was a good thing there were only two floors to the store, in addition to the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally making it to the door at the top, which thankfully had a latch and was not automatic, Yukiko took a look behind her.  The front of the pack was only several steps behind her!  Quickly, she shoved the door open, scrambled through, and heaved into it from behind, shutting it just as the cats were about to burst through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha... ha...\" Yukiko could only sigh as she breathed heavily, crumpling to the floor and leaning back against the door.  That was too close...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko-san?  What happened to you?  And is that... a fish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko looked up in shock, and saw her friend and classmate Yosuke Hanamura, along with several other people in the food court, all looking at her.  Given the state Yukiko was currently in, her pantyhose and sweater reduced to rags, and her remaining clothes also in disarray, she was very embarrassed at being seen like this, even though she would still be considered decently dressed.  Or rather she would have been, if what she saw didn't cause her to cringe in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-c-cat!\" Yukiko stuttered, eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?  Oh, this little guy?\" Yosuke asked, looking at the little ball of fluff and whiskers in his hands.  \"We're having a pet day today at Junes, and this guy's owner's letting everyone pet him.  You want to give him a hold?  You look like you could use a serious stress reliever right about now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Yukiko shouted, clutching her fish and turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, no need to freak out,\" Yosuke replied, bringing the cat back and handing it off to a nearby woman.  \"Just have a seat over here...\" he pointed to an open table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko, deep in her own mind, silently got up and sat down in the chair, setting the fish onto the table.  Looking around, she saw some cats and dogs along with their owners milling about around the food court.  None of them were charging her.  Thank goodness for pet training!  Also, the other people who were looking at her when she burst in had went back to their own business as well.  Yukiko figured she was safe here for now, but what should she do next?  She knew she needed to wait for Chie, but then how would the two of them best avoid the cats on the way back to the Inn?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you look like you've been through hell,\" Yosuke said casually, yet concerned, taking a seat across from her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Yukiko glumly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to talk about it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Yukiko replied, looking through her bag once more, trying to figure out what to do on her end.  Nothing of use except for the fishing rod... but even if she took that out, she would have to cut or fold the fish to stick it in the bag... but she really wanted to keep it intact for cooking.  Still, it was starting to look like either battered fish or no fish by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought as much,\" Yosuke said, looking to the side, sounding a little disappointed.  \"Oh hey, how about I get you some new wrapping for your fish?  It looks like you could use some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko looked at the fish again.  Indeed, it was only half-covered by newspaper right now.  It would need to be fully wrapped if she wanted to sneak by the cats.  \"Oh, sure,\" Yukiko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Yosuke said, getting up from his seat.  \"I'll just run down to our seafood section and get some of that, be back in just a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko saw him leave, walking to the staircase door.  The one she just took.  \"Wait!  Yosuke-!\" she warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Yosuke's head turned around, but his body continued to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food court elevator doors opened revealing a severely scratched up Chie.  The sleeves on her tracksuit were completely demolished and her skirt was in tatters, showing off her excercise shorts underneath.  Her face lit up as she saw Yukiko ahead of her, but that expression turned to confusion as she saw the girl's worried expression.  She followed her gaze and turned to the side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*MEEEEOOOOWWWW!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!  What the hell!?\" Yosuke screamed as half a dozen cats pounced onto him, some latching in, others bouncing off of him and continuing into the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Yukiko was back on her feet, fish in hand, as she sprinted towards the opposite staircase, avoiding the increasingly panicking crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko!\" Chie shouted, to no avail, as the cats pursued Yukiko and the fish anew.  \"Rrrgh!  Dammit Yosuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie?  Me!?  How was I supposed to know there'd be a bunch of pissed off cats behind the door!?\" Yosuke yelled, struggling in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her friends and a plaza full of panicked people and pets behind, Yukiko bolted into the other stairwell and shut the door behind her as well.  She turned ahead only to see another group of cats!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-!?\" she gasped.  Did they circle all the way around the store just to catch up to her!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of her confusion, the cats leapt to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAH!  OW!  Not again!\" Yukiko yelled, clutching the fish protectively in her arms, opting to charge on through.  Enduring a flight's worth of scratches and bites as the cats stubbornly held fast, she trudged into the main store the first chance she got.  Fortunately, there weren't any customers in sight, not that that helped Yukiko at all at that moment.  \"Argh, just leave me alone already!\" she grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko!\" rang a shout from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie!\" Yukiko replied, recognizing the voice.  \"Get these beasts off me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it, come on Yosuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Yosuke replied, his voice alongside Chie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko continued trudging forward, and then felt a tugging sensation all along her back.  Undeterred, she continued pushing forward... and was soon released!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RRRIP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Chie gasped, holding two cats who were clutching the remains of Yukiko's skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Yosuke uttered, the cat he was holding clutching a large portion of Yukiko's shirt in its claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" they both said in unison, seeing a lot more of Yukiko sprinting down the hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko, however, had ignored the noise completely, taking advantage of her restored movement to put as much distance between herself and the cats as possible.  Looking around for an exit, she soon saw a door off to the side.  Beelining towards it, she quickly shut herself inside, avoiding the cats once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting completely out of control...\" she panted, catching her breath in relative safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, looking around, her relief soon turned to dread.  She ended up in a restroom, meaning the only way out was back through the cats!  As she checked over herself, she realized it was even worse than that.  Her skirt was gone entirely!  Only the uppermost parts of her pantyhose that were previously blocked by her skirt remained, covering only her panties.  And, checking in the mirror, she saw that her sweater was also gone, and that most of her shirt was torn and open around her midriff, with large holes in the back as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yukiko was taking this all in, the movement of a stall door opening in the mirror drew her attention.  Her face paled.  She wasn't alone; someone was going to see her in this mortifying state!  However, she didn't know whether to feel even more embarrassed or relieved when the person inside turned out to be another one of her friends.  At the very least, she was surprised beyond words to see that the other person was-</span></div></div>",

I must be in a beautiful dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Yukiko groaned, the color draining from her face upon seeing the colorful costume bear costume that was Teddie.  Why, of all people to see her like this, did it have to be that perverted bear?  Teddie was a good friend, sure, but he was very un<i>bear</i>able at times, pun fully intended, as he himself would say; especially around the girls of the group.  And if the sight of them in swimsuits was enough to excite him into a frenzy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Yuki-chan.  I don't know what happened, but now that your precious Teddie is here, everything will be a-okay!\" he said, arms outstretched running to embrace her in a likely to be less-than-wholesome manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Back off!\" Yukiko said, reacting just in time, smacking Teddie right in the face with her fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLECK!  Ah-Achoo!\" Teddie sneezed.  \"Ah!  It got in my nose!  Noooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Teddie,\" Yukiko apologized, bringing the fish to cover her as well as she could.  \"But you were out of control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Achoo! Ugh,\" Teddie moaned, wiping his nose. \"This definitely isn't a dream then.  But, but that means...\" Teddie's eyes lit up.  \"Yuki-chan really is almost naked in front of me.  What wonderful series of events could have led to this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's been nothing wonderful about it!\" Yukiko growled.  \"Except for catching this fish, that is.  This whole day has been a disaster with those horrible cats aren't letting me get home with my hard-earned catch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cats are trying to steal your fish?\" Teddie asked.  \"Well, I can see why.  That fish is eeeenormous!  I'm getting hungry just looking at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in trying to take it from me, they've been picking me apart, reducing me to this!\" Yukiko continued, presenting her bare, scratched up arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!!  Those monsters!\" Teddie gasped, becoming incensed with rage.  \"How dare they even lay a single claw on that precious skin of yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was lucky though, making it in here.  Chie and Yosuke are still dealing with most of them, and Chie's been with me since this all began,\" Yukiko let out a sigh.  \"Oh, Chie, you're probably just as messed up as I am right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie-chan too?\"  Teddie said, his pupils dilated.  \"All caught up with those awful mangy felines?  We need to save her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Yosuke also,\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, him too,\" Teddie said dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko shook her head, yet smiled all the same.  Same old Teddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Teddie said, waddling to the door.  \"Stick behind me, Yuki-chan, I'll be your shield!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't!\" Yukiko shouted suddenly, stopping Teddie in his tracks.  \"I'm still, you know... exposed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Teddie said, obviously thinking nothing was wrong with escorting the young girl half-naked across town back to the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suppressed the urge to smack him upside the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those cats still want me and my fish?\" she continued.  \"Do you really want to risk all those beasts clawing me, scratching me all over to take what's rightfully mine?\" Yukiko said, doing her best to appeal to Teddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Teddie said, pondering.  \"Now that you mention that, that is a problem... Oh, I know!  You can wear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Yukiko was taken aback by Teddie's blunt solution, he put his arms to his head and lifted it off in one swift motion.  As soon as the head disconnected from the neck, the costume collapsed in its shape, draping the smaller dimensions of Teddie's auxiliary human body, a young blonde teenager wearing fancy clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Yukiko said in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go ahead to help Chie-chan,\" Teddie said, shrugging off the costume and setting his bear head down on the floor.  \"A bunch of cats shouldn't be a problem for the great and studly Teddie.  RAWR!\" he roared, charging out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, finally,\" Yukiko sighed, stepping into Teddie's costume.  Fortunately, she and Teddie's human form were around the same height, so the costume was able to fit her with little difficulty.  The only problem was, once again, how to deal with the fish.  Teddie didn't have any pockets large enough to put it into, and she couldn't effectively carry it in her hands... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...There was nothing else for it.  Yukiko set the fish down in the costume, next to her leg.  It felt weird, but it would be the safest place to store it on her way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr would it?  A sudden thought just rang in Yukiko's head.  Thinking back to the summer trip, Teddie, in costume form, had once eaten 11 bowls of ramen, including her own when she wasn't looking, but it had all vanished in just a few hours.  The costume was Teddie's actual body, after all, and since he was talking about eating the fish earlier... she needed something to keep her fish safe in case he got hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing time was of the essence, Yukiko checked the paper towel dispenser.  \"Empty!?  When are these things ever empty?  Rrgh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaper towels weren't an option, and there was no way she was going to use toilet paper to wrap up this precious food.  Seeing no other solution, she took off what was left of her shirt and wrapped the fish inside.  \"There, just good enough,\" she said, satisfied with her work, setting it in Teddie's costume.  As she put it on, she caught glance of her reflection in the mirror, and let out a whine.  She was a wreck, what with her hair all messed up, her clothing reduced to just her underwear and bag, and her only other coverage being a lifetime supply of cat scratches along her arms and legs.  \"Stay strong Yukiko, you can get through this,\" she said as she put on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing Teddie was very... strange.  Though the material didn't feel very thick on the outside, inside it was quite warm, despite her lack of proper clothing. Maybe the costume still indeed functioned as Teddie's main body even when he was outside it.  Yukiko quickly banished that thought away before she completely grossed herself out.  As for sight, she could actually see pretty well in front of her, despite Teddie's eyes being fairly spaced apart.  Another thing to not think too much on, she noted.  As for getting around, her movement was hampered a bit, even if the fish wasn't resting alongside her leg.  After a few paces to get used to the costume, Yukiko slowly pushed the door open and walked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko!\" a shout and hug instantly greeted her.  \"Just where he said you'd be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie!?\" Yukiko gasped in response, nearly thrown off-balance by Chie's tackle.  Chie was a bit worse for wear, her tracksuit looking more like a vest, now torn along the front and hanging open, and her shirt underneath had taken some damage as well, but her shorts and everything else was just as fine as before; far better than Yukiko's current situation, the more-naked girl noted with some jealousy.  \"Where's Yosuke and Teddie?  And the cats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, it was brutal,\" said Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" said Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  No, not the fight,\" Chie backpedaled. \"We took care of the cats easily enough, even if we got messed up a bit during the fight, but right as we got done chasing them out the stairs, Teddie comes charging in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm, that sounds about right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, he thought he was going to be a hero and save us with his big entrance.  But not only was he too late, Yosuke then tore into him for slacking off for the past 3 hours, forcing him to do all the work and being forced to deal with this catastrophe by himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catastrophe?\" Yukiko repeated Chie's unintentional pun, barely suppressing her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so now he and Teddie are off doing damage control upstairs.  I do not envy either of them right now, especially Teddie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... we really shouldn't have come here,\" Yukiko winced in sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shit happens,\" Chie shrugged. \"I'm just glad Teddie gave you something so that you wouldn't be walking home in your underwear.  He better not have perved on you too hard in there, or else-!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah-what?\" Yukiko gasped.  \"You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those cats were fierce,\" Chie said, looking awkwardly aside.  \"It happened right as we helped you get onto this floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Yosuke also...\" Yukiko said.  Chie couldn't see it, but Yukiko's face was as red as her flame skills.  \"You're right,\" Yukiko said sternly.  \"Those two should be just fine.  Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Yukiko and Chie made their way out the other side of Junes and back onto the streets.  It was now fully nightime, the only lights coming from streetlamps, the moon, and the stars.  They were nervous walking the darkened pathways, dreading the possibility of another attack, but not a single sight nor sound of cat was to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whooo...\" Chie sighed.  \"The inn's only a couple streets away.  Looks like we're finally in the clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Yukiko agreed.  There was still cooking the fish and seeing how it would work, but that would be a trial for another day.  This ordeal was nearly finished.  She was especially grateful for this stroke of good luck.  She felt like thanking Teddie for this later, especially in lending her himself.  Unfortunately, any notions of thanking Teddie for the use of his body were about to go up in smoke, as it was about to cause a problem of its own, despite them being so close to safety.  As they turned the next street corner-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukiko ran up the steps of the small shrine next to the old town shopping district. The last golden blot of sunlight was fading over the horizon, and the shadows of twilight clustered tightly around the stone statutes and wooden structures. The place felt silence and empty, and the stillness made Yukiko's footsteps on the hard stone pathway seems especially loud in contrast. The shrine had long since been abandoned by any formal caretaker, and it showed in the faded paint and crumbling facades of the building and surrounding hillside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko took in a breath as she moved deeper into the shrine. During the day she loved to come here to be by herself or pray to the local kami. She also visited the shrine at night, but for entirely different reasons. Most people, including Yu Narukami, had to work up their courage to come to the place in the dark. It looked far too much like the setting for any number of horror stories, and local superstition warned that kami or other shinto spirits liked to abduct anyone who trespassed in a sacred space such as this. But Yukiko had become rather fearless of such things. She had a passion for fairy tails and ghost stories, and indeed there was a time when she would have welcomed the intervention of a god to spirit her away from her mundane life. That particular wish had blessed died in recent months thanks to her shadow, but it had been replaced with an even more fearless attitude towards the place. After all, any space in which the supernatural could manifest to threaten her was also a space in which her other half could turn it to cinders. Or so her reasoning went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, hundreds of cats biting and clawing at her was another matter entirely! The cats had backed off when she began running for the shrine, but they hadn't exactly disbursed. As Yukiko took a moment to catch her breath, she could hear them at the bottom of the hill. Some were soft mews almost like a whisper, while some were loud yawls that rang through the night. What she was certain of was that they were getting closer, and louder, and more numerous. Her heart was pounding as she imagined every feline in Inaba slowly gathering around the edges of the shrine. Despite herself Yukiko shivered. A fog had been threatening all afternoon. Now the infamous mists of Inaba seemed to be thickening, rising in perfect time to the sun's departure. And as the shrine became a tiny island surrounded by an ocean of vapor, the screams of the cats grew more and more frenzied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko looked left and right. If the cats decided to advance, she had no means of escape. She clutched her fish to herself tightly. Her heart was beating faster and faster. The sounds of cats seemed to whirl around her like a hurricane. She trembled slightly, expecting any moment for the legion of cats to emerge from the mist and vent their wrath upon her. She was so on edge that the sight of the woman in the white kimono inspired a little shriek from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, young lady. Are you all right? You seem rather anxious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" Yukiko stammered in confusion, suddenly realizing that the cats had abruptly fallen silent. \"Who....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a new round of yawls and screeches erupted from the shrine entrance. And above the din an energetic series of grunts, screams and 'hai-yas' echoed through the night. From the mist emerged a silhouette. Yukiko barely recognized Chie. Her clothes were a chaotic mass of shredded cloth, covered with dirt and splashed with blood, her arms and legs covered with nasty scratches. Given the atmosphere, she could easily have been mistaken for an oni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie!\" Yukiko said, rushing to her friend's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yukiko....\" Chie said, wobbling on her feet and sporting a listless smile. \"Glad your safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo saying, the brown haired girl practically collapse to the ground. Yukiko awkwardly caught her, forcing both girls to their knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie! No! Oh, why did I leave you behind? Your bleeding! All because of this stupid fish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Don't...don't say stuff like that.\" Chie said, swaying in her arms. \"You..worked hard to get that fish, right? You jumped right in and took it back from all those furballs. I can't just stand around and...let something important to you go undefended! Even as...useless as I am...I can still do that much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Yukiko chided, her voice full of worry. \"I didn't want anything like this to happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Is nuthing. This...is what the hero...does when...the mob goes after the girl.\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie...\" Yukiko began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" The woman in the kimono said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, yes! C-can you please call an ambulance? My friend was attacked by wild animals! They could have carried a disease!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't help with that.\" The woman said softly. \"Perhaps you should ask the fox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...OH! Yes! The leaves! Thank you so much-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before that....would you mind sparing some food? My children are hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the wind the cats began to scream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I...I'm sorry to hear that. All I have is this fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As luck would have it, my children only eat fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cats were growing louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko...who is this lady?\" Chie asked, blinking heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm...I've seen her in the shrine from time to time. She comes here at night. I..I'm sorry ma'am, but I don't know your name.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very few people do.\" The woman said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...wait...I've heard rumors about this...\" Chie said vaguely. \"Aren't you...supposed to be a ghost or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in white laughed. \"Some would say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...and Yu said something about this too...that when he gave you fish more cats started to appear around town. Does...that make you some kind of cat spirit??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is another rumor, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or...are you really the fox? Are you a kitsune?\" Chie continued to babble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Or maybe I'm just an ordinary woman wanting to feed her children. It all depends on what you want to believe.\" The woman in white said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The authors personally believes that it is damned annoying that Golden doesn't bother to explain what the hell is up with this chick, thus forcing him to remain vague on the subject and toss off some of his personal theories. Anyway...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...well whoever you are, you leave Yukiko's fish alone! She went through a lot of trouble to get that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cacophony of cats erupted all around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain that's your answer?\" The woman asked with a thin smile.</span></div></div>",

What was that about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA high pitched yip pierced the night. The pair looked towards the shrine the center of the grounds. On top of the building a four legged figure surveyed the pair. Yukiko gasped as the fox leapt off the roof, flipping over in mid-air and landing directly next to the two girls. Yukiko continued to gape in stunned silence as the fox looked at her expectantly. Remembering herself, she quickly shut her mouth and hastily bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! Can we please use some of your leaves?

Did she really just volunteer to strip off all of her clothes in the middle of town? The shrine was often deserted, but the shopping district was practically the center of activity for the region (loss of business to Junes aside). How would she get back to the Inn without being seen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox continued to look at her expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing in a breath, Yukiko started to unbutton what pieces of her clothing remained undamaged by the host of felines. Her red shirt fell away to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, Yukiko....\" Chie began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay, Chie. You got scratched up because of me, remember? I'll just borrow your jacket and skirt.\" Yukiko said, trying to reassure herself as much as Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing?\" Chie said, raising up her jacket, which had become riddled with claw marks and gashes. \"And the skirt...I'm not sure I can call it that anymore. Maybe a 'belt'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its foggy. No one will see us if we're careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Chie stopped as Yukiko removed her undershirt. The lacy red thing Yukiko used as a bra filled out her large milky breasts very nicely. Chie gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, you were hurt for my sake. Again. Please let me do something to make amends!\" Yukiko said, unhooking her bra and allowing her beautiful orbs to bounce free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie stuttered out something she intended to be a protest, but the words lost any sense of coherence on the way past her lips. Even in the darkness of early night Yukiko\u2019s half naked body stood out clearly in the moonlight. Her breasts were large, the pink nipples rising prominently and standing out in bluish light, swaying slightly as she moved.  Her skin looked so soft, her curves well rounded and feminine with enough fat to make her flesh bounce slightly as she worked. Chie\u2019s shadow had rather gleefully explained how jealous of her friends Chie secretly was. And while she was trying to overcome that feeling, watching the girl sway in the moonlight was a definite reminder of WHY she envied her so much. Little exercise, yet she stayed thin, somehow keeping that perfect balance to be soft and cute without being overweight. Chie just wanted to grab hold of her and squeeze her like a teddie bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie closed her eyes, sucked in a breath, and begged her stupid head to stop that line of thinking. This situation was bad enough without getting all pervy. Yukiko was doing this for her sake, and all because she had been too useless to take out a few stray cats!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat bitter thought said, Chie opened her eyes\u2026Just in time to see Yukiko with her back turned towards her an her skirt dropping. Her panties were sheer, red, and almost see through. And then she hooked her thumbs into the waste band, bent over and pushed her pnties off, revealing her round, bouncy butt. And then she turned to the stockings, bending over even further as she rolled them down her legs, revealing her shaven pussy lips in the process. And thus it was that Chie\u2019s brain stopped working all together as she stared like a deer in headlights at her friend\u2019s naked glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko stared down at the pile of clothes at her feet, then at her entirely exposed body. Hiding what she could of her large large breasts and exposed sex with her hands, she stood there blushing and slightly bewildered with her heart pounding. Everything had become so surreal, yet the reality of finding herself naked in public all too clear and immense! Then, as if in slow motion, she raised one bare foot and stepped softly away from her garments and nodded to the fox. Without preamble the beast quickly and expertly gathered the tattered remains of the clothes into its jaws and scampered away. Yukiko stood there a long and tense moment, a little cold and very aware of her nakedness in the unfolding silence. Moments later, a blur of fur darted out of the darkness between the two girls and deposited a particularly large supply of leaves between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you very much!\" Yukiko said, impulsively bowing in gratitude, her hands falling to her hips and her large jutting out in front of her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe fox gave a friendly 'yip' before returning to wherever place it called home within the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-so\u2026.\u201d Chie said at last, reminding herself not to stare at her best friend\u2026and completely ignoring her own advice. \u201cN-now what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well\u2026.\u201d Yukiko said softly. \u201cI think\u2026now we treat our wounds with the leaves. So\u2026if you\u2019ll\u2026umm\u2026take off your clothes\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-wha-whaaaaat?\u201d Chie said in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour cut all over! It\u2019s the easiest way to apply the leaves. And once we\u2019re done, we can\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko winced a little. \u201cDivide up it all between us so we\u2019re both covered\u2026at least a little.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There's no way I'm agreeing to this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wounds are too bad.  There's no way you'd make it home like this.  I've thought it over some more and, well, we need the leaves, Chie,\" Yukiko pleaded, but was looking off to the side nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we don't!  I can make it home like this just fine, see?\" Chie walked forward, only to fall thanks to her injured leg.  \"Aagh!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie,\" said Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, I'm fine!\" Chie said stubbornly, looking up towards Yukiko.  \"I'll just need you to help me along to my place.  Or I can just stay here and you can get some money to pay the fox and patch me up.  The cats are gone so, there's no need to be so hasty.  Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Chie,\" Yukiko shook her head.  \"But I can't leave you here with injuries that severe.  Even with those cats gone, you can't even walk straight any more.  What if something else attacks while you're like this, here or on the way to your house?  It's too risky.  I don't know what I'd do if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop feeding me bullshit!\" Chie snarled.  \"You could just use your clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've thought it through, and the best option is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To throw your best friend under the bus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie!\" Yukiko shouted, finally looking directly at Chie.  \"Please... trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Yukiko's plea fell on deaf ears.  Chie spat at Yukiko, causing her to flinch back, and turned herself around with her arms.  \"I can't believe this.  I'm going home.  Both you and that fox can just fuck off!\" she yelled, slowly crawling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but you don't have a choice, Chie,\" Yukiko said somberly, walking over to her helpless friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko first grabbed Chie's skirt, quickly tugging it down Chie's hips and off her legs before she could react.  The garment came off effortlessly, so frayed and worn that it had nearly been destroyed already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Chie gasped, feeling the cloth leaving her legs.  Without a word, she rolled to her side and tried to stand up, but her leg impeded her yet again.  Yukiko, in response, pushed her over, knocking Chie onto her back, and straddled the weakened warrior as she went to work removing her shoes and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko!  You're really-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't struggle, Chie,\" Yukiko interrupted, swivelling around and pulling up Chie's already torn-open tracksuit jacket over her arms and off her body.  \"It will all be over soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie responded with grunts, yells, and attempts at bucking Yukiko off of her.  So shocked she was that she didn't even think of responding with her arms until her jacket was gone. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko then reached toward's Chie's school blouse.  The school uniform piece, normally white, was stained red in several places, punctuated with teeth and claw marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie, unable to dislodge Yukiko, tried to force away her hands, but the fighting had taken its toll on her.  Yukiko's arms would not budge as they pulled the material further and further up Chie's body.  \"Yukiko, please.  Stop this,\" Chie begged, tears flowing freely, her battered hands clawing feebly at Yukiko's wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko remained silent, her gaze focused only on her task.  She released the cloth, only to force Chie's arms behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie shook and went limp, turning her head to the side and crying, eyes closed as Yukiko removed her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko then lifted herself off of Chie and backed up, pulling Chie's shorts down off her legs.  Chie offered no resistance at this point, even when Yukiko lifted her legs to get the shorts out from under her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko added Chie's shorts to the pile of clothing she had made and looked at the fox.  The fox walked over to the pile, seeming to be inspecting the clothes within.  Soon enough, it turned up towards Yukiko, let out a bark, and turned towards Chie again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, it looks like it wants... everything,\" Yukiko said, hesitating slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie opened her eyes, eyelids all red from her crying.  She uttered just one word, \"Fine,\" and then closed her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko, turned back towards Chie.  With most of her clothes off, Yukiko was able to see just how badly Chie was damaged from the fight, not that the state of her clothes wasn't already a good hint.  Bloody red lines covered her torso in addition to her arms and legs.  In addition to the bleeding, there were also several areas of Chie's flesh that had been badly bruised.  The nastiest one in particular was along her right calf, likely the cause of her limp.  Yukiko bit her lip, taking all this carnage in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yip,\" went the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminded that she shouldn't keep customers waiting, Yukiko began with Chie's sports bra, thankfully covered only in sweat and not blood or dirt.  Pulling it  off exposed Chie's firm breasts, which Yukiko tried not to stare at.  Throwing the bra onto the pile, Yukiko looked ot the fox, who just looked back at her expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko sighed and grabbed Chie's panties, turning away as she pulled them off to try and afford her friend at least a little modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the panties on top of the pile, the fox sniffed at it once more, then turned towards Chie, examining her body and injuries intently.  It then reached into its bib with its mouth and brought forth a few of the precious leaves, setting them on Chie's most severe injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox then let out a great howl before walking back to Chie's clothes, gathering them all up in its mouth, and finally leaping to roof of the shrine in a great leap, quickly disappearing from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Chie groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko turned around to see Chie sitting up facing her, rubbing her eyes.  As she was competely naked, Yukiko could see that the leaves had already worked their magic: the nasty bruises were fading back to Chie's normal skin tone, and it was likely that the bleeding had stopped too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie!\" Yukiko said, smiling with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie, her expression crestfallen, turned away from Yukiko, curled up and hunched over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie,\" Yukiko began.  \"I'm sorry, I-I just didn't know what else to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I had to do something.  Look how easily I kept you down.  You needed that healing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Chie finally spoke, bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, understand, Chie.  I was doing what any friend would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Chie scoffed.  \"Throwing around that work like you know what it means.  I can't believe you Yukiko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we really friends?\" Chie shouted, getting worked up again, but still not facing Yukiko.  \"We put in so much work to get that fish together, all to help <i>your</i> cooking, then I get seriously hurt protecting you from those mangy felines, only to have you throw it all away at the end, nullifying everything I've suffered through for you, like it meant nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie,\" Yukiko tried to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then,\" Chie continued. \"When I needed your help so badly, you instead kick me down even further!  Do you really care about me, or is it just convenience that makes me your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie! Let me explain, dammit!\" Yukiko snapped.  \"You want to know why I used your clothes to buy the leaves?  This is why!\" Yukiko shouted, reaching over Chie and dropping something in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Chie said, looking at the bundle of cloth.  Eyes going wide, she stood up and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko stood before Chie entirely naked, her skin appearing paler than usual in the night air.  Her face was scrunched up, only barely holding back tears during Chie's rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko,\" Chie whimpered, sniffling once more, and would have cried anew had she not already dried herself out.  \"Yukiko!\" she shouted, dropping the clothes and embracing Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie,\" Yukiko replied, now openly crying herself and returning the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was your plan all along?  But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your clothes were completely wrecked.  I knew if I gave mine up, you would try and share yours with me, but they were so far gone that they would have ended up falling apart on the way back, leaving us both mostly naked.  This way, you'll at least be coveredt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't tell me because?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the fox knew it was getting the raw end of the deal, it might have increased the price.  Oh, Chie, I'm so sorry for all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko.  Oh, Yukiko,\" Chie said, smiling once more, looking Yukiko straight in the eyes.  \"Don't worry about it.  Now I can't believe I thought you actually betrayed me.  Some friend I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some friend I am!\" Yukiko repeated.  \"Now, how about you get dressed and let's head back home, it's been a long day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it,\" Chie replied.  \"Wait, I just noticed.  If you're naked, that means your underwear's here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Uh, um...\" Yukiko stuttered, blushing red.  \"I must have put those in there accidentally while I was taking off everything to even things out with you.  Just wanted to keep everything together.  I'd like those back now, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, sure,\" Chie grinned.  \"But are you really okay heading back in just that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been through much worse,\" Yukiko shrugged.  \"I can handle a little embarrassment if it comes to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls then made to get dressed, and-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With no further issues, the girls divided Yukiko's clothes between themselves.  Left with just her red-colored set of underwear, Yukiko felt exposed and chilled in the night air.  Though it was an improvement over walking back naked, she couldn't help but feel a little strange.  As for Chie, having put on Yukiko's skirt and shirt, she seemed to be mulling over what to do with the sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was deciding, the weather began to change again, the fog slowly pulling away raindrops began to trickle down from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez!  Really?  Can't you cut us a break, weather?\" Chie grumbled, as she pulled the sweater over her top, and held her hands down the front of the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Yukiko gasped.  \"So that's what that was about.  Sorry, Chie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Chie answered.  \"Oh!  No, no, no, it's fine!  It's only a problem if I kick or something.  Let's just get home already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, after making sure she picked up her bag, Yukiko followed Chie out of the shrine into the rainy shopping district.  Taking the north exit and looping around as to avoid late-night customers and traffic, the two ran through the rain, eager to get back to warmth and safety.  But it was a long ways back to the inn, and the girls were already tired from earlier, forcing them to dial it back down to a walk on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brr!\" Chie shivered.  \"From deadly cats to pervy foxes and now this.  What a night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No kidding,\" Yukiko agreed, teeth chattering.  \"And all I wanted was some rare fish to cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a shame we had to give it up... Sorry, Yukiko,\" Chie said glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine, Chie.  I'm just glad we made it out in one piece,\" said Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but... If only I was just a little stronger!\" Chie said, clenching her fists. \"I, I just, after all we've been through... we deserve a little more than escaping with just the clothes on our backs.  Or, well, your back, heheh,\" she said uneasily, trying to lighten the mood after her outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Yukiko agreed, staring off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were passing by the Samegawa flood plain again, right by the steps to the riverbank now.  To think, it all started there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie,\" Yukiko said, suddenly enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Chie replied, turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have to be all for nothing!\" Yukiko said, beaming as she began digging through her bag again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't mean?\" Chie asked, filled with sudden dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've still got my rod and some bait,\" Yukiko said, pulling out her fishing gear.  \"We can still pull this off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Chie gasped.  \"Right here?  Right now?  In this mess!?\" she gestured at the rain currently soaking them to their bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rare fish may be more easily caught during the rain,\" Yukiko continued.   \"The old man said so himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy?  He did?\" Chie asked. \"I kinda droned off partway through... but what if more cats come again?  I wouldn't be surprised if they just ignored this rain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After taking our other fish?  No way,\" Yukiko said calmly. \"And if they do, then I'll give that lady a piece of my mind about how she's starving her cats and relying on stealing other people's food just to feed them.  If she wants fish so badly she should fish for them themselves, and if they have a problem with it they can deal with both of us, not just you.  No mangy felines are a match for the two of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of what Yukiko said was sheer bravado, but she meant every word.  She knew that giving up the fish and making Chie's struggle pointless really hurt her, and while she couldn't get that back or get revenge against those cats, maybe salvaging this evening would be worth it for the disheartened martial artist.  And helping Chie out of her funk would be worth it, even if it meant freezing her butt off in this downpour.  It didn't help that by now her underwear was completely soaked and was starting to cling uncomfortably to her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie stared at Yukiko, and looked down to the river bank and then back to her.  Taking a deep breath, Chie let out a huge sigh and said-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Chie said those words, she honestly could think of several ways on how the situation could get worse than it already has.  With all that had gone wrong today, it was all but guaranteed that something else would happen if they continued on this path.  It was a trap as obvious as those she had seen in her favorite Kung-Fu movies time and time again.  The odds stacked against the hero, at the mercy of the villain and their superior forces in an area of their choosing, knowing that they may not make it out alive.  And yet... the hero would always walk into them, because whether it was to save a friend, protect their village, or just because of their code of honor, not doing so was simply unthinkable.  And looking into Yukiko's eyes, Chie could see them burning with determination.  It was clear that Yukiko wasn't going to give up until she had given it all she got.  This was now one of those situations.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie wanted to tell her it was alright and that they should just head home but... damnit, Yukiko was right!  She really didn't want to give up, and really only was thinking of it because of the whole clothing issue.  It totally wasn't fair what happened to them, and she was furious that she was bested by a bunch of mangy felines!  And hell, if Yukiko could continue to be out here like that, then what kind of friend was she if she left her hanging?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Chie said, \"What's the worst that could happen?  Let's do it,\" and the pair eagerly made their way down to the riverbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as Chie was suspecting, luck wasn't really on their side.  Even though Yukiko was sure that there'd be more fish due to the rain, they weren't having any luck.  Something kept knocking their bait off the hook, either it was due to increased currents in the storm, or perhaps the fish were getting better at stealing Yukiko's bait.  Either way, they were down to their last one soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-This is it, Ch-Chie,\" Yukiko said, her teeth chattering as she put on the last of her bait. \"The last one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  You've got this, Yukiko, just give it everything you got!\" Chie encouraged her.  She hoped she wasn't accidentally putting to much strain on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Yukiko said, taking a deep breath, reaching her cast back, and then waving her rod back and forth like a baton, while hopping from foot to foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-!?  What are you doing?\" Chie gasped, ducking as the hook flew to Yukiko's wild swings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this?\"  Yukiko asked, while continuing her weird dance.  \"I saw something like this on TV once.  To make the fish get caught more easily, the fisherman would wave the rod a certain way before casting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you hear that!?  Some kind of anime?\" Chie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Yukiko matter-of-factly.  \"But all fiction is rooted in truth right?  Can't hurt to try at least, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does if you fall in or poke an eye out!\" Chie shouted.  <i>Damn it, I need to stop this now before she slips or something!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Chie was too late.  As she stepped forward, Yukiko's new gimmick caused something to happen all right, something bad.  As a result of her uncontrolled flailing-</span></div></div>",

She was going to end this now.  All she knew, and all she needed to know, was that the hook had gotten caught on something; so she needed to get it unstuck.  With the storm raging around her, the wind whipping at her hair, and the rain freezing every inch of her body, only the adrenaline pumping through her body and singlemindedly focusing on her goal kept her from breaking down into a shivering, sneezing heap and giving up for the night.  So, energized as she was, instead of doing the safe and logical option of stopping and letting Chie work the hook free, she just kept pulling harder and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what she didn't know, and what Chie was trying to tell her, was that the hook had whipped around and gotten itself snagged in their clothes, specifically:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Yukiko launched her line into the river she was confused, as she had felt a sudden release of tightness around her upper chest area.  She then noticed a thicker line trailing through the air around where her fishing hook was, flapping in the wind as it flew into the river, which puzzled her even further as she knew she didn't have any fishing lures to go on the hook along with the bait.  Then she felt Chie's hands clasp over her breasts, and she knew that something was very wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHIE!?\" Yukiko gasped.  \"What are you doing!?  Why are you grabbing my b-!\" she paused, and her jaw began to drop as she realized there was a distinct lack of bra between Chie's hands and her own body.  \"OH NO!\" she shrieked, nearly dropping the rod in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!  Careful!\" Chie shouted, releasing Yukiko to help catch the rod, then sighing in relief when she saw that her friend had managed to hold on to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. how...?\" Yukiko muttered, staring down, flabbergasted as she tried to process her topless state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko, that weird waving you were doing caused you to hook your own bra!  But the good thing is that if it's still on the hook, we should be able to reel it in!  Now, focus!\" Chie yelled, bringing Yukiko back to attention before latching her hands onto her friend's exposed breasts once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie? Ngh...\" Yukiko gasped once again, though not as shocked and surprised as she was the first time.  \"I-I understand now, but, why are you, um, grabbing me there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?  Isn't it obvious?\" Chie said, taken aback.  \"Just because it's raining doesn't mean no one's outside!  Your arms are tied up and I can't get dive in to get your bra back myself; not in this time or weather anyway.  So I'm covering for you until you can reel it in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, mmph... Chie,\" Yukiko grunted, her voice strained.  \"You're kinda... squeezing me pretty tightly there, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" went Chie, as she slowly turned to Yukiko, actually bringing herself to look squarely at her for the first time after her unintentional disrobing.  Yukiko's face was scrunched up in a nervous, wincing expression, with a soft look in her eyes and a red flush across her cheeks.  Nervously keeping her breath in check, Chie peered over Yukiko's shoulder and saw that her hands weren't just covering Yukiko's chest, but nearly flattening them under her grip.  In that moment, Chie could swear she could feel Yukiko's heartbeat along part of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWAH!\" Chie gasped, releasing her grip entirely, allowing Yukiko to breathe easily once again.  \"Sorry, sorry, sorry!\" she apologized, bringing her hands back away from Yukiko, opening and closing them as if she was in a state of disbelief at what she had been doing.  \"I-I panicked!  Didn't mean to go that far, you know?\" said Chie, speaking more and more quickly, trying to save face.  \"It's just, someone seeing you like this now would be the absolute worst, after all that's happened tonight.  But I totally didn't mean to be creepy or anything!  Just was trying to do what any good friend would and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, it's okay,\" Yukiko said, much more calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind loudly roared around them, reminding Yukiko she needed to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  I said it's okay!\"  Yukiko shouted back.  \"Please, go back to covering me!  Just... not so tight this time, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Chie's turn to blush.  \"Yukiko!?  O-Okay,\" Chie replied, standing behind Yukiko and covering her up with her hands once more, setting them in place this time instead of pushing in.  \"N-Now, let's hurry up and reel it in!\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko, nodded, and began to reel in quickly, which by now meant pulling the line back from downstream.  She hoped that her bra was still there and not lost to the elements yet, as even though it would be completely soaked now, it was still better than nothing.  She couldn't very well walk back home topless, even with Chie providing coverage for her.  Although, she couldn't deny that Chie's hands felt very warm and comforting, and was partly why she let her touch her to cover her again.  especially now that she wasn't squeezing out of reflex, (which where Chie was concerned meant \"death grip\".)  Although Chie being so warm likely also meant that she herself was getting too cold.  Since Chie was also exposed to the same elements she was, it meant that if Chie was like a warm fireplace to Yukiko, Yukiko herself was closer in body temperature to a zombie or some other undead creature.  It was clear that she should hurry and finish this before they both got sick or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the line almost reeled in, just 10 feet away from the dock, there was a sudden resistance on the line.  Yukiko and Chie shared a nervous look before looking back to the river.  The same unspoken question was on their minds.  \"Did they finally get a bite?\"  They stood at the ready, and Yukiko moved the rod to hook the possible fish.

I feel like we've been at this for hours!\" Chie shouted back.  She herself wasn't in a good position, being fully extended forward in a near-dive to save Yukiko left her using her legs and feet to hang on to the dock.  There was no way she could cover Yukiko like this, so she hoped that it would end soon; not to mention all the rain and wind going on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the fish wasn't coming in easily.  \"Ergh... Come on, you big, stupid, fish!\" Yukiko grunted, trying to force the fish closer by jerking the rod back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Careful, Yukiko!\" Chie gasped.  \"I'm starting to-AH!\" she screamed, as her feet slipped forward, jostled by Yukiko's motions.  The good news was that, by digging her toes in, she managed to stop herself again before Yukiko fell over the dock.  The bad news was that she was extended further, and lower than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, what's going on?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing!  Just keep at it!\" Chie shouted.  When Chie slipped forward, she ended up falling down Yukiko's legs, and taking her panties with them!  She was still holding strong at the knees, but who knew how long that would last?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr...\" Yukiko growled.  She may had only started fishing today, but she had never faced a fish this intense before!  She could feel herself nearing the end of her rope, but still, she wasn't going to lose!  \"YAAAHHH!\" she roared, leaning back in one great heap, finally pulling the fish out of the water.  The fish sprang out and slapped into Yukiko, sending her sprawling back over Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" they grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got you, I've got you!\"  Yukiko shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie rolled over and sat up, and bore witness to Yukiko wrestling with a massive fish on the dock.  It was nothing like she had ever seen, partly due to the fish's massive size and partly due to seeing Yukiko stark naked for the second time that night.  \"Oh, shit...\" Chie swore, seeing that the panties she had inadventently slipped off while Yukiko fell over her were nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie!  Chie!  We did it!\" Yukiko cheered, standing with the calmed-down fish held in front of her.  \"We caught the fish!  Oh!  And the storm's dying down too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!  That's... great...\" Chie said, looking awkwardly at Yukiko. as the rain and wind died down to nothing around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Chie?  Aren't you proud of us?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am but...\" Chie said hesitantly.  \"I don't... see your bra on that fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OH!  Right, heheh...\" Yukiko chuckled nervously.  \"I, um, guess it got washed away.  Well, nothing to do about that but-\" she then positioned the fish horizontally across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki-!  Oh man...\" Chie sighed.  \"And then there's the other thing.  I kinda... accidentally pulled off your, um... in that last struggle...\" she pointed down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko, confused, followed Chie's finger and saw nothing where her panties should've been.  She flushed red, realizing she unknowingly flashed her crotch to Chie.  \"Oh no!\" Yukiko shouted, re-orienting the fish vertically and squeezing it with her arms.  \"How are we going to make it back now?\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, maybe I can help with that?\" said a voice behind Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko slowly turned around, with Chie peering over to the side.  Standing there, fishing rod in hand, was Yu Narukami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHA-!?  YU?\" Chie shrieked, shoving past Yukiko to shout in Yu's face.  \"How long have you been there, huh!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Yukiko squeaked, nearly losing grip of the fish as it fell away from her for a moment, revealing her naked front for a split second.  She fervently hoped that Chie had distracted him for that little bit.  She also hoped that this was all a dream, but she knew it wasn't.  Luchador masks were usually involved with dreaming, which was weird since she didn't even watch wrestling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got here, it was pretty dark so I only just saw your sihlouettes until just now!\" Yu said a bit of franticness in his usual composed manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Chie asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Yu said, now with a bit of nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reeeallly?\" Chie asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he didn't see anything, then he didn't see anything!  Right?\" Yukiko shouted, face as red as her hairband, the only thing left on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Yu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Chie sighed.  \"But, what the heck are you doing out here at this time of night!?\" Chie shouted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fishing.  Same as you, I believe?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yeah... didn't you say something about that earlier today, Yukiko?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, yeah, I did...\" Yukiko answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll just be on our way, so you have at it,\" Chie said, tugging Yukiko along as they strafed around him, keeping Yukiko's nudity hidden by the fish as best they could.  They trusted Yu well enough, but there was no reason to show him anything he didn't need to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I came for that fish,\" Yu said, pointing at the fish Yukiko was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, suuuurrrrre you did,\" Chie said, giving him a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious!  That's the Guardian of the Samegawa River.\"  Yu explained.  \"Someone's been wanting to see that fish for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that would explain why it was so hard to catch...\" said Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?  Seriously?\" Chie asked, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you, and I'm sure that's very nice of you,\" said Yukiko.  \"But, as you can probably tell, I'm somewhat... compromised right now.  Even if I wanted to, I can't just, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you need to do is ask,\" Yu smirked in a friendly way, taking off his jacket and extending it towards Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you!\" Yukiko said, beginning to hand the fish over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Careful!\" Chie interjected in the nick of time.  \"I'll just hand Yukiko the jacket first, oka-YYYY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guardian chose just then to get its second wind.  Wiggling back and forth, it smacked its tail fin at Chie kicking up the ragged skirt she was wearing and knocking it down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" Chie gasped, clasping her hands down below just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm losing it!\" Yukiko shouted, stumbling near the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" Yu shouted, dropping the jacket and rushing in, grabbing onto the frenzied fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now hang on!\" Yukiko yelled, letting go of the Guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko?\" Yu gasped, now struggling with the full power of the fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this!\" she shouted, winding up and punching at the fish, hitting it right in the gills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's working!\" Yu said, knocked back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then here's some more!\" Yukiko said, continuing her assault, punching again and again until the fish calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!  You did it, Yukiko!  That was great...\" Yu drew off, realizing what he was now properly looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  Hold still!  I think it's still moving!\" Yukiko shouted as she decked Yu right between the eyes.  She realized it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko!\" Chie gasped, having finally gotten her skirt around her waist again.  \"What happened?\" she asked, seeing Yu collapsed with the fish in his arms, and her friend standing before them, still naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all taken care of,\" Yukiko said matter-of-factly as she picked up Yu's jacket and put it on.  Fortunately, it was enough to cover her enough in both front and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... the fish?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the fish?\" Yukiko asked, the meaning clearly present in her tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, gotcha,\" Chie nodded.  \"Let's head back while people are still inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two barely dressed girls headed off the river and back to their homes, the old fishing man, who witnessed the whole thing, walked up to the unconscious Yu, and took the Guardian off his body.  Putting a note of thanks in Yu's pants pocket, he began to whistle as he walked away.  \"Never thought I'd get my wish fulfilled with a show like that,\" he said.  \"That shrine sure is something!\"</span></div></div>",

The week had been long and hard, but the opportunity to lie naked in a pool of steaming water made it all better. She imagined all her troubles melting away along with the dirt and grime. All her misgivings about inheriting the Inn seemed so silly in these moments. Surely any price was worth paying for the simple bliss of this bath underneath the stars?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts turned to the events earlier in the week. A news crew had been trying off and on for months now to do a story on the Inn. At first they had been politely refused, her mother had certain misgivings about their \"news of the weird\" program and associating the Inn with the murders and possibly ghosts in the area. Later the crew portrayed themselves as a more reputable outlet and tried to film the story AGAIN. They even had the nerve to suggest filming Yukiko in the bath to boost ratings. Now there were rumors circulating that they were back in town for a third attempt. Despite threatening to complain to their sponsors, the producer seemed obsessed with getting an exclusive. Yukiko's firm rejection must have hit a nerve with the petty little TV exec. But despite the rumors nothing had come of it, much to her relief. Still, no sense in risking bad publicity. Yukiko and the staff had all voluntarily worked extra hard to keep the place neat and tidy. A lot of work, but worth the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven haired beauty emerged from the pool. She was a sight to see, with a slender naked body, long legs, and large breasts. Her hard work and a strict diet kept her thin, though unlike Chie she seldom worked out and thus boasted bouncier butt and shaplier curves than her friend. After drying off she decided to retire for the evening. Alas for poor Yukiko...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukiko was humming to herself as trotted up to the small wooden aisle that held her clothes. Her large breasts swayed gently as she half-skipped to where her garments should be, her mood sky high after the relaxing bath. That feeling quickly faded as she looked into the box where her clothes had been not half an hour before. Instead, she found a slinky white nightie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's blood ran cold at the sight of it. Not because her other clothes were missing, although it was quite alarming that neither her clothes nor any other garments nor even a spare towel could be found in the area. Not because the nightie had a slit down the middle that would expose an obscene amount of her cleavage yet was so slinky it would at best hide her naked sex and butt cheeks by mere millimeters. Not even because her dripping wet body would surely turn the fabric transparent! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, what was frightening was that she had seen this garment before. Mayumi Yamano had worn this exact variety of slip when the night before she disappeared (only to be found hanging from an antenna, cause of death unknown). Yukiko distinctly remembered seeing it on her, and indeed having to get rid of the item along with several other small pieces of property when it became known that the announcer was dead. What was it doing here? Could it really be a coincidence that such a distinctive piece of underwear could end up here twice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it was not, though not for the reasons Yukiko might imagine. In their own way the tabloid journalists had done an impressive bit of research in locating the skimpiest bit of clothing Yamano had brought to the Inn with her. The underwear Yukiko had found was a painstakingly reproduced replica, rigged with a few extra surprises. The big question was: would Yukiko put it on, or would she listen to her susperstitious instincts and brave the hallways naked rather than risk a ghosts wrath?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One fact that occasionally surprised her friends was how much Yukiko enjoyed ghost stories and folklore. She particularly enjoyed tormenting her friend Chie, a bit of a role reversal from the usually fearless and energetic girl and the more timid Innkeeper. The sad fact was that Yukiko was used to being alone, so the idea that other beings might be there with her unseen was not as frightening as it might be for others. Still, her love of ghost stories made her hesitate. Some of these tales revolved around terrible things happening to the person who ate ghostly food or handled ghostly objects. And yet OTHER stories said failure to follow the prompting of the spirits (and this was either a very obvious prompt or the most elaborate prank she'd ever encountered!) also led to a bad end. Then there were the spirits who acted like tricksters....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, it was a crap shoot. What decided the matter was that Yukiko had absolutely no interest in trotting down the halls of her inn completely naked. So with a blush and a sigh Yukiko put on the tiny slip, covering her private parts that were almost instantly revealed the moment the fabric touched moisture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in charge of this evening's filming, who we shall call Kanshi for lack of a better name, smiled to himself. He was an old hat as at these filmings, and he knew a few things about buildings this old. Research said that Amagi Inn was a several hundred years old at least. One didn't keep a place this large intact for that long without several periods of renovation and restoration. And inevitably, unused rooms were buried or walled off or just plain lost in the act of reconstruction. More rarely but still possible were the old places that had hidden doors and secret observation rooms. Japan had gone through some dark times in its history. The age of warring states was little better than the dark ages of Europe. If you could afford it, having a place to hide away your valuables (and potentially yourselves!) could be the key to your survival when bandits or arrogant nobility came to call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome careful research in Inaba's town records and some secret use of soundwaves to test the building's layout had revealed plenty of examples of both inside the Amagi Inn. Ever so carefully Kanshi had moved his people into the hidden rooms, exploring and \"redecorating\" as they went. They now had an entire base set up here, every room wired with hidden cameras. They had also built \"set pieces\" inside hidden rooms, designed like a funhouse to confuse the senses and terrify the onlookers. There were now dozens of rooms ready for Yukiko to stumble into, each using subtle and overt techniques to confuse her sense of direction and cause her to stumble into places she'd rather avoid. Any noise of construction heard by guests aided their cause as rumors of strange pounding or unseen voices only increased the Inn's reputation as a cursed piece of haunted real estate. All was ready to subject the Amagi girl to hundreds of smoke and mirror tricks designed to horrify her. And, it should be noted, the humiliate her beyond all measure. Yukiko had thrown the gauntlet down and drawn the personal ire of several members of the film crew. They were going to take personal delight in keeping Amagi distressed and underdressed for as long as possibe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yukiko stepped into the hallway...</span></div></div>",

Staring back at her was not her face, but the face of Yamano Mayumi! Her skin was pale and her eyes were dark pits, but Yukiko definitely recognized her! She wore the same flimsy gown as she stared at Yukiko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA celebrity had impersonators. Mayumi was no exception. The studio had been lucky to find an incredibly (eerily so, really) close lookalike. The rest, of course, was just smoke and mirrors.

What on earth was that? What...what was all this smoke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's garment was equipped with a very special function. The fabric was custom made to dissolve completely into a fine mist-like vapor at the touch of a electrical signal from a tiny chip inside the fabric.

Seeing nothing, the Amagi heiress looked down to evaluate her own state and make sure she was unharmed. The raven-haired beauty let out a cry of shock as she clapped one hand over her sex and an arm across her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of her hardened nipples against her arm surprised Yukiko. The inn wasn't that cold, even undressed, and especially so shortly after leaving the warm bathing room. What Yukiko didn't know was that the vapor her body had just been enveloped in had a unique aphrodisiac effect. The arousal would be subtle at first, but the longer Yukiko went without being exposed to the aphrodisiac's solvent would cause the effects to compound exponentially. Simply put, Yukiko would get hornier and hornier as time went on, with no discernible reason why!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, of course, was part of Kanshi's plan. If he was going to release the best episode of his career, he was going to need something big, and the recent scandal with Mayumi Yamano was exactly what he needed! After this episode hit the network (and later the internet, plus sales of the uncensored edition), the \"Yamano Curse\" would be one of the biggest supernatural stories in Japan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Kanshi felt the Amagis should be grateful for his plan. After all, it could do nothing but improve business. A curse that filled young ladies staying at the Inn with insatiable lust? Couples from all over the world would be flocking to the Amagi Inn to have a good time! If anything, he was guaranteeing the Amagi family generations of prosperity! At least that's how he rationalized it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure the cameras are ready to zoom in at a moment's notice. She flashes anything, I want it in frame!\" Kanshi demanded into his headpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it, boss.\" and variations came flooding in over the earpiece, each camera operator prepared should Yukiko wander into their field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see what Little Miss Amagi does next, shall we?\" Kanshi muttered to himself as he watched the quivering girl currently in front of Camera 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Yukiko was horribly confused. A second ago, she was running away from an apparent ghost, and now the flimsy gown she had for cover was just... gone in a puff of smoke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, pull it together, Yukiko. Nobody can see you, this is all just bad luck. Just have to duck into a room and find something to wear before... before I wreck the Amagi reputation.\" Yukiko told herself, trying to figure out where to go next. She knew the layout of the Inn like the back of her hand, and there were a couple options she could try near the springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing her options, Yukiko quickly decided where to go and nervously trotted off to-</span></div></div>",

The girl was stubbornly keeping her front shielded as she ran, but there were a few choice side shots and rear shots providing plenty of quality material.  And, with the special chemical currently coursing through her body, soon enough that shield would soon become an open gateway for them to see her indulging in one of life's most forbidden pleasures.  And once she was vulnerable and occupied, then would come the master stroke.  He shook his head, tucking his fantasies in to the back of his brain.  It would all come to fruition soon enough.  He just needed a little more patience...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the monitors, Kanshi scanned for Yukiko's current location, but couldn't find her.  She had vanished from all the camera feeds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did she go!?\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already on it, sir,\" one of the technicians responded, poring through the previous footage.  \"It looks like... the kitchen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Why there?  Did she suddenly get snack cravings after all this?\" Kanshi asked.  \"Figures she'd go to the one room that was too busy to sneak a camera inside... Hey, that's not a side effect of the gas isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir,\" said the worker he addressed.  \"If it made you hungry as well as horny then there'd be no market for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right, skip the lecture next time, we're on a time table here,\" Kanshi admonished.  \"Now, who've we got closest to the kitchen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be the one in #108, just a couple doors away,\" another worker answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"#108?  Perfect!  Get 'em there with their camera and have the feed patched through to the big screen,\" he ordered.  \"We're going in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Yukiko had already made it to the kitchen and was in the middle of searching the cabinets for an apron, having turned on the lights to help after making sure she was alone in the room.  With dinner having long since finished, the kitchenware had already been cleaned and put away for the night, though the smell of the night's meal still lingered in the air.  It was to that smell that Yukiko attributed the strange headache and warmth in her chest, unaware of Kanshi's crooked scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was sure it was this one... yes!\" Yukiko said to herself, having made her way along the cabinets before finally finding an apron in the leftmost one.  \"It would've been nice if it wasn't the last one, but that's always how it goes isn't it?\" she joked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite being able to make that joke, Yukiko wasn't feeling fine at all.  Her thoughts kept coming back to what was happening to her right now, and Mayumi Yamano.  That slip from before, the one that instantly vanished from her body, was one thing.  It can't have been the original article, she disposed of it herself, so maybe it could have been a copy, and someone was playing a joke on her?  But if this was just some horrible prank, how could they have gotten this level of detail in acquiring an exact replica of a piece of clothing that she wasn't even wearing at the time of her death?  No one should have known of that underwear's existence.  But then again... Ms. Yamano's affair was exposed so there may have been some earlier pictures featuring her in that clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as Yukiko began to feel a little better, she remembered what she saw in the mirror, and that voice, followed by the slip vanishing into the ether.  That felt all too real to be fake, and she had had that headache ever since then, not because of the food smell.  But if that was real, then could that really be Ms. Yamano's ghost, or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhh!\" Yukiko's breath froze in her throat as she realized a new, terrible possibility.  What if that wasn't Ms. Yamano's ghost, but her Shadow!?  The image also spoke about Namatame, the man she was having an affair with, and one's Shadow did seem to exhibit one's suppressed desires.  Also, Ms. Yamano herself was killed by Shadows, her own Shadow likely being one of them.  So then, what would happen to a Shadow after the human they came from is killed?  Would they just disappear, or would they continue to exist, filled with unending rage at the human who denied them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's breathing grew rapid as she gripped the apron tightly with her hands, her mind racing as she considered the possibility that Mayumi Yamano's Shadow was haunting the inn.  Why now after all these months?  Was it foggy tonight?  She couldn't remember.  The steam was always nice and thick during a hot spring bath so it could have been steam or fog clouding the area.  She could go outside herself to check, but not like this.  She needed real clothes, not just an apron!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!\" she said, her mind snapped back to reality as she began to don the apron.  While she shouldn't go outside even with the apron on, she should be decent enough with it to be able to make it back to her own room, where she could check on things from there and even use her phone to call her friends and tell them all about what was happening.  If shadows were involved, she would have to be a bit more daring; there was no time to lose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was putting the apron on, the \"guest\" from Room #108 arrived, camera in hand catching Yukiko's naked backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, so that's what she was doing!  Well played, Amagi, well played...\" Kanshi, back in the recording van, sighed.  \"Looks like we made it in time, though.  Now, as soon as she finishes dressing, kill the lights,\" he said over his headset to #108.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko had thought that putting on the apron would ease her nerves as well as protect her modesty, as she would be wearing some that most definitely wasn't ghost or Shadow clothing.  But the headache and warmth in her body was only getting worse.  Even stranger, after securing the apron to her body by tying the strings, she realized that the fabric felt weird along her private areas, which Yukiko tried to rationalize by reasoning that you're not supposed to wear aprons naked, the fact that one's butt is still completely exposed notwithstanding.  Still, she needed to contact her friends and get to the bottom fo this, now!  \"Okay, Yukiko, you've got this,\" she said to herself.  \"Time to g-AH!\" she yelped as her surroundings fell into complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SLAM* the kitchen door shut loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko whirled around, only to see nothing.  If there was anything, it was too dark to tell what it was.  Either way, Yukiko wasn't going to stick around and find out, and began creeping toward the other door, the one leading to the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, nice touch slamming the door.  Got a priceless look of fear there,\" Kanshi spoke to #108.  \"Let's keep this up.  You said you were pretty skilled with your hands and great at stealth, so next we're going to have you-\"</span></div></div>",

Two instincts were screaming in her head, one to still perfectly still and hidden while other wanted to run away screaming. She compromised by crawling across the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing through her fear was becoming difficult. Her ears were ringing as her headache continued to beat down on her. Although....now that she thought about it, it did feel like the pain in her head was subsiding. But not exactly in a good way. The relief she was feeling felt more like the sort that came from a lot of headache medicine. She was starting to feel woozy and a little dizzy. The sensation was a little like the night of the King's Game, after she had drunken a little too much (Naoto continued to insist the drinks were alcohol free, but she was clearly wrong about that...there was no way Yukiko would let herself act that silly all on her own!). There were, however, certain differences. She felt more aware of her surroundings than drunkness would have allowed. And yet the feeling of warmth rising up in her chest was much more intense than it had been that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yukiko paused at the doorway, seemingly trying to get her emotions under control, the agent from 108 made his move. With all the skill of a magician, he plucked at the strings on Yukiko's apron, untying the piece that kept the top of her meager clothing tied about her neck. Ever so carefully, one string of the apron was tied around a tray filled with pots and on the counter next to her. The other was tied around a nearby broom. Each string was expertly placed so that Yukiko would fail to notice the strings were no longer secured around her neck. 108 gave the bottom of the apron the same treatment, untying the drawstrings so subtly the act went unnoticed. Gathering up a small nozzle intended to help wash dishes, 108 tied the two strings around the device and positioned it precisely. Then he backed off, gathered up the camera, and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yukiko crawled forward she dragged the apron and its cargo with her. By the time she noticed that something was wrong, the damage was done. With a loud clatter the broom and the tray fell to the floor, their cacophony mixing with Yukiko's scream of surprise at both the noise and the way the falling objects yanked her clothing down to her waste. Her awesome breasts bounced into view- large, round, and topped with big pink nipples (erect, thanks to her arousal). 108 filmed the exposure, filling the whole picture with the dazzling orbs. But the best was yet to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrightened, confused, and embarrassed Yukiko immediately tried to flee on hands and knees for the door. The little hose she was dragging behind her reached the end of its length. The strings were tied in such a way that once fully extended the trigger for the nozzle would be pushed inwards and the hose would activate. Yukiko's momentum caused her to lurch forward, her face down and her rear high in the air. Just as intended, the spray of cool water struck directly along Yukiko's nether regions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock to Yukiko's system was too much. The poor girl gave a loud moan, throwing her head back and parting her lips in absolute rapture. At that moment nothing mattered or made sense except the sudden magnificent sensation washing over her exposed clit. Rearing back, Yukiko abruptly stopped the spray of water. Dazed and only semi-cognizant, Yukiko made another move towards the door. Again the hose was activated, and again Yukiko moaned in surprise and need. A third gentle pull, a third spray of water and erotic pleasure. On her hands and knees, Yukiko began to move her body forward and back, teasing her inner folds as the water went off and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanshi stared as Yukiko bobbed back and forth, her breasts thrusting before her and her face contorted in pure delight. \"108? What are we paying you again? You know what, never mind. Whatever it is, consider a couple more zeroes added to the end of it!\"</span></div></div>",

Swishing her hips one way and then another, Yukiko struggled against whatever had her apron and kept spraying her with water. Many times she would wiggle into a new position only to be overcome by the now constant deluge of water aimed firmly at her naked opening. It was like she was wrestling with some particularly erotic snake. And the cameras caught it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, breathing heavily and trembling, Yukiko extricated herself from the tangled mess and ran for the door on unsteady knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed.\" Kanshi said with a smirk. \"I didn't think she could squeeze an ass like that out of that apron. Have to stop underestimating her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko ran into the dining room. Scared and completely embarrassed, she looked around while covering herself with her hands. Thanks to the cold water she was now trembling, the air feeling icy on her exposed skin. She almost screamed as a sharp crack of thunder from the windows flooded the room with a second's worth of blinding light. As the darkness settled back around her, Yukiko took a moment to settle her nerves. Something was obviously not right here...but was it a ghost? Or a shadow? Someone else? She needed to talk to someone. But first....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, can't keep underestimating her.\" Kanshi said in exasperation as Yukiko plucked a table cloth off the nearest table and wrapped it around herself. \"Oh number 108?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnoticed by Yukiko a shadow left the kitchen and hid behind one of the tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling far more confident now that she had some protection for her modesty and silently relieved no one except perhaps the dead had seen her shameful display, Yukiko walked towards the door leading to the guest bedrooms (including her room).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was about to move into the hallway, Yukiko heard a soft female laugh behind her that sounded both familiar and distorted (as well it should, being a tape recorded sound bite of the supposed ghost, with some cheap audio tricks added to make it seem otherwordly). Suddenly Yukiko found herself being pushed forward. At the same time, her latest bit of clothing was forcibly yanked from her grasp and practically sucked back into the dining room even as the door slammed shut with a definitive locking sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nerves already frazzled, Yukiko trembled a second before letting out a loud scream of surprise and misery at finding herself naked once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a scream. You know the drill, people.\" Kanshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drained from Yukiko's face as doors up and down the hallway opened wide and heads began to pop out. Despite her ordeal so far, getting caught entirely naked by real honest to god humans was too much for poor Yukiko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooooooo!\" She cried as she ran down the hallway, every door she passed seeming to immediately open so that yet another stranger could take in her nude shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she stood before the door to her own room....</span></div></div>",

As such, each of her outfits was being sprayed with a quick drying, ordorless version of the chemicals and a tiny microchip. When completed Kanshi would be able to dissolve any piece of clothing she owned with the push of a button, giving him the power to strip her bare with a puff of smoke and had the added advantage of double her sense of arousal. But that was a game for tomorrow. For tonight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a push of a button Yukiko's room locked with a soft click. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was running full tilt for her room, her only objective to get away from her sudden audience. A single moment of relief washed over her as she reached her door. At long last she had reached sanctuary! No more ghosts, no more vanishing clothes, and especially no more nudity! She could put something on and call her friends and forget this whole awful ordeal ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer door refused to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's mind went numb. On reflex she yanked on the door again, and then again, seemingly hoping her sheer horror would negate the reality of the situation. But no matter how hard she pulled the door would not open. Yukiko moaned in despair as running footsteps stopped abruptly and the whispering began. Without looking Yukiko knew that the modest hallway of her Inn had filled to overflowing as a group of guests formed a semi-circle around her. The whispers and exclamations were mortifying to hear, especially the snatches of conversation she heard identifying her as the Innkeeper's daughter or admiring her naked body. Worst of all, though, was the general unintelligible murmur of simple awe and delight. The sound reminded Yukiko of Chie looking over a prime rib just before digging in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an amazing ass.\" She heard someone say mere feet from her, and to her lasting horror heard a camera phone go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't look at me!\" Yukiko cried as she spun around, shielding her butt from inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few seconds for her to realize her lovely breasts and tight slit were now fully exposed to the crowd. Those few seconds, alas, were all it took for a legion of cameras to blind her with their flashes. Her hands came up to shield herself from the sea of gawking faces. She was feeling dizzy with humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

The producer was surprised to see the Amagi girl maintaining her composure. The chemical aphrodisiac was meant to work in conjunction with increased heart rate, meaning that Yukiko's sex drive should have been going crazy, yet she still had a clear enough mind to try hiding herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Yukiko was spared that particular humiliation thanks to her unique gift. Her Persona mainly benefited her in the TV world, but in truth had some helpful effects in reality as well. As such, Yukiko was more resilient to the devious chemical she'd been exposed to. Resilient, however, did not mean immune, and the raven haired beauty was certainly feeling the effects Kanshi had intended. It wouldn't take much more to knock Yukiko over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how she's holding it together, but I guess we've had our fun for tonight.\" Kanshi muttered, pressing a button on the tablet he used to oversee the operation. \"Better let her in her room before things get out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the hallway, Yukiko found her cries of humiliation cut short as her door suddenly gave way behind her, sending her falling inelegantly to the floor. Now on her back, disoriented, and with her legs splayed wide open, Yukiko found herself subjected to more frantic camera flashes before she could regain her senses. Scrambling wildly, Yukiko grabbed her door and roughly slammed it shut, finally putting an obstruction between her and her unwanted audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's face was pure crimson, her heart hammering away as she tried to stop her body's shaking. She'd just been seen -and photographed- by an entire hallway's worth of people, completely naked! There was no way she'd ever be able to live this down. And what if her parents found out?! Forget the if, it was almost certain they'd find out from one of the guests. How was she supposed to explain any of this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the desperate hope that this was all just some kind of awful nightmare, Yukiko climbed into her bed, wrapping the sheets tightly around herself and burying her face in her pillow. This horrible night was finally over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what Yukiko thought. Kanshi was nothing if not devious, and the producer had his sights set on more than just a special episode. He was looking at an entire season of the show if he played his cards right! This was the kind of TV that changed careers, after all, and Kanshi had every intention to capitalize. By the time he was done, all of Japan would know about the \"Yamano Curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, the producer began the next planned phase of her grand scheme-</span></div></div>",

Eventually, she managed to pass into a world of troubled dreams, full of laughter and mockery and public exposure. Even this was not to last, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe storm outside had mostly run its course by the midnight hour. Little more than a drizzle, really. Apparently that still counted to whatever arbiter of the paranormal decided such things. And so, at precisely midnight Yukiko found her sleep disturbed by a sharp burst of static and a sickly yellow light suddenly flooding into her room. It took her a moment to understand what was happening. The small TV in her room was turned off, yet an image was appearing on the screen. The Midnight Channel had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe images were crystal clear and unimpeded by the usual level of static. They looked more like the scenes the Shadow would broadcast after a victim had entered the TV. But what was playing was not a Shadow at all. Yukiko stared in stunned horror, rising to her feet while wrapping the blanket around herself. The person on the screen was tinted yellow, but was very clearly Yukiko herself. Yukiko traipsing naked through the hallways, the screen shifting to the most lewd and scandalous angles possible (angle not even Kanshi could have dreamed of!) showing off every curve of her form in high definition. The skipped around certain details of her evening, omitting any images that might incriminate Kanshi's crew and lingering on the moments of her abject humiliation. Yukiko turned bright red when the screen came to her ordeal in the kitchen, watching herself on all fours thrusting her hips back and forth in pleasure was simply too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP IT!\" She pleaded with the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all at once the screen went blank. And a yellow eyed face appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Yukiko.\" She said pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Miss Yamano....\" Yukiko said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good. You remember me.\" The image on the screen said, responding to her as if they were in the same room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko shook her head. \"This...makes no sense! How can you talk to me? Are you a ghost? A Shadow? What's going on??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamano smiled. \"The Midnight Channel shows you what you want to see, Yuki-chan. Your thoughts drew you to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would only occur to Yukiko later that, if that was true, then what she presumed was Miss Yamano might just be a illusion her own mind conjured up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why....why are you stealing my clothes?\" Yukiko demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamano stared at her a moment, then smiled and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to show you what I went through, little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My time with Namatame was wonderful, you know. Fun. Exciting. And yet when it all came out into the open I could feel nothing but embarrassment and shame. I lost my lover, my career...and my life all in quick succession.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Someone tried to hurt me the same way! My friends are looking for your killer. We're trying to make sure what happened to you never happens to anyone again!\" Yukiko said, taking a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How noble.\" Yamano said in a deadpan. \"I'm sure you will find him eventually. But he's not really my concern. What I want is for everyone to understand what my life was like before I died. I was happier than I'd ever been, and then all I knew was total humiliation. My love life was paraded out before the entire world! Everyone needs to suffer the way I suffered. Starting with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko turned pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Mrs. Amagi. Your little naked romp through the Inn was just to start. Your humiliation has only started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! There has to be something I can do! What do you want?\" Yukiko begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. At the moment I'd be more concerned with whether or not all those images of your naked body were appearing on your screen alone, or if everyone watching the channel tonight got an eye full of you in your birthday suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was speechless. The TV went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If her friends had seen that her phone would be ringing like crazy right now. The best option was to just try and go back to sleep. At the very least, Yukiko preferred the small comfort that came with ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching the sheets tighter around herself than ever before, Yukiko crawled back into bed, burying her face in her pillow and shutting out the entire outside world. Sleep, thankfully, came again soon enough. Meanwhile, Kanshi and his crew were trying to figure out what had just happened to cause their camera in Yukiko's room to break into static for several minutes. Everything was back to normal now, but nothing seemed to have changed other than Yukiko shifting somewhat in her sleep.

As she slipped out of her covers and found herself stark naked, however, she realized that it had all been too real. Yukiko chewed her bottom lip, dreading the idea of heading to school today. Even if nobody else had seen her Midnight Channel display, the odds were good that rumors would trickle back into town from the hotel guests that had seen her in the hallway. The best Yukiko could hope for was that the rumors would just be written off as exactly that: rumors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gnawing sense of dread, Yukiko carefully dressed, making absolutely sure that her outfit was as secure as possible before having the confidence to step out of her room.

The rest of the town took greater notice of outsiders, especially given the murders and kidnappings that had taken place. Even then, it had taken months of preparation to get everything ready. Smuggling a camera onto school grounds unnoticed would take a miracle, and any extra attention could ruin the whole plan and get them all arrested in the process.

She also could not avoid an encounter with her mother and the maid staff. Frankly, she was practically mobbed by a horde of giggling servants and cooks the moment she appeared, all wanting the details of her humiliation. Of course, she omitted the supernatural elements from her tale, instead blaming the incident on some horrible pranksters that had stolen her clothes while she was in the bath. Fortunately, her mother wasn't angry. It seemed similar incidents had plagued the Amagi women for generations. A inevitable consequence of being an attractive woman running a bathhouse, as her mother put it. However, to maintain the Amagi reputation Yukiko would be expected to apologize for being foolish enough to find herself in such a lewd situation and for disturbing the guests with her screams. When Yukiko protested, she was sternly reminded that she still had responsibilities to the Inn. The guests came first, and her mother was not above disciplining the girl with a hard wooden paddle despite her age if Yukiko needed to be reminded of that fact. That would certainly be the result if she fell that prank a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo not mad, but not at all sympathetic either.

But you don't smell like a wizard or an esper....how bizarre.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in question was tall, wrapped in a kimono that left her legs bare but arms covered. The garment itself was silky and embroidered with the image of countless dragons writhing across a surface of blue, gold, and green. A purple sash kept the item secured on her body. A bag brimming with shinto charms and less identifiable things was slumped over her right shoulder, while a stylized bamboo sword was carried over her left. Yukiko noted that the kimono was not quite up to the task of containing the woman's large breasts, which provided quite a lot of cleavage to any onlookers interested in such things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, 'who are you'? I'm Saeko Machiko, of course! We just discussed this! Was my kiss that intense?\" The woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?? YOU JUST CAME UP AND STARTED MOLESTING ME!!\" Yukiko screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be absurd! We've had a proper introduction and agreed upon....err....oh. Oh your right. I skipped ahead again, didn't I? Oh dear. That was rude.\" Saeko said, more to herself than Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I don't know who you are, but...but you stay away from me! If you come near me again I'll call the police!\" Yukiko declared, intending to turn around and storm off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then who will exorcise your ghost?\" Saeko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that who I think it is?\" one of the news of the weird techies asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.\" Kanshi confirmed. \"Saeko Machiko. Self proclaimed greatest exorcist in Japan. Self-taught spiritualist with immense psychic powers. Or so she says. Borderline lunatic and suspected nymphomaniac, more likely. Claims to specialize in a rare form of shinto magic involving sex rituals and humiliating 'purification' acts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we hire her or something?\" The tech asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. We've asked her to come on the show a time or two. Mostly when we need to spice things up with something comedic and raunchy during sweeps week. She's crazy as a loon, but its a fun kind of crazy. Nah, I just staged a little 'visitation' during her meditation that convinced her that Amagi was being haunted. With any luck, she'll notify US of what's going on so we have an excuse to show back up in Amagi's life and justify all the footage we've gathered. We play our cards right maybe Amagi will beg us to help her out with her embarrassing ghost problems. Maybe we'll even get her to sign a long term contract with us. Heh heh. See how she likes complaining to our sponsors after she agrees to strip off her clothes every week and be on film!\" Kanshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your kinda obsessed with this, huh?\" The techie noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and keep filming.\" Kanshi snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My card!\" Saeko said, producing a small embossed business card from within the folds of her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exorcist and....erotic psychic?\" Yukiko asked, bewildered and a little terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! Shinto magic is a celebration of creation and all the spirits that embody it! Sex is the purist form of creation, and as the bearer of children women are the purest representatives of that form! And since ghosts are entities lingering on after death, there is no more powerful a weapon to use against them than the magic of life and creation!\" Saeko proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....This sounds insane.\" Yukiko noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me if this sounds insane! Last night you had an encounter with the ghost of Mayumi Yamano, who proceeded to humiliate you and fill you with lust!\" Saeko declared loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko blushed and looked around wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-All right. You've made your point. Please be quiet!\" She begged. \"Yes, I had...something happen to me last night. But how do you know that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. Exorcist and erotic PSYCHIC!\" Saeko declared. \"In any case...Yukiko, have you ever seen Ju-on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? The horror movie? No. What does that have to do with-\" Yukiko began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the movie, a murder victim returns as a Grudge to haunt first her killer then anyone foolish enough to enter her former home. The idea plays off old Shinto texts that imply that strong emotions experienced in the moment of death can dominate and overwhelm the minds of dead spirits! While this usually means things like anger or hatred, sometimes other emotions come to the foreground. Emotions like LUST and SHAME. A ghost created from these emotions is unlikely to kill its chosen victim the way a grudged spirit would, but it will always seek to inflict as much shame and lust upon that person as possible. You live at the Amagi Inn, correct? The place where  Miss Yamano was killed?\" Saeko spoke a mile a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where she disappeared.\" Yukiko corrected. \"No one knows where she died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, really. The emotions she experienced at the Inn were most certainly lust due to her encounters with Mr. Namatame and shame that the affair was made public! Now she wants to pass that shame and lust onto someone else. And the girl she has chosen, Yukiko, is you.\" Saeko said melodramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...I...\" Yukiko stuttered. \"I have to go! I have school.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Just hang onto my card. If this was an isolated incident perhaps you won't need my help. If not...well, give me a call. I have a host of rituals ready to exorcise the spirit from your body!\" Saeko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanshi smiled. The nice part about Saeko was that her brand of exorcism was rarely less humiliating than the ghosts she was supposedly banishing. The fact that she had an amazing body that she often ended up baring as much as that of her clients was just icing on the cake. Now his job was simply to torment Amagi enough to convince her to call the woman. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukiko glanced at the clock once again. How had the minute hand progressed so little since class had begun? Kashiwagi was droning on about something, oscillating between her lesson plan and idle gossip of questionable appropriateness for a teacher to discuss. Any other day Yukiko would be attentively writing down the important information in her notebook along with Yu Narukami while her friends Chie and Yosuke zoned out. Now she found her mind wondering along with the slackers in her group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had been entirely uneventful. A few timid questions between her friends had revealed that none of them had stayed up for the midnight channel (the rain storm lst night had not been predicted in the forecast, and no prominent figures had been featured on TV to put the investigators on alert. So none of her close friends had seen her naked. That still left the possibility of random students at her school. No one had said anything, but the smirks and hushed whispers she saw on her way to class made her nervous. In all probability it was just the usual level of gossip, but Yukiko was now hyper sensitive to the issue and paranoid who might be talking about her. The fact that rumors and perhaps even pictures of her were likely already spreading across the small town with or without the Midnight Channel did not help her to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, the headache that had plagued her last night was back. Though perhaps that wasn't the right term. She wasn't in pain, exactly. Just...hazy and restless. It was like being hungry without knowing what food was- a vague and growing sense that her body wanted something from her she wasn't quite certain how to provide it. It was very distracting. Kashiwagi was especially hard to pay attention to. Her mind kept wandering to her large amount of cleavage and curvy body. As unpleasant as she was to deal with Yukiko couldn't help but notice how good she looked for a woman her age. A lot like that Saeko woman from before. Which brought up images of her kiss and the way she had caressed Yukiko's body earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of her body, Yukiko had been sporting erect nipples and a slightly aroused sex all morning. She was only vaguely aware of that fact, dismissing it as being cold in the well air conditioned classroom. The truth was that she was effectivey marinating in Kanshi's arousing chemical cocktail, her clothes drenched in the stuff and slowly causing it to seep into her skin. Minute by minute they were chipping away at her resolve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA buzzing sound brought her out of her erotic reverie. Her phone was receiving a text message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki-chan! This is your Teddie speaking! I wanted to get back to you about those questions you had this morning. Unfortunately I don't know very much about the other side, even though I'm from there. I do think there's a difference between the 'regular' shadows we encounter and the 'Big Shadows' that come out of people who get put inside the TV. The little shadows are a little like individual thoughts and feeling people ignore or reject every day- little things like whether to buy ice cream or ignore that impulse. The Big Shadows, the ones that become Personas, are more like the deeper core parts of a person- what Nao-chan keeps calling your 'Id'. Hard to explain. As for what happens after they kill their original selves? I dunno. I think they just become very powerful 'normal' Shadows and lose their memories and intelligence over time. If they tried really hard and kept thinking about more complicated things I guess they would end up like yours truly- able to manifest a human form and return to the real world. But I'm pretty exceptional, ya know! Most of them can't stay that focused, and most of the ones who can wouldn't want to. Doing that would eventually turn them into something more than a Shadow, and most Shadows don't want to be anything else. Oh yeah, and you wanted to know if a ghost could have a shadow? Weird question. Anyway, I've never seen one, but if ghosts exists they probably could have a shadow. As far as I know, anything with a mind can create shadows. Even animals or even plants- but humans make the most shadows cause they have the most complicated thoughts. So if those spooky stories about ghosts are true, that they can talk and interact and haunt people and stuff- then yes, it seems like they have a mind of their and can have a shadow in my world. But if it happens, its so rare that I can't think of a single example of it! Hope that helps! Ciao, baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko read the message, her breathing quickening. No real answers there, only more questions. It sounded like Ms. Yamano's Shadow COULD still exist, but that it was unlikely. And if Ms. Yamano had a ghost wandering around the Inn, that ghost could manifest a shadow. But that was even more unlikely. If either scenario was happening, it sounded like it was a unique phenomena and Yukiko would have to find her own answers with how to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko thought a moment, then began texting the female members of her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I need some help. Would all of you come to the Inn tonight? Maybe we could have a sleep over? There something I need to talk about. Its about the Investigation. But-uhhh- it involves a few details that I don't want the guys to know about- at least not until we've looked into it more on our own. I'll explain everything tonight! Please come if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at Chie for confirmation. The look on the blond girl's face was...panicked. Blinking, Yukiko followed her gaze and found her vision suddenly obsctructed by a human body standing rather close to her. With dawning horror Yukiko found herself craning her neck upward to stare into the furious eyes of Kashiwagi looming over her. Her texting had not gone unnoticed, and her spell of zoning out was apparently worse than she realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah, ummm, Miss Kashiwagi, I...uh...\" Yukiko stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice of you to return to us, Miss. Amagi.\" Kashiwagi said caustically. \"I hope it isn't too inconvenient for you if we continue the lesson now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes ma'am.\" Yukiko muttered, blushing as the kids around her snickered at the reprimand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Perhaps you would be so kind as to solve the problem on the board if your done with your little text?\" Kashiwagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko bit her lip and swallowed her anger. In her own way she was one of the most popular students in Kashiwagi's class, with a score of admirers and a long list of broken hearts. Most of the time she rejected boys without even realizing she was doing so- the infamous \"Amagi challenge\". That she had an excellent figure for a girl her age didn't hurt either. All of these things made her the enemy of her naturally jealous home room teacher. But Yukiko was also a demour, studious, polite student who scored exceptionally well and came from an important family in the area. Thus while Kashiwagi was eager to torment the girl she knew quite well she would need a good excuse. That Yukiko innocently refused to offer any chink in her armor as a model student only infuriated the teacher all the more. Now at last her time was at hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanshi had avoided smuggling any cameras into the school. There was one important exception, however. A pinhole camera was hidden inside the fabric of Yukiko's book bag. It wasn't much, certainly nothing compared to the arsenal of high quality cameras that had captured Yukiko's humiliating romp through the Inn the night before (from as many angles as possible!) but he was willing to make do with what he had. And of course, he wasn't going to waste this opportunity. With that thought in mind, he ran a finger across a multitude of switches that controlled the dissolving mechanisms hidden on each of Yukiko's garments. He whistled cheerfully to himself as he pressed one of the buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe board was a simple question based off the current reading material. Yukiko smiled to herself. It was a tricky question no doubt intended to trip her up, but she had studied the material backwards and forwards. Kashiwagi had managed to embarrass her a moment ago, but now it was her turn to show the teacher up. Standing on tip toes (the problem was written high up, so she had to stretch to answer it) Yukiko began writing. A few of the students might have noticed the thin tendril of smoke snaking out of her skirt, but that strange event was quickly forgotten as they and everyone else in class took wide eyed notice of the first hint of Yukiko's lovely round butt cheeks peaking out beneath her skirt. Was she not wearing any panties??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko hummed to herself, taking pleasure in providing a through and poetic answer to the question. She had almost finished the question when the chalk fell from her hands. Sighing to herself for trying to write with such a flourish (this wasn't drama club!) she bent down to pick up the chalk and continue answering the question. The entire classroom gasped audibly as Yukiko unintentionally offered a confirmation that she was indeed not wearing any underwear, as well as an unimpeded view of her ass and pussy to her fellow students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko Amagi! Explain yourself!\" Kashiwagi bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Did I not answer it correctly?\" Yukiko asked,straightening up and looking at the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole class chortled. Kashiwagi fumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be coy, you little bimbo! What are you thinking coming to school dressed like that?\" Kashiwagi demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But...I know its not quite the standard uniform, but I thought the school allowed for minor changes and accessories.\" Yukiko said, looking at the red sweater she typically wore over her usual uniform attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school most certainly does NOT allow that level of....accessorizing!\" Kashiwagi snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've been coming to school like this all year. Why is this an issue now?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole class gasped and laughed and exchanged glances. Had she really gone all this time without panties? Had she always been such a huge pervert? Kashiwagi herself was floored by the statement. What kind of slut had been hiding behind inside that bland little Innkeeper's daughter this whole time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! If you expect me to believe you ever thought the school permitted you to...to so liberally interpret the dresscode regarding your underwear then-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My WHAT?\" Yukiko squeeked. \"What's that supposed to...what are you talking about??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else would we be talking about? Your panties!\" Kashiwagi roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about...what's wrong with...why would you....\" Yukiko stammered, confused and blushing at the sudden topic of her unmentionables. \"Are...are they SHOWING?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic she began feeling around the bottom of her skirt, fearing that it might have ripped or been flipped up somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They most certainly are NOT showing. That is ENTIRELY the problem!\" Kashiwagi snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what...are...you...\" Yukiko trailed off as a dawning horror began creeping up on her as she frantically searched for her underwear. With a growing suspicion and the same stabbing feeling of shame she had experienced last night Yukiko snaked a hand under her skirt, desperate to deny what she already knew to be true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a camera flash. Yukiko's eyes widened, realizing that her class would have no reason to understand her confusion over losing her panties. They would think she had come to school like this deliberately. Which meant on top of mooning everyone moments ago everyone would now be convinced that the hand down her skirt meant something entirely different!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOO!!\" Yukiko screamed, yanking her hand out of her skirt and instead grabbing the garment on both sides and pulling it down as far as it would go without yanking it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you've enjoyed making a fool out of me this morning, Miss Amagi.\" Kashiwagi said. \"I was taken aback at just how depraved you truly are, and you played off that well. Now its time to pay the piper!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait! I can explain! I'm not a pervert!\" Yukiko wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Then just what-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud buzzing sound came from Yukiko desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Even after all this you still had your phone on?\" Kashiwagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? N-no! I turned it off right away!\" Yukiko stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange silence descended on the room as Yukiko watched, frozen in place, as her teacher walked to her desk, picked up her book bag, and began hunting for the loud buzzing vibration inside. Her eyes widened as Kashiwagi produced a long, thick dildo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying?\" Kashiwagi said. \"On the highest setting, too. I guess we know why none of these poor boys ever impressed you in that little 'Amagi Challenge', eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...That's...That's not mine! I've never seen it before!!\" Yukiko screamed, beat red and utterly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, number 6. Good job smuggling that baby into her bag.\" Kanshi said from his hidden lair. \"We done planting the evidence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, boss. Got a receipt and everything. With a little diligence anyone can 'confirm' that Ms. Yamano bought a 'Happy Rabbit' 50 horse power extra large vibrator a few days before she disappeared. We've prepared a few nasty rumors that she did it to 'compensate' for breaking up with Mr. Namatame. We'll leak a little report to the local news outlet tomorrow. Their reporters are gossip hungry and perverted. They'll run it for sure. She'll put two and two together real quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet.\" Kanshi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little Miss Amagi, I think we've seen enough.\" Kashiwagi said, moving towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait! Please! This isn't what it looks like!\" Yukiko begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it.\" Kashiwagi said, grabbing the poor girl by the ear and leading her painfully to the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew what was happening Yukiko found herself kneeling on all fours on the desk, the whole class whispering and laughing and gasping all around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay still and accept your punishment like a good girl, and I MIGHT not bring this to the attention of your parents or the principal. Squirm away and you can count on a long detention and maybe a little suspension in addition to an inability to sit down this evening.\" Kashiwagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...Wha...What are you-\" Yukiko began, then yelped in pain as Kashiwagi's thick paddle smacked her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm....that skirt's going to get in the way. Here, why don't we...\" Kashiwagi said with a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo! Please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's pleas went unanswered as she found herself half naked and on all fours in her classroom, her skirt hiked over her waste and her naked bottom fully exposed. Painful spankings were raining down on her cheeks, turning them a rosy red. And for a second time, she found herself blinded by camera flashes as her school mates captured her exposure for all time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The guys weren't making eye contact with the girls, though Yosuke and Yu had strange little grins on their faces. The girls, for their part, were all watching the boys like hawks and seemed to gathered around Yukiko a bit more closely than usual. Almost protectively. Yukiko herself was standing up rather than sitting with the others. her hands clamped around her skirt and her face totally red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....\" Teddie began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted, telling you as a friend. Don't. Ask.\" Yosuke said. \"If you value your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...okay.\" Teddie said in confusion. \"But then what are we supposed to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the reason we're having this meeting is for Yukiko's sake.\" Yu began, risking a quick glance in her direction. \"You said something about seeing the Midnight Channel last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Yukiko said, clearly preoccupied. \"Oh. Right. Yeah. I...um...I did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you think someone's gonna be kidnapped?\" Kanji prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh. No. Not anything like that. It wasn't like that.\" Yukiko muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then someone's already been thrown in??\" Kanji said in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Or...I mean...it doesn't seem like it? It was...weirder than usual.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto sighed. \"Yukiko-san, I realize your ordeal this morning was unpleasant, but please try to focus. Your the only one who saw any details last night. If we're going to be any help at all we need as much information as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to...\" Yukiko snapped, then took in a breath. \"Fine. There are some things I won't get into. You....know how the Channel can be. It got a little personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure, we understand.\" Chie chimed in. \"But we're all friends here. You know you can trust us. We've basically already seen the worst parts of one another, right? Its not like there's anything left to see that would change our opinions of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there are a few things we really liked seeing.\" Yosuke muttered under his breath, then coughed in alarm as he found himself stared down by four pairs of female eyes filled with murder. \"Uhh...heh...umm...anyway! Just skip over the details and give us the short version!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I think I saw a ghost.\" Yukiko said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went on to explain as much of her encounters in the bath, the mirror, and the conversation with the apparent ghostly Shadow of Yamano. She tried to omit as much of her humiliations last night as possible, and she was reasonably confident that the boys did not read between the lines. Although the carefully neutral expression Yu was giving her suggested he might have gleaned a few of the details despite her efforts. She couldn't help but blush at that thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that explains all those weird questions earlier. But if there really is a ghost...what do we do?\" Teddie asked. \"We can't use our Personas in the real world, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hoping there's a way to appease her and put her to rest.\" Yukiko said simply. \"And if there is a Shadow wandering around, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we stop it.\" Yosuke chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko glanced in his direction and gasped softly to herself. All day and throughout the meeting he had been studiously avoiding eye contact with her, but occasionally stolen little glances at her when he thought she wasn't paying attention. At such times he had a stupid, pervy look that made her blood boil and her cheeks burn with shame. Now though, he was looking directly at her, no oggling or leering. He looked...determined. Serious. Sad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know where Yamano died in the TV world. That creepy room with the noose. So hunting around there won't be that hard. Teddie should be enough for a patrol tonight. Me, Kanji, and Yu will go in tonight and see what we can see. The rest of you do what Yukiko suggested and keep her company tonight. See what happens. We can trade stories tomorrow and figure out our next move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. Check out mister assertive over here! What's the deal, Yosuke? When did you get so proactive about this stuff?\" Chie chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you get it? We've been assuming all this time that Shadows only stay around long enough to kill their other self and pop out of existence. If Ms. Yamano's Shadows is still around, whether this ghost stuff is real or not...then what if she's not the only one?\" Yosuke said, his voice breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Chie said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think Ms. Konishi might be...\" Naoto began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Saki-senpai is...still trapped in that world, then I...\" Yosuke said softly. \"We can't ignore this. We need to figure out if this is possible and deal with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was silent for a moment, before Yu cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know the Midnight Channel is connected with the thoughts of the viewer. If Yukiko had already encountered something she thought was a ghost, then its possible the Channel just responded to those fears and showed her something based on those thoughts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think it wasn't real?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think at best it offers a distorted picture to its audience. Naoto's lab, Kanji's bathhouse, Rise's nightclub...we've seen first hand how warped that world can be.\" Yu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Scoring a hot stud'?\" Teddie said with a smirk before Rise smacked him on the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yosuke's right. We need to investigate further. Just remember- the whole point of that world is to hide the truth behind the fog- literally or otherwise. The information we've gained from the Channel has been helpful, but its always been distorted and never straightforward. There could be a Shadow on the loose here, or it could just be an illusion the Channel created specifically for Yukiko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to any of the investigators, they would see a grim first hand example of the latter during their confrontation with Namatame, a vision of his Shadow that would nearly goad them into becoming murderers themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In short, make no assumptions, be logical and keep an open mind.\" Naoto said. \"The qualities of a good detective. The basic principles still apply, supernatural elements aside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Let's do this. Stay safe tonight, girls. We'll reconvene in the morning.\" Yosuke said with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls waited until the others were out of sight, then noticeably dropped their serious faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo...what were all those little details you didn't want the guys to hear? Must be juicy for you to be so tight lipped, huh?\" Rise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko blushed more deeply, took in a breath, and began to explain her awful ordeal.</span></div></div>",

As she stuttered through her recollection of the events that led to her lack of clothing, the girls poked and prodded and she began to embarrassingly admit to some of the more shameful moments including her ordeal with the hose. Red faced, she finished her story and was met with a round of giggles from her companions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoohhh how bold, I\u2019m sure those guests won\u2019t be forgetting their trip anytime soon!\u201d Rise teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-This is serious!\u201d Yukiko stammered. \u201cHow long is this going to keep going on for?

Every minor breeze brought the terror that she might moon another passerby, causing her to hobble most of the way awkwardly holding her skirt to prevent such exposure. Her behavior never failed to inspiring more teasing and laughter from her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! We're here!\" She said in embarrassment and exasperation as they arrived at the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does the Inn seem really crowded to you?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its that time of year...but yes.

Do we get an apology too? That incident at school-\" Chie began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" Yukiko snapped and stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, don't take it so....HEY!

After getting tormented by all those ghost stories she tells? Not a chance! Its nice to see her freaked out for once!\" Rise declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. In any event. We need to treat this as if it were any other investigation. So we should retrace her steps through the Inn, and examine everything she encountered as carefully as possible.\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOOOOOOO<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this be a problem?\" asked the intern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Amagi's reinforcements? Probably not. Although....that crossdressing detective might notice something if we let her wander around long enough. We should probably deal with them now. Prep the mirror for possession induction.\" Kanshi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mesmerism and suggestion? Will they fall for that? Not everyone can be hypnotised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, yes. But the more intelligent and thoughtful you are the more vulnerable to that stuff you actually are. The ones most immune to it are the most close minded of people. Girls looking around for ghosts and especially someone who makes the deductive leaps our little detective here has to make are gonna be easy to put under. We'll fill their heads with some basic instructions to ignore evidence that this is anything OTHER than a supernatural happening, and then give them a few triggers to act like Yamano is taking control. It'll be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Amagi?\" The intern asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to ask. Little Yuki-chan has been running around all day with (most) of her clothes on. That's not acceptable. Let's give her the vanishing bathroom routine.\" Kanshi said, steepling his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOOOOOO<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a soft hiss as the shower sprayed a steady stream of water over the young innkeeper. In a very strange way shedding her remaining clothes had been an enormous relief to Yukiko. All day the shock and humiliation of her accidental exposure combined with the constant dread that the ghost might strip her of more clothes had weighed down on the poor girl. Now at last her day was over and there was no risk of losing her clothes to another. Oddly, the rest of her uniform felt strangely confining as well despite being the one thing standing between her modesty and total humiliation! It felt good to be naked out of sight of any ghosts or perverts. And the warm water cascading off her large breasts and thin stomach was heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was only disturbed for a moment when the water stopped running, then resumed at a slightly faster rate. She had no way of knowing that the normal plumbing had been cut off in favor of a secret tank of water directly under her bathroom saturated with arousal chemicals. She was already under their effects, having grown hornier and hornier with each passing hour. The concentrated dose would accelerate the process still further, increasing her lusts over a span of minutes what would have taken hours before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko felt herself growing hotter and hotter. Her ordeal just a day ago replayed itself in her mind. She remembered the feel of the skimpy piece of underwear the ghost had made her parade around in. It must have driven Namatame insane back in the day. She was picturing herself wearing it now, swaying and posing for an admirer....Yu sprang immediately to mind, but her mind replaced him in turn with a gawking Yosuke and then a perverted looking Teddie (\"Well, I suppose I need to give you a demonstration of 'scoring' at some point, don't I you naive little bear?\") and right on through her female companions (Chie taking center stage). The idea of being seen was so humiliating! But...enticing. And then the garment was gone, and she was wandering naked through the halls. The hose trapped her again, only this time it was in the dining hall. and it was packed. She was providing a lewd display for the night's entertainment. Now she was trapped in front of her door again, but instead of hiding behind her hands she was freely posing and displaying her large breasts and shaven sex to a hundred snapping cameras, following their instructions and showing off every inch of her bare skin. And finally, she was again on all fours in front of her class. But this time she had walked to school this way, with neither underwear or anything else on. Her hands and feet were tied, her breasts swinging freely. Her classes...no, the whole school was there, each given a choice. The paddle...or the vibrator. Every student she knew was alternately tormenting her with a hard smack on her ass or a powerful vibration moving in and out. She was helpful to do more than blush and beg and yelp and moan....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko tore her eyes open with a gasp. Her fingers were moving in and out of her with desperate abandon. Her left hand was clutching her breast, occasionally pausing from playing to steady herself against the wall of her stall. She was close. It was only with an audible whimper that she disengaged herself and let the water cascade over her while her heart pounded and her insides throbbed. She was NOT going to get off on her humiliation! No matter how much she might want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strong will as always, Amagi.\" Kanshi said in admiration. \"Your roughly 20 times hornier than you were when you got your first taste of those chems yesterday, but your still holding out. Of course, as things stand now you'll probably totally lose control in front of the whole Inn. But I'm not complaining. By all means, struggle on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko realized that her bathroom had gone dark. She had two thoughts in quick succession. The second thought was the rational one- a light had burned out while she was 'distracted' and she would have to fumble her way back to her room. That was the comforting, reassuring thought. The first, immediate thought was about her Inn's mysteries. Old tradition in Japan claimed there were seven mysteries that haunt every school, Inn, Park...everywhere, essentially. These were innocuous rumors about the place, strange little phenomena that occurred within the walls for no apparent reason. One of her favorites was a guest who once complained about the bathroom in his room being too dark. But of course the man did not have a restroom in the room he had rented. Thus the Inn's third mystery was a phantom bathroom which moved from place to place and room to room. Silly and absurd. Yukiko of course ate up such rumors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissing it all as impossible, Yukiko snuck her way to the door, already planning to use the daylight to find her towel to dry off. But as she pulled the door opened and exited her bathroom she found not her familar bed and furniture but a long carpeted hallway buzzing with the sounds of staff and guests in every direction. Yukiko was now naked and dripping wet in the middle of her upstairs hallway, well away from any staircases and likely only moments away from discovery. The door behind her vanished back into the wall, secreting itself seamlessly into the wallpaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA secondary use of the chemical bath Yukiko was given was a momentary confusion to her senses. It was a slight sense of vertigo, but it was enough to disguise the hidden elevator mechanism that transported her bathroom from one floor to another. A similar mechanism could secret it to nearly any room inside the like a train car. Kanshi intended to bring every mystery of the Inn to life in his bid to humilate the heiress, and he was proud of the results. </span></div></div>",

We need to find a hiding place. Quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's eyes suddenly widened. \"Nooooo. Don't let them find me like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Exactly. Is there anywhere on this floor that might be of use?\" Naoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Room 204. Has...electrical problems. Aren't renting it out...\" Yukiko said, trying her best to focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Come along....\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next several moments were a tense game of hiding and scouting. There was one moment of total panic when an entourage of cooks passed down the hallway right past a potted plant. A single glance to the right would have allowed them to spot the horny, desperate girl they occasionally worked under. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doorway to Room 204 slid open Yukiko practically fled into the room. Kneeling on all fours she began to once more pleasure herself with more vigor and desperation. The pause had been agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...how exactly did she wander onto the second floor totally naked and horny without getting caught?\" Rise demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ghost, I assume.\" Naoto said. \"From the water and the lack of clothes, coupled with what she said, I'm assuming she was taking her shower when through means and reasons she doesn't understand she found herself on the second floor of her Inn. And soon after she found herself overwhelmed with...a need to do this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko nodded slightly before giving a loud moan from her indulgences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ace detective.\" Rise said. \"But its a good thing we caught up to you! There's no way anyone would buy that story. Everybody else would think your just a huge pervert for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie glared hard at the idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa! Don't kill the messenger! I'm just saying what everyone else is gonna think!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. Which is why our first priority should be securing something for her to wear. I don't suppose you have anything in this room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...just the cot and the furniture. No linens or towels. Nothing to cover with...\" Yukiko said in misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we will find something suitable. Chie-chan, please keep an eye on her and make sure neither of you are discovered. Rise, help me search the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the blond and brunette were alone in the dark. The silence was broken by a sudden, loud moan from Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko! If you don't stop, someone will hear you!\" Chie chided her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! But I can't help it! You have no idea how hard this is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie bit her lip, took in a deep breath, and gently grasped her friend's hands and pulled them away from the girl's young body. In the process, she decided to pretend the strange moisture she felt was just water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Easy.\" Chie whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing and hanging her head, Yukiko whispered. \"Yeah. Easy. And I can't even do that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko...\" Chie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me! I can't even...keep my clothes on for a whole day!\" Yukiko whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! None of that!\" Chie said, pointing at the other girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of what?\" Yukiko said in a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of that 'I'm so weak and worthless' crap! I know that look! And its not like you could have prepared for this or that you did something to deserve all this! None of us know how to fight a ghost! We're all flying blind here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says the girl who still has all of her clothes on.\" Yukiko muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. I'm sorry, okay? I'm not...good at this comforting stuff, you know! If that ghost had a face, I'd stomp it into nothing! You're better at the emotional support stuff!\" Chie sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...trying to get me to comfort you?\" Yukiko asked in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What? No! Unless that'll distract you! Then I totally am!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. You are pretty terrible at this.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie gulped, finding a lot more of Yukiko's face and breasts much closer to her than she realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always have been there for me, haven't you?\" Yukiko whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...well...yeah! We've been friends since grade school! Of course I've got your back!\" Chie said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember. Energetic, bold, tough Chie, driving away all the boys.\" Yukiko said in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr...I...yeah.\" Chie trailed off. \"Sorry about that. I always thought I was protecting you, but...I guess I had other intentions, too. My shadow said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about that!\" Yukiko said suddenly. \"So...so what if you were jealous of me? I'm...glad. You know? I was always in awe of you, too. Strong. Thin. Athletic...pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Uhh, Yukik-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it turns out...you thought I was something worth being jealous of. Shy. Talentless. Worthless me.\" Yukiko said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What did I just say about that??\" Chie snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I know. But if it wasn't for you...and later, the others...that's how I would still think of myself. The only time I could laugh was around you. You were the only reason I could really enjoy myself.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko...\" Chie sighed. \"You know...you made me stronger when I was with you too. You remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm-hmmm. Its what you said after you saved me...hahaha...from myself! Saved me from myself!\" Yukiko giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie rolled her eyes, then gasped as she felt something soft pressing close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...the shadow...said you were my prince. One of my princes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...and that I wasn't good enough.\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she doesn't know what she's talking about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm not your prince?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princes are male, you know. And its true, you act strong and courageous and cool like Yu and Yosuke...But you're still a girl. You don't pretend to be anything else like Naoto-chan. You're way too cute to be a true Prince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" Chie suddenly found herself without a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I guess I'll compromise. The others can be my princes. And you can just be my hero.\" Yukiko laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't...Marie say that was 'heroine'?\" Chie said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. Chie...I need your help! I'm still...well, I still want to...but you won't let me! So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Wait. Are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my hero, right? You need to save me when I'm in distress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko, come on, we...err...we can't...what if they come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I need you, Chie. I won't...force you..if..but I..if your willing...I need you so bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause. Then, with a drawn in breath, Chie tentatively sought out the naked girl's lips. There was heavy breathing, fumbling in the dark, a tongue dueling her own, and surprisingly aggressive arms pulling at her jacket. Off the shoulders, down her arms, on the floor. A yellow top, black sports bra, shorts and panties joined it in short order. The last thought Chie had before getting lost in skin, and warmth, and wetness, and pleasure was that Yukiko had never been all that sad when Chie drove off all those boys even back then.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Somewhere in the sea of sensations and hungry lust there was a vague feeling of discontent within Yukiko. After all, she was the one that had coaxed and prodded the lithe form of Chie out of her clothes and towards providing the brunette the attention she so desperately desired. So how was it that Yukiko found herself in a sitting position pressed up against one of the wooden pillars, her back arched so that her breasts were thrusting out provocatively, her legs rising up in the air and parted with the thinner form of her best friend pressed so incredibly tightly against her own? Wasn't she supposed to be in control right now? How was it that Chie was the one guiding the pace, her tiny figure moving like a hungry serpent across the innkeepers body, her sopping wet sex locked snuggly against Yukiko's own, her smaller breasts embracing the brunette's large orbs and hardened nipples, and her eager lips sniffling Yukiko's intense moans? How could she undulate her body with such skill, her clit moving in and out with one gentle thrust after another, the ripple rising up Chie's tiny form in perfect harmony to rub her nipples against Yukiko's sensitive orbs and guiding her tongue deep into Yukiko's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie! D-don't...I'm going to...\" Yukiko pled desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! I'll just...\" Chie whispered as her right hand removed itself from Yukiko's butt and began rubbing her lower region with renewed vigor even as she adjusted her thrusts. In mere moments both girls came to a shuddering burst of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what's the score?\" Chie said, looking a little smug as Yukiko recovered from the mutual orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How-how should I know?!?\" Yukiko whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking 2 to 5...maybe 6.\" Chie said, nodding to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...isn't fair! I should be the one...to be...\" Yukiko said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? On top? Sorry, Yuki-chan. No can do. You can't get me fired up with all that 'hero' talk and expect me to just stand still! You gotta play to win in this situation! Besides...with all the training I do to perfect my kicks, shouldn't you have realized how...em...good my hips are?\" Chie said, laughing at the blush her words inspired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea just how embarrassing this is for me?\" Yukiko whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. The way you keeping blushing and gasping and hiding your face makes it really obvious! And I don't think you understand just how cute you look right before you...umm...get off, all desperate and embarrassed like that! It was so amazing seeing it back in the hallway! I wanna see you make that face as many times as I can!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't fair! Your enjoying this way too much!\" Yukiko stuttered. \"What if they come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax. All the noise Rise makes when she's excited we let us hear them coming from a mile away! We probably have time for at least one or two more, really.\" Chie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko blushed. \"This still isn't fair! The ghost is making me enjoy this way too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So you wouldn't normally like having-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! I mean...probably! Or...maybe? I just don't normally...get this worked up! I've never...been able to do this more than one time in a row! Its gotta be because of the curse!\" Yukiko said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true?\" Chie whispered. \"Are you sure you just don't enjoy being with someone? After all, how much experience have you had with this kind of stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how much have you had??\" Yukiko snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a lot.\" Chie shrugged. \"But I'm not the one on record as trying to 'score a hot stud', am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't bring that up! That doesn't count at all!\" Yukiko stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh? You sure Teddie isn't on to something? After all, weren't you trying to tell everyone your true feelings?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop! I'm not...I'm not a pervert! I don't enjoy doing things like this! I don't like...scoring with people, or being caught naked or being spanked or...or....\" Yukiko trailed off. \"Just shut up! Its all because of this ghost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...I'll try to believe you.\" Chie said softly. \"Whatever the case...has the curse 'calmed down' yet, or does the damsel in 'distress' still need her hero?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko stared at her, glanced down at herself, then turned her head sideways with an enormous blush. \"I need more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't quite hear that...\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I NEED MORE.\" Yukiko snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lady.\" Chie quipped, shifting her body so that her butt was sticking high in the air while her face was near the floor, her lips lapping at Yukiko's waiting slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were so engrossed in one another that they both failed to notice when the stealthy camera crew abducted all of Chie's clothes out of the room. Instead, their first warning that something was amiss was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The silence came to an abrupt end as the shrill sound of a ringing telephone cut through the darkness. The pair of naked girls froze in surprise and confusion, their bodies paralyzed in the compromising dance they had been engaged in mere moments before. Their eyes met as a second ring blared through the room, their forms pressed up so tightly that they could feel the rapid beating of each other's hearts...and a more desperate pulsing coming from more intimate places. With a painful sense of hesitation and suffering Chie slowly disengaged herself from her best friend, pushing aside every instinct she had to ignore the piercing noise and continue touching and feeling her best friend's exposed body. The pair found themselves caught up in one last stare as Chie rose to her feet, each still a little awe-struck by the other's beautiful naked form. Another ringing broke the spell, Chie turning her head away and covering her body with her hands while Yukiko unsteadily rose to her feet and did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-seriously, who would call at a time like this?\" Chie muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-probably Naoto. We should answer it.\" Yukiko whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the girls trembled a little. Each had been very close to a climax, which added to their sense of disorientation and feelings of lust. Their situation was made all the worse by the arousing agents in Yukiko's system, which magnified their natural desires to intense levels. After making such intimate contact with her childhood friend Chie was starting to feel the impact of those chemicals, though not yet as intensely as Yukiko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right. I'll, uh, gather up my things...you take the call...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko nodded and approached the phone, her hands still covering her body (though she did give a nice view of her butt to Chie). For a moment she felt an inexplicable spike of apprehension. In a horror movie, there would be something sinister waiting on the other end of the phone. But that was a silly cliche. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?\" Yukiko asked as she picked up the phone. She heard breathing and static on the other end. In the background she could hear Chie fumbling around in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Hello? Are you there? I'm sorry, this connection isn't good...\" Yukiko tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she heard something else. A low, drawn out laugh coming from the phone. Female. Familiar. The laugh of Miss Yamano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo.\" Yukiko moaned. \"M-miss Yamano.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Chie pause and rise to her feet, the wood flooring creaking softly as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Yuki-chan! Have you been enjoying yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko trembled, unable to summon her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for all the clothes, Yuki. This place can be so cold. Its nice to have extra layers. Though you aren't quite my size... such a thin, cute little girl you are. Such a naughty girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-p-p-please!\" Yukiko finally stammered. \"Please! No more! I-I can't take any more! I-I don't want to be naked anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor thing. It isn't easy, is it? Getting caught out. Exposed. Your public image destroyed. Everyone knowing what a bad, dirty girl you really are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop! I'm n-not naughty or dirty or-or anything like that! I don't deserve this! Please, just l-leave me alone! S-stop cursing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother prolonged laugh from the phone. Chie was by Yukiko' side by this point, a hand on her shoulder. Yukiko held the receiver out to her, and both girls timidly pressed their faces close together to both hear the voice coming over the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a liar.\" Yamano whispered. \"You act so very innocent and pure around others. But when no one is looking you are so very wicked and dirty. We know what you do in private, Yukiko Amagi. The dead see everything. We know what you and your little friend were doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair glanced at each other in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you were watching us?\" Chie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. What else is there to do but watch? We know who you really are, naughty girls. And we want everyone to see who you really are. That's why I take your clothes. That's why I fill you with lust. There isn't anywhere to hide now, Yuki-chan. You can't deny what you feel or what you are anymore. Neither of you can. Bad girls harboring such lewd thoughts about each other. Now everyone will know the naked truth about both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh yeah?\" Chie piped up despite the wobbling in her knees. \"Well, shows what you know! Yukiko can borrow my skirt and jacket and I'll still have my undershirt and gym shorts! The only one who sees her naked tonight is me!....and Naoto...and Rise...err, anyway! Shows what you know, you undead perv!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a silly girl. So dirty. You haven't even noticed that your clothes are mine now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girl's eyes widened as the words sank in. They began glancing this way and that, Chie running about the room when her discarded clothes did not instantly meet her sight. Yukiko bit her bottom lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...no more.\" Yukiko whispered into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not done playing. I've been so lonely here. And I have so many gifts to give you.\" The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want-\" Yukiko began but the line died with another bought of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko....\" Chie whimpered as she pranced up to her friend, covering herself and fidgeting from foot to foot. \"Everything's gone! I can't find any clothes! We're...we're....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trapped.\" Yukiko finished. \"T-trapped and naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what should we do? What can we dooooo?\" Chie asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dread and anxiety were back. And with the fear reaction came a counter reaction from the chemicals in their blood. The pair began to lightly run their fingers over their naked slits, softly playing with themselves as they contemplated their situation and likely exposure. Yukiko gasped in realization a moment later, looking with alarm at Chie. The athletic girl paused in her own manipulations, a look of dismay crossing her face as the implications set in. They were now both \"cursed\" with nudity and lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...We...We wait for the others. They'll have something for me to wear. We can get you some clothes when I get back to my room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That sounds good! No one will see us as long as we stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was suddenly a loud rattling noise in the room. Both girls paused, looked around, and located the source as coming from a chest of drawers in one corner. Carefully Yukiko made her way across the dark room, cover herself and walking on tip toe as if trying to surprise the sound. Chie followed closely behind her, one hand on her shoulder and the other alternately covering her sex and playing with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another rattle from the drawer. Sucking in a breath, Yukiko yanked the drawer open and stared at the contents. Chie glanced at her, then at the drawer, and back. Finally she reached into the drawer and produced a large rod in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez. Who the hell leaves their freaking dildo lying around in their hotel room like this?\" Chie said, shaking her head and sighing with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...that's the one...from school. The one in my bag!\" Yukiko whispered in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Are you....are you sure?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the dildo sprang to manic life, vibrating intensely in Chie's hand. With a shriek the blonde girl dropped the instrument and fled behind the naked brunette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....So much for being my hero.\" Yukiko deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut up!\" Chie snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko laughed to herself. The laughter died a moment later as the dildo began to rise up into the air. Both girls gaped in horror as the sex toy floated up and up until it was level with their eyes. Yukiko was trembling. Was this the 'gift' Yamano had given her? It was just so....huge! So long and big and thick...how could it possibly fit inside....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly half aware of her actions, Yukiko slowly reached out a trembling finger and lightly touched the edge of the floating monstrosity, as if to confirm it was real. Immediately, the device began vibrating intensely in midair. Whatever trance the pair had been under broke with that response. Screaming, the two girls fled out into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job!\" Kanshi said, glancing at the Yamano voice actress as she removed the microphone headset she had worn to make the phonecall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled and bowed. Wasn't much for conversation, that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are we doing the dildo thing? Wires?\" An intern asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnets, actually. Made of a material that responds to certain magnetic frequencies. We can make it float and move around. And of course, we can remotely activate it.\" Kanshi said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. So...now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else?\" Kanshi said as he flipped a switch. The door to the room the two girls exited obediently locked itself behind them. The pair of horny teens were now trapped naked in the open hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She and Chie made it down the hall and around the corner before the sounds of a commotion down the hall finally registered to their minds. A few important realizations followed. One, they had just fled into an open hallway with various guests and staff wandering around. Two, their screaming appeared to have alerted at least one room full of these people. The third, and most important revelation (one that sank in as they simultaneously looked down at themselves, switched their gaze to their friend's female body, then whimpered in unison as their hands came up to hide what they could of themselves) the two of them were completely naked in a place neither of them wanted to be caught without clothes! Just as quickly their bare feet ran back to their previous location. Yukiko stood by, knowing full well what was coming, though her misery was no less savage as Chie was unable to open the door to the haunted room they had just vacated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko...\" Chie whimpered, the pair of naked girls standing on tip toe, hands covering their breasts and pussies, each visibly trembling and offer the other panicked looks. \"They heard us! We're naked and they heard us and there's nowhere to hide!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-sh-shut up! No one is finding us! Th-they can't! We need to go!\" Yukiko whispered, grabbing Chie's hand and pulling her down the opposite end of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair fled through the hallways, seemingly just moments before some new guest was about to exit a room and discover them. Dodging around corners and dashing down halls faster than either thought possible was the only thing keeping their dignity in tact. Suddenly they found themselves in a long hallway, voices at either end indicating people were just around the corner and coming towards them! They were TRAPPED!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" Yukiko said, pointing at a small alcove with a tiny bookcase in the center of it. In desperation, the pair ran behind the shelf and hid on their hands and knees, praying their flimsy hiding spot would not be discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiting was agony. Loud voices filled the hallway, seemingly endless footsteps marched up and down, shadows of innumerable people moved passed their hiding place. Dozens of times someone seemed to pause, and Yukiko felt a stab of panic as she was certain they were discovered. Yet each time the person passed by, apparently none the wiser. At long last the last person seemed to leave the hallway. Yukiko sighed in relief....only to gasp as something warm and soft pressed against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie?!?\" Yukiko whispered as felt her friend's naked skin pressing against her leg and butt. With an alarming level of persistence and a worrying lack of resistance on Yukiko's part Chie pushed her legs a little wider and pressed her throbbing sex up against Yukiko's own as if one were trying to kiss the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Chie, no...we can't now! If we get caught...\" Yukiko protested, making no physical effort to pull away from her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I just...can't...help it! We were almost c-caught, a-and all I've been able to look at is your bottom in the air and that dripping, pretty little...it feels really good and things were so tense and- and-\" Chie moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko blushed. Her willpower was too frayed to deny the girl pressing herself up so intimately and softly whispering begging pleas in her ear. \"J-j-just try to stay low and don't be too loud!\" She whispered after only a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanshi smiled from ear to ear, whistling a tuneless sound to himself as he casually activated a small motor beneath the bookshelf they hid behind. A tiny motor and hidden wheels caused the shelf to move from the center of the alcove off to the one side. Instantly the two girls were transformed from a pair of desperately horny but still somewhat discreet lovers to a pair of total sluts brazenly humping in a hallway where any passerby could see them. With Yukiko bent over on all fours and Chie on her knees behind her, the pair thrusting their sexes in and out of the other, their eyes closed and faces masks of complete ecstacy, they were totally unaware of their exposure until....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair froze a moment, eyes shooting open and staring into the bemused face of Rise and her camera phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLASH! FLASH! FLASH! FLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto hung back to one side, hiding her face in complete mortification at the antics of her friends. She held two skimpy hotsprings towels in her hands. Oddly, both she and the grinning Rise were clad only in towels themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-stop it!\" Yukiko moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. As soon as you two get up and stop your little performance, I'll stop taking pictures!\" Rise said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't performing!\" Chie snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise shrugged and smiled, waiting for the pair. Yukiko felt the blood pumping in her veins and burning on her face, her wet nether regions still quivering in delight at the contact with Chie...and impatiently thrumming for more. Her blush turned redder as she glanced behind her, seeing the same desperate need in Chie's eyes. Trembling with absolutely humiliation, the pair began their stimulating dance once again, realizing to their shame that the pleasure was all the more intense knowing they now had an audience. After a few minutes and as many hundreds of pictures Rise's camera phone could snap documenting their carnal degeneration the pair finally came to a shuddering release. The pair rose to their feet, their heads bowed and bodies beat red. Belatedly they covered their naked forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...your terrible.\" Yukiko at last choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww. Don't be that way. I'm just snapping some pics of our historical town Inn. Its not MY fault a pair of nymphos got caught doing something they shouldn't out in the open!\" Rise said with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it the curse has somehow spread?\" Naoto said with a sigh. \"Please, use these to dry yourselves off and wrap yourself up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of embarrassed girls dried off their sweat and love juices, wrapping the towels around themselves. A moment later they were blinded by a cloud of flowery smelly vapor coming from a large spray can being held by Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you guys smell like sex. Like, seriously, we practically could track you from the other side of the Inn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were blushing and refused to make eye contact. At last, yukiko broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we only dressed in towels?\" She asked at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plausible deniability. We didn't have access to your wardrobe, so we had to improvise. If anyone finds us, we're four lost girls looking for the hotspring. We almost went to the wrong location and walked in on the men bathing due to your confusion about the hour of the night.\" Naoto explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would possibly believe that?\" Yukiko demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone who knows you, of course.\" Rise noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, we will venture to the baths, I and Rise will redress and gather some clothes for the two of you once we know your are safe and not in danger of being discovered in places inappropriate for being naked, and be done with this ordeal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in the meantime, we walk around the hallways dressed in nothing but towels?\" Chie asked. \"Great plan there, Detective Prince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's eye twitched slightly. \"By all means, if you object to the plan, feel free to abandon you towel and take your chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie cringed. Rise laughed. Yukiko shrugged and silently prayed their ordeal was truly over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yukiko contemplated the soft white towel that now enfolded her naked body. She stood on tiptoe, still feeling the telltale wobble in her knees in the aftermath of the glorious orgasm she had shared with Chie moments before. Her skin was still flushed with the pure shame and erotic excitement of the past hour (had it really only been an hour ago she had arrived clothed and with her dignity....it felt like 100 years ago). There was still a quiver from her nether regions, asking for more attention, and she could feel the fabric of the towel rubbing against her erect nipples. Her relief at once more being clothed, even if just a little, was hampered by her unease. First, the towels her Inn provided to their guests were not meant to provide modesty- usually guests used them to wash and perhaps cover the front or back of their person if they were feeling shy. Wrapping the towel around the body was only possible due to how thin the four girls were, and even then there was not enough material available to truly wrap the garment fully around themselves- Yukiko and the others were grasping the top and bottom of the towel to ensure it didn't fall off their bodies. Moreover, the towel was slightly too small to cover everything. The best it could manage was barely hiding the nipples while allowing a generous amount of cleavage while hinting at the first curve of the butt cheek below. Yukiko was holding her towel defensively in place with her right hand over her crotch, for fear it was not entirely hiding her secrets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we?\" Naoto broke the silence. \"Towel or no, I'd rather avoid being seen as much as possible in this state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if...something else happens?\" Yukiko whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" Naoto paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ghost...she's...s-stripped me before. She made a nightgown disappear right off my body! She whipped a tablecloth off me last night. And....and you all know what she did to my underwear at school!\" Yukiko moaned in embarrassment. \"What if she does something to the towels? What's the plan if we get stripped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable under the circumstances, Amagi-san, but you are sounding paranoid.\" Naoto said. \"I doubt the spirit has the power or inclination to try such a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NAOTO!\" Yukiko squeeled, closing her eyes and preparing to feel her towel vanish into the ether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanshi indeed had his finger hovering over what his staff affectionately called the \"poof\" button. He could easily leave all four girls naked in the hallway any moment he chose. But an audience wants variety, and a master of suspense leaves his characters small opportunities to relax between the horror. A horny and embarrassed Amagi was the goal, not one so bombarded by humiliation she became shellshocked. Besides, it wasn't as if walking through the Inn in skimpy towels was a major step up in the embarrassment ladder from butt naked. He could wait, even if the thought of four hot, naked teenage girls to torment put a smile on his face.</span></div></div>",

As far as they could see the chaotic mass of humanity swarmed, guests hauling luggage or gathering keys, staff scurying everywhere on a thousand errands, cooks trying to deliver their products, and on it went. Yukiko noted with a sinking feeling that the number of guests had surely tripled since she had taken her ill fated shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our plan is to go through that...\" Chie continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls glanced down at their attire. Fluffy white towels clung tightly to their frames, held in place by white knuckled hands. The cleavage each girl had on display was almost obscene, the towel wrapped so tightly around their bodies it actually squeezed the breasts and exaggerated their apparent proportions beyond their already generous size. Even Chie, the smallest bus size, stood out in this regard. Alas, the towel only barely covered their lower half, offering a hint of each girl's butt cheek. Any attempt to cover above or above the waste more completely would mean exposing the other side too much for decency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...dressed like this.\" Chie finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto cleared her throat. \"Correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Aren't you supposed to be the smart one?\" Chie muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to think on my feet! Rise had no objection!\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah! I got to tease Amagi here about being in a towel! That doesn't mean I was super excited to go back down there like this! Besides..it didn't look so crowded on the way up...\" Rise whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you said, Rise-chan...we didn't have this many guests last night. All these people started arriving after word spread that I was seen naked! All of those people came here hoping it would happen again! We're going to walk through a crowd that came here to leer at undressed high school girls!\" Yukiko said, squeeking the last part out in a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" Rise paused. \"S-somehow that seemed a lot funnier when it was just teasing you and we still had clothes on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow...\" Yukiko echoed. \"We...we should get going. Standing around will just draw more attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it already had. As the four made their way down the stairs they were greeted with whistles and suppressed snickering. Yukiko pressed her legs tightly together, instinctively rising on her tip toes and timidly making her way down the hall. She felt the familiar sensation of every eye upon her, and she was certain at least a few cell phones were snapping pictures. She trembled a little as a stab of arousal threatened to bring her to her knees, but she kept her footing. Not here. Please not here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! There you are!\" A familiar voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho could it be.</span></div></div>",

Her fame having spread throughout the nation, her fanbase included just about every teenage boy, obviously, but also included a large amount of teenage girls as well as a not-insignificant number of adults.  Fortunately, for her numerous fans, it wasn't that difficult to get a glimpse of the teenage hearthrob.  Rise's face, (and more importantly to some, her body,) could be seen throughout various commercials, music videos, live events, and also in the occasional calender/promo art book, all dressed up in a variety of outfits and costumes designed to maximize her sexy factor, swimsuits included.

Every talk show host and tabloid was clamoring to get an exclusive interview with the idol, and every venue was just as eagerly hoping for a chance to boast that it would show a \"one time only\" exclusive show by the performer. So far, Rise had turned down every single request, refusing to let herself be swayed by any paycheck or benefits she was offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Rise found the letter secreted into her locker, with the long list of students supporting the idea of a Risette performance, she found her resolve shaken. Surely there couldn't be any harm in doing a little show for her home town, and it was the least she could do to show she appreciates and remembers her roots. So, against her better judgment, Rise made a few calls and cashed in a few favors to get everything ready. If Risette was going to do a special show, she was going to make sure it was done right! Never let it be said that the idol did anything halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that Rise found herself backstage in the school auditorium. The entire student body and faculty were present, along with a fair portion of Inaba's adult population. There was no denying that the audience was eager to see their homegrown idol perform. And, just as she would before any show, Rise was fighting her nerves. No amount of practice and exposure to the industry could ever seem to fully conquer Rise's last minute jitters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's fine, Rise, these are your friends and classmates, you see most of these people every day!</i> Rise thought to herself. <i>Heck, some of them even helped put this all together!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. A group of Yasogami students had volunteered to help with the concert preparation, citing their adoration of Rise. However, their true motives were far from altruistic. Truth be told, the group of students were motivated by jealousy and perverted desires. Some of them wanted to knock Rise down a peg, unhappy at being knocked down the social ladder themselves by the far more popular girl's arrival. Most of them simply wanted a chance to get a once-in-a-lifetime look at Rise in all her glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the guise of friendly aid, sabotaging the performance was a trivial affair. A few interesting surprises were in store for Risette as she finally stepped out onto the stage, greeted by thunderous applause.

What she and all of us would like to know is what precisely that would entail?\" Naoto said, trying to keep her voice calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I thought it would be perfectly obvious. But if you insist....It means that the Yasogami High Beauty Pageant, the most important event of our school's festival and the highlight of the semester, has been rendered invalid and must be judged once again.\" Miss Kashiwagi said, a hint of glee leaking into her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Invalid? What does that mean?? Everybody already voted! We beat you fair and square!\" Rise chimed in, crossing her arms and glaring at the teacher. She and her trio of girlfriends had walked to school together as usual, but had found their classroom empty save for the jealous cougar they had for a teacher waiting for them. And she had a bad feeling about where this was going....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they did vote.\" Kashiwagi said, her eyes flashing with anger. \"Unfortunately, they voted for someone who neglected to show up for the final event! Hence, the contest was invalidated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...You can't do that! That event was humiliating enough with my clothes on!\" Naoto said. \"I...I can't subject myself to that again! I refuse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is precisely the problem. Miss Yasogami High is SUPPOSED to be the charming representative of our school to the people of Inaba and the rest of the country! We can't have her disappearing without notice whenever she gets a little shy of the crowd. Furthermore, as a contestant myself who had the courage to stand up with the other competition and submit myself to the scrutiny of the audience I ABSOLUTELY refuse to see the award go to sole coward in the group that couldn't be bothered to put her good looks on the line. Who's to say what the audience would have thought if they had actually seen the pasty little detective 'prince' in action next to my perfect figure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Didn't you come in dead last in the poll? Even Hanako scored better.\" Yukiko pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT!\" Kashiwagi thundered, slamming her hands on the desk and startling all four girls. \"The POINT is that the Pageant was effectively ruined, and after a lengthy debate our principal finally agrees with that analysis. Therefore, we are going to do a little recount. As far as you four are concerned, the last contest never happened! We're going to do it again, properly this time. I've personally selected a swimsuit for each of you which will highlight what miniscule charms your underdeveloped bodies have, which I will be LOANING to each of you and expect to have back on my desk before my lunch hour. The students are already assembled. I am personally going to escort each of you to the auditorium, you are going to present yourselves to the school, take a moment to greet the audience and highlight why you deserve the title of Miss Yasogami High, and wait for the audience to vote!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! That was humiliating!\" Chie snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do whatever you want! I don't have any need for the title! I-I won't be dragged into this again!\" Naoto snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko simply blushed in silence and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Rise seemed composed. In fact, she flashed a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? That's all we have to do? Heh! No problem! Bring in on! I'm surprised you want to risk getting shamed by us all over again, but I'm always happy to do a repeat performance!\" Rise said, her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three girls glowered at her. Kashiwagi glared, then sat back in her chair. \"Oh, I'm not competing today. The vote clearly indicated that you four were the biggest deadlock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Okay then!\" Rise said, a little less confidently. What was she playing at if not a chance to show them all up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you other three....do you really want to draw this line in the sand? Miss Satonaka, your grades are a disaster. You don't need your odds of graduation any more stacked against you. As for Miss Amagi and Miss Shirogane...do I need to remind either of you how you spent weeks upon weeks on end away from school with barely an explanation provided to either the school or the police? In addition, Amagi has missed several more days due to her family business, and I don't think I need to remind MISS Shirogane that she originally claimed to be a boy when she transferred here. And of course, if our little superstar gets any second thoughts, let me just remind her that she has missed just as much school as our innkeeper and ace detective...and her grades are even more dismal than our kung fu expert here. There are things your school teachers have kindly been overlooking up until now. So...can any of you afford to make me angry?\" Kashiwagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the girls dared to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. Now strip.\" Kashiwagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer order was met with a chorus of horrified protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are NOT having a repeat of the previous contest. I will be keeping your things...ALL your things, here at my desk, locked and safe. I will return your clothes to you when we are done here. If any of you are still nervous about going up on stage and want to run for it, I suggest you consider the prospect of having to spend your whole school day wearing your skimpy little suit, to say nothing of having to march through Inaba wearing all that skin and having to explain yourself to your parents. And yes, I'll be happy to correct any embellishments to the story upon request.\" Kashiwagi snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls were blushing furiously now. Even Rise, despite her bravado, was blushing crimson and the prospect of being naked in front of her homeroom teacher right in the middle of their classroom, empty or not. Ironically, Rise was in many ways as shy and timid as Naoto when it came to her body, a trait she had been shamed and taunted for in her early years. Showbusiness had never really eliminated or even reduced her shyness and insecurities, but it had taught her to cope with them. Flamboyant displays of emotion and enthusiasm allowed her to sidestep her terrors by essentially leaping headlong into situations that could otherwise terrify or embarrass her. She suffered through a number of bikini shoots this way, getting it all down to a science. But there were some parts of her body even she could not bluff her way past her mortification in exposing, a fact her Shadow had known and exploited by making it the central theme of her dungeon. Now she found herself trembling even as her fingers mechnically removed unbuttoned her blouse and pulled off the ribbon from her neck. As if she was in a dream she opened her shirt and pulled it off her shoulders, unzipping her skirt in a similar dazed fashion. Her progress slowed when she got to her underwear. She felt herself fidgeting from foot to foot, biting her lip. It wasn't until she noticed the looks of her friends, standing naked and blushing and covering themselves while glaring at her with consternation that she forced herself to unclip her bra and let it fall to the floor. One hand covering her not inconsiderable breasts, she used the other to strip off her sheer panties and step out of them as her off hand hid her shaven inner folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKashiwagi watched the mini-drama unfold, a look of malicious satisfaction on her face. \"Good. Now hurry up and put them on my desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise blushed as she bent down and gathered up her clothes. She and the others placed them on the desk then returned to their places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....those postures aren't proper for Yasogami students. Stop bending over, put your hands at your sides, straighten your shoulders, and place your feet apart. NOW!\" Kashiwagi snapped as she casually examined each garment in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls obeyed except Rise and Naoto. Their hands simply refused to reveal their charms. Kashiwagi stopped her inspection, gathered up a large ruler and repeated her instruction. When only Naoto obeyed she instantly strode around her desk and was upon Rise in a few strides. The idol shrieked in surprise as her butt was painfully smacked with the ruler. Even after her hands had fallen into place and all her secret were laid bare the spankings continued until her cheeks were as rosy as her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor thing. I doubt the little thong you'll be wearing can hide that. Oh well. Spare the rod....\" Kashiwagi said as she strode back to her desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls stood at naked attention as Kashiwagi slowly (agonizingly) put each of their garments into a metal cabinet and locked it. Rise couldn't help but wince as the bolt went into place. The sound had a sense of finality to it.</span></div></div>",

Though the common, down-to-earth appearance of her in the tofu shop was presenting herself naturally, away from all the glamour and false appearances in show business, this wasn't her true self either.  It was something she had been coming to terms with recently, ever since she was rescued from the world inside the TV.  Risette, the cheery, sexy celebrity, and Rise, ordinary high-school girl and tofu shop worker were both parts of her, so why did she have to feel like she was smothering a part of herself when committing to either image?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise sighed as she looked through the shop door out onto the empty street.  She liked her downtime well enough, but she was starting to get bored.  And all this introspection was making her uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise?\" a voice from behind asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma?\" Rise turned around.  \"What is it?  Is something wrong in the back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Rise's grandmother replied.  \"We're just running low on ingredients, so I was going to go buy some more.  Will you be okay with looking after the shop while I'm gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course,\" Rise replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  I'll be back as soon as I can, though from how things have been, I'd be surprised if we had even a single customer today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheer up, grandma.  Maybe business will pick up while you're gone.  See you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Rise's grandmother left the shop, leaving Rise alone with her thoughts again.  Soon enough, it was back to her earlier train of thought.  Rise... Risette... they were both her, so they shouldn't really be that different, right?  If only she could combine these two facets of herself, maybe then this wouldn't be so confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's eyes shot open, considering that last bit.  Maybe there <i>was</i> a way to combine the two...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her grandmother out and no customers around, the perfect opportunity presented itself.  Rushing through the back of the shop to her own room, a plan took shape in her mind; a plan to present a Rise that encompassed all her selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her room, Rise looked at herself in the mirror.  This was the first, and arguably most important step: putting together an outfit that would combine the vivacious Risette and plain ol' Rise.  If done right, then the rest would start to fall into place.  Looking at her options, Rise decided to-</span></div></div>",

Practiced at quickly changing from her idol work, Rise was standing in front of her mirror in just her underwear in no time. The starlet couldn't deny that she cut an impressive figure standing there in her lacy orange undergarments. That definitely fulfilled the Risette aspect of her look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking the apron back up, Rise quickly tied it around herself once more. Appraising herself in the mirror, Rise was satisfied with what she saw. From the front, everything seemed innocent enough. At most, someone would assume she was wearing shorts and a tank top, but a view of her sides or from behind would disprove that theory in an instant. It was naughty, it was risque, and Rise was loving it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just like that, Rise and Risette are fused into one!\" Rise said to herself happily as she skipped out of her room and back to the store front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thrill went up Rise's spine as she took her place at the register. The shop was still dead, with no signs of changing, but that didn't lessen the excitement from this little stunt of hers.

There you are!\" yelled the blonde, burly teen that just barged into the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kanji!\" Rise gasped, thrown completely off-guard.  She was hoping to try out her experiment on a completely random stranger, not one of her friends!  \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing here?\" Kanji asked.  \"What are you doing here?  Didn't you get the message?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Message?\" Rise asked, realizing that she hadn't checked her phone recently and was away from it while changing her clothes.  Sure enough, there was an unread text message from Yu, their leader of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Everyone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmergency meeting at Junes.  Please get here ASAP.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" said Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, glad I decided to check if you were still at work.  Everyone's probably there by now, so let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kanji, I can't just leave,\" Rise said, surreptitiously backing up towards the door.  \"Grandma's out, so I have to at least lock up first,\" <i>That, and I'm wearing next to nothing under this apron!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that won't be a problem, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's eyes went wide.  It was her grandmother, back from her errands.  \"Grandma?  You're back already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be able to the rest from here.  You go have fun with your friends,\" she said, as she moved back into the backroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Kanji cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kanji, I need to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we're already late,\" he yelled, running towards Rise and grabbing her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kanji, wha- HEY!\" Rise cried out as Kanji started pulling her out the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but it's time to haul ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise struggled to stay in place, but the momentum was too much, and she was soon outside the shop and down the street.  There weren't any people around at the moment, but Rise felt exposed all the same.  \"Kanji!\" Rise yelled, forcing her hand out of his grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was fuming.  If only Kanji had just given her a minute to get decent, but now it was too late.  She kept her shoes on so she could move around fine, but as for everything else... They had already made it to the end of the shopping district and were just a stones throw away from Junes.  Since this apparently was an emergency, there wouldn't be enough time to go back and change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, she had wanted to test this out for real, and she was still just as covered in the back as she would be on the beach.  Still, running around town like this was a bit much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh well, whatever happened from now on, she decided to hold Kanji directly responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't just grab a girl's hand and force her along like that!\" she scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know that, dammit!\" Kanji said sheepishly, turning out of shame.  \"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still needed to return my work apron you dummy!\" she said.  \"You don't see Yosuke running around the TV in his, or Yukiko in her kimono, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... sorry.  Should we go back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, too late now.  We're already late aren't we, now let's go!\" Rise said, signaling Kanji forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Kanji replied, confused, but running ahead once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon found themselves at Junes, where there actually were people milling about in the lobby, doing their own thing.  Rise stayed calm, keeping her back away from them as Kanji called the elevator.  The doors opened, and the pair entered, with Rise taking a deep breath first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, up to the roof.  Huh, what's their rush?\" Kanji spoke, as several people sprinted into the elevator after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise knew though, confirmed when the people continued to look at her and not turn towards the front as one always would in the elevator.  They saw her scantily-clad backside as she entered, and were wanting to see more.  She began to grow nervous.  Surrounded by these kind of guys in an elevator with no way out was not a good situation to be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's your deal, huh?\" Kanji spoke, eyeing one of the strangers threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" the man sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a problem with us?\" he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no problem at all!\" the man stuttered, him and the other strangers immediately turning toward the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise silently exhaled in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator soon reached the rooftop, and the strangers, still intimidated by Kanji, quickly left the elevator first.  Kanji and Rise then headed out, heading to their usual table where the rest of the Investigation Team was already waiting.  \"Sorry to keep you guys waiting,\" Rise said, taking her usual seat on the bench while keeping her back away from the team members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry for the holdup,\" said Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, we just got here too,\" said Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise, did we get you during a bad time?  You're still wearing your apron,\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can thank Kanji for that,\" Rise snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I said I was sorry,\" said Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone,\" Yu spoke up, stopping their talk.  \"Thank you for making it here on such short notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, so what's the big emergency?\" Yosuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is very important,\" said Yu.  \"I've been checking our equipment, and it's out of date.  It's been forever since we did this last, so it's time to get lots of materials from the TV World so that Daidara can make some new gear for us.  The shadows are growing tougher, so we need to be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMutters of assent went around the table.  Rise was annoyed, though.  How was a farming run a big emergency?  Such a big deal out of nothing, though perhaps she just felt that way because she was merely support and as such never got any new equipment to wear, so runs like these were not nearly as exciting as diving in to save someone, explore new territory, or to specifically hunt a tough shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the silver lining at least was that she would be away from prying eyes in the TV world.  Prying eyes that she noticed were all around her.  None of the watchers were close to the table, thanks to the team being in a large group, but she could feel them nonetheless.  She wondered what they were thinking right now.  Considering how those elevator goons acted, she was starting to get second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go,\" Yu said, and everyone got up from their seats.  Rise did likewise, following up the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, none of the people upstairs followed them into the electronics department, and no regular customers were around, so entering the TV unseen was no problem.  Rise landed last within the middle of the circle, quickly picking herself up and backing herself up near the exit.  It probably wouldn't matter much if her friends saw like this, really.  After all, her shadow was wearing a bikini when they rescued her, so it's not like they would be seeing anything people hadn't already seen.  But then there would be questions of why, and she wasn't comfortable with or sure enough explaining to them yet.  Well, Yu-senpai maybe, he seemed to understand her the best, but there was still a ways to go before that!  Anyways, it was fine.  She'd deal with it if it happened, but hardly anyone was ever behind her, so it's likely they won't ever know.  Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept these thoughts in mind as Yu brought up their plan for the gathering run, and they began today's mission.  Their first destination was-</span></div></div>",

Its former master was long since gone, but the air was just as thick with hot, moist steam as it was before, slowly flowing out the entrance.  No doubt the inside was just as thick with Shadows, but they were confident that they wouldn't be a problem even with their outdated equipment, as a quick scan from Rise confirmed.  The team split up, with Yu, Yosuke, Chie, and Naoto heading inside, while Yukiko, Kanji, and Teddie waited outside as backup with Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise summoned her persona and began relaying information to the team as she always did.  However, with such weak enemies being fought, she began to grow lax, her mind subconsciously beginning to wonder.  Not helping was that none of her friends outside were being particularly talkative either, especially Kanji, who always seemed nervous around this place.  It made sense though, as she, Yukiko, and Naoto also had similar reservations with their Shadow's dungeons.  But even though she could sympathize, She couldn't help but wonder just what had happened here.  If it was anything like her own experience...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Rise could continue her speculation, she noticed something odd.  Yu and the others' presences in the dungeon were diminishing.  That never happened before!  Pushing further with her persona, she felt something clouding up her vision.  Flinching, she pulled back and performed a wider area scan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face grimaced as she saw the results.  All vision from the 4th floor onwards, where the party had just entered, had become blurry!  She could still feel her friends, but their signatures were getting fainter with every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise-chan!\" Yukiko's voice shouted, shattering her concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" Rise gasped, as her vision returned to that of the dungeon's entrance area.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With everyone's eyes looking at her with confused looks on their faces, Rise had a fair idea of what happened.  With a slight gulp, she stared down and saw that her apron had indeed become soaked through by the steam.  While the apron may have been thick enough to still hide her skin even in this wet state, the bright orange color of her underwear shone through like a neon-lit sign.  Now they all knew, which made her feel so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, how did she feel exactly?  Sure she was embarrassed now that they could see her underwear and knew she was only wearing that underneath the apron, but not that much, now that she thought about it.  She, or rather, her shadow, was wearing just as much when they rescued her, and these were her friends for goodness sake.  And they were all just a few steps away from noticing up until now, it was strange that they hadn't noticed yet, especially Kanji.  Really, she was starting to feel more frustrated at herself for freezing up just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe point was, they now knew, and it wouldn't do any good to try and hide it.  Besides, the whole point of wearing her clothes like that in the shop was to have someone see her like this, so that she would know for sure.  Without an audience to actually test out that look, the entire day would have been nothing more than pointless dress-up!  So, why not have her friends be that audience?  Much better than random elevator creeps any day... and she was not going to let that be her only memory of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like the jig is up,\" Rise said casually, flashing a cheeky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody pinch me, because I must be dreaming!\" Teddie cried out, being the first to react.  \"Why else would Rise-chan be dressed so sexily just for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not for you, Teddie!\" Rise yelled. <i>Of course he would jump straight to the most perverted reason.</i>  \"I was just feeling, er, doing something new to try and help draw in customers for the tofu shop.  See?\" she said, turning and showing her underwear-clad backside to them, to much reaction.  She was pleased to feel some relief at letting them know, and couldn't help but giggle at their surprised gasps, but she still felt too nervous to give the true reason behind her attire, thanks to Teddie just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so this was for business?\" said Yukiko. \"And here I was thinking you ran out of clean laundry except for your underwear today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rise, asked, followed by a weird look from her, Kanji, and Teddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" said Kanji, smacking his forehead.  \"So that's what you meant when you said you needed to return your uniform!  And I just dragged you to Junes flashing your panties everywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not underwear, it's a swimsuit!\"  Rise shouted. \"Geez... well, it's fine though, it's nothing anyone wouldn't have seen if they went to the shop today,\" Rise shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  They make swimsuits with that much lace?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swimsuit, underwear, what's the difference?\" Kanji asked.  \"Aren't you covered up about the same either way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tut, tut, tut,\" Teddie admonished, waggling his glove.  \"Oh, Kanji, you really don't know anything do you?  Of course they're different.  Different as night and day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Kanji said sarcastically.  \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple really.  Swimsuits you can wear in public, but underwear you can't!\" Teddie beamed.  The weird looks now shifted towards him.  \"What?  C'mon you know I'm right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that simple Teddie,\" Yukiko said. \"The difference is that swimsuits are made to handle water, but underwear is not,\" the looks shifted towards her once again.  \"What?  I wouldn't go swimming in my underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just as lame as Teddie's explanation!\" Kanji said, before launching into an argument with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise sighed.  It was a bit of a letdown that their attention had passed so quickly, but also a relief to see her friends arguing about nothing.  Basically they were acting just as they had before they found out about her.  <i>I guess once the shock has passed, there really isn't much of a difference whether I'm fully dressed, in my underwear or somewhere in between.  I'm still me, after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise blinked, and chuckled in realization.  There was no need to try and combine Rise and Risette in her attire, they were combined in her and how she acted!  If anything, all she could learn from this was that work was really, really boring, and that she had a mischievous, naughty streak, both of which were things she already knew about herself.  Also, she felt hot, sweaty, and suddenly remembered that she was still in front of a steamy bathouse dungeon in a saturated apron, and that going back home like that was probably a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better dry this off,\" she said, walking back towards the entrance while the others continued their argument.  Once there, she removed the apron and cap and hung them off the edge of one of the exit TVs, then ran back towards the bathouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got there, she found that-</span></div></div>",

Oh crap!\" she yelled, realizing that she had forgotten something very important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise?  Wah!\" Kanji gasped, the others appropriately reacting in tandem as the idol was now standing before them in just her bright orange bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It still looks like underwear to me...\" said Yukiko.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more apron?  This really must be my birthday!\" Teddie swooned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a swimsuit, and the apron's drying, but neither one's important right now!\" Rise said, some slight red in her cheeks from Teddie's remarks.  \"Earlier I sensed something clouding up my readings and was losing track of everyone, but then I got side-tracked with this!  I just hope I'm not too late,\" she said, scanning with Himiko once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others clammed up instantly, desperately waiting for the results of Rise's scan.  \"Senpai?  Anyone?  Can you hear me?\" Rise asked as she searched and searched, but no response came.  Soon her persona faded away.  \"Well?\" Yukiko asked, breaking the silence that had settled over the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no good,\" Rise shook her head. \"There's no sign of them and I couldn't get ahold of them either.  And just like before, I couldn't penetrate any deeper than the fourth floor from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Teddie gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like there's something... clouding up the area, like this steam.  I can't find them at all like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are we waiting for?\" said Kanji, turning towards the bathouse's front door.  \"We gotta go in there and find them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Rise nodded.  \"Let's go, everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the four of them ran into the dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dungeon didn't seem very different from the last time they were there, according to everyone but Rise, at least.  The monsters were no different and proved virtually no challenge, the layout had changed but not by very much, really the only difference was that the bathouse steam was far thicker than before.  As they continued, Rise tried to scan for the rest of the party again, but found that she could not see further than the fourth floor, despite being closer.  A bad feeling arose through the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the team reached the fourth floor of the dungeon, where they were met with a strange sight.  Unlike the other areas of the dungeon, this hallway was mostly steam-free, leading them to realize just how much the steam was soaking them through earlier.  Rise, quickly shuddering, glanced at herself, and sighed in relief.  Fortunately her underwear was still opaque.  Thank goodness she wasn't wearing white today.  Going through the hallway, they found that it was a very short corridor with the only exit being two separate doors on the far end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?\" Kanji gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Yukiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sniff* I can smell in here!\" said Teddie.  \"No sign of the others though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, this... wasn't part of the dungeon before?\" Rise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh,\" Teddie replied.  \"There was never an area so clear of both steam and the ugly stench of sweat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Yukiko, who had advanced to the end of the hallway, called.  \"Take a look at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team followed and saw what she found: two doors at the end of the hallway.  Each door was completely normal and unremarkable, only sporting a sign on the front of each one.  Upon a closer look, the sign on the left door said \"Entertainers,\" while the one on the right said \"Audience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Entertainers?  Audience?  Is there some kind of show going on in here?\" Kanji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There definitely wasn't anything like this before,\" Yukiko said.  \"Could someone have been thrown in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, can't be,\" said Teddie. \"I would've smelled something.  Maybe the shadows here changed on their own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this was my dungeon, wasn't it?\" Kanji asked.  \"And I know I haven't done anything with it.  Argh!  Whatever, we can't just sit here while Senpai needs us!  Let's just pick one and go through!\" he said, reaching out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Rise shouted, stopping him in his tracks.  \"Before we do, let me check one more time!\" she said as she scanned once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steam was as thick as before and she couldn't get a layout of the location, but this time, she could feel some familiar presences, somewhere behind the door. \"It's Senpai and the others!  They're just about in front of us, but I can't tell anything else!\" Rise shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then what are we waiting for, let's go!\" said Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!  What if it's a trap?\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" said Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise can't sense anything else right?  So who knows what's back there?  We're still going, but we need to be careful!\" Yukiko explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" said Kanji.  \"You know, this Entertainer and Audience sounds like showbiz stuff... what do you think, Rise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" said Rise, thinking it over.  It did sound like show business, almost too much like that in fact.  \"If this is a show, then the door on the left means we'll be going on a stage, while the door on the right goes to the seats, I think?  They should both lead to the same area, but it can't be that simple.  Maybe we'll be forced to 'perform' or 'watch', depending on the door we choose, which could mean anywhere from a battle or a puzzle as far as Shadows are concerned.  Oh, let me check...\" she tried both door handles. \"Yep, they're both unlocked, so whatever's made this is forcing us to make one choice or the other.  But which one...\" she pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know nothing about show business,\" said Teddie.  \"Ooo!  Maybe we should take the audience door and see what happens.  I love watching things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Ted,\" said Kanji.  \"I don't like these creeps telling us what to do.  Besides, it could just be us sitting there while the Shadows do whatever the hell they want.  The other way around, at least we're doing something, so I think we should go through that one, especially if it's just some kind of fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good point, Kanji, but I can't help but wonder... What kind of show is this anyways?\" Yukiko asked.  \"Sure, if we go onstage we may only have to fight, but it may instead be a performance, which could mean anything.  It could be fun to act out a play, but if it's anything like the midnight channel... I really don't want to do anything embarrassing like that, you know?\" she drew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Hadn't thought of that,\" said Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group grew silent once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Yukiko picked up again. \"I think we should leave it up to Rise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Rise asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do this sort of thing all the time right?\" Yukiko asked.  \"So I think you have the best chance of getting us through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a wonderful idea!\" Teddie cheered.  \"Rise's got more experience at this than any of us, so I believe in her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that makes sense,\" said Kanji.  \"Alright, I'll follow your lead, Rise.  Just tell us where to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Wow!  Um...\" Rise was astonished.  Normally all the decisions were left up to her senpai, and she just went along with them and provided what support she could, but now they were looking to her for this important choice.  Suddenly she felt a lot of pressure, but also some pride in how they were all looking up to her.  She almost felt she was dreaming for a second, (she was running around in her underwear after all,)but it was a very real and very serious situation right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Rise weighed the options one more time, and made her decision.  \"Okay, guys,\" she said. \"We are going to go through-\"</span></div></div>",

Her Persona, who had been dutifully keeping track of affairs inside the bathhouse mere moments ago, would not so much as appear in front of her.

Something was interfering with her connection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, we have a problem!\" Rise called, when suddenly she found herself enfolded in slimy tendrils.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rise slowly came awake. Her head was pounding like a hangover and she felt strangely drained.  For a moment all she knew was confusion and a hazy sense of unease. As her memories came back to her she sat upright in alarm. The shadows had been dragging her away, and then...she must have passed out. She was lucky to be alive. But where had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Rise said, her unease increasing tenfold. That strange purplish haze in the air, that gaudy combination of purple and lavender, the projected lights of kissing lips and naked silhouettes, the thundering bump and grind music in the background...and that horrible smell of perform that couldn't quite overpower the distinctive odor of sweat and sex. Oh yes, Rise Kujikawa knew this place all too well. This was her world, the realm spawned by her heart when she was first tossed into the TV world. The fact that it resembled a strip bar was just one of many reasons why she hated to come here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Of all the places they had to take me, why HERE? Do those pervy little monsters want me to put on a show or something?\" Rise muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. No need to be so melodramatic.\" A voice came from somewhere in the smoke filled darkness. \"They were just being good little boys and doing what mommy asked for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise rose to her feet, despite a tremor that was running up her spine. Like this place, that voice sounded horribly familiar. It had a tone and resonance almost like her own, and yet there was something alien and distorted about it. Rissette knew well before the figure emerged from the smoke what she would see...a near perfect clone of herself, dressed in a tiny golden bikini, a fashion that complimented the demented yellow gleam of her eyes. Rise's shadow, the inner manifestation of her hidden thoughts and desires. But knowing what to expect made seeing it no less terrible. Rise stood in stunned silence as her nearly naked counterpart sauntered up to her and plucked the glasses from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love the new look.\" Her doppleganger said with a smile, putting the glasses on and giving a little twirl. \"We're like a sexy librarian now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how...Why...WHY ARE YOU BACK?\" Rise screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where else would I be? After all...you're here now...and I am you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lie! You can't-wha!\" Rise stopped abruptly as she found two fingers pressed against her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, me. We've been through this part. And it was a lot of fun, being denied and going berserk and nearly killing all your friends before getting messed up by a giant teddie bear. But it was pretty much a once in a lifetime kind of performance. So let's make a deal. I won't try to provoke you, and you don't say something stupid you'll instantly regret. Okayyyy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise stared at her double. The shadow was right, of course. By deny the connection between them, Rise would have inspired a hideous transformation in her Shadow. But why had the SHADOW been the one to stop her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right. What I meant was...aren't you Himiko? Why...are you back to being...this?\" Rise said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow shrugged. \"Same reason as before, me. You've been having some slippery little thoughts running through your head recently that you don't want to admit to yourself, and thanks to the way this world works its now my job to spell it out for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I thought we settled this already! Rise and Rissette are the same person! I was looking for the 'real me' everywhere when the reality was that I was always me! Rise is Rise...your me and I'm you. That's...all we need to do, right? I just need to accept that you're a part of me! I do! Please be my Persona again!\" Rise said in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow smiled in what Rise almost thought was honest affection. But then her face turned impish once again. \"So I'm the real you? Are you sure? What about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of spotlights clicked on around them, and in each stood another clone of Rissette dressed in different costumes from various commercials and concerts and the occasional movie cameo from her career. Each of them cooed and waved at the pair in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. Those are ALL me, okay?\" Rise said in exasperation. \"Or maybe none of them are. There is no such thing as the 'real me'. Every part I've played, every song I've sung...I put something of myself into all of it. I was wrong for feeling that I was being fake or losing myself before. We've been over all of this! None of the props or the roles matter. Take them away and its always just been me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heeeeeaaaaaaard her!\" The shadow said with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dumbstruck Rise watched as her laughing clones happily stripped off their costumes and slowly approached the two girls in the center. Soon Rise found herself surrounded by dozens of naked versions of herself, posing in various embarrassing ways that emphasized her private places in extravagant ways. Despite herself, Rise was blushing like a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...she's embarrassed. Don't be embarrassed.\" The shadow said, hugging her counterpart. \"It means a lot that you want to accept me all over again. It seriously does. Believe it or not, that's what I want too. The first time we met I was furious at being ignored for so many years. But then you accepted me, and you've been acknowledging me ever since. It felt really good nice helping to track down killers and save the other dopes that fell into the TV. So I'm gonna be a little more patient with you this time. We'll get through this together, and I'll help every step of the way. But this time things are a little trickier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why...\" Rise asked as she gaped at the naked antics of her other selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm....I wonder....\" The Shadow said with a smirk as it disengaged from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise stared at her in confusion. Her other selves tittered. Her primary shadow smiled, and made a show of walking around her. As she began to pass behind Rise's apron, the girl self consciously moved with her shadow to hide her exposed backside. The shadow smiled and continued to try and look behind the illusion of modest Rise had created for herself, forcing Rise to move around in a little circle. The titter from the other girls grew louder, and Rise suddenly realized she had been tricked into mooning all of her assembled spectators by twirling around as she had. She blushed furiously, and that moment was all her shadow needed to skip behind her and grab a handful of orange panty and yank sharply upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEK!\" Rise cried as she was given a sudden wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise, Rise, Rise....\" Her shadow said softly, swatting her exposed cheeks as she pulled on her underwear. \"Exposing yourself in public? Minding a store with your half naked body barely hidden by an apron? Giving all the customers at Junes such a great look at our firm little butt? How embarrassing! How mortifying! Who need the famous Rissette was really just a slut that loves to expose her body to an audience??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...that's not-OWWW!\" Rise screamed as she received another spanking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look around, me. The stripper poles, the setting, all of those threats I made to take it off last time we were here. Did you think that was a joke?\" The shadow whispered as she dropped poor befuddled Rise to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to be done with showbiz! I thought Rissette was fake! I wanted to be seen for who I really was, not what  was pretending to be! You were just exaggerating all of that! B-being naked was just a metaphor!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I said it wasn't?\" The shadow asked gently as it knelt next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a pervert!\" Rise wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh? Sooo....you've never stood out on a stage, feeling that little bite of dread and excitement as all those faces turn towards you, staring and clapping, all there to see you. You've never wondered just how much MORE intense the terror and the excitement would be without your clothes? You've never come home after a long day of exercise and eaten a pitiful little salad because of your diet, and then looked in the mirror at the gorgeous creature you've worked so hard to become...\" The shadow ran a hand down Rise's exposed stomach and hip. \"...and let out a little sigh thinking its such a waste your fans can't see more of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut up.\" Rise said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happens all the time. Some believed childhood icon ruins their image by doing little nude scene in a movie or maybe making a questionable music video. People get scandalized, the news calls it a tragedy. But that's what their business forces on them. They spend so many years being molded into this picture of sweatness and innocence, and have to spend so many more years breaking out of that image to reclaim some semblance of a career. Happens all the time. But I'm not sure anyone has dreaded and yearned for that moment as much as little Rise Kujikawa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-STOP IT!\" Rise snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shadow smiled and fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...get it! I get a thrill out of dressing like this! And I'm ashamed of doing it too. So...you came back because of that conflict, right? F-Fine! I'll..I accept that. I hate hearing it, but I'll accept it as the truth! Can we please just END this now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shadow sighed. \"Wish it was that simple.\"</span></div></div>",

I accept the unpleasant truth and you -all of you- calm down and things go back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor, naive little Rise.\" the Shadow taunted. \"Just saying the words isn't the trick, especially not with issues of this nature. To really accept us, to make all of us return quietly, you need to become comfortable with the fact that we exist. Thing is, well... your thoughts are just so contradictory! For example...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more figures seemed to fade into being, and the naked and posing Rise shadows were joined by (thankfully clothed) Rises, each sporting a more outrageous outfit than the last. These outfits weren't anything Rise had worn for any photo shoot or television spot. There was a maid, an outfit that likely was supposed to be a police officer, a set of tight leather gear that left nothing to the imagination, and others still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get a thrill out of dressing like this, sure, but you're even more excited by the idea of being seen, aren't you?\" the Shadow asked, her mouth all but touching Rise's ear, hot breath tickling her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... I don't... I mean...\" Rise stammered, unsure of what to say. \"How could I be excited if it makes me so embarrassed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the question, isn't it? The contradiction, the way it makes your heart race, but also makes your knees shake in fear. How are any of us supposed to feel at home inside you when you can't figure out what you feel?\" the Shadow pressed. \"Though I see now that perhaps I was doing more than I thought with those spanks. At least, if those two are any indication.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise gasped as she saw what her Shadow meant. The leather-clad Rise had bent the maid over, delivering sharp swats to her bouncy backside with a riding crop, each crack of the crop eliciting a cry from the maid that sounded far more like pleasure than pain. Rise couldn't even begin to understand how this made sense. She'd never even thought about such a thing, even when she was sneaking a rare moment of pleasure to herself. Was this... was this really how she felt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how am I supposed to accept these thoughts?\" Rise pleaded. \"I need Himiko back, and all of you under control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's easy!\" the main Shadow chirped. \"You just let us handle that. You see, with so many of us restless, you aren't exactly running a strong defense inside yourself. When we can, we'll just... take the wheel from you. You'll still be conscious and aware of your surroundings, so don't worry about waking up with no idea what's going on. You just won't have any say over what we decide you'll be doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean?!\" Rise demanded, but as soon as the question left her mouth, the room was empty. Just as swiftly appeared, all the Rises were gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must have just been a weird trick. Something the Shadows cooked up to mess with my head. No way any of that was real.\" Rise told herself. She could feel Himiko's presence again, after all. Unless her Persona could also manifest its Shadow form, that alone seemed proof enough of a wild hallucination. That wasn't important at the moment, though. She had to get back to the others!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise quickly dashed out of the room, using Himiko to maneuver through the dungeon and avoid any shadows along the way. The odd encounter with her Shadow was already being pushed to the back of her mind to be forgotten. Unfortunately for Rise, what she'd just went through was no hallucination, and her repressed feelings and thoughts were simply waiting for the right time to assert their control...</span></div></div>",

But, not even a minute passed after she had fixed their position did the straps slip down to the side of her shoulders again.  Appearance-wise, nothing had changed, as the work apron had long sleeves that covered her arms, shoulders, and neck completely, in addition to her front, leaving only the middle of her back exposed.  However, with the straps slipping down onto her shoulders like this, they were starting to get in the way of her arm movements, which was annoying right now, and would be really bad if anyone showed up and she had to do some real work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrgh... I knew this thing was getting old,\" Rise groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis probably was a sign that Rise should have taken the time to change back into normal clothes.  But she had committed herself to her trial run at this point, and wasn't going to be stopped by some worn out elastic.  She also felt that she didn't have time to waste.  She only had until her grandma returned, after all.

She felt excited and nervous, standing there wearing nothing but the apron and her panties, a fact which she just realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, what am I doing?\" she gasped, turning red, suddenly aware of just how little she was wearing.  She had wanted to put a little more of her provocativeness into her everyday life, but this was going overboard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was it? she wondered, looking down at her front.  The apron was as smooth and solid as ever, and the amount of coverage was just the same as before.  The only difference anyone would see now was that there was no longer the bright orange strap of her bra across the middle of her now bare back.  And with the shoulder straps were no longer getting in the way of her shoulders, her arms were free to move comfortably.  What was a few extra inches of skin between her shoulder blades anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is fine,\" Rise grinned, rocking back and forth on her feet, welling with anticipation.  She was all dressed up, or underdressed, as the case was, and felt comfortable enough like this on her own.

Today was one of those precious little jewels she had rarely experienced as an idol- a day she could devote purely to herself! She was not going to waste one moment of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was...where should she go? When she first arrived in town, she had been terrified to go out on her own. The chance that someone might recognize her was high. Fortunately Yu Narukami had been willing to show her around (doubly fortunate that he was super cool and good looking!). But Yu was hanging out with Yosuke and the other guys today, so that was out. And while she could go out with on of her other friends (Chie or Naoto could easily keep her safe, and Yukiko would be good company) today Rise wanted a little alone time. Surely all the buzz and excitement about Risette had died down enough that she could wander about safely? As a precaution she could along a nondescript coat and sunglasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being done, the only question was where she would go.</span></div></div>",

So far her little disguise was a total success!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch as she loved the country, there was a part of her that missed the bustle of the big city. Shopping, glamour, bright lights, the hum of a million people rushing in every direction. Rise had grown up a country girl, her life full of quiet and mundane happenings. When she began her modeling career she had been in awe of the big city. No amount of show business could totally erase that simple delight and love for the city and the crowd. Much as she valued her time with the Investigators and her family she dearly missed the pleasure of strolling down the boulevard of a busy street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo....now that I'm here, what shall I do?\" Rise asked herself, her eyes dancing up and down the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShopping was always a popular pastime. Trying on clothes and the thrill of finding a valuable purchase were near and dear to Rise's heart, teenage sterotypes be damned. Perhaps something sexy to flaunt in front of Yu and the boys? Maybe something that would finally turn Kanji's head (seriously, what was up with that guy?). Maybe a new swim suit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly stopped dead in her tracks. A familiar face stared enthusiastically back at her from a prominent billboard. \"Kanamin Kitchen! Performing one night only! Feast your eyes on these delectable morsels as they serenade you toward your dreams\" declared the poster under the image of Kanamin Mashita and her crew of performers. Rise had to laugh. Not too long ago Kanmin had been her coworker, a junior member of show business who looked up to her as a senpai and a friend. When Rise had quite being Risette the studio poured all their resources into Kanmin and her meat themed production. At one point Rise had been jealous of the attention the new girl was receiving. Okay, maybe she was still a LITTLE jealous. But she also admired how far her old friend had grown while Rise was on hiatus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In more ways than one, apparently. That has to be plastic surgery. There's no way those things are real! She could give Naoto a run for her mammaries.\" Rise thought, staring at the chest of her pseudo rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmmm....she might just be able to grab a ticket if she was lucky. Maybe she should check out the concert? Nobody was gonna notice her in the dark and the crowd.</span></div></div>",

The intense feeling of the music seeming to replace the beating of her heart, the heat and press of the crowd, the room alive with energy. She had forgotten how much she loved it. In those moments especially it was possible to forget who she was and simply meld into the sound and the crowd and bask in the shared experience.

She definitely liked that outcome the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Rise pulled with all her might on her twice ensnared coat. Unfortunately, as the moments passed it did not seem to relent an inch from the vice grip the doors had on it. Rise was starting to get red from her increasingly desperate attempts to dislodge it and her second bought of public nudity if she failed. Then all at once felt a yank in a different direction as the coat was pulled away by the train, practically spinning her around as it stripped her precious modesty away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Rise said, shaking her head and staring down at her naked body. \"No! No! No!\" She screamed, twirling around to face the slowly retreating train. \"Give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a move that screamed of desperation she ran along the platform, grabbing ahold of her coat by the pocket, placing her feet up against the moving train, and pulling with every ounce of her strength.

In a manner of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise found herself tumbling backwards, landing with a soft cry of surprise and pain on the platform, the fabric of her coat pocket still clutched in her hands, her phone and other assorted contents stuffed into the pocket now strewn around her. With a forlorn look in her eyes Rise watched the rest of her coat and dignity fly away as the train picked up speed in ernest. Standing up, clutching her phone to her chest, Rise confirmed her worst fears. She was naked in the crowded Inaba terminal, and more or less every was staring at her. She didn't even have the slender bit of safety that her sunglasses provided- they had fallen off sometime during her desperate struggles with the coat, and she had no idea where they were now. Choking back a scream, all Rise could think to do was offer a little wave to the gawking crowd before covering herself as best she could with her hands and running where the crowd was thinnest. </span></div></div>",

Somewhere her clothes, including her panties, were being solemnly set aside as objects of adoration by perverted fans....or more likely auctioned off online with a no doubt detailed account of the humiliating deal she had struck at the concert. Worse, a whole train and now a whole STATION of strangers had seen her naked. She didn't THINK anyone had connected the lewd streaker she had become with the former pop idol she truly was....but that state of affairs wouldn't last if anyone got a good look at her face. Of course, what comfort she might take from how unlikely anyone was to have been staring at her face was made up for in just how embarrassing it was that they got to stare at anything else!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any event, to say that the idol had been \"lucky\" at any point today was a blatant lie (at least as far as GOOD luck was concerned). But, as miserable as her day had been, it seemed the kami had left one tiny little piece of grace for her inbetween subjecting her to this humiliation. Her phone was fully charged, it had not suffered any significant damage in the fall from her coat pocket, and there appeared to be a decent signal in her current location!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just left Rise with one grim decision to make. Who should she contact? Her first choice would be to ask a female friend for help. Unfortunately, the opportunity to make plans easily had passed- knowing her friends they were likely embroiled in one activity or another by this point. Chie liked to spend her weekends training in Mt. Yasogami in her free time...usually far from a possible signal. Yukiko was probably watching her family in and/or trying to salvage her most recent cooking disaster. And Naoto liked to busy herself in the local library researching the case or otherwise looking up information that might prove important in her line of work. The one thing they all had in common was that they preferred to keep their phones off while engaging in those activities. Rise too liked to disconnect when by herself. Usually it wasn't a big problem- the town was small enough that any of them could be hunted down if one of them wanted to hang out with another (usually that someone was Narukami, in fact). But that was NOT an option right now. Rise just had to hope against hope that one of them would answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr....or......she could do the unthinkable, and try to get some help from...the guys. Just the thought of being seen like this by her other friends caused Rise to stifle a moan of dismay. Not that any of them would take advantage of her in this state...probably. But they would all definitely peek at her! Except maybe Kanji...but the others would for sure! And even worse, they no doubt remembered Rise's less than supportive attitude where it involved public exposure...whether it was calling Kanji a pervert after his wardrobe malfunction on the beach or smash their heads with buckets in the hot springs (and then enjoying soaking in the springs for an extra hour the boys should have had) to the lightning strike at the ski resort...the guys had not faired well at all when it came to the girls and nudity. All of them were likely to be a little resentful...and maybe a little vindictive. So obviously she wouldn't be begging any of them for help, even the indifferent ones like Kanji or the cool ones like Narukami. At least, if she didn't have to....</span></div></div>",

She realized she had absolutely no idea what to say in this situation. She needed help desperately, of course. But...but how exactly was she supposed to explain this? Kanji wasn't exactly the sort to drop everything and come alone with a bundle of clothes no questions asked. And the actual story....ohhhhh, this was beyond embarrassing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, whoever ya are. I can hear ya breathing. If this is some kinda prank call or whatever, your messing with the wrong guy, ya hear me! And if this is some kinda threat, bring it on! Don't think I can't find out where your calling from, either!

What's up? This like, investigation team shit? Where are you? I'll get everybody there in-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Rise squeeked loudly, then looked out from her hiding place.

Please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooookay.\" Kanji said, a little leery. \"So maybe you should tell me just what the hell is goin on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just....oh no!\" Rise said. A group of police officers was moving through the area, likely responding to the reports of the streaker earlier. \"Hold on....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart beating, Rise, waited until they had their backs turned. Then with a quick sprint, Rise ran from her hiding place. She could feel her bare breasts and butt cheeks bouncing as she moved, her mind dizzy with adrenaline and humiliation. Sprinting as quickly as possible into a large alcove full of train equipment, Rise crept through the shadows, terrified of meeting a worker or vagrant or anyone else. Finally, she found a decent space to hide between a pile of rock and a discarded rusty train wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Can you hear me!\" Kanji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Stop shouting!\" Rise said, cringing at how her own voice echoed. \"I had to move. They almost saw me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? What? Tell me what's happening? Why aren't I getting everyone involved here?\" Kanji said, bewildered and increasingly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you. J-just calm down and...and give me a sec.

Can't you sucker Yu or Yosuke into that shit if your missing the pop idol life so bad?\" Kanji said, now clearly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being an idiot and listen, Moranji!\" Rise said, and immediately regretted her volume and insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that how it is? Well, why don't you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean that! Don't hang up!\" Rise begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Jeez, what's with you today? Your not acting all perky and snarky at all? Ya sound more like ya did back when ya first came to town. Cept..I dunno. Less depressed and more...pathetic?\" Kanji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise blushed and fought down the insult she had on her lips. \"Look...can you just...please come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Fine. But you owe me for this. Be there in ten minutes.\" Kanji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! When you come....could you...bring....some clothes with you?\" Rise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....WHAT THE HELL?\" Kanji screamed into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet! I need some clothes! I'm....\" Rise wrestled with the word. \"....naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe admission came out as such a high pitched, tiny, forlorn sound even Rise herself had to admit that 'pathetic' was a good word for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..........\" There was a long silence. \"The hell is this? What do you mean yur 'naked'? The hell are you doing there NAKED?.....DID SOMEONE DO THIS TO YOU? SOMEONE TRYING TO HURT YOU?\" Kanji said, increasingly loud and alarmed and angry...more so than at any other time Rise had ever heard him save for the fateful night Yu had talked them down from killing Namatame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Nonononono! Its not like that! I'm fine! I'm fine!\" Rise said, fearing her friend might actually break his phone in his rage. \"Nobody did anything to me! Well...not like that! I'm okay! I'm fine! I just....did some....really stupid things....and had some really, really bad luck! This is...sort of my fault. Okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........\" Another pause, longer this time. Then, to her embarrassment and anger, she heard him start to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't funny!\" She snapped. \"D-don't sit there laughing at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Sorry! Its just....\" Kanji stammered. \"I mean....its a little funny, right? Your not in any danger? Just...managed to lose your clothes? Seriously, I'm relieved. Just....snerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right! Its a little funny! Now....can you just PLEASE get down here already? You get it now, right? I can't go home like this!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Sounds like a great way to drum up publicity for Rissette's big comeback!\" Kanji said snidely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how about I use the publicity from me strangling you for my comeback instead!\" Rise growled and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh. Getting a little defensive, huh? Look, this is just like that time at the beach, remember? Just do what I did. Roll with it! Just take a deep breath, do your walk of shame, and let all that embarrassment flow away when ya get back home. Ya know? Like the tide.\" Kanji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...you....Kanji...do you even know what this could do to my reputation? Everyone would be talking about it! The press would....eat me alive! This is way more serious than your stupid Venus stunt!\" Rise said. \"Now...g-get down here or....I'll....ummm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" Whatever Kanji said was too incoherent to qualify as words, but it sounded distinctly uncowed and much more like laughter for Rise's liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-would you...please just....come down here already?\" Rise asked, putting on a pout but unable to keep the misery out of her voice. \"If someone catches me like this....I'll...die of shame and haunt you forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snerk. Yeah, fine. Just lemme....ah shit.\" Kanji's snarky tone suddenly got a lot more serious. \"Uhhh...Rise-chan. Your not gonna believe this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rise said, feeling a panic coming on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see....Ma don't have her own machine, so she takes our dirty stuff over to a laundromat in town. And we just had this big wedding the other day....lots of clients and stuff....\" Kanji trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't tell me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bone dry. All the cloth was sold off and we're still waiting for a new supply. I don't even think Ma left a bed sheet for ya to wear.\" Kanji said, mulling things over. \"Except...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except? Except what?\" Rise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...I could salvage a few inches....if I use the bunnies?\" Kanji said thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...what? Hey, are you talking about those creepy little dolls of yours?\" Rise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Kanji said. \"These little guys are offering up their lives and your giving me lip? Maybe we should just forget the whole damn thing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waitwaitwait! I'm sorry! Don't do that! Just....hurry, whatever you do. Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.

Whatever the case, Rise stifled the noise in the most expedient and embarrassing fashion possible. She tucked the phone tightly between her legs and hugged it close to her body. The sound immediately died, but the sensation of the vibrations passing through the core of Rise's body made her situation no less dire. Forbidden and erotic pleasures were flowing through her, and the need to let out a moan or cry of passion was overwhelming. But she had to stay silent!

She noted with growing embarrassment that her breasts had taken to rising and falling fractionally faster than before, and her face was bound to be flushed... but at least she'd stopped there.

There, perched on the edge of the billboard she had just identified as a useful landmark sad a slightly obsese man with thick glasses, a gaudy orange bandana tied around his silvery hair that matched the ugly plad shirt he wore. Blue jeans and a purple backpack were the only other noteworthy features about the man. Well, except for the cameras. Even as far away as Rise was she could make out at least three expensive looking pieces of photography equipment hanging from the man's neck. And another gripped in his hands, with an elongated lens surely intended to act as a telescope for the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera was large enough that Rise could make out the opening and closing of the shutter. To her horror, the man was pointing it directly at her, snapping photos in rapid fire succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a gold mine! the camera operator thought to himself. The rumors that Rise Kujikawa had attended a concert earlier that day and essentially stripped herself to give out autographs had mostly been derided and ignored by her fanbase. But there were certain \"specialized\" fans who paid closer attention. Frankly, it didn't matter to this man whether the rumors were a lie or not. Any possibility of catching the famous Risette in a state of nudity, even if hidden by a coat, was enough for a prolonged stake out. He knew she had left Inaba that morning by train, and thus would most likely return by the same route. He had already missed one golden opportunity to see Rise naked- he had found the perfect vantage point to peek into her room and snap a photo. But a bunch of loud mouthed kids and a particularly stupid cop had assaulted and arrested him despite it being perfectly legal to take these illicit sorts of photos! But today was different! Today Risette herself was coming to him! He was not going to miss the opportunity, even it turned out to be a false lead! And boy had it paid off! His attention was naturally drawn to the police officers and their particular interest in that one alcove. Moments after they dispersed, she emerged. The beautiful Risette, star, idol, model....revealed before his eyes and camera devoid of even an overcoat to hide her fabulous body. Like a sniper armed with a gattling gun, the camera man wasted no time in transcribing image after image of the naked beauty onto film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise felt a shriek building up in her throat and only JUST remembered to stifle it. In shock she covered her exposed breasts (only mildly dampening the camera man's enthusiasm- he had plenty of shots of the orbs, up close and filling the whole frame thanks to his wonderful lense). She stared at him and noticed the slight dip of the camera. Belatedly she transferred one hand to her pussy, too late to prevent a few excellent pictures of her exposed nether regions (complete with a hint of her erect clit, awakened by her brief but intense contact with the vibrating phone). Rise finally remembered how to move her legs, scampering behind the corner and out of sight of the cameraman. This day was a nightmare that refused to end!</span></div></div>",

She then sighed in relief. That sounded like a definitive solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that appeared to be taken care of, Rise just had to go find Kanji.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being so close to what was presumably the end of this embarrassing ordeal sent a wave of giddiness and relief through the frazzled idol. But as exciting as the notion was, she resolved to be patient and let Kanji come to her. He had all the information he needed to find her, and frankly exiting her hiding place had already found a way to backfire on her. Plus, as much as she was looking forward to seeing her friend and getting out of this disaster she wasn't nearly so keen for him to SEE her (so to speak). With any luck he could just hand her the clothes he had brought and nothing more needed to be done with it. Soon enough she heard his leather shoes crunching on the gravel outside her secluded base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kanji! Over here.\" She whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bout time!\" Kanji grumbled as he squatted down and began to enter her hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! What are you doing?! Don't come in here, stupid!\" Rise squeeked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why the hell not?\" Kanji snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm still naked back here! You don't just go barging in on someone like this!\" Rise scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why? Haven't like a hundred people already seen you like that? What's the use of being shy now?\" Kanji asked in genuine confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and hand me the clothes! I'll get dressed and be out in a second!\" Rise snapped, marveling how stupid some of her friends could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...bout that. Putting this stuff on is gonna be...complicated. You'll need my help for sure.\" Kanji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a lame excuse! Pervert! You even think of coming in here and you'll be sorry!\" Rise snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You threatening to pull a hot springs freak out on me and pummel me with crap fer tryin to help? Screw that! You try it and I'm leaving you here and telling everybody about this little situation! Maybe sneak a few pics just to back up my story, too!\" Kanji threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you wouldn't dare!\" Rise said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so? Lemme tell you something, Rise. Today I just ruined months of work on my favorite hobby just to help you out, not to mention bruising my freaking knuckles on some poor dweeb cause you suck at hiding! I've gone through a massive amount of SHIT for your sake, Kujikawa! Now's a real bad time to test my limits! Not to mention all the crap you've dumped on me before!\" Kanji ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was taken aback by the vitriol. Kanji had a temper, of course, and she'd seen him blow up at his friends when being needled too much. But this felt a little more intense than usual. It seemed there was more resentment built up than she had realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it! I get it.\" Rise called back. \"I'm sorry, okay! This hasn't been a good day for me either, okay? I just don't want you to see me naked! Is that really too much to ask??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally? NO! But this isn't exactly normal, is it?!\" Kanji shot back, then sighed and spoke in a calmer tone. \"Look. I get it. This ain't an easy thing for ya. Especially with all that crap your shadow pulled. Sensitive subject, right? But I'm TRYING to help here. And this time around I'm NOT getting punished for it! Let's be clear on that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji continued before Rise could respond. \"If your seriously that terrified of me seeing you bare I guess I can try to find something easier for you to wear or something. I got no idea how long that would take, though. Its gonna be better for everybody if you get over this now and just rip off the bandaid as quick as possible. I get that maybe I'm not easy to trust in this situation, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not that!\" Rise said. \"You know its not that! You helped save my life! Of course I trust you!\" That and her Persona offered a level of perception beyond the norm- she knew perhaps better than anyone that Kanji's gruff tough guy appearance was mostly a bluff- he was willing to beat down people who deserved it, but he'd never turn on anyone he really cared about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't mean I'm ready to...to show myself off to you either!\" Rise added quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, dammit. You act like there's anything back there I'm even interested in seeing.\" Kanji jeered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...WHAT? Excuse me? D-Do you have any idea how many people would kill to be in your position?\" Rise snapped, momentarily forgetting her shyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well..that's them. And no offense, but I never cared about any of that idol crap. All this midnight channel shit makes it obvious, you know? Most of the crap you see on the TV is just that, crap! All the damn rumors and nonsense about celebrities is about as accurate about who you really are as your Shadow was! Get over it- I'm not one of those dumbasses drooling over your Calorie Magic commercial. I came out here to help out Rise my preppy classmate and investigation partner, not to check out Risette in the buff! So....either tell me to get lost, get your ass out here, or let me come in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Okay!\" Rise said. \"C-Come in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a scraping sound. Despite her words Rise edged around a corner to hide as much of herself from Kanji's sight as possible. As she watched him emerge she bit her lip and blushed. As he emerged she glared at him. He rose to his feet and looked at her meaningfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least turn around! Didn't they teach you any manners at all?\" Rise demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell's the point? Hurry up and get out here so we can get this over with!\" Kanji snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning red, Rise drew in a breath and stepped out from her hiding place, covering herself and contritely moving to stand in front of him. He was, of course, right even if he was being way more forceful and blunt than she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. Hurry up and drop your hands so I can get started.\" Kanji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just-\" Rise began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop em, Kujikawa!\" Kanji snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise obeyed, closing her eyes in the process. Ugh! Standing fully exposed in front of a boy! How humiliating! Rise almost screamed when he felt a hand on her boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I'm just making sure its gonna fit.\" Kanji snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her shock, Rise felt her left nipple rubbed and pinched in a fairly forceful manner. The pink orb naturally began to stick out fully. Her embarrassment only increased as Kanji produced a wod of string and cloth from his pocket, which he wrapped around the nipple and proceeded to tie into a knot. Rise had to suppress something between a scream and a moan as her nipple was pinched enough to be both painful and sensual all at once (not that she would admit the latter to anyone...EVER). At the same time she felt something soft and fluffy brush against her breast. Looking down she saw the face of one of the Kanji's dolls, a tiny bunny rabbit, now repurposed as a sort of pastie, which just barely managed to hide her exposed nipple and areola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...are you SERIOUS?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I didn't have much to work with.\" Kanji said with a sigh. \"I know its not much, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this thing is literally the most humiliating thing I've ever worn in my life!\" Rise snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't wanna use it, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I want to use it, dummy!\" Rise said, blushing profusely. \"Its...better than nothing at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo saying, Rise closed her eyes and stood at attention, her body glowing red as Kanji foddled her other breast until her nipple was erect then proceeded to secure another bunny to her breast in a similarly erotically painful manner. It only dawned on her afterwards what this implied about the rest of her 'outfit'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how its designed, dammit. If I had more fabric to work with it'd be different, but this is all I could come up with. So just....\" Kanji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are NOT going to...get my...get that to stick out the same way!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Do it yourself, then. Just hurry up.\" Kanji said in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you better turn around and stay that way!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like I care either way.\" Kanji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise glared at his back. With a gulp, she looked down at herself. Gingerly she began to manipulate the space between her legs, arousing her clit and slowly coaxing it out of its naturally hiding place. Periodically she kept glancing in Kanji's direction, expecting to see him sneaking a glance at her as she fingered herself. To her surprise he never did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya done yet?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah. That's...as far as it'll go.\" Rise said, her voice quivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Kanji immediately turned around and stared intently between her legs. Gasping, she used both hands to hide her moist treasure. Rolling his eyes, Kanji instructed her to turn around and spread her legs far apart. A short argument later, Rise complied. She felt string once more wrapped around an intimate place, though less painfully than before. Eventually a small bunny was once more secured against her private places, providing literally the barest amount of cover possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her mortification, Rise thanked Kanji for his efforts and even managed to overcome her shame and look him in the eye. Somewhat to her surprise, she didn't see any mockery or lust in his face. She was almost disappointed. Not even a little nosebleed? He had just seen more of her than ANYONE and he didn't seem effected in the slightest! It was a weird feeling, feeling embarrassed about how unimpressed her audience was with her body on top of the exposure itself. But that was indeed the state of her emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nervously, she frequently scanned her surroundings to ensure that no one else was nearby, or was at least, able to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While she was begrudgingly grateful to Kanji for providing her something to wear the idol was still virtually naked, and was not much better off than before.  Ironically, with the stuffed dolls stimulating her nipples and clit by being so tightly woven, she was even more aware of her nakedness than before. With any luck she and Kanji would escape soon and she could finally put this whole embarrassing fiasco behind her!<br>\r\nAs they continued to discreetly make their way through the city the two took a short break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere exactly are we going?\u201d Rise questioned, realizing that she didn\u2019t recognize the route that Kanji was taking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kanji turned to answer, looking straight at the idol as he did so.<br>\r\n\u201c Well\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise nearly yelped at his brashness and her hands instinctively went to cover her privates. <br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey!

What? Is he serious right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you mean alone!?

There didn\u2019t seem to be anyone nearby at the moment, but if someone were to show up she wasn\u2019t sure how well she would be able to hide herself. She was a little uneasy being left alone, but she needed that bike, and there was no way she was willing to give anyone else an eyeful by trying to get it herself. The idol gave a heavy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c..Ok\u2026But hurry back! \u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Yeah. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll only take a minute.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd with that, Kanji walked the other way and eventually vanished from Rise\u2019s line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Kanji was still nowhere to be seen.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding that this was taking too long Rise tried to make herself as little as possible as she attempted to take cover and await her companions return. Quickly giving her surroundings a look around, she pressed her back up against a wall and crouched  down to make herself less visible.   Come on Kanji, you said it would only take a minute, hurry up! Her inward pleas fell on deaf ears however, and there didn\u2019t appear to be a soul in sight. All she could do now was wait for Kanji to make his return.<br>\r\nAs she continued to wait she became increasingly aware of her hanging breasts and feeling the dolls continually rub against her most private of areas was beginning to take its toll on her current state.  While she was thankful to Kanji for  sacrificing his work to provide her with \u201cclothing\u201d the dolls required her nipples and clit to be erect at all times, so as humiliating as it was to admit, she was in a constant state of arousal. Blushing profusely, the idol began to think of a way to get her out of this mess. This is ridiculous, I can\u2019t even rub my legs without \u201cit\u201d being\u2026. It\u2019s too tight!  In a squatting position with her legs spread wide apart she looked down between her thighs and was greeted with the rabbit doll that was fashioned onto her.  Embarrassed by how ridiculous it looked on her she decided to loosen it. Maybe, if it wasn\u2019t so tight..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that though in mind Rise very gently prodded the doll and the reaction was instant.  She let out a yelp as a jolt was sent up her body as she indirectly stimulated her most sensitive area. The soft fur of the doll brushed her clit and the idol was momentarily overcome with a temporary feeling of euphoria. Finally getting some relief after getting worked up the entire day, the teens body craved for more.  Crimson faced and biting her lip she scanned her surroundings in search of life, no one was around. I- I have to take this thing off \u2026. Yeah, it\u2019s the only way\u2026.  With that half hearted justification and with her heart pounding out of her chest Rise closed her eyes, flicked the doll again and was rewarded with a surge of pleasure that shook her to her core.  In that moment, self-control was thrown out the window as the idol began to openly play with herself, stimulating her breasts and vagina expertly with her slender fingers as her arousal skyrocketed exponentially.  Her pussy was dripping wet while her clit was swollen and begging for attention so Rise began to increase the tempo and flicked her clit furiously with one hand and finger herself with the other neglecting her breasts in favor of her g spot. The guise of \u201cremoving the doll\u201d quickly evolved into full blown masturbation and Rise was reaching a climax. Thighs trembling, buttocks clenched, and hips gyrating, Rise\u2019s uninhibited moans increased in volume. The idol cried out in a fit of passion <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026. I\u2019m going to cum!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Rise her release was denied and her eyes snapped open as she saw Kanji with his bike tow.  Mouth agape and completely red  a whole range of emotion hit Rise at once, as her brain worked to formulated a response. Kanji was the one to break the ice.<br>\r\n\u201cYou done yet? You ready to get going?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cK-KANJI! How long were you there, wh-why didn\u2019t  you say anything? What took you so long!? This isn\u2019t what it looks like, I\u2026.I!\u201d<br>\r\nKanji sighed \u201c Well I tried calling out to you for a while but you seemed to be really into it so decided to just wait.\u201d. They stood in silence for a few seconds as Rise stewed in her shame, avoiding eye contact with her classmate, she could just die of embarrassment!  \u201cY\u2019know if you want go ahead and finish you want.\u201d Kanji stated <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Rise\u2019s full attention . And she stammered back.\u201d \u201cWhat!? What are you talking about, I can\u2019t do that yo-you pervert!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWell \u2026 Just by how you are right now it kinda seems like you need it. And it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t seen everything at this point.\u201d Kanji responded.<br>\r\nGasping Rise realized that her legs were still spread wide apart with her fingers still lodged in her pussy. She looked down, and to her shame, threads of juices were dripping to the ground and her thighs were smeared with her arousal. Worst of all, she was still incredibly horny. Her dignity and body\u2019s needs were at conflict with one another and she was forced in a dilemma. Masturbating with Kanji here? I\u2026 I can\u2019t. But\u2026.

In order to deal with Rise\u2019s current state Kanji would scout ahead to ensure that it was safe for travel. Then, if Kanji was satisfied with the current environment, he would give a signal to the blushing idol who would then scamper to a different hiding location. With this strategy they managed to cover a relatively decent distance and for a moment, it seemed that this night would  end without any more disasters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to bad eh? At this rate, you\u2019ll be back home in no time!\u201d Kanji exclaimed, impressed with the progress that they have been making so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Can we take a break for a minute?\u201d Rise questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji\u2019s face was one of puzzlement.<br>\r\n\u201cAnother one?

But I\u2019ve been running around like this for a while now, I\u2019m getting tired\u201d She replied with a flushed face.<br>\r\nKanji looked at her quizzically then sighed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTch, fine\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that excuse, Rise took a moment to collect herself. She felt a little bad that she had to lie to Kanji like that but the truth was too mortifying to admit. As happy as Rise was that Kanji\u2019s plan seemed to be working, there was one pressing matter that had begun to make itself known during her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was incredibly horny<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nWhile the rabbit dolls served as a source of cover for the young star, it was also a catalyst for her arousal. The fabric of the dolls was tightly pressed against her most sensitive areas, which made it impossible for Rise to ignore the sensations in her erogenous zones.  Furthermore, because the dolls were so tightly woven, touching the dolls alone would cause direct stimulation to her privates. So as she made her trek across the town, the slight movement of the dolls would cause continual pressure to be applied to her nipples and clit.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rise took in a deep breath. Everything was happening so fast! Clothes had been lost, idols were colliding into her, and now she was somehow getting swept up in some mad plot by her rival to run away from her career! She was confused and on the brink of panicking. And in these situations, Risette was prone to making terrible or dangerous decisions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was old Rise! Old, indecisive, 'don't know who the real me even is so I might as well get naked' pre-persona Rise! This was the new, improved, not depressed, light-hearted but not airheaded Rise. Solver of mysteries, saver of lives, hunter of otherwordly murderers, and card carrying cutest member of the Investigation Team (as conducted by an exhaustive survey headed by Rise Kujikawa tabulating the results of the unbiased opinion of Rise Kujikawa). So, what would the new Rise do? She'd take a breath, and take a page from Naoto's book. Cool mind, logical thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanamin, for whatever reason (and Rise did want to know what that reason was...later, when she could talk this out without fear of recognition or public nudity!) had decided to make a break for it right before a big concert. Her plan, thrown together though it obviously was, clearly required a quick exit and not drawing attention to herself! CleaRisrly, a butt naked Risette drawing fans and press to the scene like honey attracting flies ran totally counter to that. There was clearly no reason to strip Rise in the middle of a public street whatsoever! Except maybe as a decoy, but Kanamin wasn't that cold blooded! Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise shook her head. No way. Despite feeling more than a little jealous of Kanamin's rise to fame in the absence of Risette, Kanamin practically worshiped the ground her beloved senior idol walked on, and Rise definitely considered her a good friend. Plus, Kanamin knew just how shy Rise was offstage, how hard she worked to psych herself up every performance to transform from the squimish little girl who was constantly bullied in middle school into Risette the Idol. Kanamin knew just how prone to embarrassment the real Rise was, how terrified of humiliation and public mockery she was. And above all else, Kanamin knew of the extra special TERROR that haunted Rise of getting caught naked in public (a terror Rise's Shadow exploited to the fullest in order to force Rise to confront the ugliest parts of herself). Kanamin alone knew all of this among the many associates and contacts Rise had made in her time as an idol (with perhaps the exception of their mutual manager, Inoue). She knew because she was the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanamin had been discovered much like Rise, through happenstance and the excellent instincts of Inoue. Her idol persona was largely as fake as Risette (well, okay, \"fake\" was a strong word- as her shadow said, Risette's personality came from Rise, and was no less valid her 'regular' personality...none of which was particularly relevant right now; focus, Rise!). What Kanamin had been before was clumsy, nerdy looking awkward teen with a big bust but all the confidence of baby deer learning to walk. She'd suffered her share of bullies, and humiliation, and smug comments that ground her self image into dust. So of course it was Inoue's big idea for big sister Risette to coach the newbie on how to get over stage fright and the terror. And Rise had done a damn fine job, if she said so herself. Not, of course, in helping poor Kanamin overcome her anxieties and phobias. That would require Rise to have discovered an solution to her own problems. No, Rise had trained little Kanamin on burying her shyness and terror of humiliation deep, deep, down so the idol could come out and entertain the crowds. She showed Kanamin the times to keep it in and let it out, to go from the lie of the crowd pleaser to the truth of little girl afraid of the mockery and the laughter and the gawking and the perpetual sea of cameras ready to steal away your dignity the very instant your guard was down. And in the process, if from time to time Rise had let down her own walls, let the little rising star see more of her weak side than she'd ever dared...what about it? If she let Kanamin get a little too close, let her be as much Risette's coping mechanism as Rise had become Kanamin's...that could stay their little secret. And if maybe there were way more nights involving mutual tears and late night confessions and falling asleep clinging to each other like human teddy bears...that was no one's business but their own, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo no way...no way in hell Kanamin would throw Rise to the wolves like that! This was a test, and a bluff. She needed help, and she was offering help in turn! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Kanamin. Sure. You can \"take\" my coat.\" Rise said, winking and smiling at her junior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! You have no idea what a relief this is! I was afraid I'd have to lose a shirt or something!\" Kanamin said, grabbing Rise's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...what?\" Rise asked, before letting out a sudden 'eep' as Kanamin pulled her along once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick trip across the street and into a back alley later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise felt her heart beating as the pair were confronted by a worrying number of people hanging out in the back alley. All Kanamin fans, based on the logos on shirts and hats. The way they were looking at Rise made her feel like she had just interrupted a birthday party and no one was sure whether to be angry that she was ending the fun or hopeful that she had brought additional presents. She looked around nervously until her eyes settled on a single motorscooter with a side passenger pod parked in an oddly prominent position in the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kanamin...what the hell have you done?\" Rise asked, a grim certainty falling over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I didn't have much time to plan...but I made contact with some fans who were willing to transport me to a place to lie low for awhile...they just had..umm...some conditions....\" Kanamin explained nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They want your clothes...\" Rise stated numbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh. Uh, y-yeah.\" Kanamin laughed nervously. \"W-wouldn't take cash, or anything else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise blushed intensely, remembering her experience before. \"Wha-Wha-What is wrong with you people! Out of all the things, why would you want clothes instead of money?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assembled fans looked at one another, then back at Rise and Kanamin. \"Uhh...is that like a rhetorical question or something?\" One guy asked, cocking an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-anyway! Good news, guys! I found something better than MY clothes! I just landed the chance to get the one and only jacket of the fabulous Risette!\" Kanamin said, clapping her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kanaminnnnnnnn!\" Rise hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't be mad! This is perfect! You need a place to hide, I need a place to hide, and this will ensure it all! I won't even have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...heh heh. Its okay! It'll just be for a little bit and then we'll get you new clothes, I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise glared harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, not to spit on Risette or nothing, but we all came here expecting you to be paying...\" Another fan noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Its okay. One gorgeous idol hottie is as good as another, right?\" Another said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, she's okay, but have you seen the size of those-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude. Be cool. I got this.\" The first man noted. \"Sure thing. Take off the coat, we'll get you were you need to be....Risette.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanamin beamed with happiness while Rise felt her legs wobble underneath her. This wasn't happening, was it? </span></div></div>",

That was her Shadow's fault! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did the phrase go? I am thou, thou art I? Rise's Shadow was a part of Rise. Rise was suffering from an internal crisis, and wanted to flee her life and career. And part of her wanted to take that impulse to the extreme, abandon her clothes and her dignity and utterly destroy her career in one lewd act of rebellion, at once punishing everyone who was pressuring her and punishing herself for all her internal conflicts and failures. Was Risette really that angry at Kanamin for dragging her into this stupid situation? Or was she disgusted with how much she RECOGNIZED that nihilistic little urge to go all out with running away and burn that last bridge in one final act of lewd self-destruction. Or was it maybe the fact that Rise did not want to admit that her natural excitement for performing in front of an audience and being the center of attention had a perverted streak to it, as evidenced by that suspicious stiffness of her nipples and that growing hint of wetness between her legs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll right! Enough! Shut up, brain! Rise fumed, scolding herself. She had managed to get through her \"episode\" and so could Kanamin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise had gotten through her episode. Because there were people, total strangers at the time, who were willing to help her. Sure, she loved taking and trading insults with them and often competed for attention, but as much as she mocked them she still felt the same about the group as she had after her recovery. They were dorky and flawed, but still cool and amazing people who saved her life! More than that, they helped her find her way by just being there. Even the laughter and the jibes worked to keep things light hearted. They had seen her at her most raw and embarrassing, freely acting like a lewd slut and admitting her secrets like it was nothing! And they didn't care! To them she was still Rise. Her flaws didn't count against her in their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't...say it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanamin is lost. She needs help. She needs someone who will talk to her. She needs some cool, amazing person to intervene and put themselves on the line for her sake. Otherwise she's going to keep fumbling her way into that abyss of depression and ennui you were in that nearly swallowed you whole and almost killed your new friends to boot! She needs help. Like you did. Now who here is likely to step up and be the one to save her, I wonder? Is it the assholes who are leering at her right now? No, definitely not. So who else can step up and put it all on the line for her sake? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShut up! Shut up! Shut up! Rise winced and open her eyes, crinkling her face in despair. I get it! But...but I DON'T WANT TO BE NAKED!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn answer to her shrill, desperate protest her conscious simply shrugged. What would Yu Narukami do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\" Rise said out loud, looking back at Kanamin and her entourage, who were currently staring at her and watching her mental debate with terror and bemusement respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" She repeated a little louder as she stormed over to Kanamin. \"Kanamin! Purse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Purse?\" Kanamin asked, a little dazed as Rise practically snatched the accessory from her off her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeaningfully, Rise emptied the contents of her pockets, wallet and phone included, and filled them into her friend's purse, struggling to zip up the now bulging bag. Shoving it back into Kanamin's hands, Rise turned to face the apparent leader of this mob of perverts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get to keep the purse and everything in it! Non-negotiable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader shrugged. \"Yeah, okay. Terms accepted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Rise snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed as everyone looked at Rise expectantly. She felt a shiver go up her spine. Her heartbeat was strangely steady, playing out a pattern that sounded to Rise like the drumbeat of an execution. Her hands twitched nervously as they descended with painful slowness to the first button on her coat. One by one she unclasped the remaining shielding between her dignity and her leering audience. She paused for one final long moment, her eyes meeting Kanamin, then she let the raincoat open and fall away from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collective group of males surrounding her let out a collective sigh of awe that made Rise\u2019s skin crawl. The reality of dozens and dozens of complete strangers seeing her naked very quickly crushed her resolve, and the naked girl gave a small cry of dismay as she immediately bent down to retrieve her coat and hold it in front of her to hide her nudity. She glanced behind her to see Kanamin staring at her naked butt. She blushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot for nothing, Risette. But we do need to have the coat for the toll to count.\u201d Said the leering leader of the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise trembled slightly, humiliation and anger building up in her. With a savage move, she threw her coat into the face of the pervert, momentarily blinding him. His fellows laughed and jeered. Rise blushed again, this time covering herself with her hands in a pathetic attempt to hide. The leader chuckled as he pulled the coat off his head, his gaze drinking in the humiliated celebrity standing stark naked in front of him. The others followed his example, staring intensely while Rise remained paralyzed before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKanamin!\u201d Rise squeeked at last. \u201cHurry up!! Everyone\u2019s looking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Kanamin take several steps towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSenpai\u2026\u201d Kanamin said, awe in her voice. \u201cYou really did it. You got naked for me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you hurry up and-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise trailed off as Kanamin hooked her thumb in her pants and began to shimmy out of them. Her round posterior heaved and bounced, emphasizing a certain bit of weight she had put on. Far from being unsightly, the pounds had mostly added a bounce to her Rise found distracting. With her pants still pulled at her waste, Kanamin off her black panties without preamble. She glanced up at Rise, her glasses shining in the sun a moment before revealing her wide eyed stare. She was clearly breathing hard as she wrestled with her bra under her shirt. Rise felt a flash of envy as the black underwear was unclasped and yanked up between her cleavage. Seriously, how did those things get so big so fast? Kanamin continued to stare at her intensely as the last article of clothing lay at her feet, holding her shirt low to cover her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! Great! Let\u2019s get moving before-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Kanamin squeeked. \u201cYou..you really did it! You really got naked! Senpai, you\u2026this isn\u2019t fair! I can\u2019t let you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle late for\u2026\u201d Rise trailed off as sucked in a breath, took a hold of either side of her shirt, and began yanking it over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother round of awed excitement came from behind them. Rise could only stand in awe as the short, busty girl dropped her shirt at her feet, her curvy body on full display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKana\u2026why?! You didn\u2019t have to lose your shirt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just\u2026didn\u2019t think you\u2019d\u2026I was in such a rush I didn\u2019t think ahead and\u2026you really did it. Even though you thought I was bluffing. You really..and if you can, then so can I!\u201d Kanamin declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rise could respond, Kanamin rushed to her and gave her a bear hug. Unsurprisingly, no one seemed to object to two hot celebrities squishing their naked breasts and bodies tightly together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Senpai! I was going crazy and everything was falling apart and\u2026and I don\u2019t know what I would have done if you weren\u2019t here!!!\u201d Kanamin sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiot\u2026\u201d Rise whispered, angry and exasperated and trying unsuccessfully to not feel a little glee from the heartfelt display. \u201cYou owe me! Your going to tell me what the hell this is all about when we\u2019re safe and not getting leered at! Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise emphasized this last by wrapping her arm around Kanamin\u2019s waste and pinching her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, ma\u2019am!!\u201d Kanamin yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd on that note, hurry up and take our clothes! Get us the hell out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All I did was point out certain facts in the case that led to her arrest. Really, it was your own report that clinched the matter...I just pointed out a few details your superiors missed.\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't downplay your part! You did what any good police consultant would do...uhh...you consulted! Besides, she was originally called in for questioning on the serial murders case. So I'd like to downplay my involvement as much as possible. Dojima-san gives me enough bad looks as it is these days....\" Adachi said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto shook her head in exasperation. While it was true that the latest suspect was indeed a criminal, apprehending a local pick pocket and panty thief was a far cry from locating the mysterious serial murderer that had haunted the town for so long. That Adachi had zeroed in on this girl, Izumi Caito, as suspicious was sadly no real surprise. Adachi had picked up on her suspicious behavior and once again let his enthusiasm override his common sense. While the girl had been guilty of something, one look at her should have told the detective that she had neither the resources nor the upper body strength to efficiently kidnap and carry a grown adult any distance (both prerequisites for the serial killer/kidnapper to have). Naoto considered the whole episode yet another waste of her time (ironic, since she had recently been called off the case...but her dealings with the Investigation Team had opened up new avenues to the mystery the police themselves could never ever comprehend!), and that her deductions managed to book the suspect on entirely separate crimes was small consolation. Adachi was an expert at wasting time, so much so that Naoto suspected his \"aid\" had helped the actual killer steal away his victims more than it had helped the investigation. Purely coincidentally, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Naoto-san! Anyone else would have completely missed this suspect. She's a tricky one! Just ask a few questions, see if that amazing intuition of yours gets to tingling! It'll give you some work while your out here going to school, and it'll help the department out a lot! Please?\" Adachi begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto sighed. In truth the less she had to work with the department the more she could focus on the murder case under the table, but there was no graceful way to refuse this particular request. The police reasonably believed she was desperate to get back in their good graces and hungry for any scrap of work they might toss her, and there was something to be said for playing up that facade a bit. Still, interviewing a pervert was hardly worthy of her talents, even a tricky one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the detective prince found herself in a dimly lit room seated opposite a tanned woman with wild black hair and a playful glint in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well. A visit from the detective prince! I'm honored!\" Izumi said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sarcasm is noted.\" Naoto said dryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. I knew if anyone in this town could catch me, it would be you.\" Izumi smiled. \"You are my only match, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A oridinary, run of the mill, petty crook with a fetish for underwear thinks she's my equal. How flattering.\" Naoto muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now your starting to disappointment me. Ordinary? Really? I'm the best there is, hon! You'd be amazed what I can do with these hands! As for my fetish, what about it? I like to take a peep every now and again, and sometimes I bring back a trophy. When you get to be as good as I am, you deserve to take what you want! I mean, who gets hurt at the end of the day, really? Oh no! Some girl has to suffer through a little embarrassment cause I snatched her panties! Feh. Not like I'm tossing girls up on antennas like you cop buddies thought I had.\" Izumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you believe your crimes are justified on the grounds that they aren't murder?\" Naoto said, sighing in exasperation and sipping her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe any crime is justified when it won't do any real harm. I take chump change from schmucks that don't even know I was there. Sometimes it becomes clear that I've taken more than the oblivious fools can handle...and so I put it back. No one has ever noticed until now. See, it isn't what I take that thrills me, Princey. Its that I can take it, and no one will know I was there. Like a detective, really. You love digging into peoples secrets and pulling out the truth. Am I right? You'd never actually use those secrets to hurt anyone (except the criminals, of course). The thrill comes from being able to yank those secrets out and discover what your subjects were hiding! Same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except I don't get off on exposing those secrets. You receive a sexual thrill from stealing undergarments and other personal items!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that just makes you the bigger prude between the two of us, doesn't it?\" Izumi said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough. I'm wasting my time here...\" Naoto muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first I was thinking the same thing. It was kinda easy to do this even with you right in front of me. But no. It looks like you've got some particularly juicy secrets to hide...\" Izumi said with a smile, raising her hands from under the table to reveal a blue thong between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto stared a moment. She realized dumbly that the suspect had gotten out of her handcuffs. And then it dawned on Naoto how familiar that thong looked. Looking around, Naoto carefully felt around her waste, looking for the tell tail feel of the fabric beneath her blue pants lining. Her complexion reddened significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo...what is this? A cross dressing fetish? Naw. Your too serious for that. Are you just pretending? Maybe trying to milk your androgyny long enough to get a reputation you can ride on even when your curves really come in and you can't hide it anymore? Hmmm...I think that's part of it, but it isn't everything, right? So...are you just a little girl who wants to be more like those big burly hard boiled detectives in the old black and white movies...or is this a full blown 'guy in a girl's body' transgender things? Which, by the by, is totally cool with me. Be whoever you need to be, ya know? Just curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto glared at her. \"How....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah nah nah. No answering a question with a question, Miss Detective Prince...ess. But maybe its too early to know that one, huh? Your still pretty young. Getting to know your sexuality can take awhile, am I right? So forget I asked. You'll figure it out sooner or later, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here....!\" Naoto began, then yelped in surprise. Her left arm was handcuffed to the table!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. You listen. Your a damn clever little cutey pie, Naoto-'hon', but your also arrogant. You were so self-assured just now that picking your pocket was as easy as any dope on the street. I've been following you awhile, Nao-chan. I knew you were a match for me. But in person you totally underestimated me. Kinda pisses me off, you know? Holmes wouldn't of lastest five minutes if he stuck his nose up at Moriarty that way. I think I need to teach you a little lesson...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get my underwear. That...that isn't physically possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Impossible is a word for people who aren't masters of their craft, Naoto. I can steal anything, anytime, off anyone. Now then...enough chitchat. Your going to help me get out of here, Naoto-chan. Completely unseen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After revealing how dangerous you really are? What could possibly convince me to do that?\"</span></div></div>",

If you're as brilliant as you say you are, then you must know how stupid that threat is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown shot across Izumi's face. Not just a frown of disappointment, but one of anger. Naoto had just provoked her opponent in a way she couldn't let stand. Izumi stepped away from the restrained detective, her eyes sizing up and appraising her quarry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you were as brilliant as you say you are, you'd know better than to call your captor stupid.\" Izumi replied. \"Looks like it's up to me to show you just how foolish of you that was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzumi walked briskly past Naoto, passing behind the detective without even a moment's hesitation. As such, it was a huge surprise to Naoto to see a familiar blue bra tossed onto the table. A moment later, Naoto became acutely aware of the weight of her unconfined breasts pressing against her shirt uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto flushed red. \"H-h-how?!\" she squeaked. \"You didn't even touch me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I, Princess?\" Izumi purred. \"Or was my touch so light and perfect that you never even noticed? Also, if you don't mind me saying, it has got to be a crime to hide a pair of beauties like what you've got there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto self consciously crossed an arm against her chest, feebly trying to conceal the noticeable bulge of her bust. This was getting out of hand! Naoto had to figure out a way to get control of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've made your point! Now uncuff me and give me back my undergarments!\" Naoto cried, her authoritative demeanor crumbling with every word. \"You're... you're digging yourself into a hole with everything you take!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, is that the real pitch of your voice?\" Izumi teased as Naoto's voice cracked to its more feminine state. \"I barely recognized it. I wonder if anybody else would...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzumi passed by Naoto once more, and the flustered detective grew only redder as she suddenly saw her pants tossed onto the table! With a cry of dismay, Naoto crossed her legs and desperately threw her free hand over the neatly groomed patch of curls above her pink treasure. This couldn't be happening! She was bottomless in an interrogation room, at the absolute mercy of what was supposed to be her suspect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shapely hips, cute bottom, and I bet that hand is covering something really pretty.\" Izumi said. \"You should be thanking me, you know. I'm just trying to help you accept your body for what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's blood ran cold when she heard Izumi's voice. It wasn't the voice Izumi had used at the start of the interrogation. It was entirely different, but familiar... Realization hit Naoto like a ton of bricks: it was a perfect impersonation of her voice! Just who was this woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really a shame you refused to confess.\" Izumi said in Naoto's voice. \"And your bizarre behavior since the start of this interrogation has me worried about your mental state. Stripping yourself naked is not normal behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back into Naoto's line of sight, Izumi revealed herself to have drastically changed. Gone was the tanned skin and wild black hair, replaced with a complexion and hair matching Naoto's! In Izumi's hand was a wig, which she casually tossed on the table as she grabbed Naoto's discarded clothing and began to change into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... but... how?!\" Naoto asked, barely able to form a sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, Naoto-chan. I'm the best at what I do. That includes impersonation. How else do you think I eluded capture for so long?\" Izumi explained as she firmly placed the wig on Naoto's head, replacing her signature hat in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last flourish, Naoto found herself completely naked, and Izumi donning her jacket. If Naoto didn't know any better, she'd have thought she was looking in a mirror. A horrible, evil mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're quite done here.\" Izumi said, knocking on the interrogation room door. \"As for you, 'Ms. Caito', given your recent lewd behavior...\"</span></div></div>",

I need something, anything!</i> she thought, as she scanned the small room completely for something that should be there... It had to be there, but where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that-whoa!\" Adachi exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto slowly turned back, only to see Adachi and Izumi behind her, staring at her naked body.  \"A-Ah!\" she squeaked, paralyzed with fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the key to her cuffs.  I leave her in your capable hands, Detective,\" Izumi said, giving Adachi a key and turning to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Naoto screamed, finally finding her voice, covering her breasts with her free right arm.  \"Where?  Where are your clothes!?  I saw you take them off right in front of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My clothes?\" Izumi replied, in a confused tone.  \"Clearly you must be mistaken.  Are you talking about the clothes I am clearly wearing right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not mine, yours as in-\" Naoto paused, realizing her error.  \"I mean, <i>my</i> clothes, the ones I was wearing when you arrested me!  Before I... took them off myself,\" she choked out the words.  \"What did you do with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There reallly is something wrong with you,\" Izumi deadpanned.  \"I didn't do anything with your 'clothes', because there was nothing to do anything to.  Ever since you were arrested, you have been completely naked, don't you remember?  It caused quite a stir in the department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Naoto and Adachi gasped simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could've sworn you were wearing something when I found you,\" Adachi continued.  \"If you were naked, I'm sure I would've remembered, especially with a body like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep yourself composed, Detective!\" Izumi chastised.  \"No, I remember clearly, this little pervert was entirely nude, ever since you brought her in.  You told me yourself, detective, which was partially why I was so reluctant to continue this interrogation.  It was a good thing you did, however.  Anyone else would have underestimated this minx due to her nudity and would have been caught by surprise after she secretly undid the cuffs after stealing the key before I got here.  But fortunately, I was able to disarm her and trap her anew.  Now, I must be going, or do you need me to hold your hand while you escort her to a cell, Detective?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I should be quite alright here,\" Adachi said sheepishly, walking over to Naoto as Izumi left the room.  \"No resisting now, Ms. Caito,\" Adachi said as he undid the table cuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResistance was the last thing on Naoto's mind, however.  Oddly enough, so was her complete nudity and Adachi's not-very-subtle leering looks towards her amble bust.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the puzzle completely clouding Naoto's mind as Adachi led her out of the room was: where did Izumi's clothes go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definitely wearing something when she started the interrogation.  Naoto remembered it clearly.  It was a white button-up shirt, with the collar turned up and the top two buttons undone, allowing one a slight glimpse at the cleavage of her larger-than-average breasts.  And for her lower attire, Naoto had gotten a good look when Izumi had stood up to disrobe her of... everything... She was wearing a purple cloth miniskirt, with black circles in a pattern crossing diagonally.  The length of the garment only went down to the middle of her thighs, and the slit at the side scandalously went all the way up to just underneath her hip; fitting for a woman as vile as her.  As for footwear, Naoto hadn't glanced that far down, so she had no clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when Naoto was reduced to just her hat and jacket and Izumi started disguising herself as her, Izumi was already naked, somehow changed her skin complexion and wearing the wig, and began to put on Naoto's underwear.  Naoto couldn't remember what Izumi's underwear looked like, but it was highly likely, given the type of person Izumi was, that she wasn't wearing any in the first place.  Regardless, where did Izumi put the clothes she was actually wearing, and where did she pull out that wig from?  There were no hiding places in the interrogation room.  Also, she shouldn't have had the wig in the first place.  Master Thief or not, Izumi should have been searched thoroughly and had her possessions taken before the interrogation began, in case she was holding a weapon of some kind.  After all, even if nothing was in her pockets, she could have stored a hidden knife or tiny pistol in the waistband of her full-length, blue denim jeans.  There's no way Adachi would be that incompetent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut item hiding and storage was beside the point!    If Izumi was wearing Naoto's clothes over another set of clothing, it would have been clear as day.  After all, with Izumi having a chest around the size of Naoto's own, wearing anything other than that tight bra and jacket would have been a giveaway as to her true gender.  So the main question was still, 'Where did Izumi's outfit go?' After all, a bright yellow sundress doesn't just up and disappear from a room as small as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh...?  Sundress?  Wasn't it a button up shirt?</i> Naoto thought.  <i>And she was definitely wearing something underneath.  Shorts, wasn't it?  No...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto furrowed her brow, oblivious to the stares of the department as she was led through by Adachi, or to the fact that his jacket was covering her, for decency's sake.  <i>Why are my memories betraying me?</i> Naoto continued to ponder.  <i>Being forcibly stripped, though surely traumatic, should not have erased my memories of the suspect?  So why can't I remember what she was wearing?  Come to think of it, I can barely remember having my clothes taken.  I didn't even feel a thing.  I was right there, arm chained to the table, as she- wait!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at her handcuff-bound wrist, Naoto had a horrifying realization.  <i>Regardless of my personal state of mind, it would have been impossible to remove my jacket while I was still bound to the table.  It would have gotten stuck at my wrist and would have been impossible to fully remove from my body!  To remove my jacket, my arm needed to be free, but I was trapped there the entire time until Adachi undid the cuffs, so how...?  Something is terribly wrong here, and not just the situation I am in right now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Naoto flinched, shaken from her thoughts.  In short order, Adachi's jacket was forcibly removed from her, leaving her naked once again, though the handcuffs were still around both her wrists.  Now at attention, Naoto turned toward Adachi and realized that-</span></div></div>",

And that's not considering what I can do once I file the paperwork to have her put into my custody...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two thoughts warred in Izumi's head, each vying for dominance.

Izumi(???) needed to shore up the holes in her new identity before she began tormenting anyone else. So, file the papers first, then maybe \"help\" Naoto's reputation along...preferably in a way that would embarrass the actual detective immensely and allow her to write off any odd behavior like walking around naked. A sudden and avid interest in nudism was going to be hard to justify in the detective's case, but there was certainly a-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's phone began to ring. With a sigh of consternation, \"Izumi\" answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shirogane here.\" She said in a flawless voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done.\" Came a voice over the other end, a whisper she could barely hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm sorry. Can you speak up? Who is this?\" the impostor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a fan of your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well, as much as I appreciate an admirer of my detective skills, I don't appreciate unsolicited phone calls. Please do not call this number again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww. But I just wanted to say how well you handled putting that stupid bitch in her place. Flawless work.\" The voice said with an air of smugness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izumi\" bristled. Master of disguise and pickpocket extraodinaire she may have been, but she still had her pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you mean Miss Caito. I don't appreciate anyone calling her stupid or a bitch. She's clearly troubled, but also clearly very intelligent. As a detective I find it lamentable that anyone should come to such a state as her, especially when-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up a minute.\" The voice said. \"First off, I never said I was talking about Izumi Caito at all. And second, shouldn't a master thief let her work speak for itself and not sing her own praises like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzumi stopped dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Got your attention? Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An admirer, like I said. Its about time that someone put that crossdressing know it all bitch in her proper place. Surprised it escalated that quickly, but I knew how it was going to end. Naoto Shirogane, Detective Princess, stripped and misidentified. Hilarious.\" The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Glad you approve. I hope your not expecting me to be impressed, though. I've run into a blackmailer or two in my time. It didn't end well for them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Yeah. Can't be easy to blackmail someone who can just be someone else at the drop of a hat. Fortunately,  I don't really want anything from you. Just...to stick around a bit. Do what you love doing. And don't leave Inaba. Not yet. Not until I say to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Do you have any idea who your talking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, Sarah, I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....How in the fuck-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you wouldn't believe it if I told you. You've heard about the midnight channel? Urban legend around here. I'll let you in on a little secret. It shows you what you want to see. For most people, that's whatever shmuck was recently on the TV. But if you focus hard enough, it let's you see past all the useless things the other peons want to see...and lets you see things you alone can make use of. In my case, its pretty handy for learning about people's backgrounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a load of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Believe whatever you want. Bottom line is, I know about you. And I need a little favor. There's a group of idiots looking for the truth who could use a little distractions. So...distract them. Keep distracting them until I don't need you anymore. Then...get the fuck out and don't come back. That's fair, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what? You think you can catch me? Okay, yeah, pulling some names out of a hat is pretty impressive, but it isn't going to do jack shit if I decide to go to ground. I can be anywhere I want in a day. And only a mind like Shirogane could guess where I'll end up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Totally got me there. No way in hell I'd be able to find you once you started running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me, admirer-chan, why in the fuck of fuck would I play ball with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naoto wasn't the first, right? Nah, she's only the latest stolen identity. And its no coincidence you can imitate her so well. She's been your obsession for awhile now. An obsession in a long line of obsessions. So I'm curious. Are you a professional here? All business, no pleasure? Or have you been falling for each of your marks just a bit? Its a personal thrill, right? Learning everything you can, then becoming them? Heck, you've even managed to stockholm most of them into keeping silent about you. Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Getting it now? It'd pain me to no end if one of those old marks ended up on an antenna here in Inaba. But hey, that's how things go sometimes. You ask nice, but the stubborn bitches just refuse to play along....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you don't know who your fucking with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I do. And now you know who you don't want to fuck with. So have fun, play your game. Just remember not to cross the lines I tell you not to cross and everything will be super. So be a good girl and we can be really good friends. And friends pick up when friends call. Make sure this phone gets answered when I call again, friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line went dead.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah put the phone away. Glancing up and down the street, the girl currently dressed as Naoto Shirogane casually moved down the street, then ducked into a back alley when she was certain no one was watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shadows of side street, hidden from prying eyes, the girl sneaked over to a pile of debris. Sifting through the pile she found her prize, a little something she had hidden away here in case of an emergency. To the casual observer, she was holding a pistol. Inspect it a little close and one might conclude it was actually a plastic toy gun. Neither was correct. The item she held was called an Evoker. It was a bit of technology purpose made to summon a persona under conditions that would normally make such a feat difficult or impossible. Even with an Evoker, calling one up in the real world was difficult. Fortunately, Sarah was an old hat at this sort of thing. And her 'partner' was rather good at conning his way into place he shouldn't be able to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come forth, Inaba-no-Shirousagi!\" She said softly, putting the gun to her head and pulling the trigger. She heard a sound like breaking glass and felt a jolt of pain on the side of her head where the pistol had made contact. Bluish sparks erupted around her, swirling around her and coalescing into the form of...a white rabbit. A rabbit the size of a Buick, who stared at her with blood red eyes that lacked pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its been awhile.\" The creature intoned. \"To what do I owe the pleasure, Sarah-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your voice down!\" Sarah hissed, looking around her. \"We have a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I kinda got swept into the middle of some kind of shit-storm. Somebody's killing people in your old hopping grounds. Seems like Personas are involved. Now they're trying to get me to do their fucking dirty work.\" Sarah explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Sounds like one of Izanami's little games. I'm not interested.\" The rabbit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get interested! I'm being threatened here! If I go down, nothing good happens to you, right?\" Sarah snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't confuse me with one of you mortal's petty inner selves. I did not emerge from your mind, I crossed the Sea of the Unconscious (at no small cost to myself!) and chose your mind to occupy. If you fall I simply return to the unconscious.\" The rabbit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act like you did me any favors, you bastard! You've made my life an upsidedown hell and you know it!\" Sarah snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have graciously allowed you to live rather than exercise my right and ability to execute you for opening the door to your mind and letting in a being of my stature. I have even graced you with power to aid in your proclivities. I should be praised.\" The rabbit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you. Just cause you don't murder my ass the way those things tried to with Strega doesn't mean I owe you jack shit. I was good enough without your little disguise trick. And we both know you wouldn't stay in my head if you had anywhere else to go! Or has the Dragon Clan forgotten about you yet?\" Sarah mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....No. I lied and used them for my own gain. They have not forgotten, and they certainly have not forgiven, despite my suffering.\" The rabbit remarked darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah snorted. \"So both our asses are on the line right now. So...gimme something I can use, dammit!\" Sarah demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what? You know very well I will not fight your battles. My talents are not in that area, and I would find the practice distasteful regardless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno! Gimme an edge! These are your old stomping ground, right 'White Rabbit of Inaba'?\" Sarah mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name is 'Naked Rabbit of Inaba'. The rabbit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares? It can mean either thing.\" Sarah shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OF COURSE IT MATTERS!\" The rabbit snapped. \"Do you think I would have begged the gods for assistance if my white fur was intact? NO! The dragons burned my fur away, leaving me singed and as bald as you worthless human beings! I had to beggar myself before the other entities of the unconscious. Most of them were spiteful, wretched things whose 'remedies' caused me further humiliation and suffering!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've heard all this before, ya know! Face it, big guy, you kinda deserved what you got. You were the one that fibbed in the first place...and then you were dumb enough to let your little lie slip. Of course it was gonna get back to the Dragons, and of course they were gonna be pissed. The rest was just shitty luck. That's life. Get over it.\" Sarah shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Oh yes. I lied. And I suffered for it. Meanwhile, humanity lies to each other and themselves every day! These lands have always been close to realms within the Sea of Souls. But now the place where this reality touches the unconscious is filled with an awful fog created by humanity's endless lies! They fear the truth, and their fear has been made manifest just beyond the curtains of reality. Izanami has been driven mad, her love of humanity and her desire to fulfill their wishes has sundered her to the very core! Humanity deserves to suffer so much more for their lies than I did. And you, my little robber girl, you will deliver that suffering...and you will know it.\" The rabbit declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah cringed. \"Err...yeah. Yeah, I got it. I've got some clothes right here, in fact, stripped right off a real cutie! So, uh, are we gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit opened its mouth. Sarah tossed in the clothes of her lost identity, Izumi Caito. The rabbit made a dramatic show of chomping on the clothes like they were a cabbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More.\" It said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but...\" Sarah whispered. \"I...uh...I don't have any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that you wear.\" The beast said without pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh COME ON. I need your help, here! Not more problems on top of everything else!\" Sarah snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a liar, Sarah O'Connelly. You have done so all your life, from the highlands of your home across three continents to this island chain. It was a lie that brought you into the dooms day cult of Nyx, and it was a lie that allowed me entrance into your mind. I provide you a modicum of peace because you revel in spreading the humiliations I endured to the rest of humanity. But as much as it pleases me to see you deliver those humiliations to others, I love to see them forced upon you still more. This is the price of my help, and the consequence of your lies. NOW STRIP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed beneath her makeup. In a few moments she had tossed away Naoto's hat, shirt, pants, and underwear into the beast's hungry gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. We both know how you revel in stealing another's identity. Now the people of Inaba will get to see your real face and body. Enjoy being plain old Sarah for a time, a powerless, sniveling, ordinary little girl. The memory of your nudity will fade from everyone's minds with time, of course, as it always does. But for now, enjoy the humiliations you have given to so many. We can speak of your reward when I deem your suffering has been sufficient. Good bye, little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit vanished, leaving Sarah standing in the middle of a small town completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hate that damn bunny.\" She said to know one in particular.</span></div></div>",

In the rare instances she wasn't assuming an identity, she stuck out like a sore thumb. Westerners already stood out in a place like Tokyo, to say nothing of a small town, and to say even less about a completely naked Westerner. As much as Sarah just wanted to stay put in the alley, she knew Shirousagi wouldn't let her off the hook so easily. So, grumbling the whole time, Sarah crept her way over to the edge of the alley, carefully poking her head out and looking up and down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as unfortunate as Sarah had feared: there were plenty of people milling about. After all, this was as close to a \"downtown\" a town like this could get, and it was the middle of the day. Taking a deep breath, Sarah silently cursed that rabbit that was her persona, and dashed out of hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Sarah heard the cries of shock, surprise, disgust, and amusement. Sure enough, the naked foreigner was an instant spectacle, her healthy chest bouncing freely in the sunlight, while her round buttocks jiggled lightly with every step. Normally, Sarah would be worried about somebody calling the police, but she knew Shirousagi wouldn't allow it. One of the biggest benefits of Sarah's relationship with the rabbit was that it made her effectively anonymous in her true form. While the embarrassment and catcalls were real, she'd be forgotten within an hour of being seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, people are seeing me. I know that's what you want, you jackass!</i> Sarah screamed in her head. <i>Are you happy now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I will be \"happy\" when I-</i> Shirousagi's voice replied, suddenly cutting off. <i>Wait! That smell... it's one of them! One of the gods that dared humiliate me! Your aimless running has led us right to someone truly deserving of my vengeance! Consider your punishment suspended, human. We are going to exact revenge upon-</i></span></div></div>",

One that was larger, a bit more populated, and better stocked with amenities to spend an entire day there, as opposed to the slim pickings of their usual spot.  It meant a longer trip by scooter but Yosuke, who originally suggested the location, assured them that it would be worth it.  And it looked like it would be, as the team first set their eyes on this new location.  However, they weren't expecting there to be a fenced off entrance guarded by a belligerent lifeguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was what one would expect a lifeguard to look like: tall, short-haired, skin glistening in the midday sun, and cutting a powerful figure in his tanktop and speedo, a whistle hanging from a cord wrapped around his neck. \"Hold up,\" he said, stopping the group's advance.  \"Only swimsuits or proper beach attire are allowed past here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Naoto asked.  \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A while back there were some kids who nearly drowned here, all because they were a little to close to the water and weren't prepared for a sudden tide increase.  Turned out they couldn't swim.  So now, no swimmers are allowed past here at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, seriously?\" Chie gasped.  \"Way to pick 'em Yosuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of dread began to spread through the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is news to me too!\" Yosuke shot back, feeling the team's glares.  \"Nothing about this came up in the advertising.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not something we like to talk about, for obvious reasons,\" the lifeguard shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, wait, what does that have to do with swimsuits?\" Rise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I personally am not proud of this, but,\" the lifeguard said, lowering his voice and leaning in towards the group. \"We used to give everyone a swim test for entry before, but due to complaints that got revoked, but there were safety concerns, so we made this compromise.  If you're wearing a swimsuit, then you should be able to know how to swim.  From there, it's normal beach safety issues.  It's perfect logic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it isn't.  That way of thinking is highly flawed,\" Naoto stated, shaking her head.  \"Take me for example: I can swim, I just don't have a swimsuit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you can't pass,\" said the lifeguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a swimsuit, Nao-chan?\" Teddie asked, surprised.  \"Then, do you swim bear-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Naoto shut off Teddie before he could say what he, and undoubtedly everyone else was thinking by the looks on their faces.  \"I don't have one because I was not even planning on going swimming,\" Naoto said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swimsuits only past this point,\" the lifeguard reiterated.  The group started to protest, but the lifeguard cut them off.  \"Sorry, kids, I don't make the rules, I just enforce them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't on the advertising either...\" Yosuke grumbled, once again suffering the glares of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, works for me!\" Teddie said, springing out of his bear suit and stepping out with his human body, already dressed in swimming trunks.  With a shrug, the rest of the team followed, having worn their swimsuits underneath their clothes also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto grumbled and turned away as they did so.  Just how was her current attire not fit for the beach anyways?  Sure it wasn't a swimsuit, but her casual short-sleeved button-up shirt, a t-shirt underneath, and a pair of shorts with sandals should be light enough to serve as a substitute without much difficulty!  And yet that was considered too much.  Maybe she should just strip down to her undergarments there and now and pass them off as swimwear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto considered the possibility for just a moment before shaking the foolish notion out of her head.  One, she just told him that she did not have a swimsuit, and two, she was not going to humiliate herself like that just for a chance at a day at the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And after all that way... Sorry, guess that's just how it is, Naoto,\" Kanji said sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto looked at the worried faces of her friends, and realized that her frustration was still apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Naoto said, regaining her composure.  \"There's bound to be a swimsuit shop back in the city somewhere.  I'll just catch up with all of you later.  Shouldn't take more than an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, what's that?\" Yu asked, pointing at a shack behind the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our emergency beach shop.  Sells important beach supplies, such as towels, umbrellas, sunscreen, and even swimsuits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Then can I at least go there and buy a swimsuit to change into?\" Naoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, can't enter the beach if you don't have a swimsuit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Naoto asked, the combined frustration of her comrades echoing around her.  \"What possible service could such a shop serve if it is stuck behind the gate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accidents can happen at the ocean.  It's better to be prepared, just in case,\" the lifeguard said mysteriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can't we go?\" Yu asked.  \"There's nothing stopping us from buying a swimsuit and bringing it back, right?  We're clearly wearing swimsuits after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" the lifeguard considered this briefly.  \"Don't see why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo!  Ooo!\" Teddie jumped, cheering.  \"I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" Chie growled, holding him back.  \"Who knows what crazy thing <i>you</i> would end up choosing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm the only one who knows Nao-chan's measurements, remember?  You might get something too small!\" Teddie grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I got to see those too, remember, Teddie?\" Rise said, joining Chie in in holding him back.  \"You're not needed here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto flushed crimson.  Why did they have to bring that up!?  This was already embarrassing enough as it was.  \"Look, just, all of you go!\" Naoto shouted at them.  \"I think Yukiko-senpai would appreciate your help more than I would right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe struggling trio stopped to see Yukiko having gone ahead of them, floundered in surprise, and then clamored off after her towards the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto and the others remained where they were in silence.  The guys looked nervous, and Naoto herself was feeling a little guilty, having caused all this indirectly due to her beach habits.  Soon enough though, Yukiko and her group returned, proudly holding an item, presumably the swimsuit, in her hands.  \"We're back!\" she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Naoto said, taking the suit into her hands.  \"I hope that wasn't too much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, Naoto-kun,\" Rise said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Teddie added.  \"When it comes to Nao-chan, no expense is too great for Yosuke's wallet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, WHAT!?\" Yosuke gasped, patting his pockets, his face paling.  \"Again!?  When did he-?  And you just let him!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this was your idea, and we left our stuff outside,\" Chie argued.  \"Look, We'll pay you back when we get back, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yosuke and Chie began to argue, Naoto took the time to head into a changing booth and get changed.  What a mess this all was... But at least they would all be able to finally get into the beach and enjoy themselves, now that she had a swimsuit; though she'd much rather spend the day in her own clothes... but it was clear that that was not going to be an option by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to get on with the day, Naoto had taken off everything, including her underwear, before actually regarding the swimsuit Yukiko had given her, noticing for the first time that it was-</span></div></div>",

The same shade of blue as her iconic hat, the one-piece suit covered up a decent amount of skin, though it still left her legs and arms more bare than she'd like. Slipping into the suit, Naoto was even more surprised to find that the suit fit quite well, albeit perhaps a tiny bit snug. Then again, considering her measurements, Naoto knew the others probably did the best they could. Perhaps this wouldn't be so bad, Naoto thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside the changing stall, Teddie was cowering from a ranting Yosuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't keep using me as a personal credit card, Teddie!\" Yosuke said, waving his arms at his naive teammate. \"I'm not made of money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, come on, Yosuke! It's not like I'm using your card for useless stuff!\" Teddie shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?! What about that time you 'borrowed' it for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important right now!\" Teddie said, cutting off his friend's rant. \"Besides, I know how you feel about that, so you'll be happy to know Nao-chan's suit wasn't expensive at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke's rant stopped in its tracks, his anger seeming to dissipate with this newest revelation. \"Wait, seriously? So what was all that stuff about 'no expense is too great!'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cheeky blush and a smile, Teddie put a hand behind his head. \"You gotta tell the babes what they wanna hear, Yosuke. Don't you know anything about talking to ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true that Teddie's choice of suit for Naoto had been surprisingly cheap. Yukiko, Chie, and Rise didn't bother paying attention to price, seeing as it was Yosuke's money being spent, so no eyebrows were raised when the suit was purchased. At least, no eyebrows were raised by the Investigation Team; the cashier, however, was rather curious. Most of what the store sold was normal, dependable swimwear and other beach items, but that particular type of suit was something else. It was cheap because, well, it wasn't meant to be a long-term garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason the one-piece suit Naoto was now stepping out onto the beach with was a mere fraction of its normal price, was because it was-</span></div></div>",

It was nice to relax by wading around in the water for a number of minutes, but she wasn't one for the long-term exertion or wandering too far away from the shore. It was for that reason that she meant to just wade out into the shallow area of the beach, just enough to dampen her hair and possibly float around while the others kept themselves occupied.

I-Is this really all I have to wear?  Her suit was very similar to a bikini, if bikinis were made to hide the bare essentials and nothing more. The top consisted of two seashells, barely large enough to cover her nipples, tied together with seaweed which, combined with her well-endowed chest, was almost comical. The bottom also left very little to be left to the imagination. Like a g string, it only really covered her vagina and left her rear end completely exposed. She couldn\u2019t go out in front of the girls like this, let alone the boys! It\u2019s just too mortifying!

Total.  Wardrobe.  Malfunction.\" said Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto, out of fear of being seen by the beachgoers at large, could only just barely keep herself from crying out loud as she fell backwards into the water, wrapping her arms across herself like a straight-jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, so sorry, Naoto,\" Chie apologized profusely.  \"I'm sure there's something else I can find, just hang on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!

Argh...\" Naoto tried to call out as the others left her.  \"At least one of them could've stayed with me,\" she said as she shrunk into the water, feeling highly vulnerable.  Well, at least the worst would be over once the girls came back with some coverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*TWEET*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden noise of a whistle blowing shook Naoto out of her thoughts.  That rude lifeguard from the entrance was nearby conducting a patrol, and apparently laying down some beach law to some patrons.  Her body was still blocked by the ocean in the shallows, but his path seemed to be getting closer to her location, and if he got close enough, he'd surely notice her current state as an unintentional skinny-dipper.  Given his previous strict regulations on swimwear, she could not allow herself to be discovered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she saw that the lifeguard was turned away, distracted by some people rushing into the water away from her.  Now would be the only chance she had to get to a better location to remain hidden.  But which way should she go?</span></div></div>",

Dark blue in color, she could already tell that the two pieces would not be covering much of her, which made her nervous.  Not only would it leave her gender unambiguous and easily apparent for everyone to see, but she also felt uncomfortable wearing such scanty clothes, especially if she was going to be stared at.  She couldn't even make it through the swimsuit portion of that damned beauty pageant Yosuke signed her and the girls up for back then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as much as Naoto wanted to pack it in, she remembered her friends and that the girls (plus Teddie), had picked this out for her.  She couldn't just throw that back in their faces.  And like it or not, she would have to conform to some kind of swimsuit so that they could get in... she could do this much for them at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she put the bikini on, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it fit her perfectly, and seemed to be holding okay.  And at least there was some decent coverage of her cleavage and bottom on this one, rather than some other swimsuits she had seen which were little more than strings and modesty triangles.  She could probably make this work.  Taking a deep breath, she opened the door and stepped back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoo!  Nao-chan!\" Teddie cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naoto!\" Kanji stammered.  \"You, um, you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing, Naoto-kun!\" Rise cheered as well, along with other encouraging remarks from the rest of the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks,\" Naoto said, already feeling embarrassed.  She was standing firm, not wasnting to be shaken, but that would be easier if the guys would pick up their jaws from the ground.  Even Yu looked flustered, for goodness sakes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were hoping it would work,\" said Yukiko.  \"They didn't have anything else in your size, so we were hoping this would be okay.  And with a two-piece, we all match!... Um, kind of, at least.  Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... wonderful.  Thank you, everyone.\" said Naoto, not wanting to disappoint and knowing that it could have been worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" said Chie.  \"We're all in swimsuits now.  No more problems letting us in, right?\" she addressed the lifeguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, yeah, sure,\" the lifeguard replied, startlingly more polite.  \"Again, I'm sorry if I er, inconvenienced you in any way, um, Miss.  I mean, I probably should have let you in to shop, since you were in need and all, but, you know, the rules-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.  It's fine,\" Naoto said, leveling her voice.  <i>Amazing how much more cooperative you are now than before...</i> she thought bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that obstacle out of their way, the swimsuit-clad Investigation Team entered the beach and soon found a spot and set on up.  There were others at the beach, but not too many, and thankfully none of them were staring their way, everyone all swept up in their own activities.  Naturally, after some boasting by Yosuke that he was right on the money, the discussion turned to what to do next, and everyone decided to do their own things for a bit.  Teddie decided to canvass the beach for some \"hot babes,\" and Yosuke followed suit, partly to join in and partly to make sure that Teddie wouldn't do something that ended up in them all getting thrown out.  Rise pulled Yu down over to the shoreline with a glint in her eye and a mischievous smile... they would probably be gone a while.  Then, Yukiko realized she was hungry, so she and Chie headed over to the snack shop, leaving the young detective alone with Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's just the two of us,\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" Kanji answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone else seems to have decided except for us.  Was there something you wished to do, Kanji-kun?\" Naoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To do?  You mean, together?\" Kanji asked, sounding surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like,\" Naoto shrugged.  \"I mean, everyone else has paired up as well, and I'm open for pretty much anything.  But if there was something you wanted to do on your own, please do not let me be a hindrance.  I was just planning on reading right here for a while if that is the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I uh... AH!  I just realized I forgot to eat this morning.  Gotta get some grub!\" he stammered, then sped off toward the snack shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I guess reading it is, then,\" Naoto shrugged, sitting down on a towel and opening her book, eager to pick up where she left off.  It was probably best this way.  She was almost at the climax where the detective was about to confront-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto had only made it a few pages before she was interrupted.  It was Chie, with a mostly-eaten steak croquette in her mouth.  \"Just sitting here all by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Naoto answered.  \"Kanji was here before but he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stormed to the snack line all nervous and red in the face?  Yeah...\" Chie sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it...\" Naoto groaned, hunching over to conceal her well-framed bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not your fault.  Kanji's always been that nervous around you even in your normal clothes, you know?  It's probably just cause you were alone together,\" Chie said, finishing up her food and tossing the skewer on their stuff.  \"Hm... Tell you what, how about we get Yukiko and Kanji with us and then we all go do something so we can start having fun here and forget all about that scummy lifeguard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose since I am wearing a swimsuit I should make the most of this, and a group activity may ease Kanji's nerves,\" said Naoto, uncurling herself and setting her book aside.  \"All right, I'm in.

Though Teddie had complained, the rest of the group was pretty understanding, and so even though Naoto had agreed she would likely join in their fun later, (provided they wouldn't be in the water themselves,) they headed down to the shore line while Naoto sat with their stuff further on up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as Naoto was starting to feel comfortable, she was interrupted by a couple of people running up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  I thought I was seeing things at first, but it really looks like him!\" squealed a teenage girl, looking to be slightly older than Naoto, wearing a bright yellow bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, you're right!\"  exclaimed a boy about the same age wearing red and green striped swimming trunks.  \"That blue hat and hair... that young face...  Hey, are you that Ace Detective, Naoto Shirogane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" Naoto answered warily. \"And you a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!  The Detective Prince himself!\" the girl interrupted, swooning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, talk about good luck, running into such a famous person here!\" the boy said, taking the girl's hands and looking into her face, sporting a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" the girl replied, mirroring his expression.  \"And with all that stuff he's sitting next to... Do you think he's on a case?  Maybe a stakeout?  Or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I am not in the middle of anything at the moment,\" Naoto interjected, standing up to address them.  She was starting to get a little annoyed, but was also somewhat surprised that these people didn't know her true gender, considering all of Inaba knew after her abduction incident in the Midnight Channel.  Word must not have reached this area yet, or at least these people's ears.  \"Was there something you wanted from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Sorry,\" the man apologized.  \"You probably don't get many breaks being a professional detective, right?  It's nothing, we'll just be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hang on!\" the girl spoke up, interrupting her partner's turning around to leave.  \"If he's not busy, maybe he can, you know...?\" she said, her voice dropping several levels of volume, laced with insinuations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the man asked, looking back and forth between Naoto and his companion.  \"Well, yeah, it'd be great if he could but I'm not sure if he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem of some kind?\" Naoto asked perceptively, not that she needed any of her intuition to know that something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" the pair spoke, before catching each other and pausing awkwardly.  The girl then continued:</span></div></div>",

When did I fall asleep? Why am I in the blue...WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES???\u201d The guest of the Velvet Room screamed finding herself entirely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were not wearing any clothing when you fell asleep.\u201d Margaret explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Why the heck wouldn\u2019t I....\u201d Marie began while covering herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you remember prior to this?\u201d Margaret asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I had just come back from the Hollow Forest. Those...stupid idiots with their stupid moron leader...had saved me. I was trying to end my existence and they....those idiots wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. I...they just saved my life!\u201d Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good. What happened next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was a mad rush to get out of the collapsing dungeon. And then....we had one of those stupid ultra embarrassing moments where they all gushed about friendship and how I was important to them and....ugh! It was really sappy and I wanted to die! Except not because they were really nice and those jerks made feel like an idiot and and a bigger jerk for wanting to vanish with the fog in the first place! It was seriously the most stupid thing ever and I\u2019m never gonna be able to talk to the idiots again without blushing like one of those fire truck things.....can I please have something to wear?? Telling this story is humiliating enough without-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m afraid for a number of reasons allowing you modesty. Is out of the question. Please continue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...okay. We...had a fight with snow? I pretty much destroyed them. Then...the bath! There was a outdoor bath and I was with the other girls and...those jerks! They were peeping on us! I let them have it and...and...there was this loud noise and...and now I\u2019m sitting here naked answering stupid questions!\u201d Marie shrieked, deeply confused and embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. I am glad to see you remember. So...do you remember how you \u201clet them have it\u201d?\u201d Margaret asked while jotting down notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! The idiots tried to peek over the fence, it collapsed, I had to look at their junk, and I hit them with a lightning bolt!\u201d Marie said remembering the moment of her wrath with glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. Did you hear the plea not to use electricity while they were standing in water?\u201d Margaret asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. They were begging for mercy and they were getting none!\u201d Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. So you did hear them. And you were aware of the properties of water mixed with electricity?\u201d Margaret asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Of course! Amplification! Tripled by vengeance!\u201d Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm. Did you know that the typical punishment for peeping in such a situation is a fine or a brief jail sentence?\u201d Margaret asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cServes them right for peeping on a goddess!\u201d Marie said. \u201cOr...maybe a goddess? I\u2019m still not clear about the whole Saguri thing....like did i create them or...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo in summation you felt that a bolt of elemental energy the size of the building you were in was an appropriate response to your violated modesty, while being fully aware that such attacks are lethal to normal humans. Also that our guest and the friends you previously mentioned helped to save your life at no small peril to themselves were your main targets of said dangerous and possibly lethal attack? And the purpose of this attack was meant as retribution for your embarrassment at being seen undressed. Is that accurate, Marie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I don\u2019t like where this is going...what the hell is this about?\u201d Marie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI simply wished to have a full account of the facts before I decide on an appropriate consequence for one guest of the Velvet Room placing another in extreme danger for reasons as petty as modesty. An attack coming on the heels of a very carefully and time consumingly arranged series of events on my part to place our guest in a position to ensure that your foolish and shortsighted decision to end your own life was prevented.\u201d Margaret said with a calm voice tinted with an icy edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWwwait a second. I was just-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor your edification the lightning strike had the side effect of causing an avalanche that buried your bathhouse and would likely have killed all of you if not for a few deft actions on my part. Now you and your female companions are merely unconscious and scattered along the slope. None of you have suffered significant injury.\u201d Margaret said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? I...wow. I had no idea!\u201d Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, A running theme when it comes to your actions and the consequences that will follow.\u201d Margaret said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me you ice queen harpy bitch? Who the hell even asked you to interfere to begin with.?\u201d Marie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur guest. He seems possessed of this peculiar sense of mercy that your life is worth preserving. I believe he might even hold that opinion if you were to see him unclothed and he suddenly could call down lightning outside the Hollow Forest.\u201d Margaret said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen you dumb yellowed eyed bitch I...I...okay look I may have been a little...impulsive okay? I just...ummm...oh who cares! It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything you can do to me anyway!\u201d Marie sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time while inside the Velvet Room Marie found herself shivering in fright as Margaret gave a slow, predatory smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, a resident of this room is bound by contract to assist and aid the destiny of our guest. That includes temporary residents like yourself. Violation of your contact, such as endangering the life of a guest or those bound to his destiny for petty or frivolous reasons offers the assistant in charge considerable leeway in penalizing the offender. For example...a resident might have their ability to call upon magic in the real world revoked for a period of my choosing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour taking my magic? You CUNT!\u201d Marie screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I state for the record that this...insistence you have for spitting out insults and refusing to pay proper gratitude for the services others provide on your behalf has been...trying this past year? But it does make me curious- do you consider it wise to antagonize the arbiter of your fate in this way?\u201d Margaret asked with a sinister gleam in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMargaret..l-look! I made a mistake! I\u2019ll admit it! But come on! I know I can be a little...ummm...but your like the big cool senpai of this place! You can let that stuff slide, r-r-right?\u201d Marie swallowed. \u201cI-I-I do better! Please don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurt you? No. You can rest easy. I have no interest in making you suffer physically. A lesson in impulse control and humility requires a different method...\u201d Margaret said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. O-kay. That\u2019s...good?\u201d Marie trailed off. \u201cThat\u2019s good, right? W-why do I still feel terrified?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour instincts for once are in top form.\u201d Margaret said. \u201cI had hoped to teach you respect in a subtler way, Marie. Feeding Yu that dreadful poetry of yours, for example. But clearly a less subtle lesson is in order.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew it! I knew it! Do you even know how humiliating it was seeing him read all of my thoughts, you Goddamn CU-CU..,\u201d Marie blanched. \u201cCunning, clever wise merciful big sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it felt humiliating at the time, Marie. But all things are relative are they not?\u201d Margaret asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what..,what does that..,,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResident Marie of the Velvet Room, for violations of your contract you are ability to invoke magic in the real is henceforward revoked for a period yet to be determined. In addition, upon awakening you will find yourself and your female associates cold and naked on a mountain range. A search of the area will yield the following items of clothing- Your velvet blue cap, your red choker collar, your black and white stocking, and your black shoes. In addition your companions will locate several pairs of high heel shoe colored green, red, gold and dark blue in association with their preferred color scheme. Finally, simply because I as the arbiter of fate deem it a cool and stylish accessory I would frankly miss too much should I deprive her of it, Naoto Shirogane will find her blue detectives cap miraculously untouched among the debris of the avalanche. With the exception of the above items, Fate itself shall henceforth deny you right to wear any other form of clothing at all, and will should any of you seek to defy this edict and wear any other garment you subsequently find Fate will conspire to strip said garment from you in a timely fashion in a manner you will find to be especially humiliating. While under this penalty Fate will provide some protections to your persons- no danger to your life of act of violence will occur in your vicinity and the cold will be amusingly uncomfortable rather than deadly (Fate will preserve your existence on the mountain if you huddle together for warmth, while also conspiring to make the close proximity embarrassing and arousing for all involved). Such shall be your existence until such time as I deem your lesson learned. If any of your companions ask why they are being punished you may reference a previous bathhouse incident in which their own behavior also appalling on a lesser scale. They know what they did. I mean, really, smashing his head with buckets and no apology when realizing your mistake? Consider this an overdue reprisal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie gaped. \u201cMargaret! You can\u2019t! This is way too much! Don\u2019t you dare-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie vanished with the snap of Margaret\u2019s fingers. </span></div></div>",

Lately she had stopped being subtle about it, too, dropping hints like anvils (eww, that was a good one, have to remember that for her next poem) that she had read and smirked at poor Marie's most inner thoughts. How she was doing it was anyone's guess...she probably had all kinds of ways to mess with space and time in that stupid magic room. Just what was so much fun about humiliating the tortured soul of a young poet anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas for poor Marie, she was soon to learn what real humiliation felt like! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in this state of rage and paranoia that Marie found herself smacking right into a big wooden sign at the end of a long drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! Watch where your going, FISHFACEDJERK!...Oh.\" Marie said, blushing as she realized she had run right into an obstruction. \"Who the hell put this here??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmagi Inn, said the sign. Why did that sound familiar? She didn't know that much about the world, so it surely must be from one of her trips with Yu. Inn....Inn....yeah! The Red Girl talked about an Inn. Its a place where visitors to town could stay, right? Wow. Look at that big wooden building. It wasn't flashy and bright like Junes. More...old...but it had a sort of solemn dignity about it. All the statues and little ponds with the big yellow fish looked pretty neat. If this was the same Inn that Red Girl talked about, it also had lots of rooms and a big public bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. This was good. This was a good place to relax. Relax and smolder and forget about stupid cute boys that barge into your private things and read embarrassing things you write! Maybe the Red Girl could help her find some new clothes? Humans change their colors a lot, right? And wasn't getting new clothes supposed to relieve stress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe she could get one of those rooms at the Inn. They probably had televisions. Televisions were supposed to be fun. Maybe she could finally watch that show Margaret had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr...or maybe a bath? Maybe a really long, really hot bath with all the girls gathered together like at the Ski Resort. They could wash each other's backs and talk about how stupid nosey idiot boys were. That had been a lot of fun up until the boys saw her naked....and even then smiting them with thunderbolts had been pretty satisfying in its own way. Still! A long bath with a lot of female company could be just what her mood demanded, this time without any male intruders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! Absolutely no one was going to embarrass her anymore today! And definitely no one would see her naked! All that mattered now was choosing what to do with her time...</span></div></div>",

This is the best way to recover after a long day!\" Rise Kujikawa sighed, her long auburn hair tied up in small ringlets to keep it out of the water. \"Thanks for the invite, Yukiko-senpai! You're the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can't take all the credit. It was Marie-chan's idea!\" Yukiko said, beaming in the direction of the blue haired girl. \"Fortunately, this season has been particularly slow, so we don't have anyone staying at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three young girls formed a small circle in one corner of the bath. They had decided not to wear the large towels that provided some amount of modesty in the bathing area. After all, it was only the girls of the Investigation Team here tonight, and besides Yukiko had been severely chewed out for allowing so many of the courtesy towels to become soaked during their last visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, over by the showers, Marie and Naoto were busy washing and scrubbing in the small showering area adjacent to the spring itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this necessary again? I thought the point of taking a bath was to get clean IN THE BATH. Washing up before hand seems like something an idiot would do.\" Marie said, glancing at Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...that's a blunt way to put it. And no. A public bath is not the same as a swimming pool. Most of them do not possess chlorine or other chemicals intended to keep the water clean. It is a serious breach of etiquette to enter the water without first cleaning yourself off.\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm. So many rules. Your society is really annoying sometimes.\" Marie muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't argue with that assessment.\" Naoto smiled. \"Oh...Marie-chan...there's a reason I was the last one in line for the showers here. I wanted to warn you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Is something wrong?\" Marie asked, glancing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not...exactly. Just...be prepared. The other girls can be rather...hands on in the bath.\" Naoto said, glancing at the three girls chattering in the bath an blushing to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Hands on what?\" Marie asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....you and I, mostly.\" Naoto sighed. \"The few occasions we've been naked together have involved them...expressing a great deal of admiration...for my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, to be fair, I can't really blame them. I mean...have you seen the size of those things?\" Marie pointed at Naoto's chest. \"I'm pretty sure you outclass every girl in town with those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thank you.\" Naoto said, blushing furiously. \"I am...often reminded of that now that my secret has come out into the open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Naoto. Living half her life convinced that her body and gender were a roadblock for her dreams. Recent experiences could not undo the ingrained sense of terror and shame she felt in situations where her sex was emphasized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-anyway, we don't need to talk about that! I bring this up because sometimes they express their...admiration by...touching.\" Naoto said, lowering her voice as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? That's a thing girls do too? I thought it was just gross older men on subways! Should I...smack them in the groin too?\" Marie asked, clearly befuddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! No...and please don't use any of your lightning powers either! This is a perfectly normal activity among female peers....I think.\" Naoto whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You THINK?\" Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I...I never had many female peers when I was younger. And even then I was attempting to conceal my gender most of the time, so as you can imagine I have had very few opportunities to...to interact with them in this way. But...I've read that public baths are an excellent opportunity to interact with one's friends in a way where the social distinctions of society can be relaxed. So it is most likely just a way to express affection that would otherwise be inappropriate. P-perhaps combined with...a desire to help me accept myself and to cease being so timid about my body.\" Naoto whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay, that sounds plausible. That or they all got the hots for you while you were pretending to be a man and they all still feel frisky around you.\" Marie mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...\" Naoto said, blushing. \"Yes, perhaps. In any case, I wanted to warn you not to be alarmed. They...have expressed an admiration for your body as well. There was no opportunity to get close to you in the Ski Lodge, of course, but I suspect if given the opportunity...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha. So don't freak out and just let them do their thing, right? Sounds simple enough.\" Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" Naoto whispered as the pair finished washing themselves off and headed towards the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marie was sliding into the bath, Naoto suddenly grabbed her shoulders and stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Naoto whispered, then in a loud voice. \"EVERYONE! LOOK HOW PRETTY MARIE'S SKIN IS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie blinked in bewilderment and turned around to look at Naoto. \"Wha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I don't distract them they'll go after me!\" Naoto said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Naoto, your totally right. Look how smooth and creamy it is!\" Rise said, who had gotten alarmingly close to Marie while her back was turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie felt a slender finger trace along her spine and wantonly grabbing her butt and pulling her a little closer. She gasped in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, your right. And that body is pretty amazing.\" Chie said, coming in on her left and feeling along her stomach and breasts. \"Do you work out, Marie-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't forget she can use magic even in our world. She's incredible and beautiful!\" Yukiko added, taking up a position on Marie's right and stroking her body much as Chie was on her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-! I-! Wait, stupid! I'm....w-wait! That's! Nooo, d-don't pinch!\" Marie wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her hair is also rather lovely, even when it is wet.\" Naoto said, running a hand over her forehead and down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...what do you think you...\" Marie muttered in embarrassment and glared at Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When in Rome.\" Naoto replied with a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie's embarrassment was rising by the minute. Four pairs of mischievous hands feeling up her body was a new and decidely strange (though not entirely unpleasant!) experience that made Marie feel rather foolish as the center of so much attention. She suddenly froze in horror thinking about whether any of the girls might try to touch between her legs. And that thought naturely led to her body's total betrayal, as she felt herself getting excited by the notion. She could feel her nipples getting harder as they were played with, and she was certain a certain little bit of herself was starting to stick out from her inner folds as her excitement and terror mounted. Oh no. Please don't touch down there! Even if none of the girls would normally be THAT frisky, if any of them noticed how excited she was getting...no, surely they wouldn't...but what if they did? As all four girls moved in closer and the groping became more enthusiastic, all Marie could do was pray that the situation did not get any more humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation is about to get even more humiliating. What happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feeling nervous, she began to plead with her body. Please,please,please don't be sticking out! Slowly, she turned her eyes downwards until they met her crotch.

First, she would need something to distract the other girls. Fortunately, she had learned quite recently what could keep them preoccupied. And turnabout was fair play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Wow.\" Marie said with her best dramatic flare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Marie? Feeling a little hot and bothered?\" Rise cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? No! I was just thinking. Yu was totally right. It really is amazing how good Naoto-chan is at hiding those enormous things under her clothes. I was just wondering how she manages it.\" Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto immediately gave a small gasp of surprise and sunk lower in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie-san, please!\" the detective prince said, turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Isn't it a legitimate question? And another thing, what's with the nipples standing out like that?

As excited as she was it would only take a few moments of caressing and playing to achieve her release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Marie!\" Rise whispered in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Marie said, jumping a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whacha doin?\" Rise said, smiling brightly at the blue haired goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Nothing, stupid! Don't sneak up on me like that!\" Marie snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? It looked like you were being a very bad girl doing a very naughty thing even after you were told not to.\" Rise said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't be stupid....stupid! I'm just trying to enjoy the bath! Stop pestering me with idiotic question, jerkfacedstrippergirl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's smile fell for a moment and she glared, then returned to smiling in a more sinister manner. \"Its not fair, is it, Marie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what are you talking about? And why are you smiling like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you being you. From what Yu said, your trapped all alone in some kind of weird blue car dimension with not one but two people constantly hovering around you. No room of your own. No power or TV. And definitely no privacy to 'take care of business'.\" Rise mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...business?\" Marie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think you know....\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Marie could protest, she found Rise's hands once again squeezing her body. But now the touch was far more deliberate and erotic. Her breasts were foddled, her butt was squeezed. Marie gasped when Rise's fingers actually strayed into her inner folds! She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh. Don't want the others to hear you like this, do you?\" Rise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what are you doing, stupid!\" Marie whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor, poor Marie. All year long...no relief...and all those visit from our resident senpai, too! I picture that little smirk and those flashy confident eyes....whew! I don't think I could go a day without a little stress relief when I'm around Yu-san. Going a whole year? And here we are, ganging up on you and getting you all worked up. Its really not fair, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise emphasized her point with a few teasing strokes of Marie's nether regions. With a blush of shame and lust, Marie shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be a shame of the others found out you broke the rules, wouldn't it?\" Rise whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you never said I couldn't play with myself! You just said I couldn't cum! I didn't break the rules at all!\" Marie whispered desperately, silently adding a 'yet' to the end of her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooh. Aren't we clever?\" Rise said. \"Well, clever girl, you know what else isn't breaking the rules? We only forbid you from making yourself cum. We never said that the rest of us aren't allowed to do it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie turned a bright red. \"You'd do that??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd think about it, especially if you were nice to me. Is there anything nice you'd be willing to do for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you being so....creepily nice all of a sudden?\" Marie asked, only to go weak kneed as Rise teasing her with greater gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. So suspicious. Come on, we're all about friendship and acceptance here, aren't we?\" Rise asked, giggling as Marie gave her a suspicious look. \"Okay, okay. The truth is...I like you this way. Your way too good at getting me flustered and embarrassed around senpai. Seeing you like this- naked, ashamed, docile...and sooooo desperate for what I can give you? Its a nice change of pace, you know? So what do you say? Want to convince me to help you out, Marie-chan? I know you can do it! And I promise I'll make it worth your efforts....once I get bored with teasing and tormenting you, of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Of course.\" Marie deadpanned. \"Well...err...maybe I could....\"</span></div></div>",

What do you guys think?\" Rise said merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I wasn't...\" Marie started to protest, but thought better of it when Rise gave her a wink. The idol could just reveal her earlier masturbation session, and she doubted her apparent \"loophole\" would pass muster with the rest of the 'court'. Instead, she sat silently covering herself as the foursome whispered and debated, wondering how things had come to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Rise said. \"We accept your offer as a suitable bribe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...Okay. So I guess....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On two conditions! First, if we taste it and find it lacking, we get to punish you as if you did cum on your own!\" Rise said, with Chie and Yukiko nodding enthusiastically while Naoto rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Fine. What the other condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to bake it naked.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WHAT?\" Marie said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay. The cooking staff is gone for the night. The kitchen should be free. There are good odds no one will see you and throw you out as a pervert!\" Yukiko said, apparently trying to be reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is crazy! Why should I even agree to something so outrageous? In fact, why do I have to listen to you idiots at all? Its not like we're in the TV world where you have your personas!\" Marie snapped, allowing a few sparks of electricity to form around her to remind the girls she was not so limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie-chan!\" Naoto said in alarm, both from the danger a lightning strike could cause and the attention it might draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO! Don't you try to wriggle your way out of this. That promise I made earlier didn't include this crap! This is way more...meaner!...than those peeping on us, and nobody objected to it then! Plenty of gods have smited mortals for doing things way less embarrassing and...and EVIL to them than you four are doing to me! So get ready to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pity.\" Rise said, smiling and giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....What?\" Marie said, her lightning rippling all around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was just thinking that I was going to tell Yu the next time he asks how we're getting along with Marie-chan that she was a good sport and put up with all our teasing like a champ. And now instead I have to tell him she's a huge bully who throws around lightning bolts at defenseless pure hearted girls who want to be her friends.\" Rise said, adding a note of deep regret and resignation to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......\" Marie ground her teeth, the lightning dying. \"That's just cheating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Rise said, sticking her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! I'll....bake it without any clothes on. Stupidassfacedfingergirl.\" Marie muttered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....what did she just-\" Chie began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANYWAY!\" Rise interrrupted. \"I think one of us should help you. We need to make sure you don't poison us or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to make a cake! I have all the ingredients in my bag.\" Marie said as the strode out of the hot spring and grabbed one of the larger towels to wrap around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also need someone to make sure you don't cheat and masturbate while none of us are watching!\" Rise stated happily. \"Besides, you aren't used to making human food. Someone needs to give you pointers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...that sounds like a terrible plan.\" Naoto said. \"I've heard the horror stories of summer camp and the omelette. I don't want to consider what will happen if we combine 'Mystery Food X' with the paranormal. It wasn't so long ago that we saved the world from Adachi-san and the Sagiri. I have no desire to see it consumed by some Lovecraftian dessert. Marie is better off on her own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise, Chie, and Yukiko glared daggers at the detective for a long moment. Finally, Rise spoke up. \"Hey guys, did you hear that. I think Naoto just volunteered to keep an eye on Marie for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty brave of her.\" Chie said darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially also going out there naked.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? Absolutely not! You can't force me and I clearly haven't performed any deviant actions the way she has to warrant any such punishment. Noting that you three are cooking failures is merely stating the truth. I would think we could all face such a thing by now.\" Naoto said, putting on one of her 'superior intellect' tones as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Your absolutely right, Naoto-kun. We won't make you do something like that against your will. By the way...have I mentioned how gorgeous your body looks today? Have you lost weight? How do your breasts stay so big when your so thin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie rolled her eyes as the sounds of cooing, splashing and a series of protests and shrieks from Naoto filled the air. A moment later a naked, wet Naoto came fleeing from the bath and joined Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have told you, Karma is a bitch. And she cheats at cards.\" Marie said as Naoto gathered up a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, fine! I apologize for earlier!\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, ladies, what's with the towels?\" Rise demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way I'm walking around butt naked!\" Marie declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ordeal will be embarrassing enough this way! Surely a single shred of clothing won't matter to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm....guess you have a point there....\" Rise said after a moment of consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. We will-\" Naoto began when suddenly she found herself blinded by a shade of blue as her small towel was ripped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHATTHEHELLYOUSTUPIDIDIOTICAN'TSEE!\" Marie screamed as she too was stripped and blinded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to see, the pair found themselves tossed out of the bath in a heap, their trademark blue hats retrieved from the clothing wrack and pulled low over their line of sight by the devious girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never said you got to choose which piece of clothing you got to wear! Have fun in the kitchen ladies! Love the hats, by the way!\" Rise chimed in before slamming the door shut, leaving the two behatted and otherwise naked girls to shiver and cover themselves as best they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on....one little lightning bolt. Freak accidents happen. You could vouch for me. No one else would ever have to know.\" Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps...no. No! We'll solve this problem as best we can....you do know how to make a cake, right?\" Naoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Use all natural ingredients! Barely any unforeseen side effects. Anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair made their way down the hall, their hands vainly trying to shield their ample breasts and lovely sex from view.</span></div></div>",

She gasped as she saw a multi-layered chocolate cake complete with miniature chocolate creatures reminiscient of various shadows populating the top layer (each inexplicably vibrating with localized intensity). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the heck did you...\" She began in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never said I couldn't use magic.\" Marie said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was amazing. And terrifying.\" Naoto chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. That completely ruins our fun, you know! You were supposed to be out there for hours, every second tense as your chances of being caught increased! Way to spoil everything!\" Rise whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanted a cake, I made a cake. Let us in, loserbikini!\" Marie snapped as she barged past Rise, hauling the cake behind her and giving the girls an unobstructed view of her body in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto peevishly followed, more carefully covering herself. The other girls giggled and waved to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it, right?\" Marie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost!\" Rise said, sliding a handcuff over her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! STUPIDHUNGRYMORONS! What the hell!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those mi-hey!\" Naoto exclaimed as the other cuff was locked forced over a wooden beam and locked on her wrist. A second pair of handcuffs was applied to their other wrist in a similar manner. Before either could react they found themselves helpless and on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to judge first. If we don't like it, we punish you both!\" Rise said with a smile. \"And yes, Naoto, thanks for the handcuffs and being such a great unwilling volunteer for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto protested and Marie screamed a litany of fast paced insults and curses, but neither could dislodge themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. All right judges! Let's have a taste!\" Rise proclaimed as all three girls claimed a fork from the dinner try and immediately scooped up some errant chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is actually really good!\" Yukiko exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm gonna get some more!\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Marie! You really came through!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! So get us out of...what...what are you...\" Marie trailed off as Rise gave her a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. We had a deal. But first, I think the chef should sample her work!\" Rise said, scooping up more cake on the fork and flicking it in Marie's general direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Marie and Naoto screamed as the girls alternated between enjoying the dessert as food and projectiles. Soon both girls were covered in dark splotches of cake smeared over their nude body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you....\" Marie declared as Rise approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" She smiled. \"But I'll make it worth your while. By the way...what the hell is this? And why does it vibrate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Marie regarded the white chocolate figure of Alice. \"I had leftover chocolate so I made some figures. Cute, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute! But...the vibrating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno! It happens when I cook! At least mine actually tastes good, unlike some people I could-HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a look of annoyance and wicked delight Rise pushed Marie's legs apart and INSERTED the chocolate figure inside her! Almost immediately Marie began to react, unable to hide the humiliating dance of thrusts and shudders her legs and hips were making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stop! Get it out! Its going to melt! If it melts it'll run away and hide!\" Marie squeeked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was a bad cook now? Don't worry, there's more where that came from!\" Rise said with excitement as she ate a handful of cake before retrieving more chocolate figures. Marie and Naoto soon found themselves accomodating dozens of candied invaders, each alone enough and in conjunction driving them mad with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh god! This is bad!!!\" Marie wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Worse than OH! you know! Look at them!\" Naoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls had begun to eat more and more voraciously of the cake. The effects of Marie's chocolate were taking hold. Soon the three naked girls had devoured the entire concoction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think I could eat so much!\" Rise said, stunned. \"Marie if I get fat from this...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't. Its magic, stupid. That chocolate is made of dream stuff and emotion. Its not physical...exactly. It'll dissolve on its own in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Good.\" Rise said in satisfaction when suddenly her stomach growled. \"Ugh! Nooo! Still...really hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, tough! You ate every....thing.\" Marie trailed off as she looked down at her chocolate laced form. \"....No. Don't you even think....Get away!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls ignored her pleas as, their eyes glassy and hungry.</span></div></div>",

Her clothing was an eclectic mix of fashions, mixed in with the Yasogami High uniform. Her shirt, a couple of sizes too small, accentuated the curves of her ample chest. A blue beret lay on the grass beside her. \"Boooring!\" she exclaimed, inflating her gum into a bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of male students from another school wandered over. \"What do you have there?\" One of them snatched her notebook from her. \"What's this, song lyrics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yuu arrived at Yasogami High's entrance, the scene was complete carnage.

It was a tight spot, but Marie was all out of options.  Carefully, she climbed up onto the counter, almost slipping on the narrow space with her feet, and propped herself up there grasping the awning flaps in front of her for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her new position, leaning out over the counter space, Marie's head and torso were protected from the rain, at least.  But as for everything else... Her stockings were torn off and no doubt blown away into oblivion by now, her boots were drowning in the torrent beneath her, her gloves were drenched and freezing her hands, her entire butt just got soaked, she was cold and shivering and starting to get hungry, and lastly, in her current position, there was no way to stop the wind from picking up her skirt and showing off her panties completely to any, thankfully nonexistent, bystanders.  And to add insult to injury, she couldn't even write down the perfect poetry phrase that just popped into her head due to this situation, without ruining her notebook and everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr...

After all, how would going inside help at this point?  She'd still be just as soaked, and there would be people inside, all too willing to stare at the bare-legged girl with the funny clothes and the short skirt.  In that case, she'd rather just wait right there and get a front row seat to the rain crashing down, and get someplace warm once the storm died down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Marie probably should have swallowed her pride and ran towards Junes, because the wind decided to pick up even further.

Even though the table was solid above her, the wind had angled the rain so much that the table was no longer effective.  Raindrops were coming in fast and hard, soaking the last few dry parts of her body.  Was nowhere safe out here!?  Marie shook the water from her face and tried again to reach for her torn blouse, but the wind blew it away just inches from her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Come on!\" Marie yelled, scrambling, half crawling, half running, from her hiding place to chase the flying fabric, but came up short as she reached the roof's edge, her blouse whisked away for good into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie just stood there in shock, barely feeling the rain as it soaked through what was left of her attire, chilling her body to its core.  Tilting her head back, she let out a great, ferocious yell, channeling all her rage and frustration into that single shout.  That shout was soon swallowed by the storm, leaving only the sounds of pattering rain and rumbling thunder in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie had to face facts: the weather wasn't letting up at all.  If she continued to wait it out up here she would freeze to death and then be found like this, wearing nothing but soaked-through underwear, a couple of useless sleeve gloves, her bag, her belt, and her hat-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FWIP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, just the useless bag, belt, gloves, and underwear, she noted, as her hat sailed off to join her blouse.  How had her hat stayed on until now in this storm?  Anyways, that wasn't important now.  What mattered was that she was as good as naked already and if she continued to sit there and hide, she would soon be adding numb, chilled, diseased, and dead to the list.  She needed to get to actual shelter and warmth, now!  Readying herself, she pushed through the wind to the Junes entrance, reached for the door handle, looked down, and saw her breasts, their curves and nipples clearly outlined and visible through the soaked material of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie immediately turned away from the door, and planted herself along the adjoining wall.  \"Why did I have to wear white today!?  STUPID STUPID ARGH!\" she shouted.  She assumed that her panties, being the same color and material as her bra, were likely in a similar state as well.  And with all those people inside taking shelter... Was her only choice one between physical death and social death?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marie shivered and struggled to make up her mind, her gaze fell on the corner of the rooftop, specifically a metal gate and ladder.  It looked like... it was!  An emergency exit!  It would be risky and would involve braving the storm some more, but she may be able to find another place to take shelter, find some warmth, and, if it still came down to the worst case scenario, at least expose herself to less people.  But was it worth the risk?</span></div></div>",

She even had some insulation from the weather thanks to the nearby wall. She felt her confidence building as she got closer to the roof. Maybe she could get into an abandoned part of the store and find a change of clothes, far from prying eyes. That was a lovely thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, first she'd have to get into the exit without further incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither was likely, since as it happened...</span></div></div>",

However, the constancy of the sensation served to clue Marie in to a frightening change of circumstances. Rather than cold rain drops splashing against her cotton-encased rear end, she felt the cold water hitting her bare skin. Paired with a growing difficulty in lifting her legs to climb, Marie looked down and gasped in shock and dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie's soaked panties had managed to slide halfway down her hips, bearing her backside and her treasure to the open air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH! No, stupid stupid panties!\" Marie cursed, pulling one hand off the ladder to hastily pull her slipping garment back up. \"Bad enough you're soaked and see-through! I don't need you falling off and- whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, only using one hand to hold herself onto a wet metal ladder wasn't safe. Marie realized this danger as her hand slipped, forcing her to hastily claw at the ladder with both hand and, thankfully, save herself from a nasty fall. Clinging to the ladder for dear life, Marie looked down at her exposed pelvis once more, letting out a dejected sigh as she saw her fallen panties, now down to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing wants to go right for me today, does it?\" Marie asked herself. Here she was, facing another nasty dilemma. She needed to keep climbing the ladder, but doing so would mean losing her panties. Unfortunately, there was nowhere else for Marie to go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting her teeth, Marie took a deep breath and began to climb the ladder once more, trying to ignore the sensation of her soaked panties slipping further and further down her legs before finally passing her ankles and falling off completely. The only \"real\" clothing Marie had left now was her transparent bra, and that fact set the poor poet's heart racing. She could only hope and pray that she'd find something to wear, or at the very least privacy, at the end of this climb...</span></div></div>",

TO HELL WITH IT!\" In a temperamental, childish, and somewhat unwise course of action, the infuriated brunette grabbed at the wet fabric and tore at it. The soaked material tore with ease, and Marie was still huffing in exertion moments after having torn it asunder and tossed the remaining cotton fragments off of the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'm done caring!

Gritting her teeth, Marie continued forward toward the emergency door; there was nothing left to lose after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there was.  Marie felt a sudden jolt yank her off to the side.  The wind was pulling at her bag!  \"Oh no you don't!\" Marie shouted, reaching towards her poetry-filled parcel.  \"You may have taken everything from me, but you're NOT getting this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind was proving stronger though, levitating the bag higher, threatening to tear it away.  Desperately, Marie jumped into the air, and luckily, she succeeded in retrieving it, clutching her bag to her bosom on the way down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot-so-luckily, her landing wasn't nearly as smooth.  Her soaked, numbed feet slipped on the rain-slick surface, sending her tumbling forward in a roll towards an carelessly left open skylight panel.  \"OW!  No, no no no no!\" she screamed, trying to stop herself during the worst slip n' slide ride of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, both the roof and her body were essentially frictionless, layered in water as they were.  And in no time at all, Marie was sent careening through the opening down into Junes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHH! OOF!\" she screamed, having curled up into a ball around her bag during her drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome luck was still on her side, as she had fortunately landed on her back and not her head.  Marie felt the sensation of damp cloth around her, opened her eyes, and saw that she landed on a covered mattress.  Turning upwards, she saw the open skylight above her; feeling only a fraction of the deluge from before.  \"Ugh,\" she groaned, stretching out and sitting up.  \"What kind of idiot leaves a skylight open during a storm like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile appreciating the good luck she was having in that she at least was still alive, she wondered if that luck was holding as she belatedly realized just where she had landed.

The storm must have gotten worse and caused a power outage, Marie realized, partly because she was still sitting under an open skylight and still getting rained on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick turn, she swiveled over the side of the bed and crouched behind it, peering over to the main area of the store.  She could hear the voices of the frustrated customers, disgruntled at this sudden shutdown, and could barely make out the silhouettes shifting along  the nearby  aisle.  Instinctively, she reached for her bag... And pulled her hand away just in time.  Now wasn't the time for poetry!  She's just have to hope the inspiration remained once she got out of this safe and sound!  First she needed to get dressed, and to do that, she needed some clothes, and the clothes were... where, exactly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't as though she had no idea where the clothing department was from here.  But Marie wasn't familiar with the bedding area of Junes  and its relative position to the rest of the store, and she hadn't had much of a chance to get her bearings before the power outage.  She'd be going in blind, and while the darkness would help keep her hidden, if she ran into anyone accidentally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down over herself.  Yep,  she was still naked, and her eyes were starting to adjust to the darkness already.  That would mean the customers could see too, and- she shook her head.  That line of thinking was not going to help her one bit!  But still, Argh!  How could things have turned out like this!? She thought, gripping her cover in frustration.  Which, coincidentally, gave her another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second... she thought, giving the sheet a tug.  It moved free.  \"I could use this!\" She couldn't help but mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to cross the store, her solution was right here!  But she soon began to have second thoughts as the sheet was very big; the bed was a king-size after all.  The sheet would cover her no problem, but it could be hard to manage, especially in the wind and rain.  And because of its size, if she tried to wear that through the store, she'd be spotted in a heartbeat! The billowing mass and bright color would give away her position, even if she hid among the products.   She'd be exposed as a thief, and then they'd take it away and-NO!  She couldn't let that happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's thought, Marie gathered up her courage and-</span></div></div>",

So she quickly went around the sides of the counter, looking for the least exposed area where she could at least plan her next move.

Marie wanted to clear it in one shot, but also wanted to stay low, so she ended up catching her foot on the edge, falling square onto the glass countertop with a loud splat!

Quickly crawling the rest of the way, Marie was safely over the edge and tucking herself into a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouched on the ground, rubbing her breasts which were a little sore from being dragged along the countertop, and holding her bag held in front of her as her only method of protection, Marie looked around.

Regular old customers  couldn't be inside here, and there was even a waist-high door on the side to prevent entry.  The bad news was that once the salesperson came back to this area, she was screwed!  But she couldn't cross between departments as she was with the store all lit up like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puzzled and fumed over this for a good few minutes, as well as putting in some time to lament her situation, but then she realized something.
