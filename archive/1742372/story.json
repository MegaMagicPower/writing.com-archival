Shawn replied back \" well I never thought I would see one of your kind, well its nice to meet ya, tell you what ill drop these papers off in my lab, and then ill take you were you need to go\" Catherine looked at Shawn and replid back \" Well thank you , Mr??\"  Shawn replied\" You can call me Shawn by the way\"  Catherine nods while she and Shawn headed down the hallway towards his lab...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine looking at those papers and asked\" Shawn, I dont want to sound nosey but what are those papers for?\"  Shanw looked at the papers than replied\" They are the latest test results from a research project im running, im trying to find a cure to a disease that i currently have in hopes no one would have to go through what I am\"  Catherine looked at him and smiled then said \"And you hope maybe you would be able to cure yourself\"  Shawn looked at Catherine then said\"  I have accepted the fact that my research wont cure me when the disease is at the stage it is now, my hope is to discover a cure that can cure it in its early stages, if anything this would be my parting gift to the world, but I seem to be at a standstill as i am not making that much progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn now opening the door to his lab, then proceeds to put the papers on his desk with Catherine waiting at the doorway, Shwn then headed back out to take Catherine to one of the elevators,  Shawn then asked\" I take it your here to make the offer to one of the patients of this hospital?\"  Catherine then looked at Shawn and replied\" Yes\"  Shawn then said \" well here we are, what you need to do is take the elevator to level 3 where our terminal patients are, a nurse will guide you to the person you are seeking.\"   Catherine replied\" Well thank you again, it was nice meeting you\"  Shawn replied back \" Same here, maybe sometime we can grab a coffee there are somethings id like to know about your kind.\"  Catherine replied as the doors are about to close \"I'd like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that shawn gave a little smile then headed back towards his lab...  Catherine now in the elevator now thinking about Shawn, was actually blushing from the experience. its not unheard of to have a werewolf being in a relationship with a human, and it kinda got Catherine a little excited of that prospect with Shawn, She then looked at her notepad and wrote down a reminder to see shawn later for that coffee..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n12:00pm<br>\r\nShawns Lab<br>\r\n\tShawn was sitting at his desk still going through the test results to try to figure what went wrong with his last test..  Shawn then speaking into a voice recorder said\"  Tests run last night still is inconclusive to the success of the drug...  It....\"  Shawn dropped the recorder to the ground when all of a sudden a pain in his chest started.  With the remaining strength he had he pressed the alert button which he was forced to carry with him due to his condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12:30pm<br>\r\n patient room 305, level 3<br>\r\n\tCatherine now finsihing up as she performed her task on turning a human into a werewolf stood up and told the nurse  \"Someone will be coming to pick him up and take him to a facility where the transformation can happen safely, but until then just make sure he drinks enough fluids ok\"  a nurse noded yes.. Catherine now headed back to the elevator to see Shawn before she leaves.  Catherine then enters a elevator then presses the button to go to Level 7 where the research division is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12:45pm<br>\r\nResearch Division<br>\r\n \tAs Catherine was about to exit the elevator two nurses with a stretcher and some medical equipment rushed past her, Realizing they were going in the direction of Shawn's lab she decided to follow...  hoping that it is someone else that they were going to, however as she turned the corner she noticed that it was Shawn laying on the ground, with what seems to be a remote device right next to him...  The nurses then carfully lifted him onto the stretcher than hooked him up to some divices.. Catherine then yelled out \" Shawn!\" as she rushed to be at his side..  Shawn looked up at Catherine and said softly \"Catherine, im sorry we wont be able to go have that  coffee\" Shawn paused while he had to cough then continued \" i would of loved to learn more about your kind\"   Catherine said\" and you still can... All you need to do is agree to be turned\"  Shawn then looked back at her, and replied\"  I accept your offer....\"  With that Catherine requested the nurses leave Shawn with her while she performs the task.. </span></div></div>",

Shawn left the lab leaving Catherine to finsih up with the paperwork..  Shawn also needed to do this because what Catherine had to give up to be with him as it is not permitted for council members to have romantic feelings towards those they turn...  the only way around it is to no longer be a council member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs he went down the hallway someone wearing a fedex uniform walked past Shawn, Shawn noticed the person smelled like human, which sorta worried him, as no humans are allowed in the werewolf branch of the building at least not without a escort.. however some exeptions can be made depending on the importance..  fedex usually sends a werewolf to do a delivery to the werewolf division however due to lack of staff at the time they may of had  no choice to send a human..  Normally shawn would of at least asked to see a paper giving him permission to be in this section, however he decided to let it go today...  Shawn then stopped at a nearby Tim Hortons kiosk to purchase 2 large  iced capp mocha supremes and 2 ham and swiss sandwiches on whole wheat bread with extra meat, then headed back towards the lab.  Just as Shawn turned around the corner  with the door to his lab in view all of a sudden he heard a loud gun shot that came from his labratory,  As he dropped the iced caps on the floor along with the sandwiches he started running towards his lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen he entered his lab he saw the Fed ex employee holding a gun towards the wall, on where he noticed Catherine laying on the ground with a bullet wound near her heart..  Shawn then turned to the fedex employee and demanded \"what did you do?\" The fedex employee turned at him and said\"  I killed her, just like i will kill you as i believe there is no place for werewolves in this society\"  with that the killer now pointing the gun at shawn then pulled the trigger...  *Click*  The killer then looking at his gun realizing the gun just jammed yelled out \" Oh Shit\" not realizing Shawn now transformed to his other form was about to attack..  Within seconds the killer was ripped to pieces by Shawn leaving only the fedex cap surviving the attack... <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tShawn now back in his human form went towards Catherine, noticing her wound was laced with silver filings knowing full well there was no saving her... she was still breathing however how long no one knows... all they know is that this method of killing a werewolf is very agonizing to the victim and to anyone close to him or her knowing full well nothing can be done about it other than console the victim to the end... he cursed the killer for this...  the least he could of done was do it humanly by cutting off the head, at least that way Catherines death would of been quick and painless..  Catherine looking up at shawn and said softly\" Don't be sorry for me, at least i was able to help you make that important discovery,\" Catherine paused while she started to cough up some blood and continued \"  Don't give up,\"  Catherine then coughed a little more blood then continued \" I will always love .......\"  With that Catherine drew her last breath and became motionless...   Shawn now bursting into tears yelled\" Don't die on me, not yet...\" but it was all in vain, Shawn now looking at her eyes and then manually closed her eye lids so it looks like she is just sleeping..  then softly laid her head on the floor while he put some distance between her and him while he waits for authorities to come to handle the situation...  and also realizing the guilt he has in killing the killer... even though he was in every right to do so according to the law, he made himself an oath when he became a werewolf that he would never harm any human no matter what,, an oath he has surly forgotten about in the heat of his rage towards the killer..  </span></div></div>",

He hated being here,, everything here reminded him of Catherine... however one last duty he needed to do.. which was finishing up on a secondary project he and Catherine has worked on 2 weeks prior to her death...  a serum that can be applied to a human who has been turned accidently by another werewolf, which would stop the transformation if applied early enough..  they figured there was a 2 week window before the changes would be irreversable..  provided the human was strong enough to begin with , its shorter for those who are about to die for other reasons.. as the serum depends on the humans ability to fight the infection .   After he handed in his research to the council he swore to dissappear, litterally turn his back against everything he is...  go into a self imposed exile so to speak.  Shawn knew of some places where he can go to help forget who he was and what he has become...  but even now there is still one task left to do.,.. he needed to hand over his keys to the new tennant of his labratory unfortunaty due to lack of space in other facilities we were lending lab space to other research projects that was going on around the city..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n 12:00pm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSt. Matthew's Hospital<br>\r\nResearch Division Werewolf Branch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs Shawn entered the lab for the last time which was actually the first time since the incident he already noticed another researcher sitting at the desk that used to be catherines..  On the desk seemed to be an old book covered in unknown letters...  <br>\r\n Shawn looking at the person said \" So you are the new tennant of this lab\"  The person looked up and replied \"Yep I sure am, my name is Chris by the way\"  Admittly the books did peek shawns interest and asked\" So is this what your researching?\"  Chris looked at the book then replied\" Yep, some humans found this buried in a ancient tomb and asked me to do some research into it, i cant seem to identify the writting on it it is of no known script ive seen in my studies not even when i was human\"  Chris then looking at his watch then realized he needed to go pick up something from the ground floor, then said \" oh crap, i need to go get something, I know its your last day here but can you please stay here keep a eye on this while I go pick it up?\" Shawn looked around and replied \" Sure why not...\" Shawn then sat down on the chair while Chris left the room...  Shawn being bored then started to look at the book which now seemed to give a slight glow while outside a unusual storm seems to be brewing in the area above the hospital...  as Shawn was reaching for the book   thunder could be heard from outside...   Then on the cover of the book the words started to glow .  Shawn growing even more curious about the book then touched the words...  and at the moment of him touching the books cover a lightning bolt went right into the room causing an explosion.  When Chris returned to the lab, he dropped the parcel, looking at what now seems to be a destroyed labratory, with no trace of Shawn or even the book , there was even no trace of any storm that was in the area...  </span></div></div>",

It alwys started out with Tammy standing in an open field, all prepared to go find a human which she could have as a pet...  and while she looked towards the forest she notices a human naked female at the edge of the forest looking right at her motioning for her to come closer. As Tammy came closer  occasionally a lightning bolt were to hit the ground close by and every time it did the image of the human was replaced by a wolf for only a second or 2, and when she came close enough the female started walking further into the forest motioning Tammy to follow her in. As Tammy kept following the female deeper into the forest she came across a small opening with a tree stump in the centre, with the female now standing right beside it...  the female then motions her to look up...  which Tammy does and sees a storm brweing right on top of her.. and then when she looks back down the tree stump now looks like it was struck by lighnting with what seems to be a human curled up in the middle of it...  then before Tammy wakes up she hears a female voice whisper into Tammy's ears \"prepare yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Tammy, wake up its time for breakfast!\"  Jake yelled.. Tammy replied while yawning at the same time\" Coming father\"  When Tammy joined the rest of her family downstairs in the dining room Jake asked\" So Tammy are you ready to go hunt for your first pet today?\" Tammy replied back\" Yep, I can't wait\"  Fred who was Tammys younger brother said\" I dont see why we just cant buy one from a pet shop rather than hunt for one\" Jake replied back\" Now son it has always been family tradition to go hunt for a wild human for a pet rather than buy one at a store, as we believe the more interesting pets to have come from the wild.. not to mention its cheaper because buying a pet can be expensive.\"  They then continued to eat their meal after which they all headed out to go to their favourite field to find humans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen they arrived at the field as Samantha and Fred set up the picnic area, Jake and Tammy headed off to start their search for a pet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With that they started to head down to the path that leads into that section of the forest...   <br>\r\n\tMeanwhile at the picnic site, Fred was practicing his karate. in the open field while samantha was laying down reading one of her favorite books...  Fred looked up and noticing some storm clouds forming in the direction that he saw Tammy and Jake went.. \"hey, mom it looks like a storm is brewing in that direction\"  Samantha looked up and replied \" oh dear, i hope they would be alright...\"  Storms were not as common in the area but when it does happen it can be very bad...  But, this storm was odd... it doesnt seem like any ordinary storm... most storms that do happen the clouds tend to cover a bigger area pretty fast, but this one seemed too centralized on one area.<br>\r\n\tBack in the forest, Jake was looking up at the cloud above him, then looked at tammy and said \"Look maybe we should head back, if it starts to rain it would make it hard to find a human as most would seek shelter in a rainstorm\" Tammy looked back and said\" Im not going back till i find a human, i waited so long to get one, and im not leaving without one.\" Jake smiled remembering Tammy is known for being stubborn at times... then resumed following tammy deeper into the forest...  After 5 more minutes of walking down a path, there was a sudden loud noise like one would expect from thunder, origionating from the east of their current location, further follwed by a scream.  Tammy turned around looking in the same direction the noise came from and then decided to go in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAt the  burnt tree stump, Shawn opened his eyes, Shawn then looked around his surroundings noticing that he was on what seems to be a huge tree stump...  hell he thinks it could be the size of a living room floor.. He also noticed that he was completly naked., He then noticed some voices coming from the distance and seemed to be headed his way. Shawn then noticed a area near the base of the stump of which he can hide...   and then climbed down and hid there, but he was still able to see who was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs shawn looked on he noticed 2 creatures emerge from the forest line...  well to his surprise these creatures were standing and walking like humans but they look like a wolf... in appearance.. not only that they were giant...  As tammy approached the stump she recognized the stump from her dreams... she thought to herself that this cant be a coincidence that she is seeing things she saw in a dream...  Tammy then looked around the stump incase a human decided to hide from the coming storm here...   as she looked around the stump, Shawn was looking up at her..  Somehow shawn felt that he shouldnt be afraid of her and then decides to make his presence known.. He started to climb back up the stump for which he can be noticed better</span></div></div>",

Tammy then smiled and said\"I think you would definatly make a good pet.\"  Shawn thought to himself as she said that \"A pet?\"  Shawn then decided to speak but before he could Tammy moved him to one of the pockets on her shirt and dropped him in.
