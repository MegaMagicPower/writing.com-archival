As strange as it may seems i have to ask what exactly are you, and give you the lastest tips that may help in your adventure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman Behavior: Individualistic, collaborate when necessary, personality variable depending on personal and environmental factors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Behavior: In you adventure you will probably encounter some of this mighty, mostly apathetic versus human, beast. Depending on circumstances their personality may vary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Types:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Dragon: The fastest of the three, their magic is based on influencing others living creature, they can limitedly manipulate others perception, protect themselves or other from physical or magical damage, temporary improve specific physical attributes, summon other monster for help them in combat or...other activities, lack in the offensive department.<br>\r\nThey tend to be very social creatures, even with human.<br>\r\nBreath type: Acid/Corrosive based<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Dragon: Red dragon are unique and come only in hermaphrodite form, it's unknown why, they are very territorial and aggressive in normal condition, the exception come during their heat cycle, during such periods they become quite passive and actively seek a partner to mate with, uncaring about gender or species. During the above mentioned period, they usually accept any partner that may satisfy their lust, and tend to become loyal with their partner, especially if the breeding is successful. Red dragon are the strongest of the three, their magic is mostly offensive based, with only a few disabling and protection spells.<br>\r\nBreath type: Fire/Heat based<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue Dragon: They are the physically weakest of the three, but still more agile than red, their magic is quite vast, ranging from protection to disabling, summoning to offensive. Their summoning and offensive spell are limited tough, usually they specialize in illusory or gravity manipulation technique. They are unable to improve their physical attributes, but can limitedly enhance others.<br>\r\nThey tend to be isolationist and ignore both other dragons and humans, the exception being their heat season.<br>\r\nBreath type: Ice/Cold based<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll dragons have the same heat season, with the red having the longer nearly a whole month, while the others 2 weeks. Red go in heat from 1 to 2 times per year, depend on individual factors, Black and Blue only 1. The female cycle become progressively worse as time pass, making them more aggressive towards males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll dragon type are able to shrink, remember the guidelines<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman can successfully interbreed only if certain condition are met, story specific, dragon can interbreed between type freely.</span></div></div>",

I try to remember why my head pond so fiercely, and after a few try, finally the memory resurface from my still half-slumbering brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI passed last night in the Drunker Sailor Inn, drinking like a sponge, damn that mead was good. Ugh! Too good, it's not the first time that i pass my night's there, we black don't mind other creature presence, it make things more entertaining....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes, thankfully while drunk, i had the presence of mind to drop myself in the back of my caves, where the light of the sun can't reach me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to get up, luckily my cave posses a small water stream, fresh and clean, i just have to reach it and....remember that pain dulling spells, not that would be useful, urgh.<br>\r\nMy first try end with my muzzle full of dirt, at least my cave is clean, then at the second try i finally get up, the world is still spinning a little, but i am making progress, i them apply my patented recovery method for situation like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focus my power inside my head, then i cast a refreshing spell on myself, a cold soothing feeling gently flow in my still not fully wakened brain; after a few minutes worth of concentration, i release the full strength of the spell, creating a small gush of air around me. Most of the dulling pain has gone away, and i finally examine my situation, yesterday night, i needed some company, and having no mate i decided to go down the dock area of the nearby city, shrunken down obviously, most human don't care as long as you pay and don't try to eat the other customer. I remember that i was not the only dragon patron that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fell the tingling leave my hind legs, so with some effort i push myself up, getting finally in my normal position. Rejoiced by my last success, i start happily walking towards the near fresh stream, while not big enough to wash myself in, is still deep enough to refresh my face. I submerge my head in the small stream and i let the cold feeling wake up the still slumbering part of my brain. Feeling that my little pick me up succeed, i bring my head back up and take a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes i am finally ready to start the day. As i turn in place,  a small ping of pain let's itself known on my left side, just under my wing. That damn Red, clawed me nearly two weeks ago when i erroneously got too near his territory borders, damn hir, the territory must be marked First, Then you may attack the intruders, not the opposite, bastard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, with the sun hight in the sky, and my belly still empty, i should decide what to do first.</span></div></div>",

Preparing myself i try to remember the fastest route to the nearby lake, it's neutral territory, for both dragons and human, it should be safe, but i still prepare some protection spells, who know what may happen.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to myself, i walk toward the entrance of my cave, enjoying the fresh, humid air of the morning, finally ready i extend my wings and with a strong push i lift myself in the air, aiming for the nearest lake shores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have always liked to fly, hight in the sky, feeling the rush of wind on my wings, the humid clouds brushing my scales, and of course the view, it's beautiful the dawn, the forest under me and the not bad shape of the city in the distance, i rally love this place, plenty of things to do and, usually, good company to share it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt take only a few minutes of flying to reach the lake shores, but my smile quickly become a frown, as i spot that red in the distance, i bet it's the same that slashed me, perhaps i should give hir some payback. Let's see how hir like being attacked without reason....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start a spiral descent always pointing my prey, when a few hundred of meters from dropping on my victim, a gust of wind, bring a sweet, strong scent to my nose, i feel distracted for a moment and interrupt my drop, slowing down my descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red seems to have noticed me, and stop drinking from the clean waters to stare, while i come closer hir body remain still; my reason tell me to stay at distance, but my instinct tell me to get closer, and i quickly decide that my protection spells should be enough if the need arise, so i land nearby, and cautiously walk near hir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell become stronger and i fell my cock distending out of my protective hole, i know what this smell is, hir is..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even the time to finish my thought that shi lift it's heavy red tail, revealing hir aroused and leaking sex to me, i also notice that his own tool is getting out, nearly touching the ground...a smile form on my muzzle, while this is indeed the same red that has slashed me 2 weeks ago, now hir hormonal cycle has shifted and hir body has gone in heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's incredible how they change during their season, the Blue suffer a similar plague, normally isolationist and apathetic, when in heat their female become aggressive and actively try to mate with the first male they find, oh i think that i will enjoy this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get near hir offering sex, while the look of hir male part disturb me, the scent of a needy female in estrus help me put those thoughts aside, beside i will take advantage only of hir female part, perhaps i will even breed it, now thats i an interesting thought, i am sure hir will done the same if the position would have been reversed anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI move my muzzle near hir offered hole, and extending my tongue, i give a taste of my next main course. Hir sex is Hot, drenched in sweet, strong smelly fluids, shi heat must have started just after our little dispute, how ironic that it will be me the one to...extinguish the fire that torment shi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little mental deliberation, i decide to have some fun with hir, so removing my tongue from shi delicious insides, i prepare to cast a summoning spell, Double Image, a nearly Black exclusive spell, we can make a physical copy of ourselves, that while does not have our strength and only a minimal part of our spells, it's still an useful decoy or in this case, an extra cock for shi to suck upon. Oh yes, i will break shi completely....hehehehe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI release part of the energy i have stored in case of trouble, and i use it to shape a copy of myself, having already the energy required, i immediately cast the summoning and a double of me appear before hir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShi seems surprised for a few seconds, then i order my double to mount her muzzle, and the copy do just that, grabbing the Red muzzle, he get over hir neck, and place it on it's extended cock. The red understand, and start to greedily suck my copy, bobbing hir muzzle back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis little arousing act, expose shi even more, and deciding that i have played enough, i mount hir. I place my front claws under hir now distended wing joint, and knowing that my willing soon to be mother is bigger than me, i charge the remaining stored energy to enhance my cock size and length, keeping only the minimal energy needed in case of emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then place my empowered spire at hir ready sex, and push myself in. I hear hir growling approval from under me, shi sex it's glorious, hot, tight and very needy, hir internal walls massage my cock, begging to go deeper, and more than ready to claim this womb, i push myself until i reach my intended destination, her cervix, the already partially open entrance to my new breeding ground. I let shi inside massage my length for a few more seconds before pulling out,  her inside clench trying to uselessly held me in, then when only mi tip remain in, i thrust as hard as i could, hilting inside my bitch, hir wall tremble before clenching down again, trying to extract my essence, soon enough. Shi is growling again, but i want to break her fully, so i order my copy to get more rough with is treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile i enjoy seeing my double abusing that muzzle, i start to rhythmically pound her rump, amusing myself at the look of this powerful creature reduced to a begging slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel that my thrust are rewarded by her inner mouth relenting, slowly opening, and letting my spire i hir womb, where i plan to release my life giving seed to the awaiting eggs, ha i just have found a mate! My thrust double in speed and hir insides a gripping me tighter and tighter after every thrust, not long now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push myself as deep as i could go and i feel that shi is close while her collapsing walls are getting desperate, i am now using my cock to fuck her cervix like a second pussy, keeping my tool always in. At this point i order my double to release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see as my copy hold itself deep as possible before releasing, a loss that it's seed is infertile, we could have exchanged position otherwise, i notice hoe Red is struggling to drink it all, and there, i push my tip to touch her inner walls and join my copy in release. I feel my seed traveling inside my rock hard member and rapidly fill her fertile chamber, drowning hir ripe eggs in my essence, claiming hir next clutch as my own. Shi is orgasming as well, but between me and my copy keeping her still, and my double cock in her throat, her reliving roar is drown by our milky withe gift. Only when i am nearly done i order my double to get out, and after dismounting her muzzle, shi immediately try to roar hir barely understand approval, still impeded by my copy release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt' require nearly a minute before i start to come down from my orgasm, still spurting a small dribble of my essence inside hir, while her walls still try to actively milk me for more. I also notice the withe pool under hir, shi has definitely enjoyed my treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, i could continue our little session, maybe claiming hir other hole as well, or perhaps i could leave shi here, while i go for the now quite delayed hunt, mmhhh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecision, decision.s see how hir like being attacked without reason....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start a spiral descent always pointing my prey, when a few hundred of meters from dropping on my victim, a gust of wind, bring a sweet, strong scent to my nose, i feel distracted for a moment and interrupt my drop, slowing down my descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red seems to have noticed me, and stop drinking from the clean waters to stare, while i come closer hir body remain still; my reason tell me to stay at distance, but my instinct tell me to get closer, and i quickly decide that my protection spells should be enough if the need arise, so i land nearby, and cautiously walk near hir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell become stronger and i fell my cock distending out of my protective hole, i know what this smell is, hir is..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even the time to finish my thought that shi lift it</span></div></div>",

Stepping in to the cool air, i had to squint a little at the morning sun, but the breeze blowing underneath my belly drew against my sheath. It sent shivers down my spine i could just *GRUMBLE* oh right, my stomach. Blasting off into the sky, i dived down to the best spot possible for hunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding right into my hunting stance, i cast a spell on my self just for such an occasion: a concentration spell. Passing through the low bushes and the many batches of trees and such, i stumbled across an abandoned campsite and from the smell of things... trolls. I hate trolls, but if you can get passed the icky, coarse hide, they don't taste that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, i quickly found the track of a pack of wild gazelles, ripe for the hunting and heavy in numbers.

Deciding that landing in the middle of the central square, while allowed, is a little too theatrical, so i instead opt for landing just outside the city limits and walking in from there, maybe i pass through go the market area, who know what i could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile appear on my muzzle as i remember my last purchase, a beautiful wood carved statue representing a powerful magician intent on casting a powerful spell on his defeated enemy...hey i like it! It's extremely well made, and even if the magician is not a dragon, i can appreciate a piece of art when i see one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding just before the main road bridge, i start chanting the necessary words, or maybe i should say tone, of power that will shrink me to a more reasonable mass for a human city and, the effect soon follow the words, reducing my size to what is a human would call a pony, keeping all my feature proportioned and of course the original shape. Changing into an hybrid form is far more difficult and usually not particularly well accepted, it look pretty strange i admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the spell is done, i check my body for imperfection, i know that the spell is safe but i always check anyway. Satisfied with the result i start walking towards the city guarded gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected the guards nods and let me in without a fuss, dragon are allowed to enter most of the city unrestricted, at condition of keeping their magic in check and to maintain a ^compatible size within the various city area^, which means that only some part of Kornos is big enough for a full sized adult dragon so mind your step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking to the busy street i remember what happen to mean/stupid dragon too engrossed in their ^magnificence^ (yeah, sure) to notice the damage they are causing, and kicked out by specifically trained regiment, doest not conveys the idea fully. I chuckle at the memory, poor fool, since that day he is always shrunken with his tail between his legs when he come inside the city....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk towards the market square, when a shrunken black dragon named Irasthuiroe, i just call him Ira or ^the noisy one^, approach me: \"Hey Thire heard the news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a visible annoyed expression: \"It's Thireious for you, and no i have not, i don't lose my time partying in local inn\" I say pointing one clawed finger at him, despite walking on all four, we retain quite the flexibility<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reply moving his paw in a dismissive manner, black dragons, pffffffff: \"Sure Thire, sure\" He lower his paw: \"So did you heard?\" Is he stupid or what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Irafool, i haven't\" I slowly massage my temples with my right paw, using a resigned tone: \"What are the news\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile widen dangerously, to the point of breaking his muzzle: \"Why the tournament, finally the arena rooster has enough volunteers for hosting a full fledged tournament!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight the arena, a place where only willingly gladiators are allowed. No matter if you are a dragon, human or any other sentient species really, as long as you are willing to risk a little, or a lot, you are welcome<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply with a curios tone, i admit that the idea of a tournament does appeal me: \"When?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grin remain: \"Why, now!\" His smile diminish considerably: \"Well not exactly, in a few days but they are still keeping an open rooster so...\" So you want to ask me if i want to participate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply: \"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile vanish: \"Why, the lower ranks are pretty easy and the risk are nearly none, no serious wounds thanks to the restrictive rules and the life ward in place, even if meas not much...ehm...^special finisher^ either\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial finisher eh? Right, in hight level match, if a male defeat a female in combat, or the opposite, he/she may..indulge. I still remember that famous warrior that defeated a dragoness at the peak of her heat convinced to have the match in her favor, only to find herself immobilized on her back and fucked silly by him. Quite the spectacle, especially because she found him afterwards and revealed that she has took a compatibility potion before the match, and as such he has just sired her first clutch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hilarious really, the full compatibility potion wasn't meant to make her compatible with him, but she was so sure of her victory that instead of waiting the match end for making herself compatible with her gryphon contract (a way for commissioning a service in exchange of money/favor), she took the potion right away and thus...<br>\r\nIf i remember correctly the human fainted just outside the changing room while both human and dragon was congratulating them for forming a new couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that they are now both living not far from here, and despite their rough start, are quite the happy family, especially because the potion make sure that the children are always a full breed (Usually take the shape of the mother but traits and skill of the father).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the present i immediately remember my found problem, i need quite the sum for purchasing enough ingredients, and i don't want to abandon my experiment so maybe...</span></div></div>",

I shouldn't ask really, but i am curious by nature so<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cheerful tone: \"Sooo Ira, who's the female?\" He jump a little, but then continue walking like nothing happened: \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy nothing, it's so hard to guess, returning to my normal tone: \"The female that you want to impress, Ira, it's quite obvious really\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continue to walk, ignoring me.

Hoping to attract her attention with fame and glory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answer looking at me straight in the eyes, without hesitation: \"Yes\" Without another word he resume walking towards the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am speechless, Ira in love? With a human no less! Well i admit that stranger thing has happened, but..this i didn't see it coming<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI too resume walking and reaching him: \"Look there is nothing wrong in..\" He interrupt me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! But..\" his tone become sad: \"She will never notice me, too busy with her work, And why don't you guess who is in charge for the most effective dragon-kicker regiment in the city\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell then, Ira, you are fucked: \"So she can kick you sorry ass whenever she want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recover his normal tone: \"Probably, but that's not the point\" No no, i think that that's IS exactly the point<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Impressing her in the arena will gain her affection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answer with an hopeful tone: \"No necessarily, but i have heard that she like the arena, especially the ^finale^ when it happen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplendid, a dragon-kicker and a perv too? Definitely his perfect mate: \"She like to see a female dominated in the arena grounds?

I admit that every time i came to Kornos, i am always on guard for potential threat like slayers or crazed people that believe to become immortal by drinking large quantity of my blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho give them such idiotic idea anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true that dragon blood has some regenerative proprieties and the hight quantity of hormone and a natural chemical stabilizer naturally produced by our body, can strengthen a human or a gryphon body, but the elevated quantity of iron that make our blood blackish can easily provoke a systemic malfunction on various internal organs, such as the hearth or spleen, also the kidneys may stop functioning completely if the this method is abused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless i never had this problem here, nor i have heard of any human who practice such barbarism, but i am diffident by nature so..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIra interrupt my musing: \"How much then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply confused: \"How much for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continue decisive: \"For the ingredients you want to buy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow in the..: \"How do you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's obvious really, i know about your passion for the arena fighting styles and the occasional spellcasting technique, but you agreed too easily and i think that you need the money for something. Knowing you what else that some rare reagents could be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnorting i retort: \"Maybe i want to impress a female, what do you know about my life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continue to walk while he turn his head towards me: \"Not much, but enough\" Then he look towards the entrance of the arena, now quite close: \"There! We can finally start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited are we?: \"Calm Ira, i don't think they will let us take a place in the tournament if we don't prove ourselves first\" Then with a teasing tone: \"Beside knowing you, what else than the basic combat style you practiced, hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snort while i laugh at his indignation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance of the arena is nothing special really, the signs indicate the ^service entrance^  for gladiator and personnel only, just a heavy looking steel double doors, with 2 guardsmen at it's side, and a well-lit large stairway going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we descent i notice that shock pad has been applied to every step, permitting an excellent grip even with a paw larger then mine. The short stairway lead to a crossroads with another guard and the sign Gladiators to the left and personnel to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur path continue with another large empty corridor, the sunlight and the noise of a disputing match accompany the last part of our walk. Finally reaching our destination, a small counter with a well suited human on the other side greet us, a barred window permit me to see the actual match, a dragoness against 8 gryphon, the mixed crowd roaring at every blow. Seems a disadvantage match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficial: \"Greetings, may i assume that your presence here is due..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong female voice come from a closed door to the man back: \"Shut it! Just bring them the form before they collapse from boredom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human clear his throat: \"Ehm, yes, well you just had the rare pleasure of hearing the voice of my lovely wife\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIra being the smartass he is always been: \"A strong voice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe official chuckle: \"Thats not the only strength she has, but forgive my lack of manners. James T. Ruokon, official recruitment master, at your service\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy curiosity is piqued by his introduction, specifically his surname: \"Ruokon? Isn't a dragon family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laugh briefly: \"Why yes, my lovely wife is just that, now do you wish to register as gladiators?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar from the crowd bring my attention the the window, only 4 gryphon are still fighting, and with a combined air-assault, they managed to push the dragoness on her back. Not the time to get up that 1 of them pin her form, threatening her with 3 sharp claw at her neck<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bigger gryphon land near the dragoness hind legs, and as soon as the other two help the pinning gryphon, he start lo lick at the female vent. She try to free herself, unsuccessfully while the licking gryphon cock become visible under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"So here are the rules..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look as the alpha satisfied by the now clearly visible vent, start to mount the female, placing the tip of his quite big cock at her entrance. He look at her muzzle and smirking push down all the way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"....only willing gladiators..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look as her vent eagerly swallow the alpha cock, as he immediately start fucking her without remorse or pity. The others gryphons penis start to expand as well, while the dragoness try to not show the obvious pleasure the male is giving to her unwilling vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"...the match is divided by category, light or lower match are less paid, usually easier, the most strong ward are in place and no heavy wounds or..finals...are allowed. Heavy or higher match are usually more difficult and allow you to participate in various kind of sub-matches, like the one that got your attention, pay quite the sum, all technique but lethal/assassination are allowed, the ward are at lower intensity and permit heavy wounds but still prevent death by all but the most deadly or well aimed attacks and yes finals are allowed. Also you may get a bonus if your match is spectacular enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alpha quicken his thrust while the 3 followers rearrange their stance so that one of the could place his now ready cock at her open mouth, a scratch at her neck remind her of her position, and reluctantly, she start blowing the offending gryphon while he start fucking her muzzle. The alpha cry of passion increase in intensity and finally with a last thrust his knot stretch her vent just enough to enter her lips while he release his golden seed inside her stuffed tunnel. The dragoness scream her displeasure as an unwilling orgasm wash over her form, milking the alpha cock for all he could give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alpha still lightly thrust his still spurting cock, proving his short claim on her. In the meantime the follower in her muzzle scream in pleasure as his seed start to fill the dragoness stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alpha, happy with her vent performance, extract his knotted cock from her clenching tunnel, releasing a small spurt of his seed, then his smirk deepen as he place his tool at her second opening. The dragoness roar her frustration, muffled by the gryphon essence she just reluctantly drank. Rearranging their position, so 1 gryphon grip tightly the dragoness neck with all his four claw, the second follower place his cock at the dragoness muzzle while the just blowed gryphon reach her vent and without hesitation, stuff himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second follower force the dragoness to taste his organ and immediately start his dance. The alpha wait for his 2 follower to start, then he slowly push his knotted cock in her ass, stretching her insides much to her voiced displeasure, and begin to anally fuck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"Are the rules clear?\" I turn towards him, and frankly i haven't listened a word, but i already know the arena rules, being the fan i am, i still not understand the finisher business tough. Spectacle it may be, but quite humiliating for the loser, and not particularly appreciated by hermaphrodite as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply: \"I have, and part of the gold is deducted for the mandatory medical fee, am i correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"Yes, among the few additional taxes because you are not city resident\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, how much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"Not much really, you still get 84.5% of your winning, clean, with no additional future payment required, not like some other region where after your money has been taxed, get taxed again with the pathetic excuse of % owned to the state. Ridiculous really\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at the window, noticing how the alpha male is now fucking the dragoness muzzle, while she is leaking semen from both her ass and vent, still intensely used by his follower, also the cock of the gryphon keeping her pinned, is covered in various fluid so i assume that they already exchanged place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe follower scream to the sky, finishing to release the last of their reserves. The dragoness has nearly finished blowing the alpha, but instead of coming in her muzzle, he fly to her now empty vent and stuffing his cock in, start to madly fuck her again. His victory and release is upheld by the dragoness second orgasm, filling her own womb with his essence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satisfied, the gryphons left the arena, while the crowd roar it's approval and the dragoness is magically carried in the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ask: \"How much she will be paid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"Not even half the match stake, it still quite the sum, but the complete restoration of her body for the already covered fee will lighten her mood\"</span></div></div>",

Lower or entry level gladiators are severely prohibited to use such, blatantly submission methods to finish off their foes. Also sometimes, a female in season come here to have her hitch scratched per say, or to find a worthy mate, sometimes just for fun, forgive me but even if i love my wife dearly, i must say that your species may be hard to understand sometimes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, what he say it's true, we are much different as we are equal, it's part of what make visiting this city interesting \"How long she will be kept there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually? They should have already brought her to the healer, ah, there they are\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look outside and sure enough, the healer are just completing their task and levitate the loser away, he then continue \"In some more..special match, there are quite rare mind you, the loser may remain on display for a few minutes, spectacle you understand, special rules and all, but enough, i am sure you are both busy so i won't take anymore of your time and special match rules are always explained in advance and you must accept them as they come, no pressure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIra come close and seat at my side as the official present us both the contract \"Now, the paperwork are merely a formality but it's mandatory as you surely understand, i suggest taking your time in reading the contract fully, you may also take it home and return it to me signed tomorrow if you wish\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA curiosity suddenly force itself in my mind \"What kind of matches are allowed within this halls exactly? Beside being divided in hight and low tier\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile grow bigger \"Ha! Finally someone interested in the arena inner working, wonderful\" he clear his throat \"I am afraid that my duties prevent me to explain every details but, you may ask any official you wish or just read the contract i just given you, summarizing in the lower tier the life ward surrounding the arena are at maximum strength preventing heavy wounds and mutilations, poisons etc\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pay isn't much but it's quite safe, and the spectacle you just saw cannot happen in the lower tier, mostly just standard match on 1 vs 1 or if the fighter is skilled, 1 vs 2-4 and so on, the match are nearly always balanced and mostly fair, the hardest kind of match you may face are the ^challenge match^. Their names are well earned i assure you, while the conditions of the lower tier still apply those match are all but fair, designed to push the gladiator to it's limit within the rules, usually some additional condition are set in place like only a limited uses for spells or some schools banished completely and so on, depend really. Of course those are the fastest way to the higher tier but also the quicker way to end up visiting the healer for a while\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckle \"On the higher tier there are various kind of challenger with varying degree of skills, not all of them are dangerous but they tend to be quite single minded in their goals, the ward are still in place and prevent all but the gruesomest death, it's still possible to suffer grievous wounds but very rarely permanent, we would not have many gladiators if they would be, also the kind of finisher where you pin down a female and fill her like the dragoness you just saw are allowed, in some particular kind of match even encouraged\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many misunderstood the nature of the arena, we are not a pimp empire nor we offer those kind of shows specifically, but there are a certain number of spectators, both human and not, ore then willing to pay for such shows and some gladiators want to show themselves off, thus the ^Disadvantage Match^ was born, normally it consist of higher tier gladiators fighting 1 vs 4 or otherwise at significant disadvantage without special rules in place, everything but death and mutilation is a go, but more often then not they mean fuck him/her silly. Just remember that unless specified Before the match began you don't have to put down your opponent in that way, and you have the right to refuse a match you don't want\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly Ira say something smart this time \"What if the female is in season and..well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As i have said some female come here specifically to find a worthy mate or to have their needs satisfied, usually a female in season cannot participate a match were she may be fertilized successfully, unless she insist on entering anyway or she take precaution the arena consider acceptable, we take no responsibility if that happen, beside the healing and keeping the ward active of course. In case of unwanted pregnancy the arena healers or any healers really, can perform a perfectly safe removal procedure at the gladiator expense\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIra in his typical impulsiveness use a simple spell to sign the contract without even completely reading it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI express all my disapproval \"Irafool is definitely a fitting name for you, mindless lizard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sbuff  \"Oh come on Thire, we both already know the rules, Everyone know the rules! Relax and sign the damn thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab the contract with my claw and stash it in a small dimensional rift i use for transportation, it's a very common and safe spell used by nearly all who has at least a normal proficiency in spellcasting, the minor version can't contain much but pretty cheap mana-wise and more then adequate in this case<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will read the whole contract and return tomorrow morning, good day to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe official nod \"To you as well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear Irafool blubbering something but i decide to pay no mind to him and leave the arena, my next stop, the herbalist's shop</span></div></div>",

Do he realize that dragons have been accused of hoarding for a reason? Well since we are many in these areas and raiding the merchant coming and going to Kornos mean having to deal with both clan leaders and most importantly, the elite guards, hoarding is more a concept than a fact these days, still<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a list here\" i cast the same spell i used to store the arena contract and retrieve a list of ingredients i compiled a few days ago \"say your prices, if i find them reasonable we can discuss about payment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk take the list from my claws and examine it \"Hmmmm, i see\" he sigh \"i am afraid that finding some of these herbs will be a difficult task, especially the Crystal Flower. I should have the Black Orchid here by tomorrow however\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDifficult and expansive tend to exchange place far too often when merchant are involved \"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe give me back my list \"Frankly i cannot guarantee the delivery of the Crystal Flower, there are mostly used for the famous compatibility potion you understand, combined with the uniqueness of the flower it make it nearly impossible to obtain, i can have the rest on what on your list by the end of week\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI repeat annoyed \"How Much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three hundreds for the more ^common^ herbs, another hundred for the Black Orchid as they need to be imported and...you'll need to barter with someone to help you retrieve a few samples of Cyritharia Crystalys, that or an alchemist\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least he can pronounce the name correctly, i already knew that the chance of buying the more commonly called Crystal Flower would have been slim, but i want to know if my transmutation formula work as intended before testing it on a living being, and that flower is the only plant i know that can give me a perfect feedback for my spell. I already have the gold i need for the rest of the order at least, apparently i need to decide on the arena sooner than anticipated, that or waiting for another opportunity to arise<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then a question a already knew the answer for, but it's worth trying \"There are other possible source for the flower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes his head \"No i am afraid, the crater up in the mountain is the only place this particular flower grows, the crystallite meteor that impacted there one hundred eighty years ago permanently altered the soil inside the impact crater and created an oasis of unique plants and in time, animals that exist only there. No other source as today exist\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that already, as i already know that the animals living there are...peculiar, magical some say, dangerous even for a dragon for sure, venturing there is risky, no matter how strong you are<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to confirm my order then \"Very well, i place the order for everything on this list but the flower then, by the end of the week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nod \"Yes, four hundred for the whole list, a good price all considered\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true, others asked for more, it's still a robbery but i don't have the time to seek for the common ingredients and the Black Orchid do not usually grow in these lands. I look at the clerk in the eyes \"Four hundred then, and not a coin more clerk, or your lying tongue Will adorn the wall of my cave\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulp \"S-sure, no problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take my leave without even say goodbye and close the door behind me in haste, i don't like dealing with greedy creatures no matter the blood that runs in their veins. I mentally begin to recall the arena rules i know, i want to compare them with the one written on the contract the official given me, it will be interesting to see how many rules nearly everyone do not know about are actually enforced in the arena, but before i can chose a place to read the contract in peace my eyes fall upon a black female of my species<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy memory return to the match i saw barely an hours ago, and to my surprise i recognize the female walking a few meters from me as the one defeated and mated in front of everyone willing to pay for the spectacle. I never expected to see her strolling so openly after such defeat, nor her leaving the the healer care so soon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea take shape in my mind, why not asking her what she really think of the arena and their rules?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide that if she is unashamed of what happened to her, then i should be able to ask a few questions without bothering her, too much at least. I quicken my normal peace and reach her in mere moments, then as i try to greet her she interrupt me with a tone that sounded as final as it gets<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growls \"I won't let you mount me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sincerely reply \"If you are referring to what happened in the arena, it's not the reason of my approach\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe do not believe me \"Then why you came so close to my tail\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I merely wished a few minutes of your time, i have recently visited the arena to consider an application as a gladiator and i was wondering if you are willing to answer a few question about the rules, if they are really as good as they seems\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scrutinize me for nearly a minute before saying \"You didn't lie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no reason to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunt \"Others have asked me to raise my tail just because i am a gladiator in the higher tier, believing that if i accept to participate there then i must be a whore or worse, a slut\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not surprised at her words, it's something i expected really \"Are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me dumbfounded for a second before chuckling \"Come, walk with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remain a little perplexed at her lack of answer but i ignore it and follow her, once i reached her side i begin with my first and most important question: \"Is it worth it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile deviously \"What part? The one being payed? Or the one where i was pinned down and my womb filled by gryphon seed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe answer without even thinking \"Yes, i enjoyed both\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's my turn to remain dumbfounded \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keep her smile \"If you really are a prospective gladiator then you know that you have the right to refuse any match without repercussion in your career, well mostly anyway. I ended up fucked by a group of gryphon yes, but i decided that the prize was worth the risk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't bother you the risk of end up mated if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lose? No, why it should? You are a dragon just like me, i am sure you are aware what happen to a female in season outside the wall of this city\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know, stupid tradition and all \"It depend on tradition but, mostly bred by a group of males\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, unless the female is strong enough to vanquish her pursuer of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shake my head \"Improbable, usually the group is composed of three-four males, the probability of a female with reduced physical prowess due to her season of winning are minimal at best\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckle again \"Unless we trick them, or we simply hide our scent\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What it has to do with the arena\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, in the arena i may end up pinned and filled with the seed of a male i just meet a few minutes ago, it may even be a gryphon or a human. But there, in the arena, i know at least by name who and how many i am up against, i gain a prize if i win and more importantly, i can.say.no. Beside i enjoy mating as much as anyone else, i don't see why i should not take advantage of the situation\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI certainly didn't expected...this \"Isn't...degrading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stop and turn her whole body towards me \"No, being bred by and unknown male and left on the ground bleeding alone on the mountains is degrading. Being forced to raise a clutch with the sire being potentially anyone it's degrading. Being forced down by a group of five barely considered adult and mated till dusk it's degrading\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe come even closer, then she begin to lick my snout with her eyes never leaving mine, her voice seductive \"Waking up one morning after a wet dream pinned down by an elder with my tail forced up in his claw, feeling his cock slowly slipping inside my wet vent and spreading my canal till his tip kiss the entrance of my womb, he whispering how naughty i was to offer myself so easily after only a few lick under my tail\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stop licking my snout an walk back, still keeping her seductive tone \"Finding yourself enjoying the mating, despite hating what he did to you, moaning as he use you like a toy for his own pleasure, then receiving your first orgasm as he tell you how tight you are, repeating how he will keep you as his personal breeder until he unload all his pent up desire in you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone return normal \"It's degrading when he tell you that you has been a good lay, and that you did good for you first time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe close her eyes \"I certainly felt good when i slit his throat while he slept, i enjoyed looking him pay for what he did to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reopen her eyes \"So yes, i love being a gladiator\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remain there like a fool as she begin to walk way. As she leave i hear her say \"See you there, novice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk in the opposite direction she took \"Hopefully, not to soon\"</span></div></div>",

It still bother me to have been unable to find a reliable source for the Cyritharia, or Crystal Flower as it's usually called, curse the ancestor and their lack of foresight, my life would have been a lot easier if they just changed a few old tradition<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose everyone enjoy a crazy female with an abused past from time to time, especially when they begin killing for revenge\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course we all do, the arena match-maker especially must find it exhilarating, i know i do. I still think that this whole arena business will gonna come back and as human say, bite me in the ass sooner rather then later, but i have little choice at the moment, i simply do not have the patience to find a regular work that take away nearly all my time for a few gold pieces, i am not even interested in living here anyway, i prefer the tranquility of my cave thank you very much<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in the street of Kornos it's easy to notice how the influence of both dragons and gryphons have somewhat changed the layout of this city, from the shop insignia written in the old language just under the human name to the size of the main streets obviously redesigned to allow a full grown dragon the chance to walk without causing damage to the structure around it, of course most of us prefer to stroll around in a reduced form, me included, it allow us to enter any area of the city and avoid getting  the people around you nervous, i don't really blame them, maybe pity but not blame<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy short walk bring me to my next and last, destination for today, the spellcrafter shop, here i can easily obtain both the components and sometimes the knowledge i need to complete or refine a spell to a more usable state. A raw spell can be difficult or very expansive in term of essence or mana to cast, a refined one is far more efficient and sometimes, safer to use<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs i come close to the door, it open itself and let me in just before a sound similar to a the small bell echo in the whole shop, one of the first things i notice is that the inside of the shop is quite bigger then the inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, space compression, nice, place just one glyph wrong and...i don''t want to think about it, beside space manipulation magic of this size has always gave me the creep, especially when mother showed me it's utility for the first time, i really liked that crystal, oh well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like before i expect to see a human behind the counter eager to greet me, and of course giving it's best in making me part from my gold, instead a female of my species appear from seemingly nowhere, nice trick, not at my level of mastery but still pretty good<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe greet me with a smile, i must admit her cyan scales make her appear quite attractive, her crystal blue iris aren't exactly helping me focus either<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greeting old one, how can i help you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes twitch, old one?! \"Morning miss, i must congratulate with your for your impeccable manner, unless we consider that i am probably barely a ten years older then you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blush at my remark on my age \"I..am sorry, the runes on your scales..usually only master use them and...they tend to be pretty old..sorry again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe runes? Is she meaning my improved shrinking spell? Interesting, despite being younger then me she can already notice such small details, they are not really runes but still<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense taken, now are you the proprietor of this shop perchance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blush slowly disappear \"Yes that would be me, if it regards magic, and it's not an alchemy ingredients, i probably have it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI like her enthusiasm, or her shiny scales, probably both \"Nor reagents then? A shame, the herbalist asked me quite the sum for only a few herbs, the scoundrel, are all human so greedy? And still they talk about Us hoarding, bronze face\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckle with mirth \"Not really, it's just that their guild as nearly the monopoly over herbs and small remedies, so they-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take advantage of it, greedy bastard. Now miss..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyriana, it's easier then saying my full name, both humans and gryphons believe it's a lot easier to remember too, it's kinda a nice name no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she trying..nah \"Thireious, a pleasure. Now may i see your scrolls about transfiguration please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course, this way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turn around and walk towards the deeper part of the shop where an enormous quantity of scrolls seems to be stored \"I rarely get dragon customer these days, most prefer going to the academy directly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheaper yes, but also bothersome, so much rules \"I know, but the librarian there, well, let's just say that we have a divergence of opinion he and i\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, merely annoying. Quite the collection i see, temporal seals? Aren't they prohibited outside the academy walls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe face me with glee \"Not if you graduated there! Ah here there are, transfiguration, are you seeking anything in particular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmart And good looking? Something wrong here, it's not my birthday yet \"Yes, inanimate object and transposition to organic materials, please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look pensive \"I don't have much on the argument, it's quite complicated to get it done you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's also a reliable method to get information about spells effects without having to test them on actual living being\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grab a few scrolls \"Well yes, if you can get past the whole methamagical thingy, i may be graduated but that kind of magic, thanks but no hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ^bell^ at the entrance ring again, a young male human voice can be heard \"I have done it Cyri! I have..oh, ah, sorry, i didn't know you had a, em customer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are in a shop dimwit, can't you have just err on the side of..wait, love? Ha! She is with a human? Oh well, he may be a dimwit but at least he has good taste in choosing females i give him that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi love, just a minute\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, s-sure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI follow the dragoness back at the counter \"Here we are! Hmm, now normally it would be five hundred and fifty but, for the sake of research i lower it to to four hundred, sounds good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefinitely so \"Absolutely, thank you\" i lower the tone of my voice \"Forgive me for asking but, are you really happy with a human, i mean no offense but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reply whispering \"None taken, he do still need a little more backbone if you ask me, but i am sure he will get it done by the time we get serious\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, her choice. I get the gold from my small pocket dimension and give to her, then stuff the few scrolls with the contract i got from the arena, just so i remind myself of reading it later \"Thank you Cyriana\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To you, and good day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs i exit the shop i feel a small pang of envy towards the human \"Damn him, i should really come down more often, oh well\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding to have spent enough time pondering my self imposed question, i proceed towards the city gates, preparing myself to recover my original form. Luckily nothing impede my progress as i quickly reach the gates and pass through with no problem, i admit to feel more then a little frustrated after watching that female at the arena being mated so..effectively, and also the quite interesting blue shopkeeper, i would not have minded spending some quality time with her, but alas she is already taken, and by my honor, i will not steal another one mates away<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if he is human<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly feeling a little more daring, so to speak, i decide to keep my reduced form and take light toward my caves as i am, not being in the mood to recover my full form yet, maybe remaining in a smaller stature will help clearing my thoughts, not sure how but, nothing to lose in trying<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take flight and set my course for the mountains, shouldn't take too long. My memory forcefully remind me why i am frustrated right now, despite my best attempt, i am unable to think about something else, unsurprising given that my research took away most of my time and by now i barely remember my last intimidate encounter with a female more then an year ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden noise attract my attention on the ground, only now i realize that i was just flying over one of the less frequented watering place around these part of the valley, mostly because it's pretty far from every trade routes and most member of my species prefer bigger bodies of water to quench our thirst or bathe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down more attentively i notice a dragon, he..no wait she! The same blue female i saw fighting in the arena with the gryphons, why is she in her reduced form?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widen for a moment as i finally notice that she is not alone, four griffin around her while one, bigger, seems talking to her. It doesn't take long for me to recognize them from their color pattern, the very same griffins that mated her after winning the match<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI land as inconspicuously as i could, just beyond their line of sight hidden from their sight by the small forest that surround the lake, as i have hoped they are far too distracted to notice me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to get closer, curious what such unlikely group could be discussing about, when a smell, one i recognize belonging to another gryphon, attract my attention. I lower my stance to reduce my visibility even further and try to not make any noise as i follow the scent of my prey, and sure enough my nose hasn't failed me as i finally spot the hiding place of this other little spy. I carefully approach it from behind, only by chance noticing my prey to be female, and when i feel confident enough, cast a quick spell to force her and any sound she may emit to mute into silence then jump on her back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected the gryphon try to turn around to use her claw to defend herself but with the advantage i have over her combined with my strength, it's easy to simply pin her on the ground and whisper in her ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to behave my delicious little prey\" i lick my lips as to show her the meaning of my word \"or me tasting your flesh will be the last memory you'll carry in the afterlife\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tremble with fear and stop struggling, a pity, but i am far more interested in what's happening ahead of me i can't complain. From this distance i can barely overhear their talk, but coming closer will probably expose me too much, especially with my new friend pinned under me so, i try to make out what i can<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger gryphon get closer to the dragoness, his cock quickly emerging from his sheath \"So slut, what do you say? Up for another taste?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female doesn't seems bothered by the gryphon rude approach, instead she seems quite interested in the avian enlarging cock, she walk closer to him and promptly one of the male behind her reach for her tail with his claw and push it out of the way. The blue stop and turn her head around, only to release a moan of pleasure as the gryphon begin to lick her vent with gusto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger male smile wickedly and doesn't waste anymore time and use his claw to lower the blue one muzzle to his cock, using her surprise to his advantage and show his thick shaft down her throat. I consider myself surprised as i notice the blue one tail kept hight by her own volition, exposing all her goods to the male behind her, which unfortunately does not include me, and eagerly put herself to work on the organ in her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel myself becoming excited as my own shaft slowly slip out my hidden sheath, with both the show, and the female under me unmistakable smell of arousal. A wicked smile of my own appear on my lips as i decide on how to best use the situation to my advantage, beginning with the aroused female under me, and concluding with..I'll think about it later, but first..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small squeal attract my attention once again at the scene before me, as the bigger male forcefully remove his cock from the care of the blue coiling tongue, he then walk behind her raised tail and gently push away the other male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down slut, on your back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile widen if that even possible as he push down the dragoness on her back, her legs spread open as her wings, giving all of us a quite nice view of her swollen, dripping vent. Luckily she turned to the side before rolling down, and in that position she is giving me a first seat show for all her goods, pushing my arousal too far for me to restrain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find myself not so gently bite behind the neck of my victim and force her hips just a little higher, in preparation of claiming the now quite excited bitch under me. She must have understood my intentions because she senselessly try to push me off her with renewed vigor. I only need to bite a little harder to remind her in what position she is, and just for my exclusive fun, verbally remind her as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my little bird, i am just gonna tap that nice feeling hole of yours\" i now rub my quite hard cock over her smelly lips \"and you are gonna like, every, single, moment. Or die tying\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shiver for a moment \"Good. Now, spread those legs a little wider my little hen\" she quickly comply with my request, but differently from what it may seems, i can clearly feel her heartbeat going faster and her smell becoming stronger as she submit to my whims. No mater what lies she conjure in her deluded pretty head, she is more then willing, she needed it now, just as i need her, especially with the scene we are witnessing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my hen prepare herself to be taken, the big male over the blue dragoness slowly, tantalizingly, place the tip of his cock over the reddened lips of his new bitch, he tease her for a few more moments before spreading the lips of her welcoming vent with agonizing slowness, savoring her tight walls begging for his treat. Another one of the gryph aroused as much as his alpha, walk towards the open mouth of the blissfully unaware dragoness, slapping his now more then ready cock on her muzzle. She need a few moments to recover from the blissful expression she was making at her penetration, before finally noticing the steel hard organ on her lips and begin to suck it eagerly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male in her vent wait for his comrade to adjust himself on her delicate tongue before beginning to thrust himself inside her more then willing vent with wild abandon, evidently he doesn't care too much about her pleasure and instead focus his mating with the only idea of seeding the tight hole around his member, thrusting viciously hard and vocalizing his approval as her body give in to his demand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue slut doesn't seems to mind her mates rudeness, as even the male in her mouth begin to use her throat as a personal fuck field, and let him use her muzzle as he wish. The other two males are evidently struggling to contain themselves, and evidently fearful of disturbing their leader, walk towards their other companion occupying himself with a quite full muzzle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI straddle the female under me as in her evident excitement, push her to her now quite hot sex on my tool. I didn't expect such reaction from my hen, but i surely welcome her willingness as i angle my cock to penetrate the flustered gryphon under me. I draw my hips back, the tip of my organ now touch the lips of the feathered female i am about to claim. I barely have the time to position myself that my little hen surprise me once more by pushing back against my insertion, triggering my instinct and making me reflexively push forward as far as i could go, forcing my hen to stretch beyond what she felt pleasurable i am sure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hen try desperately to free herself after the pain of her initial penetration, i never had to complain about my thickness being mostly normal i believe, and sure enough i won't now, but for once i feel a little pang of regret feeling her tunnel squeezing me pleasurably while she suffer for her carelessness. A good shove of strength and a small nibble on her neck are enough to calm her down, i give her the time she need to adjust herself as i focus once more on the scene ahead of us<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From my position i can clearly see the alpha penetrating the blue vent, her lips parting, a small dribble of liquid slip from her pounded sex and his cock plow her like no tomorrow, the three other males are being serviced by her muzzle and tongue, stimulating all of them the best she can. The alpha knot become bigger and more noticeable as minutes pass, her lips stretched by his motion to what appear to be their limits in this form, he doesn't let such small detail deter him however as he simply thrust harder against her needy hole and manage to force his bulge in, much to both partner delight it seems<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hen under me begin to grind her back and squeeze my tool, reminding me my own delicious present, and i reply in kind by slowly removing my myself from her tight canal and begin to slowly and carefully mate my new pet, i have to be careful least ruining my fun or revealing my presence to the gryph<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three male surrounding the blue muzzle are evidently quite dissatisfied by her inadequate services, she is evidently unable to keep up with their expectations as she is breed into submission by the male in her vent. Her grunts of approval are clearly the reason of her poor service and all three gryph are eyeing their alpha enviously, hoping he finish up sooner rather then later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir alpha doesn't even bother to look at his companions has his focus is entirely on the hot canal squeezing his cock, luckily for the trio this mean he won't resist much longer at the peace he pound his bitch, in fact he is now rapidly sacrificing speed in exchange for a deeper exploration of her willing vent, an act impeded by both his sloppiness as much as his stupidity given their position<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am instead fearing far better with my end of the gryph, the beak of my female opening and closing slowly with her cloaca gently massaging my member are doing wonders to help me relieve myself of the tension i accumulated today. I decide to give my pet a good solid thrust before increasing the rhythm of my pounding, an act my hen react to by pressing herself back against my push, encouraging me to take her with more vigor. I gently force my hen front a little lower, giving me a batter grip on her side and begin to seriously mate her, feeding her tunnel a bit more of my shaft as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the expression my hen is making i am sure she would scream her approval to the four winds if only she could only emit a sound, but despite my annoyance in not hearing my mate squealing under me, the silence spell is the only thing keeping us from being discovered by the group we are spying<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alpha push himself against the blue with quick short thrust a few more times before emitting a long, acute hawking of sort while surely releasing his pent up seed in the dragoness tunnel<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reply by grumbling pleasurably at his donation, evidently enjoying being filled by the male above her, giving even less attention to the three gryph in her muzzle. Her careless act force one of the three to take things in his own claws, literally, as he push away the other two organs and force his own down her throat. The blue momentarily gasp for air as her orgasm is interrupted mid course by the aggressive gryph, his cock pushing deeper then she expected and effectively cutting off her air supply. His two comrade look more then a little annoyed at being denied of their fun despite the limited attention she was giving them, nonetheless they let him use her muzzle alone for a few more thrust before he too bottom out with his knot in her mouth messily feeding her his seed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA particularly pleasurable clench from the tunnel i am stuffed in force my attention back to my own body, and how much deep i explored my hen tight tunnel, her eyes are now partially vacant, her expression of lust and desire, one i am more then willing to sate. I give another few hard push, forcing my fleshy sheath to move forward a little and making her extend her feathery wings down at her side, a muffled falling sound attract my attention under one of my hen wings, curious i push myself as far as i could get until i am able to move the concealing wings just a little, enough to reveal a transparent potion bottle filled to the brim with a semi-dense bluish liquid. I quickly grab the bottle and continue to mate my female with shorter, quicker thrust feeling my body slowly preparing up for release, when briefly smelling the potion i suddenly realize what kind of liquid is contained within<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old now discarded formula of the compatibility potion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of gasping attract my attention once more ahead, one gryph collapsed with a stupid grin on his face and the alpha forcefully removing his knotted cock from the blue vent, he seems to ignore her gaping hole and decisively walk to her muzzle where she is gasping for breath, he let her breath deeply a few times before presenting her his dirty organ for cleaning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the two remaining gryph quickly approach the now vacant vent and stuff himself in without any regards for his comrade as he attempted the same, but was far too slow, the alpha ignore both as the dragoness begin to dutifully clean his member while submissively looking him in the eyes, she seems barely consider the male now fucking her vent with quick short thrusts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy pleasure remind me once more of the hen under me and a wicked idea surface in my lusty mind, i uncork the old potion in my claw and pushing down my female i grab her beak and feed her the blue substance, she is so lost in the mating that doesn't even fight it. I smile wickedly as i remember that she may still not carry my clutch anyway, after all the old recipe was far from effective and my tight, fleshy sheath is not in heat yet, so the probability of consequences are quite low but i still enjoy the idea of attempting to breed this gryph instead of just stuffing her like a balloon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue mating my hen in this new pleasurable position, and watch the group as the second gryph quicken his thrust and screech to the heavens, he too adding his contribution in the blue womb. The satisfied gryphon remove his cock from the blue vent aided by the fluids now coating her vent from both sides, quickly the third gryph take his place, only to reach his peak a few seconds later, pathetic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime the alpha use his claw to hold the blue muzzle and force her to deepthroat his member a few times before removing himself from her mouth and slowly backpedal until the tip of his pointed member kiss the dragoness still parted vent, the dragoness lift her hips as to offer her vacant hole to the male above her, but instead he continue to walk back until his body no longer overtop her needy body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up slut, i want to mount you properly this time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue seems confused by his request, but comply nonetheless. She roll over and slowly get up on all four, moving her backside as trying to entice the male carefully observing her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alpha get closer \"Lift that tail, show me my prize\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe purr as he said the last word and the blue reveal her dirty hole to him, her vent in covered with plenty of seed from both sides and it's dripping part of it's incompatible load her legs, The alpha evidently wanted to humiliate her with words, instead his inability to control his own arousal push him on top of the dragoness and force him to resume humping the female like a beast, not even gripping her form properly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my own end approaching fast, and my quickened thrust prove to be too much for my little hen as she she orgasm copiously on my tool. Her unexpected contraction are rapidly bringing me to my own peak as well, my only regret is that my fun with this hen is nearly over. My thoughts are consumed by the tunnel squeezing my tool so fervently and i find myself capable only on how can i make my hen position more..permanent so to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of having this gryph bended with her tail hight waiting for me every morning push me beyond my edge, i give this gryph a last hard thrust and let my orgasm freely flowing in her overstuffed sex. The volume of my release is not meant for a creature so smaller then my original form, having forgotten to adequate some of my body function to my reduced form will undoubtedly bring me a few problems later, but for now i enjoy the shocked expression of my womb overfilled hen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alpha gryph scream once more his orgasm to the haven as he empty the last of his reserves inside the blue knotted vent, during my distraction she has allowed her mate to bend her in an even more submissive posture and mated her like an animal. much to her approval, till my own clarity returned to me. He hump her  little more before forcefully extracting his knot from her vent and finish his job with a few strings on her rump and back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let my body relax as the hen under me rest sprawled on the ground, still impaled on my yet spurting member. I have nearly done, and my hen is definitely a little overweight now, nothing excessive but definitely a little more rounded where it counts. My silent chuckle prove to be my second distraction, apparently in the brief period i enjoyed observing my hen the alpha and his group have left, leaving blue exposed and covered in semen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt will be interesting asking her what this was all about, both to her and to my hen, after a long bath in the lake of course</span></div></div>",

Yes you can fight, and some of the protective runes you are wearing under your shirt plus your magical abilities even if limited, can easily make you more then a match for any petty thief you may have the misfortune to encounter, but then again, you are no fighter, and confronting someone with unknown combat skill and magical abilities armed only with a rock hammer and an utility knife may not exactly be the smartest move you'll ever made. So, reluctantly, you decide to sheath back your knife and make a quick check of the house for anything that may be amiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that you are yet unable to ignore, is why this..thief, has perfectly maintained your old laboratory to pristine condition, as when you got inside there wasn't any evident sign that any of your tools has even been used, and more importantly why when you managed to give a brief glance at the intruder shape, he or she appeared so short..maybe it was a side effect from missing the proper concentration and calm when the spell was cast, a troubled or otherwise not calm mind can easily mess up a spell when the energy are released, a distraction can have similar detrimental effect if not enough focus is applied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless you decide to ignore the matter of the possible thief, and get to work seek out any other possible magical or otherwise parting gift left from your new friend, the last thing you want is ending up caught in another trap of sort<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes nearly two hours to fully inspect the house, and to reasonably calm down. When the adrenaline from your more then a little unusual experience has left you body, you thought to have touched the lowest layer of of annoyance that this day had flawlessly 'prepared' for you, this definitely wasn't what you had in mind when thinking about temporarily settling back in your old home, that and having to dust off at least half the house to bring it back in more acceptable condition for your stay<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat ended up happening however, was discovering how easily sometimes fate like to literally screw up your day, or weeks considering your  blowed up smithy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no word to describe the horror you felt entering your old room. To begin with, your bed is completely messed up, evident claw mark are pretty much everywhere on it, a strong spicy smell permeate the very mattress and what remain of the sheets, a few drips of some blackish substance have permanently ruined what little the claw marks and odor substances are mostly absent....but worst of it all, on what's left of your bedside table, toys, sexual toys are listed in what you believe is order of magnitude, none bigger then what you think a big but still perfectly reasonable natural phallus size should be, and of course, among them...blades, short knife-like curved blades that can be easily fitted in one hand, making a sort of clawed hand when worn, it remind you of a child that wished to imitate a cat paw while it's claw are extended, but this one look far more deadlier<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even bother to look around the rest of the room in details, there is no blackish substance anywhere else as far as you could see, but the smell.....if it wasn't your home you would have suggested fire as the only solution to purify all this....things<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf angry, half in disbelief, you get out of your room and close the door behind you, resisting the sudden urge to bar the door with something heavy, instead you ignore the nagging feeling in your head hinting at something bigger and just prepare the ward to protect your new/old temporary home from any possible undesirable visit, now if you could only spare the crystals powering the defense to keep the ward permanently active...another thing to think about tomorrow you wager<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now your old parents bedroom will do, for tonight at least<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, if only you could understand who is the masochistic crazy bastard that did such a mess in your home, and most importantly why..but you had enough adventure for now, tomorrow...tomorrow you'll think of something, right now you have wards to imprint</span></div></div>",

Your thoughts still rebel to the very idea, and you agree, it's preposterous really, how can two so different species even live together under the same roof, or cave, is beyond your understanding and frankly, beyond your care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your best bored tone: \"How long? We are walking for quite awhile\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness in front of you turn her head back still walking forward: \"Not long, i just wanted to make sure you appreciate the beauty that only this city has to offer..\" The city uh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarasomething then return to face the path ahead, slightly raising her swishing tail, fuck it. Just what i need, and me thinking that i could have taken a relaxing vacation after a few jobs...i just hope that not all dragon are like her in this city and surrounding area or i am screwed, or i will be, literary so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy curiosity pique for moment, a question that i had gotten a few years back, damn i don't remember her name: \"Kara can i ask you a question about your..species?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness reply without even turning: \"My my, already with shorter names? Did you like me or something?\" Her tone is playful but i can easily recognize some minor lust in her tone, maybe she like to mess with others or..no, i don't know and i don't want even<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the more nonchalant tone as possible: \"No, i just forget your name\" hopefully this will cool her off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness stop and turning around she look at me straight in the eyes, then with a wanting look: \"Really? Such a shame, i know a few method for helping memorizing things, about me, and i assure you, when our session is over your memories about us will be impossible to forget....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer creepy, sharped teeth smile help you not in regaining your composure, but after  few moment of hesitation: \"Why no thanks, eh, i have some important business to conclude, and i would like to finish it as soon as possible\" You didn't really lie, if the caravan master told the truth the job master is awaiting for you, not necessarily now but still<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin didn't fade in the slightest, not her tone, but she turn around and once again start to walk towards what you hope is your destination, of course she is now blatantly showing you her vent, intentionally walking with her rear a little higher: \"Well then, i really hope that your business end in a satisfactory way for you, and that it will not take too much of your time, after all there are other wonder that i would like to show you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour patience is at it's end, and when you feel that is time to stop this madness about her constant hinting, she speak again: \"Here we are\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sight is taken from the building on front of you, quite tall in a what you can recall is called a gothic stile but with yellow front wall and a cheery maroon double doors, on which is written: Job and central Guild Master. A not so small job board at it's side confirm that Karasomething brought you in the right place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walking ^companion^ turn towards you and say in a teasing tone: \"Good luck then, i will return at the inn and don't be a stranger if you need anything\" she then leave, walking normally this time, maybe she was just very playful but you doubt it. Then you remember that her stupid retort about names had make you forget to ask her that question, damn it. Another time...shit, no you know what i don't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with your destination reached, you take a deep breathe and walk inside following the strangely pristine orange, nearly empty corridor until at a few seconds later a sign indicate the right direction for the job master.</span></div></div>",

After all why anyone would try to eavesdrop on a job master room? Clearly visible from any who may enter even<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there are invisibility spells, not that you know of any yet, but they are supposedly quite essence/mana draining and not particularly easy to focus on but....mmmh, I'll think of it later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the door handle you push the lever down and let yourself in, what you see beyond the threshold of the door is mostly exactly what you expected, a middle aged human in official armor behind a well fitted desk, two guards posted at opposite side of the circular room, a few banners representing the city symbol...with a human and...a dragon both outlined in yellow over a cyan background.....okay i wasn't expecting that, a few words inscribed in arcane ^one language of magic^ so to speak...can't read them...oh well, and last but not last a circular magical seal on the ground at the center of the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell such seal are usually used in duels for limiting damage and power but...okay, city you visit traditions you find. The rest of the room is not different from the corridors you just came in, not much for interior public office design it seems, oh well, if they pay well who care<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking closer to the supposed Job Master you can now notice a few more details about him, one of them is that the outline of his forms seems to be constantly shifting, clearly an illusion, you recognize it as a variation of the the more common mirror spell, a defensive magic used by spellcaster all over the world as a defensive means against ranged attackers like archers and such, there are better enchantment around but they are easily detected, this one unless you came very close or cast a revelation spell is not<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr alternatively particularly magically sensitive persons may just sense it, just like you just did<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job master was reading something when you came in, and with a quick silent vision spell, you improve your eyesight for a few moments and become able to read some of the document text, unsure if being surprised or not you quickly discover that the document is about you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening young man, and welcome to the city where the impossible is a reality, welcome to the city of Kornos!\" The man smile sincerely at your approach, then return to a more serious but still personable face and continue: \"I am sorry about my presentation, it's tradition you understand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, there are worst tradition you have been subjected to, like the sticks of pain used in the welcome ritual of some lizard people, and to think that the chief wanted to give you his daughter in payment.....damn cheap bastard: \"Believe me if any city i have been to had similar traditions as a welcome, well, let's just say that i would have been an happy man\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job master chuckle: \"Why yes, the southern continent is it? How it is called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't remind me of that jungle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother light chuckle escape the middle aged man: \"As you wish young one, please have a seat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chair appear from nowhere a few steps ahead of me, is this room full of magical seals? Is he really that paranoid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Job Master calmly: \"Do not be afraid, i know that this city and it's custom may seems...curious to you, but rest assured, we only mean well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as i don't wake up with a dragon in my bed next morning I'll be fine, thank you. Actually possibly never\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job master seems to understand my predicament and nod: \"Worry not, i know that the other region are more..active in dealing with similar situation, here too if the necessity arise, still.....please have a seat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to humor him and you take a seat in front of him: \"If as active you mean slaying, sure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Job Master nod: \"Aye, that is the case. Now i can't really promise that you won't wake up with a dragoness in your bed one of this morning but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed: \"Please, spare me the details\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, and please call me Rhumar from now on\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhumar? Isn't an old word for ^Just^, as righteous and fair and such?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tone become serious again: \"I have read your professional records, if you are wondering the Caravan Master you escorted here gave it to me, and yes he expected you to remain here, for a time of course. I knew that old fox for years now and he is rarely wrong in judging a character. Now i have just read part of it and i can see that my old friend hasn't lied, i can sense it in you. So how much magical affinity young man, i heard that you incinerated a few bandits but i need to know more, you understand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah yeah, every time they discover yours magical abilities questions arise, it's not that human spellcaster are that rare, is that Mercenary Spellcaster are: \"The seal i just passed through should have told you everything you need to know, the rest i am unwilling to discuss\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly Rhumar nod: \"I approve young one, none need to know more. Very well, i have a job for you, but first. Prove yourself to the guild and i will be more then happy to give you a job worthy of your time, Lunarion\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen when he say Lunarion. It has been years since anyone referred to you as such. Lunarion are human with a deeper connection to magic than most, we are more sensible to it, like a fully human sorcerer of sort<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering your integrity: \"What kind of job we are speaking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A simple one really, a few kilometers north of this city a group of troll has attacked a caravan commissioned by one of our most illustrious citizen, no need to know who, anyway trolls are quite rare in this area and even more curiously they have stolen something apparently meaningless, not shiny nor beautiful or evidently valuable. A small black coffer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite suspicious, but none of my business: \"And you suspect foul play. How much for it's retrieval?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2800 for the coffer, 5000 if you discover any sure connection with the real thief or it's master. Also the guild will pay another 1000 for the elimination of the trolls, all 5 of them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1000 for five trolls is scandalously low, after all troll thick skin and regenerative abilities make them a difficult opponent for any human who may meet such creatures, but admittedly with my runic sword and my experience i should not have much problem in dealing with them, I Am a Lunarion after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso trolls are physically strong but their intelligence if any, is up to debate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow dealing with their master may be another thing entirely, however i need only to present absolute proof not dealing with it myself if any. Alright, hopefully i wont regret this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a deal, anything else i need to know?\"</span></div></div>",

My favorite combo is poison+fire+explosive+scatter= explosive toxic fire and scatters 4 arrows come from 1 arrow.</span></div></div>",

You are not sure what the dragoness plans are, but if your experience in dealing with them have teach you something, it's to not trust them, nor anyone with a smile that do not have anything to gain from helping you. Cynical? Maybe, but it kept you alive so far<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragoness is leading you towards the lower part of the mountains, uninhabited by dragons despite the rumors, Kara seems to know the caves very well which is curious unless she had reason to come here often. It's time to get some answers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me Kara, why are you here with me? And don't start with telling me bullshit about curiosity or friendship, we barely knew each other and you evidently know this area quite well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't even flinch at my accusation: \"I merely wanted to keep you company, that's all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, sure: \"Did you have something for human or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckle, or at least she seems to, that or she is growling: \"Me? Never! Although your nature do intrigue me, is one of your ancestor a dragon perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily no, i have enough trouble as it is being a Lunarion thanks, the so called boost in power do not worth hunters aiming at your head day and night: \"No and i am not interested in having my blood mixed with one, no offense\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail swish a little higher: \"You sure? The benefit are...interesting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The woe are up to pair, from strange individuals hunting for your blood to bunch of crazies wanting to worship you or...something, i am not exactly up to date with today madman and fools\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckle yet again with her tail lifting even further, completely exposing her vent and undertail: \"Sooo, you are not gonna jump me for being a dragoness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why i should? What are you afraid of Kara? What scare you so much to not even wanting to mate with your species?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stop without dropping her tail, she look down and close her eyes: \"My species are...effective in their methods, but female are not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Treated with respect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe open her eyes and turn her head towards you, her iris changing and shifting between amber and crystal azure: \"I want more from a mate than his cock and his seed, i want him to fuck me yes, but i also want him to love me, care for me. More then just as a breeding ground\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't sound saddened or anything, you are wandering if she is making it up, but this time you instinct tell you that she isn't lying, not truly: \"I am sure that not all male dragon are that way, i find it extremely improbable, your race won't be able to live together with mine otherwise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laugh openly now, turning her whole body towards me: \"You still consider yourself human? How amusing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour irritation quickly become evident in your tone: \"And why not?! Am i not human just because of my skills or my spellcasting abilities?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laugh lower in volume and slowly disappear, her expression serious now: \"My dear Aranos, no mere human share the connection you and all Lunarion share with magic, sure there are many skilled mages out there, i saw some, but none of them can reach but a tenth of your potential, if you only just accept it instead of suppressing it all the time. Even now here in the wild where we could be attacked at any time you still suppress your strength. If anything it is i that should ask you Why\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reply is simple as is clear: \"My dear Kara, power is not a reliable method to prove one real strength, nor is having any delusion of godhood, only your will and your soul really matter with magic, along with talent of course. What you are talking about is madness and fury, nothing any sane person be it human or dragon, want have anything to do about\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe focus on you clearly happy with your answer: \"Could have not put it better myself. Now you know why i am attracted to you, why i decided to see for myself if the blabbering of Turibqe are true, seems shi was right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A red dragon, all hermaphrodite from birth, shi was beaten in the arena by a human and he, much to my amusement, mated and claimed hir womb as his own, i believe he planned it, not sure why but apparently he liked hir, quite interesting no? Shi was unsure of hir fate but after little more then a month i meet hir walking around the market, with a smile so big shi risked to brake hir own muzzle, ahahaha, shi loved it.

Or both<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long yet?\" Your patience diminished considerably since her joining in your quest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stop, using just another chance to show her glistening sex \"Close, Should not take long by now, i do however suggest resting, reaching an important battle stressed and tense is unadvisable\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere we go again \"I am not tired, beside i am not sure i like your idea of relaxing\" your tone is clearly annoyed by now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara doesn't seems to get the annoyance in your voice, or maybe she just don't care as she turn her head towards you \"You know, without a compatibility potion your species has no chance of giving me eggs, why not take advantage of this? I'll do anything you ask, promise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou facepalm \"Why? Why you have to be so annoying!? I said no, period\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mphf, i am rarely wrong Aranos, and sooner or later i will get what i want\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her not so cryptic statement Kara lower her tail and resume a normal walking stance as she point with her muzzle forward \"We should be there in less then an hour, i know the caves at the base of the mountain well, i can help you plan the attack, if you wish\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't trust her of course, but you also believe that while she is wrong about you, she is convinced of her own truth and she will not hurt you on purpose, doesn't really mean much but it's something, you keep yourself ready to unleash a strong disturbance if needed, surely enough to at least stun her if the need arise \"Very well, take point\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile deviously as she walk ahead of you once more, this time keeping her privates hidden, it's something at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the walk continue in silence thankfully, and as she promised you clearly see a number of caves in the distance, there is a good chance that at least some of them are connected so, you need to plan accordingly, a stealth approach would be the best option both to maximize your chance of success and if you want to have any chance of discovering who is behind the theft<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara lower her stance with her belly nearly touching the ground, you too lower your stance as you both reach the limit of the underwood<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara whisper \"So, how do you wish to retrieve the package?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe know far too much for not having someone inside the job master office, or this work was well known to anyone who worked closely in the guild, both possibilities are worrying as now you know there is a chance they are waiting for you specifically, not for a common adventurer or just a warrior. You notice 2 trolls at the entrance of what seems to be the bigger cave<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the chance you must risk it \"We don't have many option, but there is only one plan with the best chance of success\"</span></div></div>",

You know where the return path is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected her a snide remark of some sort, instead she remain calm and collected, she walk next to you and lay down, placing her tail around your waist gently. The smell of her previous arousal still linger on her body, but before you can tell her to show off, she begin to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone is low, nearly sad \"Dragons do not consider the idea of family as you humans do, certainly some prefer to remain close to their mates for life or, well that the concept. However most, especially the males, are free spirit, where blood is a powerful pull, but also an unyielding chain. If one of the parents do not care for the hat..children beyond the basic needs such as food and protection,,,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupt her \"They just don't care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look in your eyes for a moment, you can tell she is telling the truth \"Not exactly, they do care. They care for their bloodline, their descendant just enough to ensure their survival to adulthood, most of the time. How do you call it...sexual maturity, yes that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When a male or a female is of age, the parents may or may not continue to support their children, it's up to them. How much support is given beside the basic is...variable. My sire was..still is i think, a proud strong dragon, black one if you care, his idea of family is pretty nonexistent in comparison to you human, breed your mate, give her basic needs and protection, let her do the rest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer improvised embrace doesn't seems so annoying anymore as she tell you her story, you know she is not lying, your instinct tell you so, still the smell of her arousal is present, more intense then before although slightly, you believe she is trying to take advantage of the situation, not that you'll let her \"And your sire was a treacherous bastard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckle deeply \"Not treacherous no, a bastard, well to your standard? Yes. I wasn't present at the time but my dam always told me this part of my life very fondly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer embrace tighten around you and bring you a little closer, a shiver can be felt on her scales when her side touch yours \"The female of my bloodline always had a..defect if you want to call it that way, that caused an artery in our canal to be partially exposed, that caused no small amount of pain when they mated or brought their eggs to the light, in some cases a rapture caused severe bleeding and sometimes..even death\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tighten her tail again for a moment before continuing \"Mother was heavy with my and the eggs of my brother when she met him for the first time\" A smile appear on Kara muzzle \"He was..still is i think, an healer, well an apprentice at the time, he was out in the forest seeking herbs and roots essential for his profession, mother meet him near the lake south of here while her thoughts was ravaged by doubts and regrets. Will she live to see her children hatch? Will her mates help them develop properly if she don't survive the inevitable lay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you may imagine, mother was worried that what happened to her grandmother would happen to her as well, bleeded to death despite her mate support, and her mate while strong was not exactly caring, she was scared to say the least, but when she met a stranger, a human, a species renowned to find solution and trouble in equal measure, practically appeared before her, a crazy idea took roots in her brain, her instinct screamed to her to try despite the risk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara bring you even closer, not the smell of her excitement can be easily felt, definitely stronger then before, pungent even \"She befriended him, helping him in his task in exchange for his hears, and possibly, his knowledge. Mother didn't need to lie or deceive, their personality really clicked she told me. Turns out the problem that plague my family for so long was curable! He told her that while rare, this defect was common in a sub-species of human living on the northern region of the word, and best, he knew how to treat it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara laugh wholeheartedly \"Of course nothing is without a price, sometimes even when your healer doesn't want to be paid. He explained her that the cure consist in using a sort of poison altered magically on the fly to heal the defect permanently. Alas he refused to treat her while she was heavy with eggs, and instead suggested a local treatment to alleviate the pain and temporarily reduce the problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turn her head to you \"The ointment has to be applied directly over the exposed artery, normally an easy task with a human, especially with the aid of magic, but he felt unsure about her and suggested her mate to do it instead, after he taught her the recipe of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe return to look at the cavern ahead of us, her clone is close and still unspotted \"Mother knew that my sire would not have considered helping her solve a problem that didn't affected him directly, so she convinced the healer to treat her instead. That day mother discovered that not only she didn't mind exposing herself, she literally loved do it for him, she admitted to become quite excited at the prospect of her healer placing his hand inside her vent, and imagined more then once to offer herself to him. He was kind and caring, capable and, or at least she believed, interested in her in That way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing happened between them during the months of treatment, or at least she told me so, but i think that something did happened, after all, an aroused female more then eager to offer herself to a male that also found her interesting? And with his hand always in her vent, literally? Sure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the time to lay came, my sire was absent as always, but he was there. He helped her lay and remained at her side when she was more vulnerable. She admitted to me that it was the last time she trusted my sire, and that she would have offered herself to her healer at the right time, no human or dragon would have changed her mind, he would have become her mate, period\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara tone become more soft \"And so she did, after he finished curing her defect, she offered a passionate night of sex as a reward, she told me he was reluctant at first, but in the end found a way to..convince him. It became a regular thing, he came to check her health and she literally fucked him senseless. My sire didn't seems to care or know, mother was not sure, but as long as the eggs where safe and intact, he didn't seems to care\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone return normal, but with and hint of anger \"When both me and my brother hatched, my sire was there, mother told me he examined us and found us 'more then adequate', or so he said. Years later when her healer was now independent with his apprenticeship now long completed, her children reached maturity and she...left us, with him. I remember he telling her to bring us or at least me with them, but mother refused, for her instinct he was her new mate and it's custom to abandon all the old ties behind when leaving, also this was the best way to ensure their safety, my sire care little of mother now that her duty was done, but would have probably come after his children\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lived mostly isolated, returning home only when needed, i knew my brother has plan for me and i wanted to avoid him when possible. In the end he caught me alone and...mounted me, at first i try to shake him off but...i enjoyed being mated, excited by his tongue first and filled by his cock, and of course afterwards, his seed. I don't know how many times he used me for his pleasure but i remember my first orgasm and letting do what he wanted as long as i felt so good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only remember my sire pushing him off me and scolding him to not mate with his sister. He agreed but i know he would have done it again as soon as had the chance, he even told me to meet him later to..continue, i was tempted at first i admit, despite his rudeness my first mating was quite pleasurable and i wanted more. But i refused to submit to a male so similar to my sire and escaped. The city and it's inhabitants offered me both help and kindness, as you know what my brother did is considered rape in Kornos and it's not tolerated, no matter how common is among dragons\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smile \"I found work as a mercenary, helping mages with rare ingredients and so on. Nearly 2 years later i found mother strolling around the city, with a smile so big that threatened to break her muzzle. I confronted her about abandoning me, as a reply she invited me home, their home. It didn't take a genius to see that she was heavy with eggs once again, and as expected the sire is her loved healer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their home was quite beautiful and he was really happy to see me in good health i can tell, her offered me shelter and a job despite my mother instinct complaining to him not to, i ended up loving his spirit and forgave my stupid mother, she was so lucky to meet him. They are happy and i will not have been the edge between them, despite knowing that he didn't mind my presence, on the contrary i felt genuine affection for the first time in my life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laugh again \"If he wasn't my dam mate, i would have offered myself on the spot. That day i decided two things. First my mate would have never been a dragon, second..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe release me from her embrace and quickly lay herself on her back then use her tail to push me on her, the smell of her arousal and the wetness i felt when my hand landed on her vent say everything about her second motive<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claim me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit</span></div></div>",

You grit your teeth in frustration, wards are powerful and you are pretty good at using them, but they are very specific and when you placed yours on the armor you now wear, you haven't engraved one capable of protecting you from an aroused dragoness, to your defense you didn't thought of needing one, nor you believed anyone should have needed a ward for that, or that it even exist<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe try lo lick your cheek again, this time you manage to avoid her tongue, although just barely, her smile diminish a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why resisting Aranos?

Move your scaly ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run swords drawn toward the cave, preparing yourself for the worst you quickly conjure an energy barrier with your left hand and focus a small part of your energy into your blade, the gentle humming of your charged sword have a somewhat calming effect as you approach quickly reach the cave entrance. Kara doesn't take more then a few seconds to reach your position, same for her clone that apparently is nothing more then a puppet given the lack of knowledge she had about the missing guards, unless your ^partner^ was so distracted that she just didn't notice her clone attempt to communicate with her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you prepare to enter the cave the clone quickly anticipate you and rush inside, Kara stop you from proceeding using her tail as a barrier \"Wait Aranos, let my clone deal with possible traps or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud noise you can't fully recognize came out of the cave, another dragon, a blue one in it's reduced form like Kara, run outside with a small black chest, your ^partner^ quickly put herself between her path and freedom, but instead of trying to push through as you expected or attempting to attack Kara, the dragon drop the chest, probably the same you came here to retrieve, and begin to speak in a desperate tone \"Please, help him! He can't defeat it alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara look at the dragoness suspiciously, then suddenly her eyes widen and she begin hissing \"A cultist! The stench of death linger upon him\" Kara push the dragon on the ground on it's back, there you recognize her more lithe form as a female of her species, your mood quickly improve at noticing your lack of interest in discovering any difference between Kara and this other dragoness undertail<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still find yourself a little confused tough, why despite the leather armor she seems to wearing her vent can be so easily reached? An armor defect maybe, despite you lack of interest you did notice that the armor pieces that should cover that area is strangely flat and of a brighter color, maybe it's has been damaged somehow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara continue to be quite aggressive towards this female, but doesn't seems intent on harming her unless absolutely necessary, she still hiss her word in evident displeasure \"Why are you traveling with...that thing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragoness manage to release a pulse of cold energy from her paws and use the distraction to release a small breath of ice from her mouth, Kara easily dodge it but the blue one has already got what she wanted and is now on capable of fighting back \"It's not a thing! Its a human and he need help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara tone is pissed, mocking even \"Really now, since when a cultist has proven themselves worthy of living, or he already enthralled you with his words?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue one seems distracted for a moment, a memory perhaps? It definitely disturbed her but she smile immediately afterwards, her tone is appreciative \"He saved me from..another, he don't deserve to die just because of what he is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou beg to differ, you may not chose to be a dragon or a gryphon, but you chose to be a cultist, it's a different thing, but you have heard enough \"Kara, leave it be\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara turn her head towards you but keep her eyes on the other dragoness \"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sheathe your sword \"Leave.it.be. Kara\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't like your decision, her growling towards the blue one sound quite like a threat, but she relent \"Very well, Aranos please do go inside and locate if there is anything left, my clone tell me that the cave it's empty but i haven't asked it to look, i prefer to keep it's claws on our new gust you understand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, and miss? That chest is ours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nearly scream \"No! We found it first, we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl form Kara shut her up \"But you can't keep it, the reward is for who bring it back, not for the one who found it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragoness seems angry at Kara, but a wicked smile appear on her muzzle instead \"What if i tell you that i know the name of the responsible? You may get the coffer, but without the name the reward is significantly lower no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre all dragon so manipulative? Not that you blame her, you would have done the same given the situation \"What do you suggest then? Equal share?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nod \"Help him, and we share the rewards\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara evidently wanted to refuse but i beat her on it, i want the more paying job after this one after all \"Fine, but i keep the chest and Kara keep her eyes on you, no spells ar tricks, otherwise your dear cultist die by my blade, are we clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Very well, i agree\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe accepted the term quite easily, far more easily than i expected, what is she planning?..Or maybe she....well, quite the  interesting thought you just got, if Kara want a human mate, why not this one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May i ask you name then, or i should just call you blue dragoness\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to debate with herself if telling you her name or not, but in the end she does \"Nariza, now help him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy so adamant on helping him? Have i right about her feelings? Or she is merely using him and he is merely necessary for her plans? Frankly you don't care what she does, but her way of reasoning may help you understand Kara and any other dragon you may face in the future, for now however, let's deal with the present you remind yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara, tell your clone to bring him out, alive, i get the chest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara is annoyed at my decision to not kill the cultist i can tell, but she follow my order and carry out the battered body of a man, he has a strange aura you can tell, but your own magical aura easily prevent his one from affecting you, you use a simple telekinetic sphere to catch the coffer and bring it to you \"I'll stabilize him, but i will not expend my energy to heal a potential threat if what Kara told is true, the healer will do the rest, at his expense of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNariza nod \"Of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou conjure a small blue/green sphere in your hand and place it above the cultist chest, then a small stream of energy flow into him followed by the conjured orb<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will keep it stable for a while, let's go\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, i should not work in that way, but, sometimes happen that way too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara snort \"Tell that to the male around here, most of them don't even bother to ask your name before siring your clutch, it's partially our fault tough, i saw more then one female in season participating a match in the arena against an opponent that are compatible with us, sometimes in group. If that's not a slut i don't know what it is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue one disagree with her, again \"It may just be desperation! It's, hard sometimes, and, she may still sterilize the clutch later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they can abort, was strange \"It's quite barbaric for a sentient species no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara beat Nariza this time \"No, it's nature. And most female enjoy being forced down and bred silly anyway. So no, not really, degrading maybe, but the female that lives inside Kornos are safe from this kind of harassment, or the one strong enough to tear a new breathing hole in the skull of a few overexcited male i suppose\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNariza finish the phrase \"Or the one living with their clan, as a group that share blood traits of some kind. They usually do not approve of a random male breeding their females\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara acidly \"Only so they can bred them themselves, sisters included if the need or the lust arise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragoness doesn't reply, so both sides are true, courting and everything, but bestial rape or incest too in certain clans or family, if what Kara told me about her brother is true, and i don't doubt her, not on this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask another question, you shouldn't but you do it anyway, after all Kara was quite adamant in claiming you as her mate \"What about incest? It's frowned upon like in human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNariza answer this one as Kara mood darken a little \"It's..not a crime if the clan allow it but, it's also commonly disdained enough to not being practiced, a-at least not if the female is in season\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..i sense a but here \"And if she is not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragoness blush \"Well, the young has to learn somehow..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara is quite pissed if her tone indicate anything \"So the male mount their own sisters for fun, and learn how to rape one when adults\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You have-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wisely drop the argument in favor of hearing the birds, a much more safe option in this case<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the, fortunately brief, journey was done in silence. We take a room for rent in an inn and drop the cultist in a bed, Nariza go call a healer after having make me promise to watch over the cultist. I reluctantly agree and keep Kara back as she scratch the wooden floor with her claw, it's obvious where she want to put them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully her clone disappear and she tell me that Nariza has a strong attachment to the cultist, she is not sure how strong but she is sure it's there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's nearly three hour later that both you and Kara come out the arena where you assisted to the cultists prowess in battle, he can surely cast a few tricks although most of his moves seems given more out of desperation than anything, you do not believe he has the full control of his power and that most of it it's not his own, you remember little about the small conversation you and Kara shared with the man, but the name of Razim  as the head of the cult of rage are not good news for the city, the job master will not be pleased when he hear of this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that having strange soldiers running out the arena has pleased the captain of the guard any as he ordered a city lock-down and the help of the mages to deal with this possible threat, a few dragon too are in the guard apparently and despite your issue with the idea, you admit that having a few full grown dragon at your side can make conflicts a little easier, they are far from being invincible, but their magical and physical strength combined can give pause to more then one type of opponent, unless they are slayers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNariza decided to go after her cultist and follow him to see what he is up to, id say follow the guards, they know where is he<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara do not lose this chance to voice her thoughts on the matter \"Cultist are nothing but trouble\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer to her sarcastically \"Amen to that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at you strangely, then \"Want to see what this fuss is all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment, speaking with the job master is important sure, but he can wait \"Did you still have the chest with you?\" She nod \"Then let's go, i am curious about his powers, i suspect that most of them aren't his\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are not, his cult gave them to him if what he has said is true, the higher you rank, more the power they gave you, it's not free however\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like your offer of help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snort \"I merely wanted to sweeten the deal. I was serious about it, and still are, it's convenient i admit, but i really want you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still don't believe her on this, maybe the cult has something to do with it \"Will will see, we will see\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both you and Kara follow the last division of guards has they reallocate outside the city, near an old decayed cathedral abandoned for a reason you still are unaware of. Reaching your destination take only a few minutes moving peace, the soldiers seems to ignore the dragoness walking beside you, isn't difficult to notice a few dragon looking her way tough<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reach the cathedral the guards have already surrounded the whole place and the captain, easily recognizable due to his armor, seems to be talking with the cultist Kara clone has carried in Kornos. It's impossible to hear them at this distance and the guards politely ask you both to not go any closer the interdicted area, a request you decide respect given the circumstances. Not a minute after your arrival, the cultist look at you and Kara before retiring inside the the abandoned building, the captain then after remaining still in place for a few seconds, order the guards to fall back and return to their post<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere you came from a captain would have never let a person that led a small legion of soldiers in the middle of the city leave with just a talk, your instinct tell you that something is really, really wrong with the captain, no doubt the job master and the city governor will think the same<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guards, some of them evidently disgruntled but still obedient, composedly leave the area, Kara growl in what seems to be frustration<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incompetent fools, why they let him go so easily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer line of thoughts seems to share yours, about the captain at least \"I don't know, i may be new in this city but this is the first time i see a captain talked down with barely any scuffle at all, i find it, strange\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara reply amused \"Any scuffle? Anything interesting about guard captains and duty you wish to share with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not really. The last and only time you have been unjustly accused of witchcraft and collusion with spirits you never even heard about only because you are a Lunarion, the captain and it's small group of guards had to first and foremost remember who they was and what they was doing there, then when you calmly left the small village, you could still hear their blasphemies about cursed weaponry echo in the small valley en route to your next contract<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was never been happier to have both mind influencing, and small curses spell in your arsenal. Now that was a fond memory \"No, nothing relevant\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara doesn't seems to believe you, maybe due to the grin still plastered on your lips \"You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo is what you want to say, but really, what would be the fun in that? \"Nope, nothing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back to the city is blessedly short, you don't want to hang around Kara more then necessary, less she find a way to get what she wants. As you both reach the entrance gate you hastily leave you single minded ^friend^ and depart alone for the job master place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind, or perhaps your conscience, keep reminding you on how sad Kara looked upon your departure from her company for the whole walk, and every time you remind your conscience to shut it, you know that she was just acting, or at least you strongly believe so. When the job board at the side of the building finally become visible, you are finally able to completely suppress your non existent guilt and push yourself forward at the thoughts of the money you are finally going to collect the fruit of your labor, or at least the 25% of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving to give credits where is due it's hard sometimes, after all with your agreement with Nariza both you and Kara get only the 50% of the reward, and of course 25% of it go to your far too friendly dragoness, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, no way you count what Kara has done as a favor, you never asked for her help even if she gave it, so you rightfully give her half what you are getting for the job, or at least leave it here on her name for when she will undoubtedly come for whatever reason. But that's it, nothing more, hopefully that whatever is not trying to contact you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the door of the job master completely undeterred you rapidly knock at his door, the answer come as a red dragon in it's reduced form open the door for you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell you expected something more from him, it, his whatever, something like a stream of fire or...nah, you are still too conditioned from your past experience you remind yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was looking for the job master, i have important information regarding the incident at the arena\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you don't even bother asking what a dragon is doing in the job master office, with how your day has gone so far, little care for such meaningless details remain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of the job master is clearly audible being the reduced dragon \"Do come in Aranos, i was waiting for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he now? Curious, maybe he suspect or even already know most of the information gained from your last endeavor. The dragon step aside and let you in closing the door behind you with a boom, they should really tweak that sound enchantment spell<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first time you was here the rune on the floor pulse gently before letting you pass. The job master seems nervous about something, and you probably know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard of your return Aranos, i confide you have news about\" he pause for a moment \"this mess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod \"Yes, a black dragoness named Karat-Karasomething, will come here shortly with the coffer, we didn't opened it of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nod, a small smile return to his stressed face \"Ah yes, Karathiana. I know her, she worked for us in the past and she always proved herself reliable, if a little single minded sometimes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe don't say \"Well yes, it's definitely her. Half my reward go to her, the other 50% go to a dragoness named Nazira, a blue one, she too seems to be quite single minded if you ask me, i instead bring information on who in behind all of this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job muster chuckle \"For one that didn't wanted to have anything to do with dragons, you keep quite the company\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep chuckle remind you of the presence of the red one still at the door. You shrug \"What can i say, i have a magnetic personality; sometimes you pick your battles, sometimes they pick you. I couldn't really choose at the time. Now to business, ehm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make sign of a pen writing and the job master understand what you mean, he take out the contract and begin to count the money he owe you, or better say the city owe you  \"It was the cult of rage that stoled the coffer, the order was given by a certain Razim\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job master eyes widen for a moment as the money he was counting fall from his hands, he recover his composure quickly but it's too late to feign ignorance at this point, you continue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know why The Father of the Cult of Rage stole specifically that coffer, as i had not opened it, but i do know it was a trap for the same man your guard captain was sent to arrest for the damage at the arena and the subsequent chaos derived from it. Do please give the rest of the money to the one i mentioned earlier, i believe they will come soon, for a reason or another\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job master steal a glance at the dragon at the door, you heard him walking at your side, then the Job master nervously ask \"How much do you know about the cults, Aranos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like his tone, nor the closeness of the red one \"Not much, enough to not get involved but really, i only know that the cults are ancient and that they was somewhat responsible for the fall of the old empires, their cultist are fiercely loyal but that probably because their mind is practically rewritten, or at least the one considered less useful are, but little else\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job master sigh \"Do you want me to being honest with you, Aranos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, knowing mean blamable, you wish to remain blissfully ignorant about anything that doesn't regard you directly or your job \"I rather not, i do not have the habits of involving myself with local politics, and frankly neither should you. If the cultist bother you, erase them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragon nod eagerly and speak heatedly  \"My thoughts exactly, we already know some citizen are actively supporting a cult, we should make an example of them, no one should think even for a moment that compromising the security of this city is a viable option\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job master sign to him to calm down \"We will intervene at the right moment ambassador, i somewhat agree with both of you but what we need here is tactfulness not strength. At the right moment we will strike swiftly and decisively\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon sbuff \"I hope so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the desk and see all the money counted and ready for taking, must have been distracted by their talking for not have noticed it sooner. You reach for the self-sustaining pen, that magically take the exact quantity ink from a near bottle of ink, and sign under the contract name, a standard procedure you repeated every time a job like this is completed, then take the money in your now pleasantly heavier purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get up the dragon speak with amusement evident in hir tone \"Aranos if i may, i know that adventuring may give you...interesting experiences, but walking around the city smelling like an aroused female may not being in your best interest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you remember Kara advances, the job master laugh \"Also Aranos, do remember that red dragon are hermaphrodite, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red one playfully use hir tail to touch your groin as he turn around and keep hir appendage hight to show you the lips hidden beneath. Despite knowing that shi was joking, or at least you hope so, you quickly abandon the place and walk at a brisk peace toward the inn, a shower never seemed more necessary right now</span></div></div>",

But...oh that stupid stupid dragon! What the heck she was thinking?! If the cultist get to know of our involvement they will...react..accordingly; you sbuff in anger, she want them to come out in the open, or at least their affiliate, so she can track them down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at the innkeeper, feigning sheepishness  \"Thanks for the warning,\" my tone then become harder, far more sincere \"I'll make sure it won't happen again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innkeeper nod as i walk up the stairs and quickly reach my designated room, and the first thing you do once inside is looking for your 'tools', among them lie a small scroll of concentration, a decently common piece of paper with a few malleable rune meant to help the user focus on their tasks, it's also a good stress reliever to a point, as the runes always help you visualizing exactly what you want to see, shifting and twisting in your mind eye as the ink seemingly stretch effortlessly to help you concentrate channeling your energy a little easier; normally you won't need such simple artifact to achieve any manner of the minimum conscious focus required for a low level conjuration spell, but this particular design can prove very difficult to keep focused on, especially if you want to make a decent ward worth the paper is incised upon against the cultist magic, in particular the perverted mind/body altering abomination they have the gall to call runes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you originally thought, dragons are proving themselves quite the nuisance for you, just as petty and proud as the common people would believe and maybe, as annoying. Your hands move expertly on the scroll as the incision finally begin to make sense magic wise, even in it's incomplete status the rune already began to absorb and redirect loose energies present in this room, the flow slowly taking shape and with it the common feeling every protection rune you have ever made, of being somewhat painlessly run through by a strain of energy as the 'magic' begin to take notice of your request<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany possible scenarios about the cultist and their possible connection in this city are attempting to emerge from the apparently calm surface that are your thoughts, such distraction can prove disastrous when focusing magic as you are doing, but thankfully the scroll of concentration already prepared beforehand manage to help you cull away all distractions, you know that you will have to deal with these thoughts later, but it's admittedly strangely refreshing being able to easily push away such distraction for the moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActively focusing again on your work manage to take away any stray thoughts or images not regarding your current task. The intricate design is nearly complete in record time after nearly yourself in your talent, but just as you move your hand to put the finishing touch on the ward, a stray image of Kara forcefully attempting to mate with you manage to slip in your consciousness, years of practice plus the concentration scroll permit you to easily swat off the distraction as if it was a mere fly, but the part of your brain wanting you to take notice of such possibility already succeeded in forcing you to at least consider such an event. Personally you don't think Kara will actually try to force herself on you, but you have little doubts she will try any and all the trick she know to make you at least consider the idea, a task she apparently already managed to partially achieve<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment or two you hesitate to complete the ward, in your experience this design will be more then enough to protect you from the cultist twisted magic, but what about Kara, what about dragons in general? Surely they seems much more civil then you would have expected, but then again, having never met one in person and having heard only voices about their abilities or aspects, can you really say that your expectations where wrong? Most of the most common speculations you and, probably most human have ever made on dragons, are coming directly or indirectly, from dragon slayers or the rare merchant that manage to strike a deal with them, and usually the merchant is quite reluctant to speak about his/her experience on the matter, you suspect that part of the deal does involve a measure of secrecy about their dealings, both for the material or service provided and, the customer details<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact outside this curious valley and surrounding territories, this is the only place you found where dragons and sometimes, other magical creature are not attacked on sight; not always for justified reasons, but nonetheless dragons usually managed to give a mostly bad impression on pretty much anything capable of logical reasoning with both their attitude and their sometimes far too 'direct' approach to problems, often involving things humans and many know magical creatures alike find unacceptable at least, so the distrust if not the hate, are at least understandable<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou half shake you head for a moment as to chase away all and any other possible distractions, instead you decide to be practical and fair, going with the little informations you manage to acquire till now, and what your instinct tell you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick mental review of all the interaction you had with dragons so far, indicate that at least part of the rumors about dragons are true, and that Kara has her own agenda to fulfill, and that unfortunately it involves you among the other things<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther images of possible future events are trying to surface, but you willfully push them down, they are of no consequences anyway, you already decided<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppealing to all your skill and knowledge of wards, you manage to slowly and carefully modify the rune, it's no easy task and in most cases you would have to start all over again, but being this particular design being somewhat flexible, and that the ward you have in mind can work even based on a generic energy pattern, you manage to create a rune that should work not only against the perverted cultist magic, but also against any mental or physical trick Kara or any other dragon may have in store for you; you nearly sigh as you remind yourself that this is not a race specific ward, as such it won't be affective against a direct physical attack nor it will weaken a dragon just by being close to it, but it will protect you against what you think may be used against you in a close possible future, and that will be enough<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finally completed your task after hours of tedious, methodical work you can finally relax, letting the typical feeling of easiness coming when concluding any kind of beneficial magical ritual seep in your brain, a way to release all the stress it take on the will by using magic you wager, and quickly decide that your next stop will be the smith, where you will be able to choose both the metal and the shape more adequate for your rune, maybe if the local smith is skilled and knowledgeable enough you may even find a material that can increase the effectiveness of wards or protection magic in general, after all, it's a while since you used to have a protection amulet in direct contact with your skin, hopefully the trace of the ward will be subtle enough to pass unobserved, to Kara at least</span></div></div>",

He left the cult not because of differing beliefs but because he was sick of being ordered about when all he desires is freedom. He is a powerful warrior who fights with a weapon that is only wielded by the Leader of the Cult of Death (Aka-Father of Death) that is a double bladed scythe with a spear blade on top. This weapon is known as the Scythe of Death but Dorian calls it The Devourer due to its ability to harvest souls which are then devoured by its bearer to increase his strength. This weapon was originally a normal scythe before he became the Father of the Cult of Death.

I was not from the city but I\u2019d heard the rumors of how the city welcomed nearly all sentient life within its walls\u2026in the past I would have called it a perfect feeding ground but now it was just a place to hide from the All Father and his minions. I am the Father of Death though I\u2019ve abandoned my cult and its foolish members who followed orders like dogs.<br>\r\n\u201cSo where are you from?\u201d the farmer asked attempting to make small talk.<br>\r\nI sat there ignoring the man as I thought him of little value both in body and soul but the just kept talking in an attempt to pull me into a conversation.<br>\r\n\u201cWill you just shut up,\u201d I hissed, \u201cI\u2019m not here to bandy words with a fool.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m just trying to have a conversation,\u201d the farmer groused, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so rude.\u201d<br>\r\nI snorted an pulled my hood further up my head to hide my facial tattoos from the man as they signified that I was from the Cult of Death and I wasn\u2019t about to go broadcasting it around the world that I was a public enemy worth probably ten times my weight in gold. I hated dealing with the common folk as in my opinion they talked way too much, they were always touching one another, and no matter what you did they always became angry with you\u2026to say the least I\u2019m not a people person\u2026after all I\u2019ve been stuck as a twenty three year old man for more than a thousand years\u2026one of the many benefits of becoming a Father in one of the cults was that you didn\u2019t age anymore but the downside was that unless I died I would always be the Father of Death even though I abandoned the cult.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting weapon you\u2019ve got there,\u201d the farmer commented still trying to start a conversation, \u201cWhere\u2019d you get it.\u201d<br>\r\nI adjusted my weapon which was about eight feet long with a crescent on top with the tips pointed downwards and a foot long spear head on top of it, the crescent blade was about four feet long, and on the other end of the weapon was a small ten sided cube on the bottom to act as a club if need be.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had it,\u201d I sighed fed up with this farmer; \u201cNow I\u2019ve a question for you\u2026will you die if you don\u2019t have anyone talk to?\u201d<br>\r\nThis shut the farmer up allowing me to focus on what I was going to do when we finally reached if the farmer kept irritating my I might eat his soul though it would probably be nothing but farming knowledge I would gain from it. We were supposed to meet up with a merchant caravan somewhere down the road but something was wrong as we should have met other caravans meeting up with us at this point\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cMy great giddy aunt,\u201d the farmer whispered utter fear in his voice, \u201cWhat the hell happened here.\u201d<br>\r\nI climbed out of the wagon and proceed to walk around it and saw what had caused the farmers distress. The clearing where we were supposed to meet the merchants was now a charred mass of bodies and ruined wagons. Someone or something had attacked them and stolen their goods revealing that it at least had some sentience and that it or they could be dangerous.<br>\r\n\u201cWait here,\u201d I warned the farmer the excitement of the hunt dripping from my voice, \u201cI will clear the area of all hostiles.\u201d<br>\r\nHe nodded but the real reason was that I simply hungered for souls right now and I couldn\u2019t harvest the farmer as he was too important at the moment. I had my weapon raised in front of me the scythe blades horizontal and the spear tip pointing straight ahead of me. I would give no quarter in this battle and devour any who dare opposed me. I stepped into the wastes hearing my steel boots crunch both charred wood and bone not caring whether it had once been a living being as all who could not save themselves were dead wait and meant to be devoured by those stronger than them\u2026it was natures law. I could hear the sound of the enemy approaching drawn to my presence like moths to a flame and the results of this foolish action would end just the same. As they appeared at the opposite edge of the clearing I noted that they were all humans and soon they would be nothing more than a snack. As they closed in on me I saw that they were nothing more than common bandits.<br>\r\n\u201cSurrender all yer valuables or we\u2019ll stick ya,\u201d the lead bandit snarled.<br>\r\n\u201cYou shall regret attacking me mortal,\u201d I hissed, my golden eyes glowing from under my hood, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry you won\u2019t have long to regret your descion.\u201d<br>\r\nI charged at them cleaving through the first three in my first swing shocking their companions as their bodies disappeared only to reform into a single glowing wisp but I didn\u2019t give them time to even think as I turned towards the remain six with a bloodthirsty smile on my face and again I charged ripping through four of them as the last two turned to flee from me. I jumped skyward and while in midair I flipped positioning myself between them and their targeted escape route.<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re leaving so soon,\u201d I taunted, \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d stay for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill us,\u201d one of the bandits whined falling to his knees, \u201cPlease show mercy!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Mercy\u2026ha\u2026haha\u2026hahahahahaha!\u201d I burst out laughing, \u201cYou killed all these people and you expect mercy\u2026Mercy has no place in this world.\u201d<br>\r\nI ripped through both of them with my weapon and as they turned into wisps I smiled at this\u2026though they wouldn\u2019t provide much strength or knowledge to me but I hungered to devour souls\u2026any soul. I gazed as the three wisps moved towards each other until they merged into a single blue wisp whose center was the size of an apple. I reached out my clawed hand to take it and when I did I devoured it in a single gulp. I gained little knowledge or skills of note but the boost it gave to my energy and knowledge of my surroundings was well worth the troubles. I walked back to the farmer who was still sitting in the wagon and before he could ask any more questions I motioned him forward while climbing back into the wagon. The steady rumble of the wagon continuing on it way as storm clouds began to roll in the sound of distant thunder accompanying them and soon after this the rain began pouring drenching the poor farmer but thankfully we were approaching the gates to the city of Kronos. We were stopped by the gate guard but with a wave of my hand I\u2019d manipulated their minds to let me through. As the wagon trundled through the gate I crawled out silently and let it continue on without me as I had not promised the farmer anything so I saw no reason to stay. I walked through the streets with my weapon on my back looking for a place to stay the night while attempting to control my hunger for souls. I\u2019d found an inn called the Drunken Elf which I found slightly funny as one of the last things you\u2019d ever see was a drunken elf but the urge to hunt and feast was great but that would be one of the greatest mistakes I\u2019ve ever made in my life. Staying at the inn would allow me to search for a job or a good fight to lessen my thirst for the hunt\u2026I need to decide what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote-There are three alignments in this characters story path Demonic (Evil)/Death (Neutral)/Reaper (Good)<br>\r\nThese stats will appear at the start of chapters based on current alignment and on choices to tell where the alignment will shift. <br>\r\nDemonic alignment will cause increased physical abilities and enhances the effects of Lost Soul but causes degradation of his mind and sanity/Death is the normal status with no positives or negatives/Reaper alignment enhances mental, magical, and physical capabilities but lowers the power of Lost Soul and other dark magicks/skills. The further you are along a path the greater the effects on the character.<br>\r\n(I would like to request of this author to be allowed to reserve a story path for this character for myself by marking it as I do in the choices\u2026if you agree or disagree please message me.)</span></div></div>",

I sat a table in the corner as a group of barbaric warriors stood shouting and cheering drunkenly and making a complete spectacle of themselves. As I stood there shaking my head a human barmaid approached me and to say she was gorgeous was an understatement but that wouldn\u2019t affect me as I\u2019ve been emotionally dead for the last five hundred years.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you around here before,\u201d She gushed, \u201cYou must be new here\u2026what can I get you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGet me a glass of water and I\u2019d like to rent a room for the night,\u201d I sighed already feeling annoyed.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026can I get you anything else?\u201d She inquired smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I answered dryly.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she continued to bother me.<br>\r\n\u201cYes I\u2019m sure,\u201d I hissed losing my cool, \u201cNow very well get me what I asked for or don\u2019t and leave me the hell alone!\u201d<br>\r\nThis must have shocked her because she ran off tears running down her face\u2026and I couldn\u2019t have cared less if I tried. I was tired, hungry, and soaked from the storm raging outside\u2026I hated this time of year in this land because it was nearly always raining. I heard the floorboards behind me creak causing me to turn around and come face to face with a blue dragoness in her humanoid form wearing scarred black leather armor\u2026she was glaring at me.<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be more polite to people,\u201d she hissed at me, \u201cor bad things you can\u2019t even imagine will happen to you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHumor me,\u201d I hissed back, \u201cbecause I can imagine a lot of horrible things.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tear you apart for starters,\u201d she threatened, \u201cI won\u2019t let you insult my friends.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019ve seen much scarier creatures than you,\u201d I yawned causing her to lunge at me but I grabbed her wrist and twisting it and causing it to dislocate, \u201cI see an overgrown lizard needs to be taught a lesson.\u201d<br>\r\nI whipped her through a window shattering it and drawing the attention of everyone else.<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d the barmaid from before shrieked, \u201cHe\u2019s overpowered Nariza!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay for the damages,\u201d I hissed at the owner as I jumped out the broken into the raining soaked street.<br>\r\nThe dragoness was on her hands and knees\u2019 gasping for air as a shard of glass was emerging from her side. She pulled the shard from her body brutally the blood pooling on the street before the wound closed up. She rose to her feet glaring at me with bloodlust in her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cI was looking for a good fight,\u201d I laughed a sadistic gleam in my eyes, \u201cand it looks like I\u2019ve found one.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she hissed at me.<br>\r\n\u201cI mean that I\u2019ve come here to prove I\u2019m the strongest being in the world,\u201d I hissed an insane grin on my face, \u201cI mean to free myself from the chains that hold me back.\u201d<br>\r\nWith those words I lunged at her my weapon out stretched to run her through but she evaded to the left seeking to rake her claws across my hooded face but I blocked with one of my gauntleted fists and struck again slicing her back open as she was too slow to evade the attack fully but still dodged the brunt of the attack. She launched an arrow made of magic at me but I simply knocked it out of the air but that was a mistake as she had closed the distance and reached towards my face her claws hooking under my hood as she lunged and ripping it clean off of the robes revealing my facial tattoos.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a damned cultist,\u201d She hissed jumping back.<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not a cultist,\u201d I sighed feeling older than I\u2019ve ever felt, \u201cI\u2019m a man whose seeking freedom\u2026is that so wrong?\u201d<br>\r\nShe was silent as she stood there just staring at me as if what I said was impossible but she didn\u2019t have long to contemplate what I said as we were interrupted.<br>\r\n\u201cHow sweet,\u201d a sultry female voice behind us snickered, \u201cI\u2019d thought they were kidding when they said you were attempting to leave the cult.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMira,\u201d I snarled turning to see a scantily clad voluptuous woman with an eye tattoo on her forehead, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought they\u2019d send the head priestess of Lust to apprehend me\u2026after all I\u2019ve not expressed interest in anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve not been sent to collect you,\u201d She sighed sadly, \u201cI\u2019ve been sent to collect the dragoness\u2026though I wouldn\u2019t mind collecting you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you take her,\u201d I laughed, \u201cI\u2019ve sought an opponent worth fighting and now that I\u2019ve found one I won\u2019t let you take her\u2026and besides it damages the All Father\u2019s plan.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that I charged the priestess and lashed out with a brutal series of slashes which she easily dodged and counterattacked with a chain whip she had been hiding\u2026I don\u2019t know where so don\u2019t ask\u2026I barely dodged the main attack but she had somehow managed to wrap the weapon around my leg and proceeded to bash me into walls and the force of the blow jarred me causing me to lose focus. As I fell to the ground I went limp as I lost the will to continue on with the fight her magicks weakening me severely.<br>\r\n\u201cAwww is my new plaything broken already,\u201d she whined, \u201cOh well\u2026at least I\u2019ll have the dragoness to play with.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d Nariza snarled.<br>\r\n\u201cYou hold the key to a thousand year old secret,\u201d Mira answered calmly approaching her while working her magic causing the dragoness\u2019s slit to moisten, \u201cand I\u2019m to claim it from you by any means necessary.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d the dragoness moaned as Mira approached her and began stroking her slit.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to interrogate you,\u201d Mira whispered seductively inserting a finger into the dragoness slit causing her to moan, \u201cNow tell me what I want to know and I\u2019ll make you feel so good.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026ah\u2026n-no\u2026I won\u2019t\u2026h-h-help you!\u201d Nariza yelled trying to resist the woman, \u201cI won\u2019t divulge his secret\u2026he-ah-trusted me\u2026and I won\u2019t-ah-betray that trust.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you so sure?\u201d Mira asked smiling inserting more fingers causing Nariza to roar in orgasm.<br>\r\nI was now regaining my strength quickly as non-cultist magic cast on cultists by other cultists was severely weakened while cultist magic cast on cultist by cultist will be completely nullified as cultists are immune to cultist magicks and abilities. I was back on my feet and now I was angry\u2026I would not be toyed with\u2026and besides I\u2019ve always hated the sisters of the lust cult due to their actions\u2026and I would not let such a worthy opponent fall to such cheap tactics. I charged at Mira knocking her out of the way and launching her into the side of a building.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re stronger than I suspected,\u201d Mira snarled peeling herself off the wall.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d I asked the dragoness who was laying on the ground in a compromising position the lower part of her leather armor flipped up revealing her slit\u2026I was starting to blush so I turned away.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked sitting up, \u201cI can\u2019t remember what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou were under the influence of this whore,\u201d I snarled raising my weapon, \u201cbut don\u2019t feel bad as this whore can warp even the strongest minds to do her bidding.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait she-,\u201d Nariza shouted covering herself in a panic, \u201cI\u2019ll kill her for defiling me!\u201d<br>\r\nI was already moving to attack her but she dodged right and to dodge left avoiding her counter attack as well as leaving her open to mine. I lashed out with my spear completely severing her right arm which was holding the whip.<br>\r\n\u201cYou bastard!\u201d she screamed covering the stump that was all left of her arm.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re finished now,\u201d I taunted with sadistic glee, \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to send what\u2019s left of you back to your sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo I won\u2019t die here,\u201d she screamed launching a powerful magical attack at Nariza and for some reason I jumped in front of her and took the attack myself which was more brutal than even I could imagine\u2026and I fell silent knocked unconscious by the brutal attack\u2026I floated through the darkness not knowing where I was until I knew nothing and faded into the darkest depths of my mind.</span></div></div>",

I saw that the blue dragoness from last night was sleeping in a chair next to my bed looking quite serene after last night\u2019s events. I attempted to get up without waking her but I failed horribly.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d she inquired smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you here\u2026and where is here?\u201d I questioned right back.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re at the inn,\u201d she answered smiling, \u201cand as to the why\u2026you saved my life so I owe you a debt\u2026and I will see it repaid.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d I sighed not sure what was going on.<br>\r\n\u201cI have some suggestions for what you should do,\u201d she offered, \u201cyou said you were looking for a good fight well you could take a shot at the stadium or you could try and complete some jobs on the job board.\u201d<br>\r\nBoth options seemed pretty self-explanatory. So what should I do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We were now walking down the street where people were staring in awe at the damage our battle last night caused. We approached the stadium which was a giant stone structure that reminded me of the coliseums of old where I would fight to spread the words of the All-Father on the edge of my blade.<br>\r\n\u201cSo explain to me the rules of this\u2026completion,\u201d I told her my armor clinking softly.<br>\r\nI was wearing my combat armor which was purple feudal knight\u2019s armor with a purple steel sallet helm hiding the upper part of my face.<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re seeking to enter the highest level of the tournament which means you\u2019ll have greater rewards such as money, items, and\u2026other things.\u201d She stated shyly.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat other things?\u201d I asked curiously.<br>\r\n\u201cWell the winner gets to\u2026have their way with the loser,\u201d She sighed blushing slightly.<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter I don\u2019t plan on losing,\u201d I snarled, \u201cbut what about killings\u2026can people die?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026but there is magic that tries to reduce this,\u201d she answered, \u201cIt won\u2019t stop it if the attack is potent enough to breach the wards but otherwise no one should die outright.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYippee,\u201d I laughed, \u201cI\u2019m guessing though that there\u2019s still pain though.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she told me.<br>\r\nWe continued bantering as we walked through the archway into the coliseum. I looked around to see multiple species wandering around the area not all of them the usual one you\u2019d see. There were goblins, orcs, trolls, humans, griffons, dragons, dwarves, elves, and other creatures just wandering around.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go sign you up\u2026,\u201d Nariza told me as she took off towards the stone desk.<br>\r\nI began wandering around and eventually found myself on the upper level of the stadium gazing out on a the field I noticed that the stands only extended about \u00be\u2019s around while the point I was at was just a sheer drop allowing me an unobstructed view of the current battle between a troll and five humans\u2026the humans weren\u2019t doing well. The troll was using its superior size and strength to smash the humans who\u2019s weapons and spells simply bounced off its thick hid.<br>\r\n\u201cThe humans don\u2019t stand a chance,\u201d I hissed as I heard Nariza approach me from behind.<br>\r\n\u201cI can concur,\u201d she sighed, \u201cThat\u2019s Thorgim\u2026he\u2019s won two hundred battles straight without one loss.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind destroying that record,\u201d I smirked, \u201cOh and you may want to move back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy-,\u201d she began before she was cut off by an explosion ripping the area in front of us clean off and leaving a gaping hole\u2026the troll had won and one of the humans lay in a crumpled heap before me.<br>\r\n\u201cIs there any who will challenge me!?\u201d the troll named Thorgim roared, \u201cor are you all cowards.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the reward for his defeat?\u201d I inquired grinning.<br>\r\n\u201cFifty thousand gold,\u201d she answered looking worried, \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking about fighting him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe needs to be put in his place,\u201d I laughed stepping towards the edge, \u201cand I could use a workout before the main event.\u201d<br>\r\nI drew my weapon and jumped through the hole and plummeted to the ground drawing gasps from the crowd and the attention of the troll. I hit the ground throwing up a cloud of dust but when it dispersed I was standing with my weapon resting on my shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you wish to fight me little human,\u201d the troll snarled, \u201cwhere\u2019s the rest of your team!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a team to eliminate you,\u201d I hissed lifting my weapon so the tip pointed straight at the troll. \u201cYou shall learn your place human!\u201d the troll roared charging me with a frenzied rush.<br>\r\nI simply sidestepped the attack and countered with a simple thrust of my weapon which pierced the troll\u2019s skin as if it was paper. As blood oozed from the wound the troll whirled around and swung wildly but I easily evaded that attack. I thrust at the troll with my weapon again and was rewarded by the scream of pain from my opponent. I struck again piercing its leg and bringing it easily to a knee.<br>\r\n\u201cSurrender!\u201d I snarled.<br>\r\n\u201cNever will I surrender to a puny human,\u201d Thorgim roared getting to his feet and swinging at me with his club.<br>\r\nI dodged his inaccurate attack, I jumped over him flipping, while I was in the air, I struck with a powerful swing\u2026impaling him on a curved blade of my weapon. I pulled him over me with a massive amount of strength and slammed him into the ground causing the ground under us to shatter. My weapon remained impaled in the troll\u2019s unmoving body. I walked over and ripped my weapon from my opponent not caring about the extra damage I did\u2026the blood flowed freely from his wounds showing he was still alive but for how long I did not know as his injuries were grave. The crowd was silent in their utter disbelief of how easily I defeated Thorgim who had never come close to defeat in his two hundred matches. Slowly but with the force of a coming tidal wave the crowd broke into cheers and shouts\u2026I just stood there one hand on my neck as I cracked it. I didn\u2019t care about their pathetic cheers\u2026all I wanted was a good fight and this one had been a great disappointment to me. I strode through the doors leading out of the arena\u2026most of the other fighters parted ways before me in both fear and awe but one didn\u2019t\u2026he wore a white set of robes and gripped in his hands were a set of hand-axes that looked old but well cared for. I paid him no attention but I made a mental note to look into this strange man. I reentered the atrium to find Nariza standing there waiting for me. I approached her to find that she was standing there smiling at me the excitement evident in her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a battle handled like that in a thousand years,\u201d She cheered happily, \u201cI\u2019ve only seen a fighter like you once before.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m personally dissatisfied with that battle,\u201d I sighed sadly, \u201cI was expecting more from such a hyped opponent.\u201d<br>\r\nI heard footsteps approaching us so I turned to see someone in a set of extravagant robes with a piece of paper clutched in his hand.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are Master Locke correct?\u201d he asked not waiting for an answer, \u201cThis is your battle ticket and the card registering your winnings with the local bank.\u201d<br>\r\nHe quickly shoved the objects into my hands and almost sprinted away. I turned towards Nariza to ask her what was the man\u2019s problem but she was already explaining.<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of you,\u201d she told me, \u201cYou brutalized one of the strongest fighters here without a single scratch.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHmph,\u201d I snorted, \u201cwhere is my money?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was deposited into a bank account for you,\u201d she answered, \u201cI took the liberty of opening one for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I told her honestly, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought of that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u201d she laughed, \u201cWe should head back to the Inn so we can rest up for tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d I told her as we turned towards the doors and walked out neither of us realizing that there was a pair of eyes on us.<br>\r\n-Perspective Switch Mira-<br>\r\nI stood there watching them walk away and I felt jealousy well within me. How can he even stand her\u2026she wasn\u2019t as beautiful as me\u2026nor was she as skilled a fighter\u2026there had to be something else driving him to stand with her.<br>\r\n\u201cPining for an unrequited love,\u201d Razim taunted from behind me.<br>\r\n\u201cShut up,\u201d I hissed at him.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go do our job,\u201d he snarled, \u201cAfter all we were sent here to kill him.\u201d<br>\r\nI panicked\u2026I couldn\u2019t let him die\u2026he just had to come back to the All-Father\u2019s side\u2026I thought quickly and the idea hit me.<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s extremely powerful,\u201d I told Razim, \u201cWe should hire some mercenaries to weaken him first.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d Razim scowled storming off.<br>\r\nHe would survive for now\u2026I knew that he had to come back to us\u2026or the All-Father would kill him\u2026I couldn\u2019t let that happen\u2026ever.<br>\r\n-Dorian\u2019s Perspective-<br>\r\nI had arrived at the inn with Nariza right behind me\u2026except this time we had separate rooms\u2026I walked up to the stairs where my room was located and as I approached my door I turned towards Nariza.<br>\r\n\u201cGood night,\u201d I told her as I stepped through my door.<br>\r\nFor some reason I felt extremely comfortable around her\u2026and when I talked to her what she said was so familiar to me it was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2026though I know I\u2019ve never met her\u2026I was sure of that.

As I sat at my table the barmaid from my first night here came walking towards me cautiously\u2026but that quickly faded as she returned to her normally chirpy self.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you going to have to drink?\u201d she inquired smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cA glass of water,\u201d I yawned.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you only order water?\u201d she sighed.<br>\r\n\u201cNone of your damn business,\u201d I hissed sourly, \u201cbut tell me where is Nariza?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe went to find you two a job,\u201d She told me, \u201cShe told me to tell you she\u2019d be back in an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d I sighed, \u201cIf she\u2019s not going to be back in a while I\u2019d like some scrambled eggs and toast for breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh and how are you going to be paying for this then?\u201d she inquired angrily.<br>\r\n\u201cPut it on my tab,\u201d I yawned.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat tab,\u201d she hissed, \u201cYou need money to open a tab!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve money from my victory against Thorgim,\u201d I hissed agitated, \u201cSo go and get me my food\u2026or leave me to my thoughts.\u201d<br>\r\nShe stormed off as I just sat there sipping my water awaiting Nariza or my food whichever came first. I was rethinking what I\u2019d done in the last thousand years\u2026it\u2019s quite difficult to organize so many memories\u2026and not all of them are mine. Whenever I devoured another\u2019s soul I also gained their memories but the ability had a down side\u2026if I devoured too many I would lose myself forever to madness. I would never let that happen no matter how much chaos and death I caused I swore I would never succumb to madness. I was sitting at the table lost in thought as the barmaid brought me my breakfast and quickly stormed off. I ravenously began devouring my food\u2026almost as if I hadn\u2019t eaten in days\u2026I was pretty sure I hadn\u2019t eaten in days with what was going on. Within minutes I had wolfed down and sat there with a toothpick in my mouth savoring the feeling of a having just eaten a nice hot meal. I stood up and walked to the bar area where I told the bartender to tell Nariza that I was going to the coliseum. I walked out into the street my armor glistening in the sunlight and as I walked down it I drew stares and whispers from the people doing their shopping or just loitering.<br>\r\n\u201cThis city is utterly disorganized,\u201d I muttered under my breath.<br>\r\nI had seen many other cities in my long life and most of them had market days once a week for people to purchase non-essential items\u2026but this city seemed to have stalls set up haphazardly. I continued down the street and to my surprise the people parted in\u2026fear\u2026they were afraid of me\u2026I could see it in their movements and how they wouldn\u2019t make eye content with me. I felt a small smile creep across my face\u2026in the words of a famous scholar it was better to be feared than to be loved. I was approaching the coliseum when I saw something strange\u2026two dragons walking into it in their natural forms\u2026and that intrigued me. I followed them into the coliseum and saw that they were arguing about something\u2026I approached as close as I dared\u2026I may have been powerful but I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to piss off two dragons arrogant enough to strut through the city in their natural forms\u2026at this range I heard only bits of their conversation\u2026the pieces I heard had to do with ingredients of some sort, something about a lover, a need for money, and about entering the battles. I followed them to the upper level which was a room with several people who seemed to be all novice fighters\u2026I walked towards the edge so I could see who was fighting but also eavesdrop on the dragon\u2019s conversation. The fight was between a blue dragoness and eight griffons that were using their superior numbers extremely poorly\u2026they were presenting a unified front directly in front of her\u2026and they were being quickly picked off for their stupidity. I was still picking up bits and pieces of the dragon\u2019s conversations which allowed me to learn that they were attempting to enter the battles\u2026I shifted my attention back to the battle to see the four remaining griffons now working in tangent to surround the dragoness and being to attack her from all sides.<br>\r\n\u201cFinally they show some strategy,\u201d I hissed under my breath already having picked apart their formation in my head...I was a terror on the battlefield.<br>\r\nThe dragoness now made the mistake to try and fly which removed her from her only safe zone\u2026the ground itself\u2026the griffons knew this and flipped her on her back greatly diminishing her threat\u2026and to my utter disgust the began raping her\u2026I think\u2026I wasn\u2019t sure if it was non-consensual. I heard the sound of padded feet behind me but I didn\u2019t bother turning\u2026I already knew who it was.<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were into this sort of thing,\u201d Nariza teased.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I answered blushing as the lead griffon penetrated the dragoness\u2019s slit while another forced his way into her mouth, \u201cWhy the hell is she allowing this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d Nariza sighed with a sad look in her eyes, \u201cSome just like the violation, some don\u2019t have the strength left to fight, and others are just too stupid to figure out a simple way to get out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she not fear being impregnated?\u201d I questioned confused and disgusted as the two griffons climaxed into her\u2026then the two who had not had their fun and went at it with her, \u201cThis is just disgraceful.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTo what have this happen to a person?\u201d Nariza the anger apparent in her voice.<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026it is disgraceful that she does not fight back\u2026that she does not resist,\u201d I snarled just as angry, \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that she doesn\u2019t use the abilities given to her to fight them off\u2026or at least burn them in\u2026sensitive places.\u201d<br>\r\nThe griffons were now leaving their fun over and having won the battle they just walked away arrogant grins all over their faces\u2026and I felt the rage boiling up within me\u2026I stormed over to official now free from the presence of the two other dragons but he was sorting papers and did not notice me\u2026so I struck the desk he was sitting behind causing him to jump.<br>\r\n\u201cYes can I help you?\u201d He inquired smiling slightly.<br>\r\n\u201cYes when would the fighters from the battle just now be ready to fight again?\u201d I asked him anger burning in my eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cBy tomorrow but neither group would even think of fighting against you,\u201d He told me, \u201cYour rank is too low.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to wager 50,000 gold on the battle,\u201d I snarled, \u201cand if even one of them beats me the money is theirs.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI could probably convince them to fight you,\u201d the man said his smile broadening, \u201cDo you have a preference of who you fight.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI want to fight the griffons,\u201d I snarled wishing to put them in their place.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay so one griffon,\u201d The man said.<br>\r\n\u201cNo I want all eight griffons,\u201d I snarled turning and walking away.<br>\r\nNariza was following me closely but did not say anything until we exited the coliseum which is when she turned to me.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve information on a job for us,\u201d She said smiling, \u201cIt\u2019s not worth a lot but it should win you some points with a very important person.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the mission?\u201d I inquired my mood soured by what I just heard.<br>\r\n\u201cWell there\u2019s a black chest that the employer is wants reacquired from a group of five trolls that stole it,\u201d She answered me, \u201cand then there\u2019s a bonus if we can figure out why they stole it and kill all five trolls.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSounds easy enough,\u201d I chuckled looking skyward, \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a free contract,\u201d She sighed, \u201cWhich means will be competing with other\u2019s to try and acquire the chest.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGoody,\u201d I chuckled to myself, \u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d<br>\r\nWe set out for the area of the objective but were quite confident that we could easily acquire what the employer sought\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As we moved through the underbrush I noticed that the area around me was already trampled by the footfalls of two others if I was any judge.<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like someone already entered the area,\u201d I warned her with a grin.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I told her motioning up the trees, \u201cWe climb now.\u201d<br>\r\nI shot up the tree in a blink and Nariza was quickly following me up the tree. We quickly but silently moved from branch to branch not drawing any attention\u2026not even from the creatures who lived in the forest. We were approaching a cave set in the cliff face when I saw a man and a black dragoness in her humanoid form arguing about something\u2026and I knew near instantly that they\u2019re also after the bounty due to their arguing about how to attack the trolls\u2026I saw only two guarding the entrance. I motioned to Nariza to attack\u2026she nodded and we both leapt down from the trees with me swinging my weapon with such force that I cut clean through the first troll\u2026I didn\u2019t even bother turning to face the second one as I knew that it would be a waste of time. I ran into the cave with Nariza right on my heals\u2026another troll appeared in front of me only to be pierced through the chest by my weapon\u2026its blood running freely down my armor as I ripped it from its chest. I continued on as Nariza slew the one that appeared to aid its comrade\u2026I ran into a large cave to find the last troll standing guard over a chest but it wasn\u2019t paying proper attention so I quickly slew it\u2026but I was still uneasy\u2026these weren\u2019t some random roving band of marauders but trained mercenaries\u2026I saw something gleaming in the dirt and blood and as I picked it up to examine it I realized that it was a medallion of rage\u2026a medallion only given to those serving the Cult of Rage\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cRazim,\u201d I hissed under my breath.<br>\r\n\u201cI see your senses haven\u2019t dulled over the years,\u201d a cruel voice laughed from the shadows.<br>\r\nI turned to see a man in blood red leather armor, dual wielding full size war double bladed war axes, and bristling with muscle\u2026Razim the Father of Rage.<br>\r\n\u201cI hired these mercenaries in the hope that would weaken you,\u201d Razim hissed crushing the head of the troll under his heel, \u201cBut it seems like a waste of money with how easily you dispatched them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNariza\u2026grab the chest,\u201d I barked at her, \u201cDon\u2019t bother ask questions just do it!\u201d<br>\r\nI brought my weapon up in a defensive posture while Nariza rushed in and grabbed the chest\u2026Razim ignored her completely but the apparent grin on his face confusing.<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true,\u201d He laughed cruelly, \u201cI guess fate is as fickle as they say.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?!\u201d I yelled confused.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to bother telling you,\u201d he shouted charging at me his axes scrapping the ground and sending up sparks, \u201cAfter all your about to die anyway!\u201d<br>\r\nHis axes collided with the my weapons handle but the force of the blow forced me back about five steps but before I could recover he was already attacking me again\u2026I could barely keep him back\u2026somehow I had to put myself on the offensive and that would prove difficult. His next attack came in at an odd angle that would have broken the defenses of any less experience fighter but it gave me the opening I needed to strike\u2026and I did block his attack and lashing out with haft of my weapon\u2026knocking him back and allowing me to begin an advance attack pattern that allowed me to inflict minor wounds to my enemy but his skill would not allow me to perform any grievous damage.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re as strong as ever Death,\u201d Razim commented, \u201cbut you should have never betrayed the All-Father.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever wondered why the All-Father fears me so?\u201d I asked smiling, \u201cIt\u2019s due to my genetic make-up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry what?\u201d Razim asked confused.<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot I\u2019m talking to an imbecile,\u201d I insulted attempting to draw him out, \u201cMy blood is that of the god slayer Kyoto\u2026which means I\u2019m capable of killing the All-Father!\u201d<br>\r\nWith I charged at my enemy and began attacking with pinpoint accuracy\u2026my attacks though minor were beginning to add up\u2026and slowly but surely Razim was losing strength.<br>\r\n\u201cMira what are you waiting for?!\u201d Razim shouted.<br>\r\nI felt fear flare in my chest as I felt a metal chain wrap around my ankle and throw me into the wall cracking it\u2026as well as injuring my back, smashing my head off of the wall, and causing me to drop my weapon. I stumbled forward the blood beginning to flow down my face but my helmet at least remained in place. I tried to maintain my footing but I clearly had a concussion so even staying conscious was difficult.<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve got something on your face,\u201d Razim taunted as Mira appeared next to him\u2026one opponent of their caliber was dangerous enough but two of them was a death wish\u2026good thing I am Death, \u201cHow\u2019s it feel to be helpless.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRazim that is your first mistake-gasp-thinking I\u2019m a normal person,\u201d I gasped my breathing ragged and broken, \u201cyour second mistake was allowing me the time to gather myself\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d Razim roared charging at me but it was too late.<br>\r\n\u201cYour third mistake was underestimating my song,\u201d I laughed as a terrible yet beautiful melody began echoing through the cave, \u201cWitness my Aria of Souls.\u201d<br>\r\nAs I felt my energy skyrocket I rushed at my two assailants and utterly decimated them\u2026but before I could deliver the finishing blow Razim opened a portal and jumped through. Leaving me alone\u2026and as my spell faded I passed out from my wounds\u2026<br>\r\n-six hours later-<br>\r\nI woke up within my room in the Inn but my head was bandaged and I felt extremely groggy. I began looking around when I saw Nariza and the other two from earlier\u2026I looked over to ask Nariza something but she cut me off.<br>\r\n\u201cLook before you go asking questions let me explain,\u201d She told me.<br>\r\nShe explained that these two had saved my life and explained that the dragoness\u2019s name is Karathiana and the humans name is Aranos\u2026they had found me in the cave battered and bruised and to make matters worse Karathiana knew I was a member of the Cult of Death but had agreed to not divulge it\u2026but they had brought me here to be healed and Nariza had agreed to split the reward fifty fifty\u2026I again lay down wondering what would happen to my fight tomorrow\u2026Nariza had already stated I was in no condition to fight  but if I backed out I would not be able to keep my money and I would be broke\u2026only time would tell.</span></div></div>",

I stood up shakily and looked around\u2026strangely the other two from the other day were standing there but Nariza was not present.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did Nariza promise you to save me?\u201d I inquired picking up my weapon.<br>\r\n\u201cShe promised us the name of the person behind the attack and why they did it,\u201d Karathiana hissed at me the dislike clearly evident in her voice.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you but you won\u2019t like it,\u201d I chuckled cruelly, \u201cThe beast behind this is named Razim\u2026the Father of the Cult of Rage\u2026and he set all this up to kill me in a surprise attack.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo wait are you saying that there\u2019s infighting among the cults?\u201d Aranos asked glaring at me.<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026the cults are still unified,\u201d I told him the confusion evident on their faces, \u201cI\u2019ve abandoned The All-Father and the cults\u2026to carve out my own place in history.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut aren\u2019t you a Cult Father?\u201d Karathiana asked still glaring at me.<br>\r\n\u201cI was\u2026but no more,\u201d I told them, \u201cAt least in my eyes\u2026but in the eyes of the cult when you become a Cult leader it\u2019s for life.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you be a cult father you\u2019re barely older than me,\u201d Aranos hissed at me.<br>\r\n\u201cMind your tone boy,\u201d I stated coldly, \u201cLooks can be deceiving\u2026I\u2019m actually over a thousand years old\u2026and I\u2019ll continue to live forever unless slain.\u201d<br>\r\nI turned and began walking out the door using my weapon to support myself but I stopped for a few seconds to offer a warning.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made a powerful enemy by helping me,\u201d I warned, \u201cand you would be wise to avoid engaging any Cult Fathers or Mothers\u2026they are far above you in power\u2026if you wish to see what I mean then come and watch my battle today and you shall see the power of even a wounded ex-Father can far out strip you.\u201d<br>\r\nI walked down the steps shocked at what I said\u2026the arrogance of what I said. I stepped down the stair only to bump into Nariza who seemed shocked that I was up.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing up?\u201d She snarled at me the worry evident in her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to my battle,\u201d I barked right back feeling a cold calm wash over me, \u201cand you\u2019ve no right to stop me\u2026I don\u2019t even know why follow me!\u201d<br>\r\nI then stormed down the stair fed up with everybody attempting to stop me from achieving my freedom\u2026why did they bother saving me if they hate me so much\u2026why did I put up with them\u2026especially her\u2026I could have sacrificed her on countless occasions to save myself\u2026yet I didn\u2019t\u2026why\u2026why would I spare her after a thousand years of death\u2026fate is fickle. I walked down the street towards the coliseum and as I walked up the stairs I saw an official come running down the stairs towards me an angry look on his face.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re late!\u201d He yelled at me.<br>\r\n\u201cGo to hell,\u201d I hissed back as I walked up the steps.<br>\r\nI entered the coliseum the coliseum to find it nearly deserted but the roar of the crowd was clearly heard throughout the stadium\u2026as was the commentator.<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like the challenger has refused to attend,\u201d The commentator commented causing the crowd to boo, \u201cI wonder what it feels like to be a coward?\u201d<br>\r\nI arrived at the gate leading to the arena highly annoyed by this fools comments so I simply blasted the gate out of the way with a burst of magic.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d The commentator shouted as I walked into the arena, \u201cI guess he decided to show up\u2026is he stupid though\u2026look at the condition he\u2019s in.\u201d<br>\r\nI walked into the arena to see the eight griffons lounging about and most of them seemed to be laughing at me.<br>\r\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve wasted enough time waiting for the challenger,\u201d The announcer shouted, \u201cso let us begin.\u201d<br>\r\nThe griffons rose to their feet and the alpha approached me with a cruel smile on its face\u2026a smile I fully intended to wipe off.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you surrender,\u201d The griffon taunted, \u201cSave yourself from the beating of a lifetime.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I stated raising my hand, \u201cI think I\u2019ll end you for your idiocy.\u201d<br>\r\nI launched a powerful blast of energy sending the griffon flying into the wall on the other side of the field where he fell limp\u2026but this small act strained my concussion causing my vision to blur for a few seconds but that was all it took for three of the griffons to close the distance to me\u2026I barely evaded the first and second ones but the third raked its claws across my chest\u2026if it had not been for my armor that wound would have been severe. I brought up my hand and began launching bolts of electricity which struck the offending griffon and promptly eliminated it from the battle. I back pedaled as my head began throbbing again trying to put distance between myself and my enemies. The two remaining griffons that had charged forward now simply circled me but even that was a horrible descion as it allowed me to burn them with a ring of fire magic\u2026leaving only four left but exhausting myself\u2026and straining my wounds. The last four took to the air and remained out of my attack range\u2026I was inaccurate with my magical attacks so I modified my fighting style to use knife fight distance or area of affect magicks rather than the long range attacks. I was attempting to figure a way to reach them because I did not have the energy to create or maintain a floating platform. I looked around the arena to see four pillars around the area\u2026I had enough left in me to unleash my most powerful spell\u2026Eclipse Gate\u2026It was a spell capable of shattering foundations of the earth itself\u2026but it would not be able to unleash its full power in this arena but it would be more than enough to bring down my opponents. I ran at the pillar my body screaming out in agony as I literally ran up the pillar\u2026I jumped when I reached the top\u2026and unleashed my spell. The area around me shimmered with a purplish light\u2026and then erupted in a huge explosion sending my opponents hurtling into the ground below\u2026I floated for a couple seconds before I plummeted into the ground with no energy left to right myself\u2026when I hit the ground I slowly got to my feet with the crowd roaring its approval and the commentator shouting something about a come from behind upset\u2026but something made me uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I turned towards him the anger evident in my eyes as the people panicked and the screaming could be heard as Razim\u2019s followers set about slaughtering all that moved.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I inquired my voice sounding extremely hoarse, \u201cWhy do you kill\u2026you\u2019ve no reason to harm these people.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was never like you Death,\u201d Razim taunted as he slowly approached me, \u201cI never deprived myself the pleasure of the kill\u2026unlike you\u2026and your so called code of honor.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTo senselessly kill does no signify strength,\u201d I coughed as I barely blocked his attack, \u201cAll it proves is you\u2019re a mindless beast.\u201d<br>\r\nHe struck again and again\u2026I was blocking his attacks but my body was in no conditions to keep this up\u2026so soon after his onslaught began my arms gave out and he struck with such force that I was sent flying into the wall of the arena\u2026before I could regain my footing I was impaled on the spike of one of his axes pinning me to the wall.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember Death?\u201d Razim questioned a feral grin on his face, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember what it felt like to lose yourself to the madness.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026,\u201d I stuttered ashamed as I knew what he said was true\u2026I had fought as a monster\u2026a mindless beast.<br>\r\n\u201cI can see it in your eyes,\u201d he taunted me, \u201cYou do remember\u2026but you try and resist it rather than letting it consume you\u2026you are weak\u2026and now you will end.\u201d<br>\r\nI felt electricity begin crackling through my body burning me and causing severe damage to my nervous system\u2026I was losing consciousness\u2026he threw me into one of the pillars shattering it\u2026I lay there leaning against the rubble barely alive\u2026my helmet laying on the ground next to me and my weapon embedded into the wall of the arena.<br>\r\n\u201cEnd him,\u201d Razim told one of his soldiers who was approaching me with his sword raised\u2026when all of a suddenly three arrows sprouted from the soldier\u2026shortly before he was cut down by a warrior wielding a halberd.<br>\r\nI gazed at the soldier to see he was wearing a set of black plate armor that even though it was metal didn\u2019t make a sound as he moved\u2026all around emerging from the shadows were warriors dressed just like him but not all of them were wielding the halberds\u2026some were wielding repeater crossbows, Katanas, or a Scythe and Chain and they were engaging Razim\u2019s forces\u2026Razim whirled around only to be met by several warriors with halberds\u2026from behind me emerged a warrior wielding a repeater crossbow\u2026and he knelt beside me before he began to speak.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come at last\u2026master,\u201d The cultist of Death responded, \u201cWhat are your orders.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDe\u2026Def\u2026Defend\u2026the civ\u2026the civilians,\u201d I choked out coughing up blood up in the process.<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish my lord,\u201d the soldier stated, \u201cMy lord\u2026do you think you\u2019ll survive this battle.\u201d<br>\r\nI remained silent almost sure that I was going to die\u2026I gazed skyward to see something in the noonday sky that took my breath away\u2026in the sky was the full moon\u2026a huge impossibility\u2026but as I gazed at it I felt a strange sensation rush over my body\u2026like being pulled from a pool of water after nearly drowning\u2026and the first breath you took after wards\u2026the moon seemed to call to me\u2026and empower me.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you see it?\u201d I asked the soldier, \u201cHow is this possible.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026how is the moon shining?\u201d the soldier shouted turning towards me, \u201cMy Lord!\u201d<br>\r\nThis shout was due to me beginning to glow with the same strength and intensity of the moon above\u2026slowly my armor morphed to take on a draconic appearance while also turning a deep blue. I rose to my feet my body encased in a strange new armor\u2026my strength skyrocketing to previously unattainable levels\u2026and all of my wounds healed fully. I slowly approached Razim who had forced his assailants back\u2026but the look of utter terror on his said it all.<br>\r\n\u201cH-h-how can you stand?!\u201d He roared his eyes beginning to bulge, \u201cI broke you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve been repaired,\u201d I hissed back still approaching him, \u201cand I\u2019m about to end you like you ended all those others.\u201d<br>\r\nHe charged me with both of his weapons but before he could strike I had already moved and struck him with an open palm channeling energy into the strike shredding his armor in the chest area and launching him into the side of the arena\u2026I steadily approached him ripping my weapon from the wall and leaving a gouge in it\u2026as I approached him my footfalls echoed throughout the arena as Razim attempted to flee\u2026He leapt up into the stands but I teleported behind and as he turned to flee not knowing I was there I grabbed him by his throat and lifted him up into the air\u2026the fear clear in his eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026don\u2019t,\u201d He begged me, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a raving beast,\u201d I snarled my voice dripping with malice, \u201cand I shall end you\u2026now and forever.\u201d<br>\r\nHe screamed as my hand began glowing with the energy of the moon\u2026the energy flowed through his body burning him\u2026the smoke emerging from his body as it disintegrated under the power of my attack\u2026when I let go of his throat nothing hit the ground as his body completely disappeared. The remnants of Razim\u2019s forces quickly scattered and my forces did not move to pursue them. They instead moved to regroup around me\u2026I turned towards the soldier who had come to my aid earlier.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I inquired confused as to why they were present.<br>\r\n\u201cWe are your people\u2026not the All-Fathers,\u201d the soldier told me which was a good enough answer for me, \u201cmy lord we\u2019ve a base set up within an old cathedral a couple miles outside the city\u2026we can head there at any time.\u201d<br>\r\nI turned to look around only to see Nariza, Aranos, and Karathiana standing on the other side of the arena near the top tier\u2026I felt bad about how we parted but Nariza was strong\u2026I knew she could take care of herself\u2026I knew that she didn\u2019t need me to watch over her\u2026I would miss her\u2026part of me wished to stay with her\u2026but I couldn\u2019t just abandon my men now they were here\u2026could I.</span></div></div>",

He was wearing an ornate black suit and to the outside he didn\u2019t seem to be armed but I knew that he carried two long knives hidden on his person. We were all riding horses in an attempt to reach the cathedral ahead of our pursuers.<br>\r\n\u201cI hate riding these creatures,\u201d I hissed disgusted by the horses, \u201ctheir so slow and ugly.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord we can\u2019t all be lucky enough to have a Kirin as a mount,\u201d my councilor chuckled.<br>\r\n\u201cMorvain I can\u2019t help it,\u201d I laughed, \u201cOnce you\u2019ve ridden a mythical Kirin nothing else compares.\u201d<br>\r\nA Kirin was a legendary creature similar to a horse except its mane and tail were completely compromised of fire. They only appeared to those that were meant to change the world and they were immortal. They symbolized peace and prosperity. We were now approaching the gates of the walls surrounding the cathedral where there were two heavily armored soldiers standing guard with halberds. As we stepped through my breath was swept away\u2026lining the path leading to the cathedral itself was the entire Cult of Death kneeling along the path in a show of respect to me.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are there so many here?\u201d I inquired not expecting the cult, \u201cDon\u2019t they know I betrayed the All-Father?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThey do know my Lord,\u201d A male voice rasped from my left.<br>\r\nI turned to see a humanoid creature garbed in a torn black cloak that only extended down to about its knees\u2026it was very similar to a poncho\u2026and the hood completely hid its face except for a set of glowing red eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again Galthim,\u201d I chuckled hugging the creature.<br>\r\n\u201cIt is nice to see you as well my lord,\u201d Galthim hissed.<br>\r\n\u201cI need my lieutenants to be gathered in the meeting hall,\u201d I ordered as we marched through the crowd, \u201cand I want a watch set about the cathedral\u2026none are to be let in.\u201d<br>\r\n-About 10 minutes later-<br>\r\nI gazed around a circular room where my lieutenants had taken their places in chairs that were set up in a circle\u2026it was very similar to the place where the Fathers and Mothers of the Cults would meet with the All-Father. There were ten people including myself sitting here.<br>\r\n\u201cI would like a status report on our operations in the area,\u201d I told them.<br>\r\n\u201cOur operatives have fully ingrained themselves\t within the economy of Kronos, \u201cone of my lieutenants stated rising to his feet, \u201cIt has taken them a decade but they are now a well-respected part of the community and their businesses are very important to the community.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026I would like the names of these shops on my desk within an hour,\u201d I told the lieutenant as he sat down and as another rose to his feet.<br>\r\n\u201cThe trading companies we\u2019re bankrolling have begun to funnel rare reagents and materials to us,\u201d the lieutenant stated calmly, \u201cThey\u2019ve also been providing steady revenue for our coffers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThese caravan\u2019s ties to us must be kept secret in order to assure their continued support,\u201d I stated as the next lieutenant stood.<br>\r\n\u201cOur agents within the town guard have been funneling us information about their movements and plans,\u201d the lieutenant told me, \u201cbut our agents have failed continuously to infiltrate the castle.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIgnore the castle for now,\u201d I told the lieutenant, \u201cIt is better if we focus on putting our agents in other places around the area instead of wasting them there.\u201d<br>\r\nHe nodded as the next person stood up\u2026it was my dark elf councilor\u2026his name was Morvain Tallow.<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord we\u2019ve found and repaired twenty ancient weapons of the Empire of the Moon,\u201d Morvain explained, \u201cwe\u2019ve equipped these weapons on our Black Riders.\u201d<br>\r\nThe Empire of the Moon was one of the three great empires that dominated this world for thirty thousand years\u2026the other two were known as the Empire of the Sun and the Empire of the Earth\u2026the Empire of the Moon was ruled by humans and used powerful magicks and advanced technology to combat their enemies\u2026the Empire of the Sun was ruled by dragons and this to date is the only nation of dragons ever to be founded\u2026the Empire of the Earth was ruled by a now extinct race known as Fengarli who are pretty much just elves with antlers who used the very world itself to combat their enemies. The three empires fell a thousand years ago before the might of the All-Father\u2026the Empires of the Moon and Sun still remained in small clans and tribes and very rarely ever left their enclaves. The Empire of the Moons advance weaponry include cannons, flintlock pistols, and flintlock rifles\u2026but they were also known for deploying several units that attempted to mimic their enemies strengths. The Geomancer was a mage that could use the very land itself to attack the enemy, while the Dragoon was a human warrior capable of huge jumps to engage airborne targets, and then there was a unit of warriors of riders who rode horses and used pistols to attack their enemies\u2026they were like my Black riders except they only wore light armor while my Black Riders wore full heavy plate armor. These three empires all worshiped different gods except for one which they all worshiped\u2026Evtonall the god of eternity\u2026Evtonall was a giant golden Wyrm with four wings and a single eye\u2026and its said it slumbers yet waiting for the day when it is called forth once more to defend the world\u2026to make sure that these differences did not destroy the empires the god choose three warriors\u2026one from each empire\u2026to defend the nations\u2026the Empire of the Moon had the Guardian of Life, the Empire of the Sun had the Guardian of Courage, and the Empire of the Earth had the Guardian of Knowledge\u2026these three beings were given the gift of eternal life to insure that that their skills would not pass into the void\u2026the reason I know all this is that I was alive during the fall of the three empires and I was pretty sure I was a soldier in the Empire of the Moons army\u2026I was pretty sure I was a dragoon\u2026It was difficult to remember due to the fact that after joining the All-Father he seals away your memoires\u2026but no matter how much of my memories he wiped who I was at the core would not change\u2026and at my core I desired to bring order to this chaotic world\u2026to prevent the unnecessary death that chaos brought about\u2026but now that I left the All-Father would my memories return\u2026my old skills were returning\u2026and my strength that the All-Father sealed away was returning as well. But would who I was also return\u2026could I even live with who I was after what I did.<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord are you alright?\u201d Morvain inquired.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026please continue,\u201d I told them as Galthim rose to his feet.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve inserted warriors into the coliseum to bring wealth and eventually glory to our name,\u201d Galthim stated calmly, \u201cWe\u2019ve also dispatched recruiters to Kronos and the surrounding areas to search out candidates to join us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d I stated standing up, \u201cI would like to state now that the Cult of Death is hereby disbanded\u2026and in its place we shall form the Death Syndicate\u2026a mercenary guild\u2026but all of this will be a distraction from our true objective\u2026the down fall of the All-Father\u2026May the gods have mercy on our souls and may our hunts be successful.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that I turned and walked down the hall leading to my office/living quarters but before I even reached the midway point of the hallway my world began to swim before me and I braced myself up against the wall\u2026</span></div></div>",

I continued on my way to my room when I felt a rush of darkness over me as a voice entered my mind.<br>\r\n\u201cSo did you really think you could escape me Dorian?\u201d the malevolent voice echoed through my mind, \u201cDid you really think I would let you go?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not your slave anymore,\u201d I hissed attempting to force him from my mind, \u201cand I will never again serve your filth.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think they\u2019ll take you back\u2026you are nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI will not bow to your will again\u2026never again!\u201d<br>\r\nWith this I unleashed a powerful burst of magic forcing the All-Father from my mind and I knew that he would not attempt to possess me again\u2026for his own safety. I stumbled into my room and sat at my desk\u2026I began sifting through the information on my desk\u2026the information on the newly formed syndicates previous activities and if any of my old contacts were still alive\u2026I had shrugged off my armor and now wore a leather overcoat and knee high leather boots and steel gauntlets\u2026as I searched the papers there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord there are city guards outside the gates wishing to speak with you,\u201d the soldier stated.<br>\r\nI got up and headed to the front gate where I saw a familiar face standing at the head of the guards\u2026and the look of shock on his face his face as he recognized who I was\u2026this look was quickly hidden away though. He was one of my oldest agents and he had apparently made it all the way to guard captain\u2026and that was the greatest boon ever.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no business here captain,\u201d I stated calmly noticing Aranos and Karathiana standing among the crowd\u2026and that meant Nariza was somewhere\u2026but I couldn\u2019t see her among them\u2026and that meant she was inside the cathedral.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to arrest you for the destruction at the coliseum,\u201d The captain yelled.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no right to arrest me captain,\u201d I yelled back enjoying this charade; \u201cafter it was just self-defense\u2026the fool attacked me after all.\u201d<br>\r\nThe captain turned and began barking orders at his men and reluctantly they dispersed Karathiana shot me a dirty look as both she and Aranos turned to leave\u2026I left the wall only to be confronted by the blue dragoness Nariza\u2026an elegantly designed longsword clutched in her hand...etched into the blade was the sentence \u201cMay this blade cut you a path always my love\u201d in the script of the Empire of the Sun.<br>\r\n\u201cNow it all makes sense,\u201d I chuckled, \u201cYou\u2019ve kept me alive to kill me for the death of you lover\u2026Empress.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis blade was my gift to him as was his armor\u2026it was to make sure he always returned to me,\u201d Nariza hissed the tears forming in her eyes, \u201cbut he still fell\u2026you killed him!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it Nariza\u2026I remember killing Nathanial and his parents\u2026but I don\u2019t remember any Evens,\u201d I laughed at the absurdity of this situation, \u201cDon\u2019t you see Nariza\u2026your lover might still be alive\u2026he might even be out there looking for you right now\u2026all I know is that I did not strike him down\u2026but if you still wish\u2026strike me down\u2026I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d<br>\r\nI spread my arms wide granting her a free shot but she still just stood there\u2026then the door to the stables blew off of its hinges and out ran a Kirin\u2026fully plated in Oricalcum armor it was a sight to behold as it stormed in between us blocking any chance Nariza had to attack. It stood there stamping the ground and snorting angrily.<br>\r\n\u201cLuvain\u2026move,\u201d I told the Kirin which caused it to shake its head violently, \u201cI said move Luvain!\u201d<br>\r\nAs the Kirin moved I saw Nariza was gone but the sword remained\u2026embedded into the path in front of me. I took a couple of steps forward and placed my hand on the hilt of the blade\u2026and for some strange reason I felt tears well up in my eyes\u2026I thought it was over the fact that I\u2019d abandoned Nariza\u2026but was it something more\u2026was it over the fact that I had destroyed the love they had\u2026I truly hoped that she found her love\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cMay your path always follow the sun\u2026Nariza,\u201d I whispered under my breath in the language of the Empire of the Moon a few tears running down my cheeks.<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord!\u201d a messenger yelled running towards me, \u201cwe\u2019ve found one\u2026we\u2019ve found a servant of the All-Father!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked smiling in an attempt to hide the conflicting emotions inside me.<br>\r\n\u201cA Dragon my lord,\u201d the messenger stated, \u201cIt\u2019s just a rumor but it\u2019s thought that the dragon is a high level member of the Cult of Greed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d I grinned, \u201cReady all of the Black Riders\u2026and make sure that they\u2019re all ready for battle.\u201d<br>\r\nI activated a spell automatically equip my armor and weapons. I mounted my Kirin Luvain and waited at the gates for my personal bodyguards The Black Riders to arrive and when they did I smiled when I saw Morvain and Galthim riding their mounts\u2026the gates opened and we charged out the gates and as I looked over to the side of the road I saw Aranos and Karathiana standing on the side of the road\u2026Nariza was nowhere to be seen\u2026I hope she was alright. As I, Morvain, Galthim, and the twenty Black Riders rode down the path we entered a fog and when I emerged from it I was on foot\u2026and I was in a stables\u2026I looked around to see an elderly human man standing next to another human man in silver armor with a hood hiding his face.<br>\r\n\u201cSo Evens\u2026how is he doing?\u201d The older man inquired.<br>\r\n\u201cThe Kirin is doing fine grandfather,\u201d Evens laughed, \u201cbut for some reason it won\u2019t leave.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell Kirin normally don\u2019t stay in one place,\u201d the grandfather laughed, \u201cKirin don\u2019t leave if they feel a strong connection with someone\u2026who knows maybe it bonded with you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Evens laughed as the Kirin emerged from the stall to nudge him in the back, \u201cWhat is it-,\u201d<br>\r\nI emerged from the mist with my forces in toe\u2026wondering why these visions keep flashing through my mind\u2026it didn\u2019t matter\u2026I had to keep my mind focused on my mission\u2026after all hunting a dragon was no laughing matter\u2026but with my Black Riders riding with me I felt safe. Black Riders wore black heavy plate armor and used a longsword and shield in melee combat but in ranged they would use their flintlock pistols and to be caught in a volley from them was an assured death. Their horses weren\u2019t normal either. They were specially bred to have huge amounts of stamina and their eyes were solid red\u2026and to make them even more intimidating was the fact that they for some reason had horns\u2026this is why they\u2019ve earned their nickname Devil Riders\u2026but I must think about the battle to come\u2026but one thought kept breaking through\u2026who was this Evens?<br>\r\n-Perspective switch to Nariza-<br>\r\nI was running through the woods tears in my eyes\u2026I had met the one who killed my love\u2026but I\u2019d been unable to exact my vengeance\u2026his sincerity about letting me kill him\u2026and the way left himself open\u2026then there was the Kirin\u2026Evens had a Kirin as well\u2026I heard the sound of hoof beats and turned to look at the path about five yards to my right to see Dorian go riding by accompanied by 22 other people\u2026all of them heavily armed\u2026I ignored him and returned to the inn where I first met Dorian and pulled out a book\u2026there was a picture of me standing next to a man with a hood and garbed in golden heavy plate armor\u2026the words \u201cMay my love be the shield you need to return to me\u201d\u2026It was Evens in happier times\u2026before his untimely death\u2026but what if what Dorian said was true\u2026what if Evens was alive\u2026I vowed to set out and find him\u2026no matter the cost to myself\u2026and that would require me to return to the ruins of the capital of the Empire of the Moon\u2026the city of the Dead\u2026Lunaris.<br>\r\n-Perspective switch Dorian-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The last three seats were still blanketed in darkness.<br>\r\n\u201cSo three have already fallen,\u201d Gluttony stated lazily, \u201cat least one has returned to the fold.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFall silent you cretin,\u201d the dragon snarled.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve to ask you,\u201d Pestilence chuckled cruelly, \u201cHow is your new form suiting you Razim?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShut your mouth Pestilence,\u201d Razim roared, \u201cOr I\u2019ll tear your throat out.\u201d<br>\r\nThis was Razim the man that Death had slain days ago\u2026Death had failed to destroy his soul and so it had returned to the All-Father who had taken the bodies of one of his followers and transferred Razim\u2019s soul to it.<br>\r\n\u201cSo Avarice is dead, Razim defeated, and Death defected,\u201d Despair whined, \u201cand where the hell is Mira?\u201d<br>\r\nThere was much muttering to this and arguing among the four remaining councilors\u2026but all of this stopped when the All-Father appeared in the group.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hit a slight kink in our plans,\u201d The All-Father snarled, \u201cDeath is beginning to remember who he was\u2026and Mira has disappeared\u2026add to that that Death is preparing his forces to assault our ally at the Haunted city.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSend me,\u201d Razim hissed standing up, \u201cI\u2019ve a bone to pick with him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe will not expect you to attack him so soon,\u201d The All-Father chuckled, \u201cTake Pestilence with you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n-Courtyard of the Death Syndicate Headquarters-<br>\r\nI strode through the courtyard as I saw about forty heavily armored mounted knights and ten light cavalry skirmishers all awaiting orders.<br>\r\n\u201cYour orders are simply,\u201d I sighed calmly, \u201cAll of the knights are to accompany me to Lunaris while the light cavalry are to marshal the rest our armies.\u201d<br>\r\nThe main goal was to recapture the Imperial Capital and then begin spreading out and retaking all of the old lands held by the Empire of the Moon\u2026this would anger several of the more powerful city states including Kronos but it was all worth it\u2026for in the end the Empire of the Moon would be reborn and I would be that much closer to having my sins absolved.<br>\r\n\u201cWe ride for the restoration of the empire!\u201d I roared as my cavalry thundered through the gate.<br>\r\nIt would take us a month to reach Lunaris without magical aid\u2026but I would march my soldiers to exhaustion if need be.

There will be three different types of units, Heroes (Example-Dorian, Aranos), Basic (Example-Heavy Knights), and Special (Example-Siege weapons, Ships) which will then be followed by power scale rating the unit from 1-100 (If a unit consists of more than one soldier you multiply its power rating by the number of units present)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMain Army (Death Syndicate)<br>\r\nHEROES<br>\r\nDorian-89<br>\r\nLuvain-69<br>\r\nMorvain-71<br>\r\nGalthim-81<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUNITS<br>\r\nHeavy Knights-20x40=800<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTOTAL<br>\r\n1100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorian-\u201cWe\u2019ve much to do before we\u2019re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The city is considered mostly secure despite the obvious but usually non threatening presence of dragons and other minor beast, residing on the mountains not too far from the city, or the Evergreen forest that flank it. The city is mostly supplied by the commercial docks and numerous caravan that travel the Grand Way, a well maintained road that circumvent nearly the whole region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuidelines:<br>\r\n-Differently from others stories, i want this one to be descriptive, especially about the erotica act, i don't pretend perfection nor a porno screenplay, but try to write what's happening to the character involved, avoid: i get in, ah ah, release, done<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Minimum age for human protagonist is 16, no specific limitation for critters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Interspecies relation are encouraged, when possible, remember that most citizens try to ignore the small phenomenon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try to use proper grammar and spelling, i don't pretend perfection, but please try<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If possible write at least 1500+ characters per chapter, excluding choice specific chapters, i won't delete if less, but try to maintain this standard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Shrinking is allowed only for the dragon and bigger critters within limits, a dragon can become medium pony sized, not less, human and small critter can't shrink, ever<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Growing is not allowed, recovering original shape is<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Only soft Vore, and only from a full sized dragon or other big critters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Characters and protagonist can die, just try to make sense, and when possible give an escape chance, Vore always result in death<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Magic is allowed for both human and dragons, resurrection while possible is a very difficult and uncertain procedure, not from Vore or body disintegration/tuned to ashes etc. the body must be mostly intact<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Rape is allowed, just try to give it purpose/plot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddendum: Shrinking below the above mentioned limit is allowed if a specific empower potion has been taken by the creature, human can't still shrink.
