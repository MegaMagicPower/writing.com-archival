You double check the address printed in the help wanted section of the newspaper. You're right, this is the place: Zonko's magic shop. \"This is odd.\" You think. \"I've walked around this block a million times to get to school, but I've never seen this place before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Due to some unforeseen complications, your scholarship was denied this year. Desperate for money, you applied to every open position you could find in the classifieds. Without fail, each employer called you back saying \"thanks, but no thanks.\" Just when you thought things were at their lowest, an ad you never noticed before made itself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a job?\" the ad said. \"then come down to Zonko's magic shop. No previous experience required.\" You thought something was fishy about it, but you were at your wit's end. \"I'll give it a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked in, you couldn't help but notice the disparity between the exterior and the interior. You're overwhelmed by the sheer amount sights, sounds and smells all vying for your attention. You look around, but can't find anybody else around. You notice a note on the counter addressed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou try to read it but as you do, some pink fog starts to emit from its edges. Almost as if by its own volition, it heads to straight into your nose.<br>\r\nYou gag as the invading toxin floods your lungs. You try to run to the door, but you're getting too dizzy to even stand. suddenly, everything goes black!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up on the floor, judging by the darkness in the windows, you realize that you've been out for at least a few hours. Trying to sit up, you notice some strange swelling on your chest. You're so shocked, it takes you a second to notice the fact that you're wearing some sort of pink tank top, the kind of clothing that your sister would wear. Had you been more lucid, you would have taking much less time coming up with this shocking revelation:<br>\r\n\"I'm a fucking GIRL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a very pretty one, at that\" Says a mysterious voice from behind. You spin around quickly. It's....  </span></div></div>",

I'm Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Bobby, and I have no idea why I look like a girl\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you ARE a girl now. Anyone who gets hired here transforms into someone else, usually into someone that the store thinks will help business out a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a little confused. \"don't you mean the store owners?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael laughs. \"No, the store itself is a living being that can make it's own decisions. It needs no owners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is spinning. First you find out that you're now a girl, then Mike tells you that the store is alive and can change people on a whim. You take a seat just to give yourself some time to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"don't worry Bobby, you'll get used to it. everyone does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seriously doubt that you'll \"get used to it\". This is just one screwed up day for you. Either way, Mike was just trying to comfort you.</span></div></div>",
