Basil, Molly, and Stephen were waiting them and finally the ring sounded. Dave was i his room planning another \"bussines\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasil went to the door to see who was and he just get a big surprise. His familiars were there too!!! and also her girlfriend Roxy. (Note: They weren't invited.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here Mortimer?\" Said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just here to make a dis... eeh just to eat and maybe coquettish with a woman. jejeje BANG Bang\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how is Kelly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He disappeared when he escaped from prison. But now i'm with my new partner Amanda. She is right out the door\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi to everyone\" said Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great another unplesant guest. Jajajajaj BOOM BOOM\" said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you Bingo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thrown of my house\" said Bingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" said Stephen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes because I wanted to start the fireworks inside the house but instead I created a bonfire. Jajajaj Bing bing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here because I was bored\" said Roxy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be a long night\" said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm going to see how is the dinner\" said Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to see if other \"invited guests\" comehere\" said Stephen as other guest come such as Anil, India, Madison and Ella (8 humans in total, for later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to see Dave is \"avaliable\" for party\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasil went to his room and saw an strange looking machine that looks much like a ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shrinking machine\" said Dave<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why are you doing one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is my plan: i will shrink the stuff of all supermarkets to make more easy the transportation of products along with a growing ray. and with that were going to be rich. jajajaja\" (Thunderstorm appears.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's as intelligent as a mobile telephone... with a cable. Jjajajja. BOom boom\"<br>\r\nsaid Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Said whatever you want this will work\" said Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about if we try it\" said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok point to that bed and press the red button\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasil did it. But then Dave said: \"No wait I don't want to shrunk this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Basil push the button and Dave and the Bed were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Master Dave? Well it seems it actually works\" said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasil took a magnifying glass to look for Dave. He found him lying in the bed and he picked him up. He was about 3 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you were right I apologize. Now where is the grow machine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't invented one. My mistake.\" Said Dave<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Well... wait you have something in the head. Let me clean you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be ashes because of the ray\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasil licked his hand and began to rub his head but the spot didn't go. \"Maybe if i lick it with my tongue it will go\" Basil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\" said Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasil began to lick him and... he noticed the flavor. It was liked roasted chicken. He stared to lick it like a candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basil what are you doing?\" asked Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're delicious, you know? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go, let me go\" said Dave as he realized what Basil was going to do but Basil put him in a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasil's stomach stared to moan then he run to the door to see if there was any food left; there wasn't. He then thought that he could at least have a \"tiny\" meal. But he also thought it would be selfish to have that delicious meal for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mortimer, Bingo, Roxy. Come here a moment please\" said Basil<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 foxes went to Dave's room and they asked him if there was going to be more food because the others didn't left food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I have a better meal for us all\" Basil said as he show the shrunken Dave to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him?\" And what is the other joke? Having frogs for dessert?\" said Mortimer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you say something licked him first\" said Basil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other foxes licked him and... also liked the chicken flavor of Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMM tasty\" said Mortimer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet... and salted\" said Bingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best that I have ever taste\" said Roxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can have more like this using the shrinking machine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok now what is the plan for eating the others guests?\" said the 3 foxes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is...\" stared to said Basil.</span></div></div>",

We can use the comb to make a bridge.\" said India.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"bridge\" was stable and the reached to the lid (upper) of the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ONE MINUTE\" said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no the window is closed\" said Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic we can use the lever to open it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope it will not be hard to push.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pushed it to the lever and when it almost opened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL THE TIME FLIES WHEN YOU ARE HUNGRY. NOW WHERE ARE YOU?\" said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!!!!\" said India as the window opened. But Madison walked a little backwards and knock over a bottle of mouthwash and the sound told Basil where a person may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get out of here\" said India.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlow motion: India and Madison ran to the window when Basil entered and saw them. He then jumped to the window and pushed the girls with his tail. Madison and India landed in the lid (upper) of the toilet along with a bottle of shampoo.  (ends slow motion)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that I am going to have two sweets for meal. jejejeje\" said Basil <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and India tried to run to the window again but Basil was faster. He then said: \"Now babes what about if you scratch my belly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" said Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But from inside. jjejejjeje\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're jokes are bad and we will get out\" said India<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be your last critic woman\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison then notices that the lid (down) was open and then she thought she could use the shampoo to make Basil slip inside of it and then pull the lever to flush him or at last to be stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also thought they could use the shampoo to slip under Basil feet and land in the towel and try to run to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither she knew that Basil liked her in a relation more than a friendship also best friend of Sheila. She thought they could use her female charm to \"persuade\" Basil not to eat them using praises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"India do what I do\" said Madison.</span></div></div>",

Maybe the others are also idiots\" said Mortimer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Just Stephen and this one\" said Basil. \"So? You want this... dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na. I don't like strawberry jelly. Besides he must be rotten Jejejeje Bang Bang\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Basil began to eat the jelly. He left Anil for the final bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me we can solve this\" said Anil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we can. You will be swallowed whole and without pain.\" said Basil. Then he bite the last part of jelly and swallowed Anil whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you were right Mortimer. He was a little rotten but the strawberry jelly cover his flavor.\" said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoyed him? Because we have to be looking for more\" said Mortimer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you look in the freezer? It's also open.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh give me a break. You were right with the fridge but with the freezer? I mean...\" said Mortimer as he opened the freezere and saw Dave inside a chocolate ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I never thought that Dave could have bad ideas\" said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I get it. You know them well because you live with them. Now Basil if you please excuse me; this one is mine\" said Mortimer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead then\" said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. I know you hate me but what about if we make a deal or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. If you are tasty I will enjoy youu more\" said Mortimer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMortimer put some chocolate syrup in Dave and then with a spoon he put Dave inside his mouth and began to savor him. He finally swallowed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like him?\" asked Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always liked the chocolate things. But why did he hide in the freezer?\" asked Mortimer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he got ideas... frozen. jajajajaj BOOM BOOM\" said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's continue now which way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they hide in the bedrooms\" said Basil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephen's or Dave's bedroom? Because I think the others are in Molly's bedroom right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",
