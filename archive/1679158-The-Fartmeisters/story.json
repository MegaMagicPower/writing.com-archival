The family talked as they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking forward to school tomorrow\" Elena said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Ruby asked \"At the other schools all your classmates did was tease you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now I can start over at a new school\" Elena said \"And maybe I can make some real friends her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie took a bite of pizza \"I want us all to try and exercise a bit more control here\" she said \"This is a perfect place to restart our lives, this is a perfect house for us, and I'd hate to have to leave town again\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHBBBBPPT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie tooted her booty trumpet, blowing the couch back a few feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved the couch back and finished the pizza.

Any opposition to the queen will be met with a point blank blast. Now. I am your queen and you shall see me as that. I have a really fun game that we shall play.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter speaking, Julie got off of their faces and got on her hands and knees, letting out a quick 30 second fart. Well... Quick by their own standards... She shook her ass slightly and giggled, thinking about how the game will go, with Ruby and Elena immediately worried with what the strongest farter in the family had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs your queen, we will make a fart chain. With Ruby's face in my plump buttocks and Elena in Ruby's. I have a good reason for this specific order. Now, let's play this game, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby immediately resented the idea. \u201cYou're sick mom. If you think we'll play this game, then you're wrong. I'm leaving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on. If you were to back out of my million dollar idea, I will release my ultra famous 10 minute stinkers in the face of the one who backs out. Point blank and bare. For life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the punishment was said, Ruby had the urge to fart out of pure fear but she stood her ground. In addition to that, Elena buried her face in her sister's ass and started frantically sniffing. This caused the older sister to release the fart that she had been building up, lasting about 30 seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElena. What the hell are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not going to be tortured by mom. Plus, I know that your farts are uncontrollable. I promise to endure it all. Just don't let me sniff mom's ass. Please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're crazy. Now get your face out of my ass. I have to fart again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby tries to push Elena away from her ass but to no avail. She exclaimed \u201cIt's coming out!\u201d before releasing another 30 second fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby had to make a decision. </span></div></div>",

She didn't have time to notice the huge ass that hovered over her face. For some reason, she wasn't scared, but fascinated. However, the fascination only proved to be a distraction for poor, young Elena, as the ass pinned down the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No! Get off me! Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena slapped her mother's ass in an attempt to get her off but to no avail. Julie only giggled and released a small fart. Well, to the family standards, it was small, lasting 30 seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh~ that was a good one~ by the way Elena, I saw your fascination with my buttocks. You have a fascination with it right? If you do, please give it a little smooch\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie only released a fart, lasting 15 seconds longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don't, you'll meet the same punishment as your sister.

Her next fart lasted one minute, the next, one minute and fifteen seconds. The next, one minute and thirty. They were now at the fart that lasted two minutes and thirty seconds. Elena was coughing but there was something that sparked inside her. Could she be... enjoying them? No. It couldn't be. She hated the bullies at the school, constantly farting in her face as a means of torture. Then... It came. Julie's next fart. It lasted two minutes and forty five seconds. It only confirmed her thought. She was enjoying the farts. But, there's a problem. A glaring one, at that. They're family. She didn't want to be a slave to Julie's ass as it would interrupt their normal relationship. A last warning came from the gassy mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast chance sweetie. If you don't want to meet the same punishment as your older sister, now's the time to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, Ruby woke up and looked at what was happening in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat... The hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Ruby. Great timing.

Nothing else matters to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure you can sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ruby went to her room to recover from what just happened. She now realized that Elena was in the dark side. She was completely worried. Her punishment was going to be dealt at night. Luckily for her, it was hours away but it means that she only had a limited amount of time to try and turn it around. She had to find a way to get Elena back on her side. She heard a door open. Ruby had mostly recovered from the smell and she made her way to the hall. It seemed like luck was on her side, as she saw Elena all by herself. In the blink of an eye, she ran up to her, covered her mouth and dragged her into the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to me, you have to come back to my side. It's our only way to get back at mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I? You left me to take in mom's farts. This is what happens. It's all on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright fine. You leave me no choice. It seems like I know how to get you to change your opinion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter speaking, the older sister sticks her ass on Elena's face. \u201cFarts matter to you, so if I can somehow override the smell with mine, I can get her back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fart came out of Ruby's ass and into Elena's face. The young girl started slapping her older sister's ass, begging her other get her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I have to get you back to normal. My farts have to be the key. It has to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fart came out. \u201cCome back Elena.\u201d Then another. \u201cI beg you.\u201d Then another came out. \u201cPlease Elena.\u201d Another... \u201cElena\u201d and another... \u201cPlease...\u201d and another... \u201cOh no...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby felt her stomach grumbling. The bathroom was right next to Julie's room. Ruby knows that she had no control of her farts and if the power of her fart didn't blow the wall behind Elena, it will surely attract Julie to the both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElena please. If you're gonna come back, now's the time to do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby had no way to control the time to release her more powerful farts. \u201cElena...\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was a woman with somewhat long brown hair. She was a little shorter than Julie, but more hefty. She wore a dark-grey sweatshirt, black sweatpants that covered her wide posterior, and a ski mask. Julie found it rather stereotypical, but she knew she had no room to talk since ate a bunch of donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, hands in the air where I can see 'em!\" Julie ordered, which the woman obeyed. \"Now what are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're a cop, then you should know.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the...Blaster Bomber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you look a bit...different than what you were described.

While it wasn't incredibly forceful, it was still a huge blast that wilted all of the flowers in a wide area behind her behind, as well as blowing back Julie's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was in too much shock to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh! It always ends that way.\" the Blaster Bomber sighed, lifted her mask above her forehead, and turned around, but she was also shocked that Julie was still standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So THATS what your face looks like.\" Julie said. The Blaster Bomber's lips were plump and her cheeks were slightly chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you still awake? My gas has knocked out every person and cop in my vicinity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you aren't the only plump woman around here with super-farts.\" Julie said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPWWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRVVVVVVVVVHHHH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her leg and ripped a loud fart that caused the bank to sway a little in her breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful with that blast. You just might be helping me break in.\" the Blaster Bomber said, rather impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured thats how you break in without explosives. No wonder you came around the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its explosive alright!\" the Blaster Bomber said enthusiastically with a big grin. \"I blast a hole in the wall outside where the vault is, grab what I can, and go. Sometimes I'll just walk right in, knock out everyone in the bank in an instant with one blast before they know what hit them, grab what I can, and go. And if I am feeling really greedy and after some beans, chili, or Mexican food, I'll then go right up to the vault and unleash an SBD so noxious that it'll melt that massive soundproof metal door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'll admit thats very impressive and innovative, but its not exactly smart of you to tell me your techniques.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You're the only one who can withstand my blasts! Send the entire police force after me; I'll blow 'em all away! Their protective gear is no match for my butt, I'll explode their cars before they can even get away, and any gas masks or weapons they bring I'll melt! And I don't even need a fart-starter to do that!\" the Blaster Bomber bragged, resting her hands on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point, and you're right. I will tell you its a little sad; we moved here not too long ago, and I think you and I could've been good friends if you weren't a criminal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Criminals get caught. And I ain't going to become one anytime soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see! I was the best cop where I used to live, and its for similar reasons as you. I could bring down any criminals with my gas in an instant without them even knowing, and at that point its easy to cuff and arrest them! It meant I always had to work alone, but it was worth it to make things a little safer each time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats not going to work with ME. You'll have to try something more traditional, and I explained why that won't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we both got our work cut out for us. Now before things get bad, I wanna know why you became a criminal. I mean, we're alike in a lot of ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not obvious to you? I'm a fat gassy woman! Society don't want people like me! No man is going to find me attractive, and thats assuming someone would even want to be around me! Any job I get eventually...blows over, and stuff like that spreads almost as fast as my farts do! I didn't see any other options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get how it is to be a social outcast, but that doesn't mean I turned to crime! You've gotta keep on searching and being a good person, and you'll come across the right path. My family had to move countless times and the way we were treated made things rough. It went on for years, but we kept on and eventually made it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...and here I thought things would never change for me...I bet if I met you before, it would be different, but I've gone too far to turn back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you haven't! You can turn yourself in, and eventually...you can start a new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think it'll be that easy? If I couldn't get anywhere before, you think a criminal record will do me any favors?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll have to take you by force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But as luck would also have it, school was let out before the morning was over, and the shortest way home was suffering a burst pipe; so they had to go the long way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was letting out loud and short burst of gas with each step, a look of tranquil fury etched onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't because of the jeering, insults, and looks of both apprehension and fear. It wasn't even because of the jokes, in fact, she actually contributed to them so often that everyone just stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, almost everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it was because of the bullies, not the non-gassy ones, but the GASSY ones. They not only didn't care about the fear and apprehension, but RELISHED IN IT, joked about it - possibly more than Elena - and even got farts in on Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA LOT of farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Tally and her gang collectively sitting on her face and farting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen and his gang wrestling her to the ground and taking turns farting on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet taking pot farts at her face all day before knocking her out with an SBD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Tammy, the biggest and most feared bully in school even before the Blaster Bomber came around, torturing her in front of all the aforementioned, and literally bathing Elena in her gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's day, however short, was FAR better by comparison. Sure she got looks from people, but there were actually MORE farters in her school than Elena's, so she didn't get as much annoyance as her younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were so focused on their days, and taking the turns they memorized from Google Maps, that they failed to see that they had walked near an abandoned warehouse near a sewage plant in an abandoned district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area had long since been abandoned years ago due to a reported \"unfixable sewage leak\". And there were no witnesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as anyone knew, the reason for the abandonment of the district was warranted by the smell of sewage that permeated the area, and that  the girls had to stomach during their pass through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, it wasn't something a Fartmeister had to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was still annoying, since it could mask their farts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough honestly that was more of a pet peeve for Elena, rather than Ruby or Julie, who hated one of their previous homes due to how close it was to a sewage treatment plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a pass underneath an opened window allowed a certain smell to reach the two girls noses before it was snuffed out by the sewage reek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fart eerily similar to that of a Fartmeisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping in her tracks, Elena looked to the warehouse and gained a wickedly mischievous smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, who had stopped just ahead of Elena, looked to her younger and said, \"Elena, what are you thinking?\"</span></div></div>",

Elena, Ruby, Corey, Julie, Guthrie, and I, and even HER, were all blessed with a powerful gift and she goes and takes advantage of it!\" Feeling pumped, Ryan stood up. \"Farts should be used for GOOD; not EVIL!!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused a lot of the other students to stare at him, after all, they still weren't aware he had that \"gift\". After a moment, Ryan cleared his throat and sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think we all need to just go and do something fun after school today.

I know I don't talk about this kind of stuff a lot, but its about my job. Listen, it wasn't easy climbing up the corporate ladder, even with someone of my intellect. No matter how high up you are in the business world, there is always someone who is above you. Thanks to that news story, they are starting to believe having someone like me so far up could hurt their business, even though they are a multi-million dollar corporation! I am at a severe risk of being demoted, or even worse, FIRED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they...not know about your...you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they knew all right! At first they were willing to look past it due to how successful I was at the job, and as I made good terms with everyone, they accepted it! That isn't to say I would smell-up the building, at least not all the time, but nobody ever had an issue with it...until now. Even though literally nothing has changed about me, all of a sudden its a huge deal!\" In an almost unheard of moment for him, Guthrie was getting angry. \"This...this whole thing is just NUTS! I'm not the kind of guy who lets success get to my head, but to have the rug pulled out from under me when I've done NOTHING to deserve it after coming so far is just...BULLSHIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn frustration, Guthrie grabbed a priceless vase and threw it against the wall, shattering it to pieces. Elena and Ruby froze and didn't say a word; they had never seen their cousin get so worked up before in their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of realization, Guthrie took a few deep breaths, adjusted his glasses, and faced his cousins. \"Elena! Ruby! I'm SO SO SOOOOO sorry you two had to see that! I should NOT get you gals wrapped up in my drama. The past few days have just been too much for me and reliving the whole experience by telling you gals about it just set me off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-few days?\" Elena asked in a barely audible voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we heard about all this before it was broadcasted.\" Guthrie then bowed his head. \"Again, I apologize for freaking out in front of you two.

Its not like you can just follow us into school and beat up anyone who insults us.\" Elena added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, 'beat up'? That's putting it on a bit thick, Elena. I'm 24 and its a bunch of teenagers, its not like I'm some middle-aged guy going into a school to hurt some little kids. Besides, you known darn well I don't need to lay a finger on ANYONE to bring them down!\" Guthrie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Elena means is you can't defend us from every person who picks on us, and honestly, you don't NEED to. Elena and I can take care of ourselves. Its tough for all of us, but we just have to face it.\" Ruby explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthrie took a deep breath, took off his glasses, rubbed his temples, put his glasses back on, and exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're absolutely right, Ruby. You guys don't need your ol' cousin to fight your battles for you, and I know you've got each others backs, or BUTTS rather. Its just really upsetting to me. I know full well how much your family has had to move around because of it all, and I know that it has been tough on all of you. After all of that time, it finally seemed like you guys found the perfect place, but then THIS happens and its back to square one! I don't want you guys to have to leave all of this behind. I just want things to go back to how they were before, and I wish that people were more understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we, Guthrie, so do we.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just know you guys are always welcome here, and I am always willing to lend a hand, ear, or rear to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Guthrie, that's great to know.\" Elena said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well go on ahead and gather everyone over here and I can totally set us all up for anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena and Ruby began contacting their friends, who soon started to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door; Corey was the first to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corey! Welcome back to my humble home!\" Guthrie greeted, answering the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Humble?'\" Corey muttured to himself as he walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Corey.\" Ruby greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corey!\" Elena greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ruby, hey Elena.

Ryan still had a look of anger on his face and his fists were trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Ryan! He's still been like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I really don't know what to do. I've tried to cheer him up, but I just can't do it! Honestly, I never even HAD to do it before! This is RYAN here! He gets annoyed every now and then just like everyone else, but this is too weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weirder than he already IS, yeah...\" Elena said to herself. Ruby heard her and elbowed her hard in the side. \"I mean, my cousin might be able to cheer him up, just like you said!\" she said in a loud tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one more knock on the door; it was Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! KYLE! I haven't seen you as often as I'd like! With Jeremy being a regular visitor here, I would hope the same would go for the counterpart to my younger cousin!\" Guthrie greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're nice and everything, Guthrie, but unlike Jeremy, I don't have a car...or a liscense.\" Kyle replied, not quite sure what Guthrie meant with the last part of his greeting, although he had a hunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats why he needed ME!\" an upbeat-sounding girls voice said. Guthrie opened the door wider to see Kyle's older sister Bianca, his longtime friend Scarlett, and Bianca's longtime friend Holly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! W-welcome everyone!\" he said, very surprised to see all of these strangers at once. He allowed them all to step on through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett was about the same age as Kyle and Elena. She had long dark-brown hair and was wearing a blue dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca, who spoke before, was about the same age as Ruby. She had blonde hair tieed into 2 braids and was wearing a red skirt and white shirt, which held her rather busty chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was about the same age as Bianca. She had short brown hair and wore a dark-grey leather jacket, a black shirt, blue jeans, and a light-purple road bike helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm real sorry for bringing so many people here, Guthrie. I know its really rude and everything, but Bianca, Scarlett, and Holly have their reasons.\" Kyle said, feeling rather guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to drive him here since, as he said, he doesn't have a liscense.\" Bianca said, poking her little brother on the side of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just HAPPENED to be over at the time and I REALLY wanted to meet Elena and Ruby again! Well, Elena again, I don't think I got to meet Ruby...Plus their cousin too!...I guess.\" Scarlett explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I just went because SHE went.\" Holly said, having a somewhat dull tone of voice and gesturing towards Bianca. \"Oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca wrapped an arm around her friends shoulder and quickly pulled her in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted her to meet our possible future in-laws!\" Bianca said excitedly, which made Kyle, Jeremy, and the Fartmeisters give her an odd look. \"And if my little bro's old friend is coming along for the ride, then so is mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She like, kind of, forced me to come here. Really rude and insensitive of her, I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no no no no! Not at ALL, Holly! I'm happy to meet ALL of you! A friend of a friend of a friend is just shortened to 'friend' as far as Guthrie's concerned! Its not like this house is pressing for room, after all! And what kind of host would I be if I turned you all away?\" Guthrie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sensible one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA! I like the mouth on THAT one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, biker chick here has a thing to say about everything!\" Bianca said, poking Holly in the side of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I like your energy! We certainly need more of THAT since Ryan there isn't feeling like himself today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan?\" Scarlett said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats right! We should join the others in the living room! Come on! Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthrie took back his seat between his cousins, the three two-seated couches were used by Kyle and Scarlett, Bianca and Holly, and Jeremy and Ryan, while Corey was on one of the two armchairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Scarlett.\" Elena said in a low tone, eyeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Elena!\" Scarlett said, sticking out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby, this is Kyle's friend Scarlett. Scarlett, this is my sister Ruby.\" Elena said, keeping the low tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ruby!\" Scarlett said, still sticking out her tongue at Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Scarlett.\" Ruby uttered, not sure what was going on with her and Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthrie looked back and forth between the two of them a few times. \"Elena, is there...a feud between you and that girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nothing really serious, Guthrie!\" Kyle assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I farted on her twice.\" Scarlett said in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft!\" Holly tried to resist laughing at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like that, which made her mad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena stood up and stomped her foot. \"That is NOT how it happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So BOTH of my cousins have rivals?\" Guthrie said as Elena sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Scarlett WISHES she could be my rival!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to be rivals with you, anyway, ELENA!...So, Ruby, whose your rival?\" Scarlett asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be ME.\" Corey said, raising his hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's kind of why we came here, right?\" Scarlett said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you that I came here because SHE came here. And I don't watch the news; its all overhyped scares meant to get the public into a frenzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soapboxing much?!

Ryan...wasn't feeling like riding it, so I just drove his car up here.\" Jeremy said, looking at his friend sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan! Why so blue? Is it because of the Blaster Bomber story?\" Guthrie asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" he replied quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have...have jerks been going after YOU, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't know about me. And even if they DID, that doesn't matter. Its Ruby and Elena. They don't deserve this. People just don't make sense; they are judgmental and don't show any sort of feelings for those who aren't exactly like them. And this Blaster Bomber person...don't get me started on HER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, I know EXACTLY how you are feeling. People don't even THINK when it comes to something they are supposed to hate. It doesn't even matter if literally nothing has changed for those who are associated with that hate, because all of a sudden, they are in the wrong for absolutely NO reason! However, moping isn't the answer. After all, there is a reason that they want you to do just THAT. You have to stick it out and go right through it! You don't have to like it; you don't have to tolerate it, but you can't avoid it. You will find someone who understands and sympathizes with you, and when you do, then who cares what everyone else thinks? And in terms of Elena and Ruby? Don't worry about it! They got each others backs...or backsides, and they can handle themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guthrie...you are absolutely right. I really needed to hear that.\" Ryan said with a smile, lifting his head up. He then looked at Jeremy. \"And Jerms, I'm super-sorry for being such a stick in the mud; I'm really thankful for you trying to make me feel better no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no worries, Ryan. I'm just glad to have you back.\" Jeremy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! Everyone is in a good mood and all the secrets are out!...AGAIN!

While he was glad his best friend was back to his old self, he didn't want him to just fire one by people he just met, as unlike Ruby and Elena, Jeremy had never met Bianca or Holly either. He also didn't want to potentially ruin things between Elena's boyfriends family and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan! I don't think you-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, Jeremy, if we are to have regular guests here, and said guests are to one day be our dear friends, then they must accept our supernatural emissions.\" Guthrie said in a mock-fancy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I already know what he's going to do...I just didn't know people outside Elena's family could do it.\" Bianca said, bracing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, go for it, Ryan.\" Elena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was starting to figure it all out. \"Is he about to...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPPLLLLLLLBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRVVVVVVVVVVVVVVRRRRRRRRVVVVVVVVVVVTTTTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired boy blasted a short bubbly fart that went into a very long and very loud sharp fart. Bianca wrinkled her nose and her braids fluttered in Ryan's breeze like ribbons, and Holly had a very surprised look on her face. Ryan's force was great enough that her helmet was lifted right off her head, and she barely managed to grab it by one of the straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan turned around and flashed the girls a grin. He then became concerned, seeing the two girls reactions. Bianca was trying to fan away the faint green smog that Ryan's gas took the form of with both hands, but his smell wasn't so easy to get rid of as it lingered in the area around their heads. Holly, whose hair was frazzled as she didn't keep it as tidy as her friend did, had her helmet held up against her nose with her eyes widened in surprise and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan! That is SO gross!\" Bianca said half-jokingly, turning her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Holly said in agreement, but she wasn't as playful-sounding as the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan bowed in regret and apology. \"I made a BAD move this time! I just KNEW I would! But everyone seemed okay with it, and I...I was really hoping to make more friends! But I totes understand that not everyone is going to be okay with my powerful gas, and-and I can accept that! I just hope this doesn't make things awkward with Ruby, Elena, and the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was great and funny.\" Scarlett said with a shrug, and Jeremy nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was joking when I said it was gross. Well, it still IS gross, but its not a huge deal for me. I want to get to know and like you guys, and as Guthrie said, I have to accept you guys for your...wind!\" Bianca said with both her hands over her nose and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long does it...stick around?\" Holly asked with her helmet still shielding her nose and mouth, seeming not to be as accepting as Bianca was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I usually have a...phase 2 of my blasts, but I...didn't want to blow you guys over...\" Ryan said quietly, trying not to grin at his own description as he was worried about what Holly thought about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's what Holly has a helmet for.\" Scarlett joked, which made the girl in question giggle a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't win 'em all, I guess...\" Elena said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwwhhhh!!\" Ryan loudly groaned, flopping back on the couch next to Jeremy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tow trucks have backseats, right?\" Bianca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the driver is on his way, so we'll meet you guys back there!\" Guthrie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, we aren't going straight to the cabin?\" Elena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I want us to arrive as a group.

Jeremy managed to squeeze in the back, pretty much sitting on both the laps of Ruby and Bianca!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments, the driver got back in and they were headed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was embarrassed by such an uncomfortable contact with Jeremy, and Jeremy was embarrassed by his head right between Ruby's and Bianca's chests. Also, his broad shoulders were up against Ruby's and Bianca's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So remind me why didn't we have the bodybuilder sit up front again?\" Holly sarcastically asked in a strained voice, being pushed up against the door from Bianca trying to move over to make a space for Jeremy to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just figured...since its Ryan's car...he should sit up front.\" Bianca uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't think it was going to be THAT tight a fit; sorry.\" Jeremy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby had no answer, she was too embarrassed. Her stomach answered for her with a loud gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Ruby?\" Jeremy was worried she was going to blast again, and he was more worried about her feeling humiliated again rather than the vehicular damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm-I'm fine, Jeremy.\" Ruby took a deep breath, trying to calm herself and not pay any mind to this awkward seating arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We definitely don't need you destroying a SECOND-\" Holly's murmuring was cut off by Bianca, who had enough leeway to give her a major charlie horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats super-insensitive and NOT funny at ALL, Holly!\" she said through gritted teeth.

Ryan was sitting in the middle with Ruby and Jeremy at his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthrie's group also got back in their car; he backed out of the driveway and they were on their way again with Bianca's car following them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the cabin without incident this time and parked their vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the corner of the main room were two sofas and an armchair, all of them black-green and looked very comfortable. Wooden side-tables were next to each seat, and all of it was facing a large wide-screen TV hooked up in a crevice on the wall. Also, a large sliding-glass door was on the opposite side of the room, leading out to a deck that provided a grand view of the mountains and trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large ladder on either side of the room led up to the walkway that went around the perimeter of the room and served as the second floor. There were three doors on each side: 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guthrie, this is incredible!\" Ruby exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really pulled out all the stops on this one!\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you guys like it!\" Guthrie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does it work with the rooms?\" Scarlett asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, two rooms have two single-person beds in them; two rooms have a king-sized bed in them. There is one of each on either side of the second floor.\" Guthrie explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing I saw all this coming! I brought a few sleeping bags! And they aren't some rough old rags; they are very comfortable.\" Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to think ahead, Bianca.\" Jeremy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to think AT ALL...\" Holly said, getting her helmet immediately slapped off by Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So about room arrangements...\" Ruby began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the rooms should be large enough that a sleeping bag could easily fit in each one, including the king-sized bedrooms, but I already have one of the king-sized rooms claimed...That leaves 3 of you in each room, and two of you together in a king-sized bed...\" Guthrie explained, trailing off at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerms, Ruby, and I could room together!\" Ryan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll room with Kyle and Elena.\" Scarlett said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That puts ME with Bianca and Corey.\" Holly said, really not sounding like she cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And which group will take the king-sized bedroom?\" Guthrie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerms and Ruby can!\" Ryan exclaimed, volunteering them. \"And don't worry, I'll make sure nothing goes on there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RYAN!!\" Jeremy and Ruby shouted at him, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that settles everything. So now that arrangements are out of the way, whattya say we work on the dreaded task of unpacking everything?\" Guthrie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the large size of the group, a lot of luggage was brought to the cabin, thus it took quite some time to get everything out and set up. In fact, it was reaching the wee hours of the night by the time they were all finished. Everyone decided to turn in so they would be rested up for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wouldn't it be better to be IN the sleeping bag?\" Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it, Ruby. Ryan usually doesn't bother with the covers for any place he sleeps. Besides, once he is out, he's pretty much impossible to wake up.\" Jeremy explained. \"Which is good, because you don't WANT to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever heard of something called 'morning thunder'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my mom has that.

Luckily, its more like 'noonish thunder', so as long as you aren't planning on sleeping in, its pretty easy to get up and out of the blast zone before he goes off. There ARE a few times when he's beaten me to the punch, and its not a pleasant thing to wake up to.\" Jeremy explained, also grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should get as much sleep as we can, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy crawled into one side of the bed, stepping over Ryan, and Ruby crawled into the other. Both of them faced away from each other and slept as close and comfortably to the edges as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were pretty uncomfortable, and the bed was certainly not the reason. If Jeremy was feeling embarrassed, then Ruby was feeling absolutely rattled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy fell asleep rather quickly, but Ruby was shaking in embarrassment, and so was her stomach. She knew if she let loose, it would blow Jeremy right off the bed and landing on Ryan, who, in turn, would he himself let loose in a double-whammy of gas. The effort to hold back her gas was actually greater than her flustered feelings, and the girl was finally able to fall asleep. Little did she know, dozing off would relax her body just enough to release a toxic SBD lasting throughout the night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Holly was just about fall asleep as well, but something snapped her out of her daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sleep-fart from Corey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small raspberry-sounding fart that was really weak, even by the standards of an ordinary person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly didn't really pay any mind to it and drifted off, but she was woken up for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPRRRRRRBBBBBTTTTT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey let out another fart, this one was louder, longer, and deeper, but still nothing notable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" Holly sighed in frustration. She had to end this before it began by waking Corey. She sat up and moved over to him to shake him awake. Big mistake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly didn't realize Corey was facing away from her, so when she tried to shake him awake, she was right in the blast range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPFFFFFFFFVVVVVVVVVVVVVTTTTTTTTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey ripped a very loud and very strong fart that fluttered and blew back his covers (as well as Holly's hair) like sheets on a clothesline. The force of the fart knocked Holly down to the ground and flung her helmet off her head and knocking it against the wall behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! That is SO awful!\" she exclaimed to herself, covering her nose and mouth with her hands; she was used to using her helmet as a more effective means of stench shielding. The loud noise of said headwear caused Bianca and Corey to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuh...wuh is happening...? How is...? What is going...?\" Bianca stammered drowsily, too tired to figure out what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey was much more alert and sat up straight. \"What was that noise?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca rolled over and noticed Holly's helmet on the floor. \"Holly...? Why did...? Why did you...? You tried to throw...helmet at me...? Why would you do that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Bianca, if I wanted to throw my helmet at you, I would make sure not to miss.\" she replied as she got up, put the piece of headwear back on, buckled it, and went back to her bag. \"Its HIS fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME?!\" Corey exclaimed defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You forgot to warn us that you pass wind in your sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I do? Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I tried waking you up, but your blast blew my helmet clear off my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Corey said, trying not to grin at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way you could NOT have known this. Don't mess with us like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly, I swear, I had no idea I sleep-fart, let alone STRONGLY sleep-fart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I don't really care if you knew or not, just sleep with your cannon facing away from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cannon'?\" Corey blushed a little at the unintentional compliment Holly made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, DON'T.\" Bianca said. \"Holly totally deserves getting gassed for how she has been acting toward you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, looks like YOU'RE fully awake now...\" Holly said to her. \"And don't even TRY to put Corey in your punishment position. I'll take having my helmet SLAPPED off over BLASTED off any day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've still been kind of insensitive to the Fartmeisters, Corey, and Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not...really. If you think THAT stuff was insensitive, then you must think all of the things I've said about people makes me a total bit-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats different! These are people we literally JUST met and they want us to accept them. They invited us to their dang vacation home, so you could AT LEAST act thankful, Holly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If its worth anything, I'M not bothered by any of what you say, Holly. Heck, I even take it as sort of a compliment.\" Corey told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...take my comments about your gas as a...GOOD thing?\" Holly asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I take great pride in my gas! The length, the sound, the force, and the smell!\" Corey boasted, sounding like an announcer and placing his fist on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW.\" Holly said flatly, not sure how to feel about that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're REALLY comfortable with what you got, Corey?\" Bianca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. Thats why the whole Blaster Bomber controversy doesn't bother me that much...Well, it bothers me because of how it affects my friends, but I've become used to the heat against me for some time now...\" Corey explained, sounding a little somber for reminding himself of how Elena, Ruby, and the others felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you got the power, you gotta show it off, I guess...\" Holly said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would YOU ever want that...power, Holly?\" Corey asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" she replied without hesitation. \"We each have our own things to do. I've got motorcycles, music, and messing around with people. You've got smelling-up buildings, peeling wallpaper, melting steel, whipping up gusts, blasting holes in concrete, blowing people backwar-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-come on, Holly!\" Corey sputtered, blushing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do me a favor and keep it pointed the other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The green smog from his butt quickly filled the small room, and due to the sheer quantity, thickened the visible vapor until all visibility was replaced with a green void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHH! That felt SO good!\" Ryan said with a loud sigh, impressed by the effect of his fart fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ryan?!\" Ruby weakly exclaimed, coughing. Even though she had the typical supernatural-stink immunity, the room was so small and Ryan's gas was so big that even SHE was having trouble handling it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot, Ruby?!

I don't think thats a good idea!\" Ruby exclaimed, still sounding weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy didn't hear her and flung the door open. With that, like a bursting dam, his gas rushed through the opening and filled the cabin with not only his smell, but also Ruby's. At the very least, the wide area dispersed his gas enough to clear the fog enough for everyone to see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Ryan. I must say that I am impressed! Didn't know you had morning thunder, or I guess in this case, morning FOG!\" Guthrie complimented from the couch below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, thanks, Guthrie! But I think we should evacuate!

My backside is pointed away from them all! What I'm about to whip up won't harm them in the slightest! That, however, in no way means they'll be weak ones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVTTTTTTT!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthrie ripped a long and very loud fart, bending the trees in a wide area behind him backward and burning up all of their leaves instantly. The trees, normally huge and thick, were charred and reduced to shriveled stumps from the strength and smell Guthrie caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby? Elena? Wattya think?\" Guthrie asked, seeing his cousins giggle. After a moment he put on a fake upset expression. \"...Not much, huh? Boy, nothing left to do but to kick it up. Hopefully this big one will make up for that.\" he said, pretending to sound embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBBBBBBWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRBBBBTTTTTT!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fartmeister blasted a very loud, very low-pitched, foghorn-like fart. The ground shook like an earthquake all around him, and the area behind him that had suffered his power vibrated especially violently. In fact, the ground in the blast range soon collapsed in on itself with a loud crash that nearly matched the sound of Guthrie's gas in volume. All that was left was a barren and crumbled area of earth with charred wood pieces embedded in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe volume of this event was actually strong enough to jolt Kyle, Scarlett, Jeremy, Holly, and Bianca back to consciousness. They awoke to Elena's and Ryan's laughter, Corey's applause and grin, and Ruby's giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats so dang funny?\" Scarlett asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthrie, still having a somber facade, had his head hung. \"They are laughing at...ME. I-I tried to impress my cousins with my ability, but I just can't catch up to them! They'll always see me as someone with no fart game. I don't know what else I can do! And now Ryan and Corey are having fun at my expense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you TALKING about?\" Holly said in both confusion and annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's messing with his cousins, Holly. You know, the thing you LOVE to do? Or are you seriously oblivious to your own annoying antics?\" Bianca told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca, yikes!\" Kyle said at her knee-jerk reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca has a routine she does whenever she wakes up, and when thats thrown off: She. Gets. TESTY.\" Holly explained, treating it as just a typical occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about all that, Bianca. You too, Holly. I was sleeping the other way like you said, but that doesn't stop them from slipping out.\" Corey said, smiling sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine, Corey, really. I just need to...take a shower and stuff to get myself back on track.\" Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is gonna be a problem, because the cabin is quarantined right now. It wasn't just MY gas. Elena, Ruby, and Ryan's gas is also mixed in there, so it could take awhile to...clear up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Guthrie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthrie sighed, shaking his head slowly, walked over to his cousins, and used thir shoulders like armrests. Ruby and Elena glanced at him, knowing he was up to something silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFFVVBBTT...FFVVBBTT....FFVVBBBTT....FVVBBTTT...FVVBBBTTT....FVVBBBTT...FVVVB BTTT...FVVVVBBBTTT....FFVVVBBTTT...FVVBBBTT...FVVVBBBTTT...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthrie started to go on a silly sob-story as he let out a sharp stuttering fart throughout. \"I...I didn't pass anything...My cousins told me I'm not one for breaking wind, even though I'm a Fartmeister...All this time I thought I embraced that name, BUT it looks like I thought wrong...I tried to change their opinions of me, and I thought I did good on that...That clearing hasn't always been there, if you know what I mean...They just laughed at me...I let my cousins down, but I hope they realized I tried my best...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthrie ended his ramble (and rumbling) with a quick grin, and Elena and Ruby were snickering throughout all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though I knew that Jeremy wouldn't be upset about it, and I'm sure YOU know that too, I DID know that YOU would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Ryan, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the way, Ruby, I wouldn't really call that 'taking the fall', because that implies embarrassment, I would use the term 'taking the credit'!\" he added with a wink, which made Ruby smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone is conscious and, once more, explanations were in order. Now that all THAT is taken care of, and since the cabins air is unsafe for breathing, what shall we all do?\" Guthrie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As usual, a green fog left his butt and it formed itself around Jeremy and stayed around him. Jeremy's eyes were burning and his lips started to tremble from the smell, but he held still and could feel the putrid emission somehow evaporating all of the water on his clothes and skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it!\" Ryan said. The instant he gave the 'all clear', Jeremy covered his nose with his hands. The muscular guy was still covered in Ryan's fart gas, which followed his arm movements like he was \"wearing\" it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Ryan that smells awful!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've heard the one earlier Jerms, THAT was worse!\" Ryan said, half-bragging and half-joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?

We had to evacuate the cabin because of all of the gas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy was becoming suspicious. \"But if your noonish thunder was what knocked me out, why would you tell me I should've heard it? And why would that knock me out before you even let it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was getting caught up in his lie. \"I wasn't talking about THAT one! There was another fart I let out after that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy wasn't buying it. \"Ryan, whats the truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long moment, Ryan sighed. \"Okay, my noonish thunder DIDN'T knock you out. You were already knocked out. And...it wasn't me that dealt it, it was Ruby. She was so nervous being in the same bed as you that she...she released an all-night sleep SBD...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy blinked a few times in complete surprise, especially at the length of his girlfriends emission. \"Wow, I had no idea that Ruby felt so uncomfortable by that, but on the other hand, that is...rather impressive. Thats at least a 7-hour long fart, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought so too Jerms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you take the fall for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like I told Ruby, its more 'taking the credit' than 'taking the fall'!\" Ryan said with a grin, but then got serious. \"I did that because I knew she would be embarrassed and ashamed of what she did, even though all three of us knew you wouldn't care.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her grey leather coat and hair waved in the wind, her legs felt wobbly, and she shut her eyes tight and wrinkled her nose to try and shield out the smell. In fact, it wasn't clear if it was the smell or the force that was drying her, but whatever it was, it worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey turned around and thumped his chest once, flashing Holly a smile. She gave him a very slight smile in return, while somehow retaining a look of disgust. She then reached up to shield her face with her helmet, but to her surprise, it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what happened to my helmet?! I definitely remember making sure it was on tight! Did it fall in the damn creek?!\" she started to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh, Holly, look behind you.\" Corey pointed across the creek, showing Holly that her helmet had flew off of her head and was hanging high up on a tree on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course that's where it ends up.\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly, I can go get it!\" Corey offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its your fault it happened, so yeah, of course you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey already felt guilty as is. \"Ease up Holly, I didn't do it on purpose! And its not like its permanently lost or destroyed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's fair, I shouldn't be like that...How are you even going to get it back? There are no branches or anything sticking out to grab on, and you were already sucking at mountain climbing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks for that vote of confidence, Holly.\" Corey said in a deadpan tone, then switched to a more sly one. \"Anyway, I know exactly how to get your helmet, and if you think about it, I'll be you'll know too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Nope, my minds a blank, just like Bianca's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey smirked, both at Holly's jab at Bianca and at her purposely playing ignorant. \"Then I'll just have to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the edge of the creek, turned away from it, and stuck his butt out towards the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly stared at him, still pretending she had no clue what he was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBBBBBBLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWBBBBBBBBBBBPPPPPPPPPPPPPPTTTTTTTT!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey balled up his fists and concentrated, blasting a very deep, rumbling, bubbly fart. Not only did this cause the area across from the three to shake, but it also caused the creek to bubble and steam. This combination caused the tree to creak and crack (or maybe that was just the sound of his fart?) and fall towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out Holly!\" Corey ran towards her and shoved her just in time for both of them to avoid the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tree was falling, Holly's helmet was flung off of it and just happened to land on her head. The tree splashed onto the bubbling creek with a loud sizzle (or maybe that was just the sound of Corey's fart again?) and the waters calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Corey.\" Holly said with a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my pleasure Holly!\" Corey replied, thumping his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that tree is stripped of bark and almost black. I dunno if it was always like that, or if your fart had combustible smell or something to char it and burn away its outer-layer. Probably not, since you probably would've burned it up into a small twig, unless you held back since that would've burned up my helmet too. If you did hold back, your gas is still strong enough to...somehow boil the creek for awhile. I could use you as a gas-powered stove, and not in the fuel sense!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Keeping up with Ruby, a lovesick teenager, and Elena, a hyperactive preteen, was hard enough, but add in her hereditary flatulence?  It was almost impossible.  Papers flew around the house on a constant basis, and things never stood upright for long.  \u201cBut they\u2019re mine, and I love them,\u201d Julie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie strutted to the closet to put the vacuum away, and as she did so she picked at the red spandex leggings that clung to her large posterior.  She didn\u2019t have a fat ass per say, but it was a little bigger then the next woman\u2019s.  She wore a black oversized wool sweater as well, and black ballet flats.  She had her hair up, and hidden underneath an old ratty Yankees cap to keep it from falling in her face.  Julie spent most of her time at home cleaning and taking care of everything a house hold needed to be taken care of, while her loving husband worked to support the family.  It was boring monotonous work but she found pleasure in it as she served her family and she loved them a great deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to take a shower before the girls get home,\u201d Julie smiled.  But a ding from the laundry room stopped that idea from getting very far.  \u201cA woman\u2019s work is never done,\u201d Julie giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took the laundry from the washing machine Julie felt her stomach gurgle loudly.  \u201cOh something\u2019s reacting badly with something else,\u201d Julie groaned.  \u201cAnd I just cleaned the house,\u201d Julie lamented.  But this is how it was since she was little; her farts would constantly disrupt her day-to-day life, making things difficult.  Friends were hard to come by, and she was almost out of college before she had sex for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her husband she lost her virginity to.  He was the only man, correction; only person who didn\u2019t mind her gas, hell, sometimes he even seemed to love it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie had gathered up the laundry and carried the basket outside, with her knees locked together and her thighs squeezing as tight as she could to hold her fart in.  She had made it outside and was bouncing up and down trying to prevent her fart from slipping out for as long as possible.  This is what Julie always did; it was her way of trying to gain some control of the uncontrollable.  But the Fartmeister legacy prevented this, their flatulence was more a force of nature than a gas problem, and soon enough Julie bent forward and let her big butt cheeks part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>PPPPPPHHHHHHHRRRRTTTTTTTTTBBBBBBBTTTTTT</b></font>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting fart ripped the leaves off the tree behind her, and blowing them over the tall fence that separated her yard from the neighbor\u2019s yard.  Looking at the bare tree she was thankful it was fall.  \u201cMaybe the neighbors will think they just fell on their own,\u201d she mused as she chewed her bottom lip.  \u201cI hope that\u2019s the only problem with this fart,\u201d Julie prayed, but then it hit her.  The smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was horrible and rancid and it seemed to be everywhere.  \u201cGod, sometimes it\u2019s like the great outdoors isn\u2019t big enough to dilute my farts,\u201d Julie whined feeling defeated.   That\u2019s when she heard the neighbor\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d a female voice yelled form the other side of the tall fence.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her stomach was rumbling and grumbling nicely by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, come on!  It\u2019ll be fun!  Besides I never see any othah women going in there.  I\u2019m beginnin\u2019 to think you don\u2019t got any friends!\u201d  And there it was, Gladys\u2019s nosiness in full swing.

See you soon!\u201d  A half an hour later Gladys heard a loud crack of thunder, followed by the sound of the doorbell.  When she opened the door all she saw was Julie standing on her front stoop in a nice yellow sundress waving something away from her big behind.  \u201cWhere\u2019s the clouds?  I thought I heard thundah?\u201d Gladys asked scanning the sky and only seeing sunshine, \u201cOh!  And that septic problem is gettin\u2019 worse!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it does smell worse,\u201d Julie agreed blushing red.  Julie couldn\u2019t help but notice how Gladys\u2019s body was almost that of a supermodel, with a decent heart shaped ass, and a lovely set of D-cup breasts.  Her sky blue dress was tight and left little to the imagination, and went well with her black pointed pumps. Julie couldn\u2019t help but laugh how it all contrasted with her thick glasses and tight fire engine red curls, and oversized hawk like nose.  \u201cFace of a stereotypical nerd, body of an angel,\u201d Julie giggled to herself.  \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know where the thunder came from.  I was just as startled as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell come in sweetie,\u201d Gladys said friendly.  She grimaced as Julie passed her; the smell surrounding her perky posterior was indeed strong.  \u201cOh sweetie, I hate to tell you, but I think that smell is clinging to yah clothes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh is it?\u201d Julie blushed redder.  \u201cHopefully some perfume will help,\u201d she laughed nervously fishing some out of her bag.  She sprayed it on her dress, particularly her ass and smiled as if it was all a big joke.  Julie then turned around to see\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amazingly enough she had fun with these ladies, except when they were talking about the effect of her fart, but still she had fun, and she didn\u2019t have that with other women all that often.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie had taken a single step when her stomach growled.  \u201cNot again.\u201d She backed up and put her ample posterior against the house.  Her husband had it constructed to withstand her and the girl\u2019s flatulence and she knew she would do little damage to it.  So she squeezed those butt cheeks up against it and began to let loose.  At first it all went fine, until she realized the force of her fart wasn\u2019t threatening the house, but it was forcing her forward, and before she knew it she launched herself across her yard and into Gladys\u2019s bushes.  \u201cWHOOOOOOOAAAAA!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie exited the bushes and looked at her house, seeing a spot where the paint had been peeled off in the shape of two large butt cheeks.  \u201cI\u2019ll have Elena repaint that when she gets home, for not taking out the trash like she was supposed to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie returned to Gladys\u2019s front door and went inside.  \u201cGladys, Linda, girls?

Both she and the girls had to watch what they ate on a constant basis, too much milk, too much beans, too much cabbage, and BOOM!  A fart that ends all farts.  For the most part they kept to salads and fresh vegetables, but Julie was feeling adventurous today. \u201cI want a bacon cheeseburger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie walked through the school back to her car, but stopped in her tracks when she heard a teenage girl talking to her friend, \u201cI just think its weird how the new girl, Rudy, Ruby, whatever, disappeared for like two periods right after that gas leak put a hole in the wall, and then she shows up with new pants!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know!\u201d her friend agreed.  \u201cAnd do you notice, and I really do feel bad saying this, but do you notice how she smells a little like a fart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe does have like a sour smell to her, but c\u2019mon a fart?  Do you know how bad her farts would have to be if she actually smelled like them?  That would be so gross!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I feel so bad even saying it, she seems so sweet,\u2019 the second girl said making Julie feel a little heart warmed that Ruby might actually make some friends, but a little concerned too.  If they noticed these things, and the faint smell the Fartmeisters all had, they might eventually put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to warn Ruby when she gets home,\u201d Julie made a mental note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie left the building and got into her car, and quickly rolled down the windows.  It was a Fartmeister precaution in case they ever got a gas attack on the road, they didn\u2019t want to put too much pressure on the windows and make them explode.  \u201cLearned that the hard way,\u201d Julie smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drove to a diner and decided to sit down; after all she didn\u2019t really have to worry until after she ate the burger.  Plus it gave her a sense of normalcy she sometimes lacked due to her flatulence.  She ordered her burger and a side of fries, and topped it off with a nice frosty milkshake.  \u201cThe bedroom\u2019s gonna take some punishment tonight!\u201d she laughed, thanking God her husband was away for the next few weeks.  More than once he\u2019s been blown out of bed and slid down the far wall in the middle of the night.  \u201cBut it\u2019ll be worth the gas tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie ate her food with a greedy gusto, reserved for when she deviated form her diet.  But it was no more than a few minutes after she was done, that her stomach started churning and bubbling.  \u201cI need to get home, and soon!\u201d she told herself.  She paid the bill and was in her car before you could blink; sweat pouring down her head as she felt her gas begin to relocate to her ass.  \u201cHold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!\u201d she chanted trying to keep it in.  She had never has such a quick reaction before.  When she got home she squeezed her thighs together and clenched her butt tight, she was almost to the front door when she saw someone waiting for her there.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her yell brought Gladys outside who looked at the clothes hanging from the tree, and scrunched her face when she caught the remnants of the fart that put them there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat dahn septic tank!  Julie!  Why are your clothes in the trees?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t talk Gladys, got some punishing to do right now,\u201d Julie called over to her, as she grabbed Elena by the ear and dragged her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwowowowowowowow!\u201d Elena exclaimed as she rubbed her ear once her mother\u2019s hand left it.  \u201cMom that hurt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour gassy little butt is going to hurt next, if you don\u2019t tell me what happened at school today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut nothing happened mom!  I\u2019m telling the truth!\u201d Elena whined giving her mother the puppy-dog-face she was famous for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was just about to press the issue when the phone rang.  \u201cHello?  Yes this is Mrs. Fartmeister.  What\u2019s that?  It\u2019s German.  Master of farts.  I guess it is a little odd.  Now how may I help you?  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  She did, did she?  Yes I will talk to her, and yes I can be there in the morning.  Have a good night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie leaned on the coffee table and pinched the bridge of her nose.  A whiny fart escaped her ass, as it some times did when she was stressed.  It wasn\u2019t really powerful, but its smell often made any non-Fartmeisters pass out from its overpowering foulness.  As it was Elena fanned it away from her grimacing face as fast as she could, before she got a mouthful and had to taste it\u2019s rotten smell.  \u201cSo was it a good phone call?\u201d Elena asked nervously.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It can\u2019t be worse than Mom\u2019s!\u201d Elena teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh be quiet,\u201d Julie told her smiling daughter, as a deep raspberry like sound started leaking out forom underneath her eldest daughter.  The fart wasn\u2019t forceful, but the smell was God awful.  It slowly worked its way through the house filling it with a vileness that most people would associate with the deepest darkest parts of a hundred year old landfill.  And still Ruby farted.  Julie and Elena felt tears form in their eyes as the smell stung them like salt.  \u201cWhew!  Where did that come from dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurkey Chili was for lunch,\u201d Ruby explained with a deep crimson blush coloring her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAir!

I want that butt print covered before dinner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Elena began to whine, but cut it short after a glare from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby you think you can help me get the clothes out of the tree?\u201d Julie asked her eldest, rubbing her stinging eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Mom, I think I need some air too,\u201d Ruby giggled nervously as she fanned the remaining fart fumes from her butt.  She walked past Julie who couldn\u2019t help but recoil from the hint of flatulence that followed her daughter\u2019s posterior.  She felt bad, but relaxed when she realized Ruby hadn\u2019t seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Elena laughed at the impression of her mother\u2019s big butt on the wall, but a quick cuff to the head set her working.  Ruby steadied the ladder as Julie grabbed the clothes and dropped them down to the ground.  \u201cAnd I just washed them,\u201d she sighed.  She used an old painter\u2019s extenders pole to reach the ones farther away, but still she and Ruby had to reposition the ladder more than once.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom atop the ladder she looked down at her daughters, and thought about the trouble she had made in their lives by passing on this genetic anomaly.  Ruby would have the hardest time coping, being much like herself, but now that she thought about it, maybe not Elena after all.  She really didn\u2019t mind her farts, and in fact she kind of liked them. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably use them to make herself famous,\u201d Julie smiled.  \u201cLook at the Amazing Flatulent Woman!\u201d Julie joked about her daughter\u2019s future profession, \u201cShe can blast concrete apart with the power of just one fart!\u201d  And she just might do that, Elena was a very talented farter for anybody, never mind a girl her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what now Mom?\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They\u2019re jerks!  They always find some reason to pick on me,\u201d Kyle explained dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I heard they ended up blown away or something today,\u201d Elena smirked, proud of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard Mary Beth, that red haired girl who never talks to me, I heard her say that Nate thought he got farted on from the way he smelled.  I\u2019d like to shake the hand of the person who could do that!\u201d Kyle said shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like farts?\u201d Elena asked intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like anyone who can do that to Nate!  Farts or no farts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena giggled at the funny little nerd boy, but stopped when she realized his sailboat wasn\u2019t moving at all anymore.  \u201cI think it stuck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid boat!  My dad will kill me for just leaving it out there!  There\u2019s gotta be someway to get it out of the water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena looked around and back to the water.  The sailboat was close to the shore on their side, and it wouldn\u2019t be hard to walk around to the other side.  She looked back at Julie who was engrossed in her book, it wasn\u2019t often she had time to herself.  \u201cKyle can you keep a secret?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I never told anyone that John Fisher wet the bed at my house,\u201d Kyle said dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena laughed, and looked back to Kyle.  \u201cSeriously, can you keep a secret?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, come with me,\u201d Elena told him taking his hand in hers and leading the way.  Elena was completely unaware of the loving look Kyle now gave her.  He would never tell on her now.  When they got into position Elena looked back around and made sure her mother wasn\u2019t paying attention.  \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to show you what happened to Nate Hauser and his buddies and get your sailboat back, but you can\u2019t tell anyone!  Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, got it,\u201d he assured her a little confused.  And with that Elena turned pointing her ass at the water, and with a wiggle of her little butt did what she did best, and the smile on her face told the story that this little girl would be the greatest farter in the world when she grew up.  Her fart was booming like a car wreck, and strong like a hurricane.  Her powerful fart buffeted the water into a large tidal wave carrying the toy sailboat to the shore and beaching it.  \u201cThat was freaking amazing!\u201d Kyle cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d she asked excited that someone else was excited about her farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cELENA!\u201d her mother Julie\u2019s voice rang out!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wether it was from a a cold or hay fever, she was always sneezing. Elena remebered her having to go to the nurse in a fit of allergic sneezes. Her nose was usually red and runny, like her eyes. She was sitting on a bench bent over a Nintendo DS, playing a video game. Elena guessed, from her Pikachu sweatshirt, that it was a Pokemon game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was Tracy Benton, a girl with her hair dyed purple wearing cats eye glasees. She known in her class as Boohoo Benton. An overly emotional girl, who could be sent into a fit of tears from the right compliment or insult. She was reading a book underneath a tree. Judging from the tears streaming down her face, it was probably a sad book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who should I talk to\" Elena wondered</span></div></div>",

Although, a football game ended up bringing her together with her soon to be husband, who was the team's waterboy.

She handed it over to Julie who looked at it with a surprised and stunned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture was of her nephew at the beach, wearing noting but a skimpy speedo.  He was obviously well endowed, and his muscles were large like a hockey or baseball\u2019s players.  He was cut and lean and Julie felt a little flushed herself looking at this picture of a flesh and blood David.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she let her eyes wander to his face.  \u201cHe\u2019s definitely your nephew,\u201d Julie smiled sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIshmael is handsome, I know,\u201d Gladys said proudly.  Julie nodded and looked at him again.  Large hawk like nose, tight red curls that looked like a tiny thin afro, no chin and large thick glasses, all came together to give Ishmael a very distinctive appearance.   \u201cYou know Julie, this coffee was delicious,\u201d Gladys complimented her backhandedly while swirling the spoon in the empty cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like another cup?\u201d Julie smiled sardonically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you were getting some for yourself,\u201d Gladys handed her the cup, and leaned back into her chair, not waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie got up and walked to the kitchen, shaking her head to herself.  Gladys wasn\u2019t exactly the woman she would have chosen to live next door to her, but she was nice enough.   Sure she was annoying, but she was the only woman in her neighborhood that greeted the family when they moved in, and the only one who went out of her way to talk with Julie on a consistent basis.  It was hard sometimes, but Julie did try to enjoy Gladys\u2019s company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women talked for almost an hour, with Gladys telling stories of how she used to be a body double for some famous actresses who didn\u2019t like to do nude scenes, \u201cBut they nevah put my face in front of the camera,\u201d Gladys sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery,\u201d Julie mock sympathized as she showed Gladys out.  \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to show Ruby that picture,\u201d Gladys called out as she disappeared down the walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie closed the door, and put her head against it.

According to others, I don't even deserve be in your-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhh. Stop talking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby couldn't believe it. She was being shut up.

This immediately worried Ruby, as she knows that she can fart at any moment. She felt the hand grabbing her ass and she immediately stopped the kiss, saying \u201cDon't!\u201d before letting out a quick second fart. This was all too much for poor Ruby. She started tearing up. Upon seeing this, Carrie puts her hand on her own ass and farts. It was as long and as loud as Ruby's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a dream. It had to be. There was no way that the most popular girl asked her to go to an unpopulated spot, kissed her, and farted right in front of her. Ruby pinched herself to see if it was a dream, but it wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're confused, aren't you? I asked you specifically because I wanted to confess. I love you and I'm jealous of you. You get to fart without a worry because of your reputation for it. If I were to fart, my reputation would be ruined. I love farting and I love sniffing them. You know my older sister, right? She once pinned me down and farted on my face for hours straight. I hated it at first but I loved it so much a few hours in. So much that I beg her to fart in my face to this day. After seeing and smelling your farts in the bathroom, I knew that I had to be yours. So please, let's go out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but why? I'm not even lesbian. I don't think it could work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can make it work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, they noticed that there were some loud farts coming from the storage room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh. I love farting in your face. You have the best face to fart on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large and long fart was heard soon after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo glad you decided to be my slave, Fartface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie and Ruby looked at each other and laughed softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...

Elena!\" Guthrie said at the door, greeting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis host was an older teen with brown hair that went to the tip of his neck and a bit of a gut, and he wore black glasses with square frames, a purple shirt, and black pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guthrie!\" the girls said, entering the home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't believe we've met.\" Guthrie said to the male accompanying them, putting a finger on his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jeremy.\" he replied, offering him a handshake, but Guthrie went with a five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so YOU'RE the boy whose been the talk of the town!\" he said jokingly as Jeremy joined his place next to Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you guys to ol' cousin Guthries place?\" he asked the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena cut off her shy older sister; \"We wanted you to meet Jeremy!\" she said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you guys have told me a lot about him; especially Ruby!\" he singled her out; making her blush slightly and her stomach gurgle a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Come on! Sit down, everyone!\" Guthrie announced, clapping loudly as he led the trio into the main room with 3 cream-colored leather seats and a large flat-screen TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're hospitable.\" Jeremy complimented as the trio sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Not you, Elena, keep your toxic tush up, I need to talk to you privately.\" Guthrie said, gesturing to himself, \"And thanks, Jeremy, you seem like a nice dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Guthrie and Elena walked away, Jeremey turned to Ruby and looked at her quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he just say 'toxic tushie'?\" he whispered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby jumped a little and blushed, \"No, he didn't!\" she said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I must've heard him wrong, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How did I...? What happened...?\" he asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby knocked you out with her farts!\" Elena bluntly said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ELENA!\" Ruby shouted, glaring at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got back to my place and set you on the couch here. You were only gone for a few moments.\" Guthrie said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jeremy, I am SO SO sorry! I-I didn't mean to-!\" Ruby stammered in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby, its alright. There is no need to get yourself worked up over this. Being around you guys, I expected this would happen sooner or later. I'm not mad at you or anything.\" Jeremy said to Ruby with a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sis, lighten up. Jeremy doesn't care if we fart around him. He said it makes us unique and he's impressed by it, remember?\" Elena added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, Jeremy has an impressive resistance to Fartmeister gas, and that'll only get better the more he is exposed to it.\" Guthrie also added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for me its different! You guys are friends with him, so you don't have to worry about...\" Ruby blushed and couldn't finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're his girlfriend and you feel self-conscious around him, right?\" Elena finished for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Ruby wasn't going to say she was Jeremy's \"girlfriend\", but her sister was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know how that is, Elena. What about when you first met Kyle?\" Guthrie said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, but I didn't need to feel embarrassed about it once I found out he was fine with it like Jeremy is! It has less to do with Jeremy and more to do with Ruby and embracing who she is!\" Elena said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it will just have to be a gradual process, but I know she can do it.\" Jeremy said to Ruby with a smile, which made her smile too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of gas, that Mexican food is really kicking in! I don't think I can hold it in any more!\" Elena groaned, standing up and clutching her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh!\" Guthrie playfully exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy was prepared for the young Fartmeister's shameless blast. Ruby wanted to be annoyed with her sister, but she knew she would have to accept that gassy outbursts was a part of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well two years ago, there was this basketball tournament hosted here. Jeremy and I were kind of friendly rivals and both of our teams made it real far. The prob is that the tournament was going to last for the entire week and I lived, like, two hours away. So rather than having to drive ALLLLLL the way there and ALLLLLLL the way back the next day, I figured I'd ask Jerms if I could just crash out at his place. He and his folks wre super nice about it and let me. Heck, they even made tacos one night!

This...town has like, a mall, right?\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...mall? How about the park?\" Jeremy wasn't sure the mall was the best idea for meeting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine. Its all settled then! So now I gotta ask for a little origin story here. Jerms, I'll assume you know these two girls?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they are sisters and they moved here a few months ago. They and their cousin are good friends...Well, Ruby is more than...We're actually together.\" Jeremy said, him and Ruby blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHA!

All of the grass in a wide area around it was either missing or dead. The trees around it were missing all of their leaves, and were either burned to a crisp, blown to bits, reduced to what could only be described as mulch, or uprooted completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whooooooa! Did a meteor crash here?!\" Ryan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anything like this.\" Jeremy said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Elena looked at one another and giggled; they knew it was no meteor, but something just as destructive! Corey really needed to meet those two sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you bring us out here for, Ryan?\" Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, is there somewhere more...uhh, green?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group walked further from the park and reached a clear area of medium-sized trees that were spaced out a little from each other, being planted there a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Ryan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is it you wanted?\" Elena asked, slightly impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, girls, get ready for this! I dunno if you two can...stomach it, but if we're all gonna be friends, its better ya know now, cuz you'll find out anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Elena glanced at each other. Did he mean...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Ryan lifted his right leg a little and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFFFFFFVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVTTTTTTTT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan ripped a long fart that came in the form of a faint green smog. The visible fumes spreaded out through the trees behind him, killing all of the leaves, if not burning them off completely, and causing the trees themselves to decay. His gas continued to spread, and although it eventually faded out away from him and sparing the foliage further away, the gas around the group seemed to remain still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for it!\" Ryan said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRPPPPPPP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a big, bassy, booming blast of green smog erupted from his butt, sending out a powerful wave of stench that either briefly caught the trees on fire before they exploded into burnt splinters, blowing them into bits of ash, or just tearing them right out of the ground where they crashed with a loud thud that was barely audible over Ryan's thunderous fart. The force of the fart managed to blow most of his previous fumes away, being more strength than smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan looked at Jeremy, who was plugging his nose and grinning. He then looked at Ruby and Elena, who were just staring. After a moment, the boy's proud smile faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh man, I REALLY made a bad move, Jerms! I shoulda known better than to share my secret with people I totally JUST met! I just wanted your friends to like me. I...I don't wanna make things super-weird with us all, so I'll just, like, leave.\" lamented Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Don't go, Ryan!\" Elena exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we hardly got to know each other.\" Ruby added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So even with what I just did, you...don't...mind it?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind it?! Ryan, that was SO AMAZING!\" Elena said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah, you're really good.\" Ruby said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REALLY?! You guys LIKE my powerful gas?! I...I thought Jeremy was the only one in the whole world who would!\" Ryan said, instantly shifting back to his usual demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought our family were the only ones in the whole world who could do that.\" Ruby said, referring to both Ryan and Corey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, HOLLLLLD up a moment!

Well...thats because-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shes talking about THIS!\" Elena cut off her sister with a hint of annoyance that Ruby wasn't getting to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPPPPLLLLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBBBBBTTTTTTT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl pointed her butt at a tree behind her and blasted a bubbly fart that blew a huge hole right through the tree and all of the trees behind it. With the lack of support, the tree behind her fell straight back and knocked all of the trees behind it down like dominoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena looked at Ruby and nodded; the older girl knew she had to demonstrate too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little smile, Ruby pointed her butt at a tree behind her and released an SBD potent enough to cause it and the nearby trees to wilt and decay into mulch-like piles in a near instant, as well as burning up the grass around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was the one who was super surprised now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so almost everyone in our family has the condition of super-gas. We've had to move lots of times because of it, but I hope this is the last time.\" Ruby explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially since our house here is Fartmeister-proof!\" Elena added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Ryan, what do you think?\" Jeremy asked with a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan covered his face with his fists and rapidly stomped the ground. He made a noise of excitement that slowly got higher pitched. He finally bursted into pure joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AGGGGGGHH! OH MY GOSH, THATS SO CRAZY AMAZING!!

I would feel SOOOO low if you had to leave because of me being reckless!\" Ryan said in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Ryan. Even if we DID go to the mall, We would warn you about this. I knew you wanted to...show off your...talent, and maybe the girls did too, so thats why the outskirts of the park was perfect.\" Jeremy calmly told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we can still freely pass gas! We just have to be at the right places!\" Elena said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For example: By our house, over here, somewhere nobody ever goes to, or at our cousins place.\" Ruby explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean your COUSIN has your ability?!\" Ryan asked, excited again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, but hes more responsible with it, just like our mom is. Neither of them are against blasting gas, but they aren't as wild about it as you, I, or Corey are.\" Elena told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corey? Is that-? Um, wait, or...or Ruby, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis is kind of a mixed bag. Around her family or Corey, shes got no issues with it. Around Jeremy, which I'm gonna guess unfortunately goes for you too, since you'd be hanging out with him a lot, she gets self-conscious and shyer than usual.\" Elena said with a hint of monotone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena!\" Ruby said through gritted teeth and blushing slightly. Elena just totally layed into her in front of their new friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she is getting better at it!\" Jeremy quickly added in Ruby's defense, also seeing Elena's words as a bit harsh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it makes sense, though! She likes Jerms and doesn't want him to think she is gross or a freak! Well, take it from ME, Ruby: Jeremy has no problemo with ANY of it! I mean, if he did, I don't think he would date you!\" Ryan said in understanding, but receiving a light punch in the side from Jeremy for the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I know he doesn't care, and I know he is even impressed by it...but still, its...I guess its more me than him. My cousin and Elena are confident I'll become more...confident about it, and I believe so too. I want to become comfortable with it around you guys, and just in general, but it...takes time is all...\" Ruby admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jerms and I are confident you will too! I'll tell you something about me that'll make you feel better, I bet! Back where I used to live, I also made sure nobody outside my family knew about my gas. It wasn't easy, because I felt like I was lying to myself and I never felt a hundred-percent accepted. Well when I stayed with Jerms, I knew he had to know. Jerms was weirded out and surprised at it, which I totes understood, but he didn't judge me for it! He knew there was more to me than that, and he even said it was an impressive talent! THATS what gave me the super-confidence to be myself! When you hide all who you are, your lying to yourself more than your lying to everybody else! Be proud of who you are, Ruby!\" Ryan said to her in a somewhat-serious tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Ryan. That DOES make me feel A LOT better.\" Ruby said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains why you weren't completely shocked back at Guthrie's place!\" Elena said in realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does...does that mean if you didn't meet Ryan, you wouldn't...you wouldn't LIKE us?!\" Ruby asked fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! Even if I never met Ryan, which I am very glad wasn't the case, I would feel the same way as I did with him. Its just a trait you all have, and it wouldn't be fair if thats the only part of you guys I looked at.\" Jeremy said, hugging Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Jeremy ain't the judgmental type of guy!\" added Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ryan. When you let Jeremy in on your secret, did you like...blow the roof off his house or peel off all of the wallpaper or something?\" Elena asked with a grin, changing the subject to something more light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan laughed at her question. \"No way, Elena! I revealed it to him outside and away from everyone! The only thing that happened was Jerms passed out before he could take it all in! He became resistant to it after some pranks-slash-exposure over the following days! Even after the night of tacos, I managed to unleash my vengeful explosion from a safe distance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNEW thats why you liked tacos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thats not the ONLY reason, but its a big reason! Thats why I call that second blast my vengeful explosion! Its the tacos powering me up as a...well, a downside for everyone else as punishment!\" Ryan explained enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...title doesn't make much sense, Ryan.\" Ruby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to explain that to him, Ruby, but he just likes the name.\" Jeremy said, shaking his head with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah! I don't care. So, um, you guys, now that we know everything and are totally tight, what now?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could introduce you to our cousin! We were there yesterday, but I bet he'd like to meet you, Ryan.\" Ruby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you two are actually kind of alike.\" Jeremy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then its settled! I've got a car, but it can only handle one kind of gas! Its part of the reason I don't go to Taco Bell as much as I'd like to. If you girls need to empty out YOUR gas tanks, let it all out.\" Ryan warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Never seen you in my quarters.\" Guthrie said jokingly to Ryan, holding up a hand in a 'stop' gesture in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm-I'm Ryan. I'm Jeremy's longtime friend, and I just moved here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just moved in, huh? Welp I think you'll like it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already DO! Today has been like, the greatest day EVER for me!\" Ryan exclaimed, feeling more welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a surprise, since you must know my cousins well enough for them to introduce you to yours truly. Ah! Where in the heck are my manners? I'm Guthrie Fartmeister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuthrie expected Ryan to offer a handshake, but was pleasantly surprised when he also had the mind of greeting people with high-fives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think you and I are off to be fast friends!\" Guthrie said to Ryan with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! For totally sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Again, I'm forgetting my manners today. Guthrie, you're not being the best host here...Have a seat at any of the couches with the others, Ryan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan took a spot on the large couch were Ruby and Jeremy were at, with Guthrie and Elena in two of the armchairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ryan, you knew Jeremy for a long time, but how did you meet my cousins? Did Jeremy introduce you?\" Guthrie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I gotta make a call, I'll be back.\" Elena said quickly before briskly walking to the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I actually didn't even know Jeremy was here until later! Ruby was the first one I met since both of us were, like, recent arrivals and all. At lunch...which I'm still surprised just happened to serve tacos, I met Elena. THEN Jerms showed up and things only got better from there on!\" Ryan said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little bit ago we were all at the park where...sort of the same thing that happened here with me happened there with them.\" Jeremy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...do you mean?\" Guthrie asked in confusion, adjusting his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby, Elena, and I literally let everything out to each other!\" Ryan said, rewording Jeremy's fumbled statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold a tic...What do you mean by 'and I'? Do you just happen to be...?\" Guthrie leaned in, very curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Ryan boasted, jumping up to his feet. \"What about YOU?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I AM a Fartmeister, aren't I?\" Guthrie boasted right back, also standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys about to do what I think you're about to do?!\" Elena said excitedly, running back to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She said she wanted me to meet someone? Are you um...?\" Corey was caught off guard a little; not expecting someone other than Elena or maybe Ruby to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New faces popping up left and right at my pad today! Come right in, Elena, Ruby, Jeremy, and Ryan are inside!\" Guthrie greeted, stepping to the side. Corey was now confused; half of those names he never even heard of, plus this guy who lived here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey sat down on the smaller couch, Elena took the spot next to him, and Guthrie sat back down at one of the armchairs. Ruby, Ryan, and Jeremy were across from them and looked surprised to see Corey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...I thought you wanted to meet just ONE person?\" Corey said to Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did! Its just Ryan you don't know, right? I guess you maybe haven't seen Guthrie in person yet...? You HAD to have met Jeremy, right?\" Elena was also confused now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess Guthrie is the one who lives here, right? But which one is Ryan...? And Jeremy...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up! Sis, have you seriously not had Corey meet anyone else?!\" Elena exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were now on Ruby, whose face started to turn a bright shade of red and whose stomach started to churn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its me! I'm Ryan!\" Ryan said, raising his hand. He didn't know Corey at all, but he did know that Ruby was in one heck of a terrible position now and wanted to stop all the tension. \"You're right that Guthrie is the guy who lives here; he greeted you. The fit guy here is Jeremy. Guthrie is Ruby's and Elena's cousin, Jeremy is my long-time friend and Ruby's boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cousin? Boyfriend? Ruby, should I know these guys already or something?\" Corey asked, adding suspicion atop confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not me! I just moved here!\" Ryan said, coming to both his and Ruby's defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just moved here and you know everyone else already? I've known Ruby for a few weeks, and this is the first time I've even heard your names!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan covered his mouth, realizing he just made things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby are you...ashamed of me?\" Corey asked, feeling rather hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! Of course I'm not, Corey!\" Ruby exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how come I've never met your other friends?...Even though we are rivals, I still always thought that meant...we were friends too.\" the normally confident and somewhat-prideful Corey felt awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ARE, Corey! Its just I'm...\" Ruby realized that her whole confidence issue with her gas wasn't just hurting herself, it was hurting other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rivals in what? Studying?\" Guthrie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that too.\" Elena said somewhat quietly. She didn't intend for this meeting to turn out like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Ruby spoke up. \"No! In farting.\" she said with confidence. The others looked at her, either due to her reveal, her sudden shift in attitude, or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've found a non-Fartmeister you like to compete with?!\" Guthrie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Ruby!\" Jeremy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then-then that means Corey and I-! And you girls-! And Guthrie-! GAH! I'm gonna use up all the good days I'll ever have in my entire LIFE because of this one!\" Ryan exclaimed, wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese reactions lifted Corey's mood a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corey, lemme ease things up for you.\" Guthrie began. \"Ruby here, well, shes shy around new people, especially if they are boys, and especially ESPECIALLY if they are boys she has an eye out for. This nervousness, well, it really jumpstarts her gas, and just the social stigma of that in her mind just makes things worse. These build off of each other until it blows right out of her! The results aren't exactly in her favor in the eyes of most guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey scoffed. \"You're kidding me, right? So you're saying the reason Ruby hasn't introduced me to any of you is because she's actually self-conscious about her gas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less, yeah.\" Guthrie said with a shrug at Corey's oversimplification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats crazy! There is no way someone like Ruby has any shame about her blasts! We had a fart contest almost as soon as we met! If we hadn't the mind to leave there, then I bet Ruby would have leveled the school with her gas bomb rather than that abandoned building!\" Corey protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis explosive reveal of Ruby's explosives caused Jeremy and Guthrie to look at Ruby in awe, and Elena and Ryan to grin hugely, even if the latter of the two was just as uninformed about this as the other two males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention she introduced me to Elena afterward, proudly offered a 3-man rematch, and was grinning and having just as much fun as her sister and I were when we turned a part of the park into an impact site!\" Corey added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy and Guthrie were in even more shock now, the latter's glasses nearly falling off of his face. Ryan's and Elena's grins just got bigger, the former's eyes looking like they were about to pop right out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is all of this really true, Ruby?\" Jeremy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah.\" Ruby said with a sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Ruby! Thats VERY awesome and VERY impressive!\" Jeremy exclaimed, hugging her. Guthrie jumped up and applauded her, while Ryan grabbed a pillow and let out a muffled scream of joy and excitement into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Ryan guy is...a little weird, isn't he?\" Corey said to Elena, who nodded a little in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JERMS! That crater we saw today wasn't made by a meteor! It was made by something WAAAAAAAY better! We should find somewhere else that would make a sweet contesting ground and the 5 of us would turn it into a, like, MASSIVE crater or just totally level it, with YOU as the judge, Jerms!!\" Ryan babbled excitedly, shaking Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like his energy!\" Guthrie said to Corey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan then suddenly shifted gears, remembering how this whole conversation even began, and turned to Corey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corey, I hope you aren't upset with Ruby, Jeremy, me, or anyone else here. Elena told me about how Ruby is like. She even said you were specifically one of the people she don't have issues with breaking wind! I'm guessing it might be ME thats a different story cuz of Jeremy, who makes her shyer than usual. She knows that Jerms likes it and that he doesn't care, so its nothing against you or Jerms. Shes just not fully confident about it yet.\" Ryan explained with a more serious and understanding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, I never would've guessed that from her. I guess theres not really any reason to be mad at anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! All the secrets are out of the way again, and everyone is in a good mood! Whats next?\" Guthrie asked the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is just the start, Fartmeister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena spent the time, trying to find a way to get out of the situation. She decided on a method that she thought might work. Although, it involved farting to distract Tammy. After taking like... The 40th fart around the halfway point of the movie, it was time for Elena to execute her plan. She raised her hips slightly so that Tammy hopefully wouldn't notice. Unfortunately for our poor Elena Fartmeister, Tammy indeed noticed. The bully would cup her hands on Elena's ass as she farted and, in a quick motion, put her hands on Elena's nose as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm- ack!\u201d Elena thought she was free as soon as Tammy got up, only to be greeted by her own foul smelling fart that was supposed to help her.

If you try to resist... Ooh boy... I will hit you... With a stronger fart... Hnnng.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy's stomach was grumbling as she spoke, realizing that she would release a fart that would prove her point. Once it came out, it was unlike the farts that she previously released. It was foul and strong and it would linger on for a while. Elena coughed and gagged like crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate this...

This was fitting, since her broken wind caused all the grass to shake and arch backward, but only for a brief moment as her potent odor caused the grass to wither and die, turning the pristene clearing into a flattened area of dead and brown grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena, with a huge grin, and Kyle applauded Ruby's feat, who performed a curtsy in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully a fire doesn't break out here.\" Kyle joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about a fire, Kyle...Because I think ignited Fartmeister gas would result in an atomic explosion instead!\" Ruby said with a wink, which made Elena and Kyle laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got anything else, sis?\" Elena asked, happy to see Ruby enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Ruby looked around and spotted a large lake in the distance. \"Yeah, follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached the lake and Ruby turned away from it.

All of that was nothing compared to her fart being so strong that, like a storm, it formed all of the water in the lake into a massive wave. The wave washed over to the shore on the other side and crashed down, soaking the landscape and uprooting several trees, not just from the strength of the water, but from the strength (and smell) of the girl that caused it. When all was said and done, the lake was nothing more than an empty pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long pause in absolute shock, Elena and Kyle cheered, holding hands and jumping.

For several minutes hot dry gas escaped the little girls back side as she shook her butt back and forth fanning out the thick clouds of stench she was producing all around herself. It didn't take long for Ruby and Kyle to realize what Elena was doing, the thin clouds of steam mixed with her gas as Elena's 10 minutes long fart dried out the riverbed.<br>\r\n\"Well what do you think about that? You're not the only one who can change the landscape.\" Elena said.<br>\r\n\"No but I'm apparently the only one who can do so without getting stuck, look down sis.\" Ruby replied suppressing a chuckle.<br>\r\nElena looked down at her feet and realized immediately what her sister was talking about. Her feet had sunk into the mud of the lakebed up past her ankles and now that that mud was dry and hardened she was completely stuck. Surprised and embarrassed by her mistake Elena lost her balance and fell backwards onto her butt. Beet red from embarrassment Elena growled before biting her lip.<br>\r\nFFFFFFFFFBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBBBBBBBPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\nElena's next fart was truly bomb like and kicked up so much dirt from the now dry riverbed that the little girl was obscured by the dust cloud.

The ground shaking gasblasts growing closer together until they were one continuous monstrous fart which shook the former Lake to such an extent that Ruby and Kyle could feel the vibrations through the soles of their feet.<br>\r\n\"Elena?\" Ruby said with growing concern for both her now obscured sibling and said siblings unrestrained usage of her superpowered gas. Ruby stepped closer to the edge of the lakebed as she reached the lip the shaking ground gave way beneath her and she tumbled down the slope with a yelp of surprise.<br>\r\n\"Ruby!\" The fart immediately cut off and Elena came running out of the dust cloud fearful that her sister had been hurt. \"Are you okay?!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" Ruby said getting up and dusting off her clothing. \"It was just a little tumble.\"<br>\r\n\"That's a relief.\" Elena said her normal cheerful demeanour returning. \"Guess you can't say my farts aren't as impressive as yours anymore.\"<br>\r\nRuby smiled down at her younger sister and...</span></div></div>",

This isn't the only day of our lives this can happen, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Kyle really did not want to take sides in this argument. He could go either way at this point, and Elena and Ruby did have a very incredible talent and sweet sisterly bond. Plus Elena was, well, she was cute. \"Lets...just get some ice-cream first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena, Kyle, and Ruby went into the parlor, gave their orders, and enjoyed their ice-cream.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The perfect fart slave falls into your asses, but we have to deal with her gasshole family.\" Elena moaned as she sniffed the fart and felt the warm air encompass her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina's stomach grumbled. \"Hey, Tally,\" she said catching the farting girl's attention, \"I really gotta fart, and if you don't want me to use Lucy's face or yours, get up so I can fart in Fartlicker's face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTally puffed her cheeks in annoyance at Nina before ripping a massive ass blast on't Elena's face, getting off her, and motioning for Nina to go walking over to a giggling Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Nina spread her ass cheeks as she squatted over Elena's face, leapt up, and crashed ass first onto Elena's face jamming it straight into her crevice to the point where her cheeks touched the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that feels so good.\" Nina moaned in pleasure as Elena's face filled her crack just right, her nose directly on her hole. \"But not as good as THIS.\" She said before crunching her face for a moment and letting out a minute long tuba fart that smelled as bad as Tally's. Nina was gasping from the escatsy she was receiving from ripping the fart, and stayed seated on Elena's face even after it ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You liked that didn't you Fartlicker?\" She said as she stood up, her ass coming of Elena's face with a pop. \"Better than anything you could rip, huh?\" She turned around to see Elena's face. \"Bet you want more, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena never answered because her eyes were closed, face was flushed with red, and was wearing a content smile. She was unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Tally got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Fartmeister Home)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doorbell rang, Julie opened clad in nothing but a night robe that hid her almost nude body. What she saw before her was nothing short of strange, even by her family's standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was unconscious, arms slung over the shoulders of a long black haired girl with purple eyes, fair skin, and in a black tank top, blue short shorts that exposed her large ass, and black sandles, and taller red haired girl with light skin, blue eyes, and wearing a green t-shirt that was two sizes too small, and blue jeans cut to make them short shorts. Aside them was Tally, who wore a white pajama shirt and purple panties, and had ripped and torn white pajama pants in hand. And the short brown haired, orange eyed, and black nightgown wearing Lucy was carrying Elena's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Miss Fartmeister, I'm Tally.\" Tally said jovially. \"I'm a new friend of Elena's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's tired eyed widened at that. \"Friend?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, friend.\" Tally said. \"She was at my house with me and my friends, and we got into a fart contest.\" Her eye twitched at what was to happen next, not that Julie noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Julie said with a giggle, remembering some fart contest that Ruby and Elena had. \"Well who won?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\" Said the black haired girl with pride. \"Face was right up my butt, in between these cheeks,\" she slapped her ass cheeks, \"and gave that face of hers a taste of some REAL gas.\" Nina smugly smiled at the fact that she farted Elena unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie covered her mouth in an attempt to muffle her giggling, the only people who've managed to knock Elena unconscious with their farts were herself, Ruby, and her best friend from a previous town, Dani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll, I hope you were looking for a relationship.\" Julie said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTally and Nina looked at her in a mixture of confusion and intrigue. \"Why?\" They asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elena falls in love with people who knock her out with their farts.\" Julie said with a teasing wink. \"It's a mental condition that strangely only effect second borns in the family, I was lucky to be a third born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTally and Nina blushed at this information. Tally because she now had someone who loved her for her gas, and would probably marry her for it, something she's always wanted and farted on Kyle for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Nina because she now had someone to be her permanent fart bitch, and lover. Everyone in town, besides her and her friends, who was a farter was a dominator wannabe, and she hated that. Now she had someone who was a farter, and submissive after being knocked out with her gas. She longed for someone who loved to fart simply because she loved farting and love her gas, and now she had that person partly slung over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie speaking up broke the two out of their stupors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting late, and Ruby is sleeping over at the house of a new friend she made. So why don't you all sleep in Elena's room tonight?\" She offered. :Her bed is big enough, and judging by her expression, she won't be up 'til morning at breakfast time. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, after some drinks of water, the five were sleeping in Elena's queen sized bed with Elena between Tally and Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned for a while.</span></div></div>",

The relationship was the best thing that could happen. Tally would look at Elena and kiss her cheek. Nina notices this and she just looked in the direction of Tally. Now is the time to talk about future plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do? I knocked her out with my fart but she loves your farts a lot more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTally would smile and plant another smooch onto Elena's cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.

It's the infamous Dutch Oven! They pulled the blanket back to see that Elena was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that wonderful smell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTally smiled as she heard Elena's voice. Nina also had that same smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a combo of the farts from me and Nina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTally would look in Elena's direction and get close to her for a kiss. That was when the door opened, revealing it to be Julie. The timing was like something out of a movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry if I'm disturbing your sleep with my loud buttocks. The gas has to come out somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiled as she got out of bed and hugged her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom. May I have a good night fart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? But you didn't like them before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I do. So can I have one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie would hesitate slightly as she hears her daughter's request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTally and Nina watched as Elena moved her head towards Julie's large and plump ass, covered in pajamas now instead of a robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure about this Elena? This will be your final warning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sure about it. Let it rip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce those words came out, Julie released a 5 minute stinks right into Elena's face. Tally and Nina watched as their future wife took in the large and very stinky fart, eventually waking Maya and Lucy. The bullies watched as the matriarch of the Fartmeisters released a long fart into Elena's face. Once the fart concluded, another one commences soon after, this time, being 2 minutes long. The bullies just continued to watch Elena taking in the behemoth of a fart. The fart concluded and Elena kisses Julie's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie would look at the bullies and smile, knowing that Nina will make a great wife for Elena. She wanted to join in their little sleepover but she wanted to spare them from her large amount of gas. Julie closes the door and Elena would look at the bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry you had to see that. I may be in love with farts, but especially Nina's and Tally's. The night's still young.

So they're in a new town, and they've moved into a house built to withstand their farts, so they can break wind without damaging the surrounding area.This is about their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie Fartmeister:(37 years old) a housewife who is sweet, calm and kind. She\u2019s tall, plump, pear shaped, and has a cuddly exterior. Out of the three, she possesses the most control over her flatulence. Though her husband Daniel is almost always away on business, they have a strong bond and neither of them has considered cheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby Fartmeister:(15 years old) Easily described as a hot nerd, she is smart, focused and a hard worker. Ruby has bouncing D-Cup breasts and as round bubble butt. But doesn\u2019t like wearing revealing clothes, she prefers to be bundled up rather than showing off. She wears glasses and can usually be found in the library with her nose in a book. She lacks complete control over her flatulence, and can unleash a destructive fart when angry or nervous. She was no experience with boys, and hopes to find a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena Fartmeister: (11 years old) The youngest member of the family. A spunky little girl who tends to speak her mind. She isn\u2019t embarrassed or ashamed about her flatulence at all. She thinks it\u2019s funny, and will fart whenever she feels like it. Believe it or not, her favorite phrase is \u201cCut the cheese\u201d.Most people don\u2019t want to be around her, so she doesn\u2019t have any friends. So after moving, she hopes to find a real friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't a sex story, it's more like a humor story. Imagine three women who can fart with enough force to blow holes in brick walls or blow leaves off trees. Or it smells so bad it can peel paint or melt metal. This is all about the everyday lives of these people. If it goes far enough, I might turn this into a real story on fictionpress.</td>",
