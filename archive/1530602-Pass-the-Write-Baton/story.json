Judging from my previous history, I can only guess the sketchy future. Whether there'll be nothingness or glory, I do not know. Glory or existence versus non-existence will surface from this cat and mouse chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sensed this monster's existence rather early in my life. I know how he works. I know how he likes to give slight warnings, although only sometimes. I know how he likes to feel my tension, my discomfort, my hurt, and how an intimidating look of relief forms on his hideous, vile face, a look that extols his sacred bond with cruelty, but is he really cruel? Or is he something else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI always wished he'd make one sudden, final leap to do away with what's left of me, but no. A monster likes to play with his prey. He will never choose the least hurtful way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his final toss, he'll imply something, some kind of an offer, maybe the promise of another existence, but who can trust an underhanded monster? I wouldn't trust any information I could sneak out of him if I tried, although I am eaten up with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I'll stick around and wait, for the omen of stormy weather lurks in the air, and the first gales have already reached me. Is this a warning?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An airy chill came through, and he bundled his jacket a little closer, letting smoke drift between his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina winter had been, was, and always would be an untimely thing for him; it was never the great heralder of blizzards such with his native New York, nor merely non-existant; some years it came, some years fall lingered through a cold spell, and teetered off sometime past where spring ought to have been. This year had luckily been the former, and the office had shut down; North Carolina was like that, too. In a city of near enough to a million, some bright mind had decided to buy a half dozen snow-plows, and only buy road-salt when it was abosolutely necessary-- the ice storm in '02 had nearly shut the center of the state down, and the rest of the displaced Yankees couldn't help but chuckle now and then at the sheer pandemonium raised up on account of a little snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered his father's comments at times like this. \"You quit your bitchin', kid.\" the old man had always said, half playfully, half ready to knock some sense into his head. \"In my day, we walked through the snow, uphill both ways, and didn't complain one bit!\" The old man had a harsh tone after Korea. Coughing into a closed fist, he supposed their winters were a bit colder over there-- if he was ever drafted, he recalled thinking in high school, he would make damn sure it would be to a tropical climate like Vietnam. Tapping ash into an empty coffee mug, he reconsidered that thought. Indeed, he was glad he had graduated after that whole mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took one last drag and exhaled eleven minutes above his head, feeling a little warmer from the memories as he snubbed the life out of the cigarette. </span></div></div>",

Before our small New England town banned the fires, the smell of leaves burning was like perfume to me.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nFirst, my friends and I would help Dad rake the fallen leaves into piles just at the edge of Cottage Street where we lived.  I use the term \"help\" loosely, since we kids spent more time running and jumping into the leaves than working with Dad to make neat piles.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nOnce the pile was finally ready, Dad would always say, \"Stand back so you don't get burned!\" This was the magic sentence, after which he bent and poked a lit match into the edge of the pile.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWaiting for the flame to catch, we kids stood on the nearby sidewalk waiting for that first wisp of smoke.  Soon, that tiny bit of smoke became flames, and that special time of the year began in earnest.  The dancing flames threw out embers that rose high into the air.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nCars drove through and messed up the smoke drifting out across the road. Usually the people inside smiled as they shared the aroma of burning leaves.  Most knew soon they would be doing this same autumn ritual near their own homes. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe best part burning leaves was the smell! There is no way to fully describe that wonderful fragrance. Even after all these years, though, I can close my eyes and that acrid odor rushes into my nose once more.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't think that memory will ever leave me.<br>\r\nI was raised in a little town, just outside Bethel. A quaint, pretty little town, with all the things people would expect in a small town. A church, a schoolhouse, a grocer--everything you'd ever want in a little town.<br>\r\nAnd then came the Baron.<br>\r\nOne day, me and my friends were playing in the schoolyard, and then we heard them. Dozens of them. Big, armored vehicles came rolling into town, along the main street. I'd never seen anything like it. We all rushed to the fence, and stared, our eyes wide.<br>\r\nThen we saw him, standing atop the largest vehicle, surveying out little town.<br>\r\nEven now, after all these years, I can't get the image of him out of my head. That man...that \"Baron\".<br>\r\nBaron Faron 4. That's the name I could see, so boldly imprinted across his rumbling armored vehicle. Dressed in all white, he looked unlike any human I'd ever seen. He was 50 yards away, yet I could still map out every crease in his face, every fold in his skin--he had the hardened look of a man who'd spent his life around things most people pretended didn't happen.<br>\r\nThe rest, though, is a blur. At some point, we were in the car, speeding out of town. At another point, we were at a blockade, then we were back in town, heading out the other way. But as we left, I looked out the window.<br>\r\nMy mother tried to stop me--she ordered us to keep our heads down, not to look at our home.<br>\r\nBut I did. How could I not? I had no idea what was going on.<br>\r\nOur entire town was ablaze. Our home, that humble little house where I'd grown up, the yard where I'd played, the schoolhouse where I'd first kissed Maddy Winchester, furtively, in a bathroom--all of it, ablaze.<br>\r\nStanding, watching it all burn, was the Baron. He was wearing a gas-mask, so I couldnt see his face, but that suit--that gleaming white suit, even the smoke wouldn't stain it.<br>\r\nHe looked at us as we drove by, and though I never saw his eyes, I know he was looking right at me.<br>\r\nAs we rounded the bend, seconds before he dropped out of sight forever, I saw him give me a thumps-up.<br>\r\nI still see him, every time I so much as smell a cigarette. That gleaming suit, that alien, inhuman mask, standing against my burning home, my burning town. Giving me a thumps-up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It sits, abandoned, with an overgrown, dead lawn and its windows, the plaintive, glassy eyes of the bungalow, staring out at the world, wondering, \"What has happened to my family?  Why do I feel so empty?\"  For it once knew the laughter of children in a neighborhood of senior citizens, the warmth of fires in the brick fireplace, and heard tales told to sleepy children ears so that they may sleep, the little eyes awakening the next morning to the glorious sight of virgin snow in a climate that hardly varied from between forty to sixty degrees Fahrenheit year-round.  That old, derelict house once was my home in childhood, a place I shall never forget.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even having been moved away for four years has not scrubbed the indelible stain from either my heart or my being.  After a day of grocery shopping, my mother, sisters, and I were driving home when we saw a beautiful rainbow arcing across the sky in front of us.  Delighted by the sight, we savored the presence of color splashed against the gray clouds of life when stopped at a red light.  Then, my mother made the discovery.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As if not thinking, she had gone the route she had traveled what had seemed to be a million times when we were small, back when that ancient house had rang with laughter and play and high-pitched voices, things of the past that are nothing but dim memories and ghostly echoes.  And, the rainbow stretching across the sky ended at none other than the dear, dilapidated bungalow that I still love and cherish to this day--the pot of gold at the rainbow's end.</span></div></div>",

My heart was thudding so loud I thought she should hear it.<br>\r\n\"Sleep well my child. Tomorrow is Christmas .\"<br>\r\nI tremulously dared a glance across the room at my little sister. Janie was there snuggled up in her pink blanket.<br>\r\n\"Are you asleep?\" she whispered. In the semi darkness she looked angelic. Tears came to my eyes as I said,\"Not yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,let's go,\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Go where?\" I asked her.<br>\r\n\"To run away Dummy! You said nobody would think kids would run away on Christmas Eve\"<br>\r\nWide eyed I stared into the gloom. Why would I choose to leave this paradise of childhood?<br>\r\n\"I,I can't go tonight,\" I stammered,\" I'm too sick.\"<br>\r\n\"Sick! What kind of sick? You were fine at supper,\" she said in a hoarse whisper.<br>\r\n\"It's my stomach,\" I lied,\" It really hurts bad,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay perfectly still as the truth hit me,I was being given a second chance. That Christmas Eve we ran away had changed our lives forever.<br>\r\nJanie threw off her blanket and came over to gaze at me. \"Are you just trying to ditch me again? Well it won't work. If you are going to leave you have to take me with you.\"<br>\r\nI wanted to smile. It was so wonderful just to see her again with her feisty ways.<br>\r\nI tried to remember why I had wanted to run away. Nothing seemed that important to me now. How could I have chosen to leave my loving family and run off into the snowy night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanie explained it for me then,\"Don't you remember how mad you were when Daddy said you couldn't have a BB gun for Christmas? All your friends are getting them this year.\"<br>\r\nYes,that was it. That was the big deal breaker. I ruined all our lives over a BB gun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leaning against the cold concrete streetlight, straining my eyes against the blur of snow and empty blackness that lurked beyond my lamplight circle, I ignore the numbing cold that seeps in through my jacket, quieting my restless movements. Somewhere beneath the thick blanket of night my friend blunders, unable to find her way. I can faintly hear her disorientated cries; but I try notto acknowlege those sounds that tug at my heart. A solitary tear slowly freezes on my cheek as I wait, willing her to find her way into my safe sphere of lamplight, but I know the cold eats away at her will power, eroding the courage I admire so much. <br>\r\nShould I step out into the secretive dark and help her find her way? No, I think, feeling the familiar throb of fear grasp me as I contemplate dying in the soft, deadly snow. But I can't let her suffer the same sad fate. And if I stay here, protected from the creatures I am sure wait for me beyond my haven, I will still slowly freeze. A stab of guilt spikes within as I realise how selfish I am. All those kind words rendered hollow by this self-obsessed act of cruelty. Thus incensed against my own inaction, I step out of the circle, quelling my fear of the inexorable dark. Stumbling forth, hardly able to see through the snow and blackness, I turn back for a moment to look at the streetlight, and marvel at the silver silence that prevails. Then back to the suppressing night, to find my lost friend. Finally in the snow I find her, huddled up against the rough bark of an oak. Is she still breathing? I don't know, but I'll soon find out. Her frail frame seems light as I lift her, but the faint pulse I can feel tells the truth. <br>\r\nSuddenly the glaring brightness of my silver lamplight expands, drawing nearer. Help! I think, opening my mouth to speak and finding no words will come. It's low rumbling muffled by the snow, the ute pulls up beside us, and I carefully lower my friend onto the seat offered. In a thick, strangulated accent the driver mutters something,and I turn to look at him. Clearing his throat, he proceeds in a clearer voice: \"No more room. One of you has so sit on back\". He stares at me expectantly, and I shut the door on my friend and succumb to the inexorable cold.</span></div></div>",

There was a slight breeze brushing against my face, coming through a window most likely, but I could not see the landscape outside. The smell in the room was a strange combination of cleaning products and flowers. Where were the flowers? On the bedside table probably. Now, where was the table?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, I start to wriggle my fingers. One at a time they shake off the sleep and begin to explore the world. They brush the top of a scratchy sheet that covered me and find the edge of the bed. It ends abruptly in a hard plastic barrier that feels similar to the handrails on a playground structure. My hand crests the top and I grip the railing. My other hand finds the edge of the bed on the opposite side and I pull myself upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is something covering my face. I bring my hands to my eyes and feel some sort of cloth instead of skin. I feel for the edge of the bandage. There is was. Eager to get the pesky thing off my face I grip the edge and rip off the bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could now feel the breeze on my nose and forehead, but I could still not see. Worried, I feel my face again. My eyes were there. Nose too. Eyebrows, everything! Why could I still not see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! Glasses! I wore glasses. That's right. My eyes were terrible. I leaned over and fumbled around on the side table. There was nothing there. Great. Maybe it was on the other side. I leaned to the other side and reached my hands out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH!! Well, it seems I had found the flowers. Why were there flowers here anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, I heard a door open. A fresh gust of air hit my face and I turn towards the wind. Still, I couldn't see squat. I was starting to get angry. Who had taken my glasses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Meyers! What are you doing with your bandages off?\" The nurse sounded frantic. She then yelled to someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor! It's Meyers. Your blind pacient. Have you got anymore medication for him? He's woken up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlind! I wasn't blind! And who is this 'Doctor'? I wasn't in a hospital! I couldn't be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Meyers. Good morning. How did you sleep? Well I hope.\" That was the male voice, the doctor probably. \"I'm going to give you some more medicine now. Help you to sleep some more.

Golden afternoon light filters through aspen and pine, pooling on the needle carpet below. The air is dry and cool, evergreen-scented. I can hear birdsong and slight rustling--no doubt small forest animals--in the low bushes around me. I work quickly to unlatch the straps across my chest and legs and stand up from the chair, stretching briefly. A glance around the clearing reveals snowcapped mountains behind me, and a shallow, forested valley downslope. The clearing is fairly level, but it looks to drop off twenty or so feet ahead. Now I can hear the burble of a creek, and inhaling deeply of the mountain air, I smell heady odors of pine, grass, earth, and...ozone?<br>\r\nA slight whining sounds from my left before a beam of light lances a chunk out of the aspen next to my head. I instinctively throw myself backwards, manage to roll up to my feet and duck behind the metal chair. \"What the <i>fuck</i>?\" I spit through my teeth. A rough, strangely-accented voice calls out. \"Give up now, smooth-skin! Maybe we'll even let you live!\" A higher-pitched but equally gravelly voice adds, \"But not before we have a little fun!

I was given a towel and a guest size soap then I was ushered into a small cubicle with a bath in and the door being closed behind me. I must admit I took a book in with me and found this time and experience a memorable treasure in my life. I was happy away from the business of life. <br>\r\n We had oil lamps for light and shared a toilet at the bottom of the close, my dad cut old newspapers up  and put string through them for toilet paper.(Oh my!)<br>\r\n Walking to school each day was fun and we had to line up in the play ground, put our hands out and teacher would inspect us to see if we had clean nails and hands, tidy hair, tie straight and clean polished shoes. If not the consequence would be to write a hundred lines on cleanliness. <br>\r\n We would go to a hut in the summer holidays. My Granny owned one for each of the family and rented them out when we didn't need them. The hut was on wooden stilts with a wooden stair case on the side. We had gas stove  run on cylinders of gas and it was perched on an old wooden tea chest.<br>\r\nWe washed from a metal stand with an enamel basin on top, an enamel jug of water was on a metal shelf underneath  and on the side next to the basin was a pull out piece of metal to hold the towel and the other side had a soap holder.<br>\r\n We had to walk along  a path passing other huts and opening out into a sort of square pitch of grassed field with a water stand where we would fill our containers  with the days water. Someone there would always start a water fight and we returned home soaked and happy, giggling away in conversation.<br>\r\nWe had to walked along paths and across a field to get to the local group of three shops. (the sea was just across the road from the shops}. One shop was a laundry and the other was the grocery store come post office, come bakery. We would ask for our post if any! Then buy some hot, (just out of the oven) rolls and some bacon and eggs, then walk off back to our hut picking up coins that the inebriated had dropped out of there pockets the night before. I always new where to find some next to the amusements.<br>\r\nit was a simple and happy life and we had no worries.

The stream that flowed through Sabino Canyon supplied us with hydro-electricity for free as long as we could keep the turbine generating. It also was an unlimited source of all important water.  Water in Arizona was around but not everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       THE WAY THINGS ARE NOW not many people had any electricity and had found it really wasn't necessary to aid in the quality of today's lifestyle.  Like in the early 1800's, when the sun goes down so do we.  People still came from miles around though to watch and listen to the static coming through the radio as we fiddled with the knobs trying to hone in on a signal, none of us had heard for ten years and were pretty sure would never hear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        The ice came from blocks I brought down from Mt Lemon in the winter.  I had a giant ice box under the house and sold(traded/gave) some to neighbors and passersby.  No money anymore.  No cities either, all gone.  Many people tore themselves to pieces trying to survive on products that were no longer being produced.  When the canned goods were gone, so were they.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Fossil fuels, our addiction to the automobile in particular was our undoing!  It's funny now when one thinks about it rightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        In 1910, the car, the building of the roads it needed, Rockefeller's oil and the robber barons.  The assembly line.  Modern medicine/chemistry. Factories paying good money. Relatively overnight, everything changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         What had been an agricultural nation, rural farms using extended family structuring to make farming and a 60 hour work week financially feasible, ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         80% of America's population moved into cities where there were factories hiring.  Mo Town was born.  Motor City.  Detroit Wheels.  Chicago, the Windy City.  Families disintegrated, scattered becoming nuclear families with sometimes a father and a mother and 2.2 children.  Worse than that.  The mind numbing, backbreaking, repetitive labor, day after day, week after week turned a population into mindless robots<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Well here we are just over 110 years later without everything that my generation had no idea we would ever be without and took cellphones, computers, cars, running water, McDonalds, supermarkets and their supplies for granted.  Pluck a chicken, carry water?  Are you out of your mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         To tell the truth, myself and most of the survivors (all of them) are of one mind.  We've never felt this kind of satisfaction and peace before.  The friendships are solid and racism is gone.  No one is color blind but without exception anyone and everyone who survived did not do so without the help and trust of friends all making extreme sacrifices for others as the norm and not an exception, even to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         It feels like Eden returning. A restoration of all things. Could this be the fulfillment of the prophecy,\" And Babylon was gone in one hour?\" </span></div></div>",

It makes nice jewelry and doesn't pollute our oceans and streams like lead sinkers did when I used lead when fishing.  The fish like the shine off gold far better than lead.

How hollow I felt inside.<br>\r\n As if enough water wasn't falling outside, small drops of water formed at the edges of my eyes before trailing down my cheeks. An endless trail of sadness, words that were unspoken, that could not be spoken. I sat at this dreary window, watching the depressing weather outside, reflecting on life. How pointless it seemed now. Life, all that matters. Everything any human knows. Can be disrupted so easily by others. The day flashed in my mind again, the words that were spoken between us; the words that weren't spoken and should have been. <br>\r\n  Nothing helped less, than the fact that it was all my fault.

Her minuscule eyes, rimmed with pink, blinked up at me, tiny sapphires set in her wrinkled face.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That one's Little Ann,\" Mom said, setting a ramekin of milk among the baby blankets.  Annie pawed at one of my waist-length locks as it spilled over into her nest of warmth.  \"You know, like from <i>Where the Red Fern Grows</i>.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled, admiring the wriggling balls of fur and love.  \"Because she sits there and watches it with you when you stuff your face with Crunch N Munch!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Naturally.\"  Mom picked up the twin males in each of her hands.  I could only tell who the sickly one was because of the tiny bald spot at the tip of his tail.  \"What did I name these ones?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, Mom, <i>I</i> named the oldest Marco Polo, 'cause he was the first to wander away from the litter.\"  Stroking his nose with my finger, I set my hair against the hue that was so like his sister's fur.  The black rings around his dark eyes and nose reminded me of a raccoon or bandit.  \"Too bad he's such a scaredy-cat.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The other one's Tigger, then.\"  Mom set Tigger in my lap, pointing out the stripes that reminded us kids of his namesake.  \"Don't let your father know that I told you, but he's his favorite.  Tigger didn't breathe when he was born, and your father ended up doing mouth-to-muzzle to keep him alive.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, smiling at Mellissa's favorite.  \"I know Annie's yours,\" I said, replacing Tigger in the box for feeding, \"Tigger's Dad's, Marco's mine, and Gheradelli's Mellissa's....\"  The dark puppy, in stark contrast to Annie, began wrestling with her sister.  Gheradelli ended up accidentally kicking the runt, who yelped and retreated into her favorite corner.  \"Let me guess, Sarah's the only one who likes this ugly thing.\"  I wrinkled my nose at her.  With her mis-matched coloring, she reminded me of a Rottweiler or something like that, except far more docile.  \"She's so ugly, she's cute.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You named her Johnette, right?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Laughing, I replied, \"Well, she was the one that was born right next to the toilet.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The surprise puppy.\"  Mom smiled at Johnette, replaced Marco, and took her in her arms.  \"We thought Murphy was only going to have four, then she came along.  Sarah loves her because they're both the babies, I think.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Watch, she's the one we'll get stuck with.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0True to my prediction, Johnette--renamed Reeses, then Brandy--was our new companion.  When she and her siblings were born on August 29, 2004 to my dog, Murphy, Murphy abandoned them after only a few weeks, leaving us to care for them.  At four days old, Tigger died, a heartbreak to us all.  Gheradelli left the remaining four first, finding herself in a good home.  Then went Annie, the alpha female.  I go to school with the son of the woman who took her in, and he tells me that she helps their other deaf dog and also assisted an ill family member on the road to recovery after having extensive hip problems herself.  That left us with Marco and Brandy.  Marco was a scaredy-cat, something hilariously in contrast with his large size and good nature.  We called him a big, cuddly teddy bear.  It was his size that forced us to take him to an animal shelter that did not dispose of unwanted animals by euthanasia.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That left us with Brandy, my new companion.  She turns six at the end of this month, but I can't even contemplate calling her ugly any more.  We're constantly at each other's sides; she sleeps in my bed at night, waits up in the family room for me until I go to bed.  Mom trained her to treat my two younger sisters and me like her own puppies, so she will even scold us if we've been out too long and cries until we get home from school or church.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before now, I never would have thought that I would love her as much as I do now, my Mama Dog, my constant companion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The room was small and the darkness large, I would be in a corner with a small, flickering candle. At the worst of times the flame would give off no warmth and little light. I would open my eyes and pray to god that I was dead. Strike me with lighten, run with over with a bus, infect me with cancer. God, please just kill me. Of course, it never happen. Every morning I would wake up to another day in the dark room, except the darkness grew.<br>\r\nThen he goes to jail and we're free. No dark rooms and thoughts of death, right? Wrong! I felt different from the other kids and i was marked as an outsider at the new school.  There was no longer a room but that didn't stop the darkness from chasing me into a corner. The candle was always there but it was never strong enough to beat back the dark. So what changed? <br>\r\nI became a gamer. Oh, sure, it began on an anime forum. That's where i met the first few people who changed my life. They couldn't see me and they didn't know my story. If they like me it was because of who <b>I</b> was. When the forum went down my brother got me into gaming. From there you know the rest. It was one mmorpg after the other. Always with the same three people by my side. Angelo, Tony, Marissa, and then there was my brother. They were my online family, they <b>are</b> my family. Its been five years since that anime forum, and now I can feel the darkness closing in again. It's funny how I never realized it had left.<br>\r\nI feel the darkness as it tries to chase into that corner, in that small room. I refuse to let it happen. My little candle has grown into a bonfire. That faint flickering light of hope grew. The darkness is all the wrongs done to me and, now, to my friends. The bonfire is all the things and people who mean something to me. Angelo, Tony, Hiro, Marissa, Joe, Brice, Andy, Kigen. My online family that pushed through high school. Even Nathan finds his way into the list, even though he added a little to the darkness too. Flyff, my favorite mmorpg, was the biggest help I ever had. It was what helped me meet my friends. <br>\r\nIt's hard to explain , how they have giving me hope. I know my real family doesn't understand.

I slowly release my knees and begin to slide up the concrete wall. My legs are sore from sitting for so long. I feel numb. My mind doesn't register everything around me and I feel like I'm in a fog that makes my vision blurred. I just can't stay here anymore. Tonight is the night. Tonight I pack my bags, jump in the car, and keep driving until I find my home.  I just hope that I can find one.<br>\r\n I make my way up the old wooden steps for the last time.

A drug that my mind has created is driving me to push faster than I actually feel I can go. I scrounge up whatever I can find and shove it hard into the suitcase. Putting all my weight on the top, I zip the zipper and run out of the house. I just can't be here. <br>\r\nWith my bags packed I jump into the car. Cali has been great but it's just not home anymore. I think it's time to head east. I remember seeing pictures of forests covered in white. Like a wonderland that no person has ever discovered. Trees cover the roads like a canopy as rays of sun flicker through the leaves and branches. <br>\r\nYes, that's where I will go. I will start again. Find my way and create a life in the wonderland of white and the undiscovered forest. I will allow nature to heal and mend me. I will find the place that will be called home by allowing my heart to guide me to the healing that it needs.

The glimmering lights from the street below, both automobiles and signs, reflect off my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city really is weird. Rushing below me is a perfect example. I mean, I could point at a random spot on the road and most likely find something strange. A limousine with a second floor and green headlights? Really? Who would need that? Ah, what the good life will be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I doing this to myself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind lightly whips against my face, drowning out my thoughts. A red light blinks behind me as the stars blinked above. There's no need to worry. It's just one of the blinking scarlet beams that tells planes and helicopters alike \"Watch out! Definite huge spire here! Do not hit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of helicopters, I hear one now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline rushes through my body. I'm not afraid to say I'm afraid. The copter passes by me, though, and continues on its nightly business. I glance behind me, to the small black box. Once my helicopter comes, I get $200,000 immediately, and millions wired into the bank account. No questions asked at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I'm just the messenger. Even with the monumental amount I'm getting, the guy who took the box himself will get enough to buy and sell me fifty times over. Or a hundred. It doesn't really matter, does it? If you can buy and sell someone once, you can do it a billion times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFWIP-WIP-WIP-WIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the helicopter. That's my ticket. Soon I'll be living the good life. Why? Why am I doing this? I know it's not right. I know I'll probably be contributing to some New World Order or some Illuminati crap like that. I lean down, grabbing the box. The chopper nearly deafens me as it lands. It exudes a dark aura, an evil aura. I can't do this. No matter how much I get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP-HISS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jet-black door slides open. I'm here, holding the box, as the rotors whip wind into my face, and across from me the man is walking out. I can't do this. There's no way. I knew I couldn't when I saw the pearly white hair flip back, and the scarlet eyes sparkle. He's wearing a custom suit, made as dark as possible. I'm wearing casual clothes. No, no, no. I reach to toss the box over the edge, but before I can he's trained a handgun on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not the time to get cold feet,\" he says, in his impossibly suave, layered voice. I can hear the malice behind it. \"That box is finally mine, and the contents will be as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't give it to you,\" I say, in as confident a voice as I can. His very presence is intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll shoot you. And I'll get the box anyway. As a matter of fact...\" he says, looking up for a second, \"I might just shoot you anyway. Save myself 3.2 million dollars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I truly do have no other option,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. Now hand me the box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant,\" I say, as I lean backward. I see his face become instantly scared, like a movie villain who's just realized they've lost the upper hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo had he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear a reverberating bang as I topple back, box in hand, over the side of the skyscraper. He screams, but I lose the sound in the few seconds before my body meets the cars.</span></div></div>",

My biological mother and her side of the family seemed bent on making my life hell, with the help of my classmates, the vast majority of whom didn't particuarly like me, simply because I dismally failed to be what was widely considered \"cool.\" My only sources of relief were my father, my younger brother, and my two best friends, who were the only ones who didn't beat me down with snide remarks and mocking laughter. Most of my time was spent hating who I was, and of course, the world in general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one night, on January 2, 2009, I was lying in bed, the thoughts of all I had gone through threatened to crush me under their immense weight. Silent tears rolled down my cheeks, and my body shook madly. I couldn't take it. I wanted, almost more than anything, to sneak into the bathroom and grab the shaving razor, the tool that had helped me for the past several years. But one thing held me back: the hope that if I cried out to a God who I wasn't even sure existed, and He responded, then I would be rescued from all my demons. \"God please..........I can't do this.........just help me, God........\" I whispered through my tears. Less than a minute later, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace, a peace that I had never known before. And I knew, in that moment, that God was real, and I was saved.</span></div></div>",

I experimented with different ways of being, exercising, meditating and practicing positive affirmations regularly.  I was surprised to see how much difference it made to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason I decided to take a few days break at the seaside.  I stayed in a B&amp;B just outside the town. It was quiet and the gardens were amazing filled with flowers and smells that I couldn't identify.   I'd sit there most of the day, sometimes writing and sometimes simply enjoying the place and the peace it offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day I went down to the main beach.  It was manic with holidaymakers, ice creams, candyfloss, amusement arcades and rows of individual booths selling trinkets and gifts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman called to me as I passed her stall, \"You have the gift, don't you lovey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped, startled, thinking I'd misheard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a minute of your time and I'll show you.\"  She reached behind her and drew out a small crystal ball.  \"Here, look into this and tell me what you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed \"I'm not a fortune teller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she said \"You're more than that. Go on.  Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I did and the clarity of the glass seemed to cloud and I could see two figures walking down the beach.  I felt an urgent need to warn them that something bad was going to happen.  I could feel my pulse rise but I looked away, knowing it was some sort of con.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't believe do you?\" the woman said.  She pulled back a dark purple, heavy weight curtain and brought out an even smaller crystal.  \"This is for you. Use it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'm not shopping.\" I replied with a grin. Relieved to have been proven right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no charge\" she said.  \"It's yours.\"  She wrapped the crystal in dark cloth and handed it to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hesitated before taking it.</span></div></div>",

Fighting, skipping school, talking back to me, and I just found a baggie of heroin or cocaine in Billie's pants pocket when I went to do the wash the other day, I just can't take any more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about that therapist you've been seeing, hasn't he been able to give you any help? Any ideas on what you should do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Robertson? He's pretty much worthless. he tells me instead of yelling at them I should use logic and treat them like adults instead of like teenage brats, Said I should  share my feelings with them. I tried that, what a bunch of crap! Just like the doctor suggested I told Billie \"When you disrespect me by bringing drugs into this house it makes me feel angry and sad.\" and you know what Billie did? he said \"Boo-fuckin'-hoo, too bad for you! I'm gonna do what I want, and if you say anything about it I'll tell the social worker you're a slut and a junkie, and those are your drugs.\" What can I say to that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Martha, I have a friend on the police force, he's in charge of a program that's geared towards getting kids like yours turned around before it's too late for them. I'll give you his number if you want to look into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks, Jolene. I'll write it down and give him a call after we're done talking.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The folks in the campgrounds had given me lots of advice. By far the most frequent was, \"Lay in enough wood. It gets colder than you can imagine. When the winter comes you won't have time to chop any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo problem. I'm young and strong, and if the pioneers could do it, so could I. Anyway, my land had lots of trees. Water too. I'd set up my trailer near a stream that gurgled into a clear pond, almost a small lake. I had plenty of buckets, so I'd have plenty of water. I had a chain saw, an ax, a maul, and several pairs of work gloves. I was all set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was I woke on June 28 at 6am to brilliant sunshine and 58 degrees. This was the life. I ate a hearty breakfast of sausage and eggs and got to work. I scouted my property, finding lots of dead wood. This was great. Revving up the chain saw, I started in on a fallen tree not two hundred yards from my trailer. By noon I had cut up the tree into short sections and split a considerable amount. Boy was that hard work. My work shirt was drenched with sweat. I was ready to sit down for a couple of hours. I ate three ham sandwiches and finished my thermos of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the afternoon I finished splitting the wood. Now it was time to transport it to my storage area. I was able to maneuver my Silverado to the work site and loaded as much as I could. Transporting took more trips than I had counted on. By six the sun was still bright with no indication of oncoming dusk. I had had a full day and was ready for a big dinner. As I started in on a beef stew, I heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anybody home?\" It was an old man about seventy. He was dressed in work clothes that were faded and soiled from hard use. He looked like the stereotype of the old prospector, complete with the worn hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in,\" I said, glad to see someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind if I do,\" he said, hopping into my trailer. \"New here, are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, just bought this land. Started chopping wood for winter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, Sonny. I'm Pete Vaughn. I live mile or so from here. What brings you to Alaska?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jack Montgomery. I left LA. Starting over. This is a change from the big city rat race.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete regarded me and said, \"Lots more people do that than you might think. Some even stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they leave? This is a great place, beautiful country, and it isn't the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete laughed. \"Show me your wood, if you don't mid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystified I showed him my day's work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you have? Son, you need  more wood that you can imagine. When you think you have enough, you probably need three times that amount. That's what the city folks never understand. You left the big city, and you think this is the simple life. It is, but the simple life isn't the easy life. You'll spend all day every day putting in wood. Then the winter comes, it's dark all the time, and you sit by your stove hoping you have enough. Then the stream freezes and there's no water. 'Bout then the big city starts to look better and better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gazed at the old man in dismay. In my enthusiasm I had not looked at the hard work from that angle. \"Why is it people come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some are running, escaping from their past. Maybe you're different. I wish you luck, Jack.\" With that he left, walking away with a slow gait. He looked over his shoulder and said, \" I'll be by next week to see how you're doin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrazy old fool I thought. I worked hard the next . All the time I noticed how much harder it was to get the Silverado to where I'd been working. I watched as my woodpile grew, all the time wondering if the old geezer was on the money or just trying to scare me. Then the last two days of the week, the weather turned nasty and I just sat inside growing more morose by the hour. I hooked up the trailer to the Silverado and set out for the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later Pete Vaughn came by and saw the empty camp site. He took out a cell phone. \"Jerry? Yeah that Montgomery fella left. Doesn't look like he's comin' back. You can probably buy his land back for a good price.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nIt took several hours to get to the first decent semblance of civilization and that consisted of a small merchantile with a bar and grill counter that seated seven, a gas station with old '60s style pumps with faded markings that read Texico, but who really knew what company supplied the gas now, and an old shack with a whitewashed wooden cross in front of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled in front of the pumps and shut down my engine. Before I had the door open a portly woman with greying hair and a round face asked what I'd like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifty bucks worth in the back tank, please.\" I stretched and looked across the road where the merc was. \"Is the store open for business, it looks a bit dark inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman opened the flap to my rear gas tank and scowled, then I remembered there were lock caps that needed keys; I dug the truck keys out of my pocket and unlocked the cap. \"Sorry, I'm not use to full service pumps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, the merc is open. Go ahead and leave yer truck here. It won't be a bother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled and walked over to the store and stepped inside. It was dim and smelled of stale woodsmoke. A couple guys were seated at the bar with partially filled beer mugs before them. On of the fellas was named Jerry, the same guy who sponsored the place I'd bought.  I sat at the bar and acknowledged the guys with a nod. The barkeep wasn't in sight so I tapped once on the little bell to let him know he had another customer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the barkeep showed up, Jerry had grabbed his mug and walked over to my end of the bar. \"Mind if I join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not at all. Have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you have your rig across the street, you leaving already?\" He grinned from ear to ear like the cheshire cat and tipped a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just needed to get away from the property for a little and brought my bed with me. Thought I'd get at least one night away before weather set in and I couldn't come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I spoke I thought I saw his smile freeze on his face. His eyes seemed to narrow a bit too. But Jerry recovered quickly and left me wondering if I'd really seen his instant of disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good good to hear you are going to stick it out. How much wood do you have laid in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am still cuttin' wood and hauling water, although, my water reservoir is nearly full now. I got it inside a small shed I can keep warm with a fire so hopefully it won't freeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry scratched his head. \"Well I hope that works for ya. Winter gets mighty cold and storms can keep ya from keeping a fire going in an out building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time the lights popped on and cut the gloom in the store. Burt walked in from the back room wiping grease off his hands. \"Oh heya, like a beer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, what I'd really like are some large jerry cans to put diesel in. I thought I might want to put in some extra fuel for the generator I bought a couple months back. Also, do you have some sacks of flour, sugar, and rice I can purchase; also some cans of crisco or other cooking lard, and maybe some other things you think I may need before the snow comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, we can get you all that, here is a list of things I've found people have stocked up and some things they've told me they had wished they'd had before the snow melt.\" Burt handed over a small spiral note book. I opened it up and looked through it. All in all the back of the silverado was packed solid and the trailer too was packed tight with just enough room for me to walk through to get to the bunk the stove and the fridge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drank a couple more beers and listened to Jerry, Burt and Ralph talk about bears, wolverines, blizzards and some casualties of first-timers in these parts. I thanked them for all the advice and life lessons they offered and wondered why everyone was being so helpful in making sure I was prepared for the coming winter under the shadow of Denali. I admit when I first packed up and headed off my property I was set to keep on going south, but the longer it took to drive the more wrong it felt for me to just give up. This country was beautiful and wild and something called to me that I couldn't resist. It may be the death of me, but life in the lower forty-eight held no more promise of survival either. Jerry seemed down right determined to make sure I knew exactly what I was stepping into. He was a good Joe. Burt, too seemed concerned, he seemed worried that another city slicker was going to be pulled out feet first, but acknowledged that I had up a good stock as long as I had enough wood in for the winter. And Ralph, he seemed the most confident of the three that I just might make it long enough to decide if I'd like to try another year in the wild or go back to the pampered city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had pulled the truck and trailer in front of the merc to load it up earlier and Margie had just shook her head when she watched me load all the goods into my trailer and truck. She had her oldest son help me with the jerry cans filled with diesel and one with gasoline. I pulled into the turnabout at the edge of town, locked up tight, placed the 'bear bells' and line to trigger the alarm incase I had an unwanted visitor, then crawled into the bed and slept like a stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I watched the lights fading and the ground rushing at my head like my head was a bowling ball in a bowling lane with no pins.  O knew this shot was mortal and I would not see or feel my contact and subsequent bounce off my front driveway pebblestones for I was done here and it was time to get the question answered that I had been asking my entire life and thought I had a pretty good grip on an understanding, if not the complete and total<br>\r\nanswer.\"<br>\r\n     Yep, I was right but it is even better.  Spectacular and brighter than anything I have ever seen but not painful to either of my eyes!  Wow, my eyes back and this light isn't just light but seems to be a type of music, language and a cross between every positive emotion I have ever experienced with a bunch of other stuff I have nothing to compare it to. Oh, I'm suppossed to grow into what it is and become part of it and then I'll see it with full understanding because I will see it as it is and not what I think it might be. What was I afraid of?  Why was I afraid?  Oh, yea!  Incomplete commitment but he gave me the rest because I was honestly trying to find the truth. He rewards those who diligently seek him.  The thing is he gives what he knows you need for what he needs from you.  He finds and chooses who he finds and chooses for his purposes.  He already loved us first and proved it through his son our friend, half brother co heirs together to share the inheiritance God had prepared from the beginning that we might through his sons righteous be perfect in his sight.  Now we, for the first time (wrong word but it's all I got at this time for time is no more and Spiritually never was for it was one of many stumblingstones to to be removed by understanding Spiritually why they were there to stumble over and who placed them everywhere?<br>\r\n    I'm dead now but live.  The truth is the life, the truth and the love that is everywhere as air is on the Earth, allows me to say on Earth I was dead for I never knew life or If I did it was placed in the Sea of Forgetfullness just as my memory of everything that it seemed was real is now falling away?  It's similar to watching a movie and now that it's over, it is fading into what it was, nothing more than a distraction from what is not only important but seems to be as natural as if I'm becoming a person or new something that really is only remembering what I really have always been but kind of transformed into God's plan and will.  This is not unlike Jesus putting on man only the other direction.  Man is being peeled off because the truth in God's Word didn't defeat the liar as much as proved or confirmed Who and what God is in relationship to everything and since He is light and truth and love and we now see him as he is in a Spiritual way this was always and was real when God rested from his works.  In a strange but understandable way our religious spirit created and kept by belief in lies which existed only because of our unbelief in the total truth that in God's Word was no lie which allowed our faith to be without the force of total commitment which is living in the lie with the liars glasses on blocking our vision.  I feel no guilt or responsibility and haven't for a long time of and about God's longsuffering.  His plan, His appointed times, He is the author and the finisher, His thoughts, His will be done,  longsuffering is we when of the world for salvation has always been on the table for those of faith as is the faith of the cloud of witnesses.  We condemned ourselves by our unbelief, never His in us for as faith and hope are no longer necessary when what you had hoped for is now seen as it is.  God is the author.  The reason He's the finisher is because when He was finished He said he was finished.  The author of a book wrote the book, created the characters and the plot and knows the ending.  God never left us, we left him but he held no grudge and says over and over come back to me and I will be your God.  The scripture that says, \"  I loved you Israel as a hen loves her chicks and would spread my wings and cover you but you would not.\"  Has our God written the complete book and does he know the whole of it?  God rested from His Work and His son said it is finished.  Is the Book of Revelation waiting for more Bible chapters?  When Jesus speaks is His voice the voice of Prophecy? <br>\r\n    Is it possible the entire Christian Churchs of today, everyone of them is preaching a word so similar to the Pharisee Christ warned us of that they are now what the Pharisee were when they were a factor in not just killing innocence but by teaching and preaching the letter but not knowing the Spirit, convinced congregations to believe in what the traditions of man over time had agreed on was meant by Holy scripture and perpetrated a worldly and religious doctrine effectively placing entire searching peoples into a bondage far worse than Egypt, Syria or Babylon for there is no exit from a lie but the truth.  If no one has or speaks the truth there is a drought for the Word and people die of thirst and hunger for a food and water that requires that someone ask for it which is kind of impossible when it's been so long you have forgotten how and who to ask and of course you belief he rewards evil, reaps what he doesn't sew and yet he comes again and offers Himself to who He chooses.  Come and worship your Father God and recieve forgiveness you did not earn or deserve save for His uncoditional mercy freely offered and given to those who will receive what He has offered.  Unconditional Love.  Believe that His Word is true.  Read this book as if it is alive for it truly is.  It is a Living Word and is as powerful today as it ever was.  Maybe even more so for veils are being lifted but were really always there where God hid them.  Right in front of us and so simple it was invisible to the adamic nature of man who loves to lean to his own understanding thinking it's from God, preaching it with no conformation.  Is todays church allowing the comforter to dwell within the hearts and minds of everyone who believes that Christ is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him or does the congregation have to make itself worthy of such an honor.  How long are you willing to wait for what is here amonst now.  These are not my words but His that He wrote in my heart as He said He would and I believed, so He has and placed them in my mind.  He speaks a Word His creative Word and it is, as is His Son entering the tabernackle, His choosen themselves being the new church with an immortal Melchizeldecian Priesthood, Jesus, the High Priest in those of faith imputed to His righteousness, purified, sanctifyed and glorified as Jesus is the truth, the way and the life.  Read your Bible and believe what you are reading is speaking to you today and the comfortor that is with you as I speak will guide you into revelation which Is not what you think but is the revelation of Jesus Messiah.  Have faith that his words are true.  They are. </span></div></div>",

Your particular question is extremely fun to answer.  Some are no fun at all as they require concise, articulate and definitive answers that make me feel no freedom or liberty in the answer but a type of incarceration, restriction or pragmatism. When this happens I am forced or herded into giving The Answer (the one and only)!<br>\r\n      No, would be the answer to your question and I could stop there but what fun would that be.  By the rules I am only required to answer your question or questions. and sometimes answer them before you ask. Within your question are other not so obvious questions I might address either to amuse, confuse and/or abuse your worldly sensibilities. Hopefully all three. <br>\r\n       Backwards is the best way to explain,\" Does he get to stay there?\"  \"There\" implies a place that has definition.  Although ambiguous, the writer of the question has an idea of where and what \"there' is or might be. To \"stay\" means something ceases  going away from or leaving behind but remains within something with borders, is stationary existing at a location arrived at. <br>\r\n       Get to stay.  Get by defination means to receive as a return: Earn.  Get implies an authority having say over allowing or disallowing something to stay or not stay for any number of reasons.<br>\r\n        Does he. He is masculine.  Does the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Where is and what is \"there\" that he might or might not get to stay within?  Where is and what is \"heaven\" to you?  We have read or \"it is written\" that in heaven is no Greek or Jew, Man or Woman.  So \"he\" in heaven isn't a he but is spirit that did arrive.  Where?  The \"he\" spirit was freed from the constraints of the World, his flesh and duality. They fell away.  Did this spirit go anywhere or simply remember what it has always been when released from the deluge or captivity it was bound by being man for a time.<br>\r\n     God is in heaven.  God is omnificent, omnipotent and omnipresent. Omnipresent is hard to hear, bare and understand.  It means in all places at all times.  It is no easier to wrap one's mind around this as it is to contemplate infinity.  <br>\r\n     When asking where is God now or where and when is heaven, like he is coming here soon and taking everyone who believes to somewhere away, a place in the future located somewhere not here but somewhere else! \" Does he get to stay there,\" isn't as simple as it seems with just a casual glance, is it?? <br>\r\n      No!  \"There,\" like time, darkness, good and bad, worldly perception and this sentence,\" Does he get to stay there,\" fall away, have no more meaning, cease to exist as if they never were.<br>\r\n     \"Does he get to stay there?\"  Not even close.  He got a glimpse of reality instead of the fiction, religious christian cults are passing off as God's Truth but are nothing more than the traditions of man!  He has had a near death experience he can sell to the National Inquirer so that those with inquiring minds can vicariously<br>\r\nexperience his experience.  But he is back in the land of the breathing and once again a man, born to die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

I gotta get a grip!\" I think I said or at least said some of this out loud, as I burst back into a waking reality much more concrete than the world I was exiting!  <br>\r\n     Damn it!  It was a dream?  Or was it?  What was it and what does it or did it mean?<br>\r\n     It's hard to figure when I still have one foot in two seperate realities.  I quickly found the pen and paper I keep on my nightstand just for this purpose.  The trick is to write down what you can remember as soon and as fast as possible before the trail goes cold and is completely erased in the Sea of Forgetfulness.  You've got to be quick, concise and unhesitantly spontaneous. Those who have tried to be dream catures know it's like trying to capture smoke with a fish net.<br>\r\n     I don't think the Dream World is any more or less real than the Waking World but have learned they require two seperate languages and that it is very close to impossible to think on or about dreams in the mindset and language (symbol interpretation) of our common physical (waking) reality. Carl Jung can help.  He is known as The Father of dream interpretation and in his book, \" Dreams, Memories And Reflections,\" gives some of his findings and insights into his explorations.<br>\r\n     Was the experience an illusion?  No! However, it was a dream, an unusually detailed and very realistic dream.  I believe it was brought on by a very large and rich meal, a telephone call and an intense, revelatory Bible study with two close friends.<br>\r\n     The Bearded Clam has crabs.  All you can eat with Monday night football and 25 cent draft beer.  We, Three Amigos ( our handle) went there after Bible study to put things back into perspective (life is a question of balance)!  I got the phone call from Brenda while in the Bearded Clam and could barely make her out for the hoopla surrounding this gala event.  I did sense her dispair, was fairly certain of the cause and was more than happy to give her a yay on my place for a little shelter from the storm.<br>\r\n     The last time I had seen her she had a black eye.  While taking a sabbatical from her problem at The Chataux Relaxo, my digs, I tracked her problem down. Brenda didn't know it and I didn't tell her.  I knew she wasn't going to take my advice and kick the little wanker out of her house so I did what I could. I didn't hurt him bad but made him cry real tears of fears.  I introduced him to the house of pain and he announced he had seen the error of his ways.  It is amazing what can be accomplished with words.  I will be really surprised to find he has been beating on Brenda again.  The picture I left him with was for him to pretend or actually see that every hand he layed on Brenda he was really laying on himself. I informed him I didn't like him anyway and it was in his best interests to not have me come back and repeat myself.  I explained the meaning of Just us!<br>\r\n     I haven't figured out why Brenda shot me in my dream? I am blind in my right eye and am having surgery, a new lens put in two weeks from now.  The damage wasn't caused by a knitting needle. There is no reward out for me that I'm aware of and I don't know anyone in Nogales! The heaven part of the dream must have been stimulated by some new insights we Three Amigos discovered that were hiding in plain sight.  It must have opened some spiritual floodgates spilling out onto my dreamscape.<br>\r\n     Brenda will be here in a few hours.  Won't know for sure what's bothering her until she tells me so I think I'll work on this dream analysis til then.  It feels like there is something here I'm supposed to understand a bit better?     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

I wasn't a seer. Brenda wasn't standing out there with a gun in her hand, waiting for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe  was actually standing, looking down, at something in her trunk. I stepped out onto the driveway and her head came up as her hand shot up to slam the trunk closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With an effort, on her part, she brought that hand back down and stepped forward a few paces opening her arms to hug me, to stop me from advancing any further. She squeezed me in a bearhug, stepped back and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, saying over her shoulder, \"I brought company, Pat. It stopped struggling fifty miles from here. I don't if know it's alive or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had come around to the trunk.and stood, staring. I wasn't prepared for a human, and I certainly wasn't expecting Billy! There he lay, motionless, and trussed up in electrical tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I bent over to examine him, looking for blood, principally, he jackknifed, trying to knock me down. He, not it, was conscious, and the hatred was plain in every line of his body!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSeeing that his mouth had been taped shut; he wouldn't be biting anyone for a while, gave me an idea of how to handle him. I picked him up like a bride and slung him over a shoulder like a sack of potatoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I backed up, Brenda slammed the trunk. I handed her the key for the front door and told her to unlock it. If he was going to struggle I might have my hands full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about witnesses?\", she asked. I answered, \"I chose this house for its isolation. The nearest houses are still a quarter-mile away in any direction.\"</span></div></div>",

And bring me back some ice cream when you're done, Cherry Garcia would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, sure thing, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as Azazel turns to leave there is a flash of light and a deafening explosion.<br>\r\nBOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd God appears... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks around at the office. Empty McDonald's wrappers and Cheetos bags are strewn across the floor, ash trays are filled to overflowing, and there is a teetering pyramid of empty Budweiser cans threatening to fall in the center of the room. Roaches are crawling on the walls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Son Almighty, this place is a pigsty! Satan, have you no pride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Big Guy, weren't you the one who said \"Pride goes before a fall\" or something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mock me, Satan, or I'll..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you'll what! Send me to Hell? I got news for you, buddy, I already live here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of this now, you know why I'm here, you broke the agreement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, but what do you expect? I am evil, after all. You gotta give some credit, I hadn't been up there in over 30 years, since that trip to Georgia. I still think I shoulda won that fiddle contest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may, you have no business meddling with that Brenda woman; she's mine, she's given up her evil past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that, big guy? It wasn't so long ago she was cooking up meth with Billy. What do you say we make a little bet. I planted my ideas in her head, now you take your shot. Then we'll see what she chooses. Winner gets a box of Cohibas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Satan, you're on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod plants his ideas in Brenda's head, and then she chooses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I needed to take her to a place that I wouldn't have to worry about her when Billy showed up and I confronted him.  And Billy always shows up a day or so after she leaves.  How he knows where to find her, because she doesn't always come to me, I have no idea.  But I wasn't taking any chances this time- I had a gut feeling he'd show up though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight I would take her to The Pub where at least 4 of my main boys would be.  The food would be homey which is what Brenda could use.  The patrons will be strong, which is what I could use.

Sometimes she'd be with me but many times she wouldn't.  That's just how Brenda was, or rather, that's how Billy made her.  So often she'd change her mind and dart back home.  As we walked into O'Malley's there I could see surprise on some of their faces.  They'd probably placed a bet on whether she'd show or not.  In any case, with Brenda by my side this night, the boys knew that this wasn't a rehearsal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugoslav was the first guy, or perhaps just the loudest guy, to welcome us and motioned to the table in the corner.  Brenda wasn't paying attention though, her gaze rested permanently to a distance just before her, a small but decent smile chiseled under her nose, She was lost in thought and who could blame her?  It was a relief however, seeing her dazed like this.  In many ways this was her way of relaxing, much different than her usual scared eyed demeanor.  Even when she was exhausted she seemed on the edge.  Tonight, in her brother's company, she simply could tune out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sit down at the table and order the Shepard's Pie which was her favorite. \"Aren't you going to eat anything?\" she asked me after I placed her order.  I wanted to tell her that I couldn't eat just yet.  That whatever was going to happen tonight wouldn't be pleasant and that any food in my body would surely react badly.  I knew that tonight I'd have to do without.  \"Nah, sis, nothing for me.  I'll just munch on these peanuts.\"  I saw her disappointment.  She had a thing about eating alone.  I grabbed a handful of nuts and stuffed them in my mouth, \"See?  I'm good,\" I grumbled with kid-like showmanship \"oh, and I'll have beer.\" I said to Tammy, the waitress who had been standing there the whole time.  Brenda smiled at my childlike eating and asked for water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugoslav came over and sat down, his eyes on Brenda.  \"How's it going?\" he asked her directly.  She smiled, always her answer.  He looked at me without expression and waited for an answer.  <br>\r\n\"She's alright, Yugoslav.  Yeah, we're OK.  Thought we'd stop in for a bite.  It's been awhile since sis came to visit and she loves this place.\" I didn't know if he wanted to talk about Billy right here, in the open and in front of her.<br>\r\n\"I see, that's good,\" he said  \"It's nice to see you Brenda.  Thought I'd visit for a minute, gotta get back to the bar.  Let me know if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was completely behind her he shot me the look of one raised eyebrow.  I wish I knew him better because I didn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Billy know you're with me?\" I ask innocently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Well, not that I know of\" she muttered, looking at me or at that space just in front of her.  \"Who knows.  All I know is that the game is up. I'm tired of putting up with this. I don't care what he does, I have to end this.  What's more important?  Living with this monster or him letting the secret out and if he does I will just have to live with the consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like my sister was always a good girl.  She had a violent streak in her but that was in the past.  The past apparently wouldn't let her go.  For many years she'd try to figure out a way to get rid of this guy but each time she did he would threaten her, scaring her and immobilizing her from making any moves away from  him.  This guy couldn't keep a girl and pretty much lucked out with Brenda, because it would take his knowing a dirty little secret as the only way to keep a woman.  Pathetic.  Still, she had done something pretty terrible and her punishment was him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food arrived and in 2 minutes her cell phone buzzed, a text.  She hadn't started to eat yet and pushed the plate away.  \"Don't read the text\" I pleaded.  I needed more time.  She looked at her cell and gave me a knowing look and then her face dropped.  \"He's gonna do it,\" she quietly said, \"he's gonna expose what I've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time like the present, I stood up and called Frankie over.  I didn't have to say anything, he knew.  We wouldn't need to protect her here tonight.  We would have to go find Billy and do what we should've done time after time.  One of them would go to his house, the other to his hangout.  Frankie would go to my house and wait there.  All I had to do was remain calm, with Brenda.  I demanded she give me her cell and she looked so sad, resigned and she put it on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt buzzed again and again and again.  I saw that it was from all different numbers not just Billy's.  \"Whats going on Brenda?\"  She wouldn't look at me.  She just watched her phone vibrate on the table as text after text rolled in.  I noticed one text when I pushed the cell to stop the noise.  It read \"Game's up sweetie\" and it wasn't from Billy's number.  \"I don't understand, have you told me everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He took two<br>\r\nsteps into the parking lot daylight and stopped.  As Brenda was releasing the door, she was turning towards<br>\r\nher big brother and was just in time to see him throw up something.  At the same time he threw up something<br>\r\nhe let out a rebel yell aimed at what was falling back down to his hand.  YA-A-A-YAA-A-A-A-A-A, the scream<br>\r\nof exaltation ended as abruptly as did the fall of his car keys when he caught what he had thrown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     While Brenda was so caught up in trying to understand what emotion her brother was expressing she hadn't realized she'd been neuroticly expending pent up nervous energy tearing a very large paper dinner naptkin<br>\r\ninto a million itsy-bitsy pieces.  When she returned into herself from where her mind had taken her on it's own,<br>\r\nand saw what she had been doing while she was gone, she threw up, all those little, itsy-bitsy pieces of naptkin soit looked like confetti in a ticker tape parade.  Out loud she said,\" Oh, what the hell,\" and let go a rebel yell of her own!  YA-A-AYA-AA-A-A!  Her scream of finality ended when all those flitering pieces of confetti weren't <br>\r\nflitering anymore.<br>\r\n     Her brother was smiling at her from the driver's seat but Lovely Rita, the Meter Maid wasn't!  She was approaching rapidly, her mouth, an ugly scowl under her very visable mustache and one eyebrow.  She had her ticket book out and was holding it like she was going to shoot me with it!<br>\r\n     I told her,\" Those are blanks.\" \" W-What?\"  she stuttered.  \" Those are blank pages, blanks.\" I iteratered.<br>\r\nShe stopped reaching for her gun and a little deflatted (which was my intention) ordered me to pick up every single one of those itsy-bitsy pieces of white naptkin that, now (at least a piece) had found a residence from California to New York and North Dakota to Galvesten, Texas.  I felt like I was Arlo Guthrie in Alice's Restaurant when he got caught dumping garbage off a cliff unto a gulley!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Looking back, I must have been in emotional limbo.  I mean, I had just looked hard on someone I had deeply loved for over ten years with his head only just attached to his body with but a guitar string!  And she is ordering<br>\r\nme to pick up a torn paper naptkin when I can see within my view looking just one direction at least thirty of them held to the cyclone fence by the breeze!  I didn't lose it, yet!<br>\r\n     I said to her in soft measured voice,\" You are out of uniform.  I am not required by law to follow or accede to the commands of any peace officer who by being out of uniform is not authorized or empowered by the mandate and protocols while in violation of these governing laws and codes himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     My brother was laughing so hard it looked as if his eyes were about to become satellites!  I was seriously praying this powerless, insecure, no self-esteemed, non-entitied, atomaton wasn't going to ask me the question I new she was going to because it was really the only one she could ask.  I had left myself no way out and I knew <br>\r\ntoday, retreat was not an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Her eyes seeing blood, her anger making her lip quiver and her eye spasam, she opened her mouth and told me,\" Her is the deal, cracker.  You're gonna tell me, right now, how I'm outta uniform.  If you been playin inside my head, I'm going to shoot you in the leg for trying to escape, comprande?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     There it was and here I go!  I looked her in the eyes about four inches apart and said to her seriously,\"You forgot to shave this morning corporeal and your beard looks like ya tryin to be a hippie puke!\"  The look on her face told me I had struck a nerve so deep it was rooted in the very center of her being.  Looking into her eyes I witnessed her humanity disappear devoured by her insanity.  She was gone.  Gone for good but I didn't find that out till later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     My brother pulled the raving lunatic off of me and by then another cop was on the scene restoring a semblence of order.  She was so gone she was wearing his handcuffs cuffed to a tree far away from us.  She made me look like an angel.  I played it.  He couldn't believe all this was over a naptkin.  He was right, it wasn't but it was a security issue.  Mine.  That made it need to know!  For my security he didn't need to know and she was in no condition to tell him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this day I can't believe I walked?  I believe Billy had something to do with it?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n     My word is my word. Our Dad, Brenda's and mine, taught us both not to give it lightly.  \"Try not to give<br>\r\nit at all!\" he reminded us over and over, like a broken record!  Before Brenda walked out my door on her way back to Denver, her house and a relationship she believed could be saved, I told her in earnest what was going to happen to Billy if he ever used her as a punching bag again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I had already told Billy to pretend when he was hitting my sister that he was hitting me. I thought that might make him think a split second and check his punch, breaking the spell or whatever madness overpowers a man's senses making him capable of being a woman beater? <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n      Jesus, she was at my house six days ago!  Six days?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      My best friend Rob's (he's really a Robbin) sisters, both of them, work at Mercy General, a very large and prestegious hospital located in downtown Denver by the Stadium. Elway's stadium!  One is an Orthopedic Surgeon and the other, Annie, the one who called, is an anesthesiologist. She and Brenda went to school together from kindergarten to high school, graduated as seniors. Their lives took seperate professional courses but not their friendship. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Annie called her brother giving him the details of Brenda's injuries so he could deliver the bad news in person to me.  Thus, sparing me the emptiness of staring at a wall or putting my fist through it, after hanging up a cold and lifeless telephone. He was with me, riding shotgun in my truck, asleep and snoring after taking a turn at the wheel so I could sleep.  The road sign said forty miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Billy had no way of knowing that I was in town or that I even knew what he had done.  <br>\r\nBrenda was in a coma.  The object he had hit her with had caused bleeding inside her cranial cavity and the building pressure had to be released and her brain monitored.  Sleep was necessary for healing so they had induced her coma  for restoritive purposes, or, at least, Annie had assured Rob this was the case.  Rob knew his sister as well as I knew mine and said she would have been an emotional wreck if Brenda's life was hanging in the balance.  I believed him, it was easier than the alternative!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     We found Billy at my sister's house.  The two empty bottles of Mescal overturned, one at his feet and the other by his elbow, explained why he had wet himself, had flammable breath and didn't wake up, or bat an eye, while we were immobilizing him with the duct tape we had brought just for this purpose.  His  arms taped behind him, his legs taped at ankles and knees and a black stocking knit cap pulled over his head and duct taped around his neck, holding the hat in place but allowing him to breath through the loose knit.  I was afraid to duct tape his mouth because I needed him alive for the event I had in store for him.  I was going to give him a chance to survive.  Admittedly not much of a chance but more than he deserved.  I also wanted him to have time to come to terms with why he was where he found himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I left Rob at the hospital after we had picked up Billy.  My word, my sister, my doing and the worst case scenerio was I get busted for murder and deal it down to second degree manslaughter.  Colorado, like Texas doesn't take kindly to men beating on women. They would look down on me for NOT doing something to Billy!  Rob didn't need this on his head either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Billy was awake when we got where I was going.  He was begging whoever had him, me, to just tell him what he'd done wrong and no matter what it was or what it took, he would make it right!  Just tell him what I wanted!  Anything he pleaded!  I went to see if everything was how I remembered.  He didn't know I wasn't there so he just kept on squirming and begging for some hope that his ticket wasn't going to get punched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I hadn't been here in ten years.  It had belonged to a real mountain man my father had met while he and Ned, my dad's best friend, were deer hunting.  Sal Vascusco was the trapper, hunter, gold miner's, mountainman's name.  The only reason dad found him is because Sal's dog, well, not a dog, a wolf he'd raised from a cub, made my dad understand that it was urgent and important that he follow Friend. Friend is what Sal had named the wolf.  Said it was the only friend he ever had til me and my dad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Dad was led to Sal who said later he was wishing to die before anyone found out that he had stepped into his own bear trap and couldn't free the spring to open it.  He had his bowie knife out and was close to cutting his foot off rather than be found dead in his own trap!  He owned four hundred acres around his cabin and the land touched federal forest reserve that was unlimited unowned wilderness.  He deeded it to me before he went missing. He told me what he was going to do and did it. He walked into his wilderness and became legend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     No one but us three, Sal, Dad and me had ever been here.  Even Brenda and Rob, my best friend, didn't know about this spread and that I owned it free and clear.  No lease expiring in ninety-nine years!  This is fee simple.  Mine for perputuity!  Billy was about to become the fourth person to see my property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After dragging Billy to where I was set up.  Still blind with the watch cap covering his eyes, I asked,\"  Do you have any idea who has brought you to this place and why?  He hadn't recognized my voice and quickly whined,\"  He had no idea but would I remove the cap so he could see who and ask why?\"  I cut the cap off with my knife leaving the tape around his neck like a chocker. It took some time for his eyes to adjust to the bright noonday sun but when they did and he saw who his capter was, first his eyes flashed surprize and realization finishing at resignation.  It was just like a green light turning to yellow than red.  Go, going, slowing down to an abrupt stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I explained what was about to happen and what his only chance to live depended on.  When he heard there was a chance he could survive my wrath,his entire being seized this hope as if it was a physical, tangible substance you could hold in your hands.  I showed him the rope wrapped around, coiled on the spindle with a handle.  It was obvious to him that this was the machine used to bring a bucket of water up and out of the well.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n     He was biting his lip as I told him the water in this well is very cold and is usually somewhere around fifty to seventy feet down.  Instead of me just cutting one of your arteries and watching you bleed out for what you've done to my sister on more than one occasion,  I'm going to untie you, lower you into the well and into the water.  However far that is, is the distance you will have to climb to free yourself from death from drowning or hypothermia, whichever comes first.  The man who dug this well said that at the bottom is an underground river that comes to daylight a quarter mile from here.  He told me if he ever fell in the well he might try that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I made a hang mans noose and had him put his foot in it.  But, of course, this was after I had him strip down to his birthday suit.  He was shaking from fear not cold as I began to slowly lower him into the darkness.  Once he was beyond my sight, about twenty-five feet I let go and he plummeted through total darkness, the only light the peephole framing me at the top getting smaller only to completely disappear when he hit and was below the surface of the frigid, Colorado mountain water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     This was my signal to pull the rope which was free of him from the fall, back to the surface.  He was crying, pleading with me to keep my word. It WAS my intention to put this extra scare in him but bringing up the rope but I also had another reason. I believe I could climb up the rope to safety.  I'm not sure if Billy could or couldn't but I didn't bring him here to escape.  He was here to be puinished for the countless abuses, mental and physical, he so nonchalantly ladeled out on someone I would give my life to save, before he died! I yelled down to him,\" One more minute, Billy!  No kidding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As I finished the end of his rope, rubbing in nice and deep the last of a gallon can of axel grease, I threw the attached rope in the well!  Without a word to Billy, I walked to my truck, took a last look at the land I would be living on sooner than later.  Cleaned my hands with lacquer thinner.  I hate grease on my steering wheel. Started my truck and pointed her to the hospital anxious, now that I was done and Billy was finished, to see if my sister was back in the land of the living? </span></div></div>",

She didn't hold me too tight, it was a comfortable hug, the one your mother would offer if she's not thousands of miles away, but I still couldn't breathe between her arms and few whispers she placed in my ear, repeating the same thing all over again; <i>you're going to be alright.</i> I didn't believe her. I couldn't, I felt my brain melting down into my throat when the army of ants invaded my head and committed genocide over my brain cells. My eyes got blurry so I closed them down, trying to escape to some other place where I wasn't surrounded by complete strangers who looked at me as if they never saw someone having a breakdown. Surprisingly unearthly strength, mixed with anger and despair, was boiling in my stomach despite numbness of my head, and spread over my chest, then my arms. I only realized I'm squeezing my boss too tight because she started to tap my back, first gently and then harder until I didn't ease up without letting her go completely still. I think none of us knew what we supposed to do in that moment so we kept holding onto each other until someone figure it out. My brain was stuck in my throat, making me unable to speak. I could only gasp for breath and wait for another part of my body to lose its battle and go numb. She was quiet at this time as well, making slight movements of her head as if she was nodding. I kept my eyes closed so I couldn't see if she was communicating with <i>him</i> or this was just random movement. Five minutes after, she tried to detach herself from me but I was afraid to let her go at this point. Ants now moved from my head to my legs. <i>I won't be able to walk ever again</i>, I thought, so I intertwined my fingers behind her back in case she try to break free. I didn't even know why I did all that. The healthier part of me, part that wasn't attacked by ants, convinced me I will shatter all over the floor if I let her go and I knew <i>he</i> will kick me and call it drama rather than trying to put me back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWC: 1147<br>\r\nMy whole being was sickly upset. It felt like everything was just a bad dream where I've been chased by the monster, sweating hard while trying to escape its claws all while realizing that  I'm running in one place and the monster is just one step away. All I had to do is to wake up but waking up in my case meant I will face another monster. I felt his eyes probing my eyelids, waiting to swallow me whole as soon as I open them. <i>You're going to be alright</i>, I heard my boss's whisper again, and again, and again. She run her fingers gently over my hair, untying it slowly. I remember the feeling of relief when she did it. My heartbeats slowed down with her movement and gasps became longer. I was now breathing the air almost with full lungs. <i>I'm going to let go of you now and I'm gonna call medical center and whoever is on duty to see if they are available for us,</i> she said with her steady voice. My heart started to pump hard in my chests again when she mentioned medical center. <i>I'm not crazy, I just... I.. I can't walk and.. I can't anything</i>, my brain in my throat couldn't produce any sentence that would make sense. It was just stuck there, betraying me. I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to keep my fingers intertwined behind her back but they felt like gummy. With one harder push she detached herself and I was now sitting on the couch all by myself, with my eyes still closed. I saw myself crashing down on the floor even if the couch wasn't too high so the jump can kill me and <i>him</i>, sitting on the chair in the corner, not doing anything about it or anything at all. At this point he knew I put the whole blame on myself, I didn't give any to him, yet he still just sat there with his mocking eyes. Few moments after I heard conversation between the nurse and my boss. Apparently, she said she will come over here rather than have me going there. Ants now moved to my stomach and I curled myself on the couch when they attacked gizzard, causing the feeling of vomiting. <i>Ladies don't vomit in front of bunch of strangers, what do you think they will say about you?</i> I put my hand against my mouth and decided to prevent gush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse came surprisingly fast. She brought some papers with herself, at least that's the only thing I saw. Like my boss, she too tried to speak with me in calm manner. I didn't know why did they treat me like that, I wasn't violent or anything, I didn't need to calm down. I was just... messed up. When she saw I couldn't even tell her my name she just told me I have to walk down to the medical center so that they can inject valium. Both of them took my hands and got me up from the couch. Since the ants were now in my stomach I could make slow steps toward. I felt <i>his</i> eyes on me and this time I managed to take a look at them. <i>He</i> looked shocked. I felt sorry for <i>he</i> never saw me this way and I felt sad because I knew <i>he</i> will hate me now even more. <i>This is all your fault, no one else's</i>, thoughts fluttered around my head as I dragged my feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my brain is slowly going back to my head, my heartbeats slowing down and my eyelids becoming heavy. Ants were finally beat down by meds. <i>I'm sorry</i>, I said to my boss as she was sitting on the edge of my bed. I guess this was the end of my career. She just covered me up and didn't say anything. I wasn't expecting anything more than that, she was just a stranger that happened to be part of all this... charade or whatever normal people call it. <br>\r\n<i>I'll never be alright again</i>.<br>\r\n<i>You will, just look for someone new.</i><br>\r\nShe didn't understand me at all. No one did.</span></div></div>",

Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to find my words, I bobbed my head for yes.

As sobs lodged in my throat, I couldn't see a way out of here. They told me I killed my husband, but that can't be right. I'd know if I had. Surely. \"No no no no,\" I repeated over and over until I must have fallen asleep right there, sitting on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething knocked my hand, and I woke up.

Someone was unlocking the door. I didn't know what was worse, experiencing that demented doctor again or whatever was taunting me in this batted room.  The door opened and two men in white uniforms walked in. I assumed they were orderlies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall muscular brunette spoke first. \"Hello Elizabeth. The doctor has decided you've had enough time to calm down.\" He pointed to the muscular blonde man next to him. \"This is Mike and my name is Jason.

They reached a long hallway and at the entrance there was a sign that read Maximum Security, monitored 24 hours a day.  Mike swiped a card and the doors opened. At the end of the hall, they stopped at a door, swiped the card again, unlocking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked at me. \"This will be your home for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped inside the windowless room. There was only a mattress on the floor. \"What happened to the rest of the furniture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason winked and his voice carried a hint of sarcasm. \"We wouldn't want you to go and find something to hurt yourself with, now would we.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \" I understand\" I moved my arms forward as much as I could with the restraining jacket. \"So, are you going to remove this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason removed it and I sat on the bed, looking up at the two men. \"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked down at her and smiled slightly. \"One of us will be back in a few hours to get you.

Jason looked at him in recognition, obviously knowing something she didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike leaned forward. \"Doctor Johansson will be calling for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Doctor Caldwell? Will I be seeing her again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike furled his eyebrows and he seemed to be getting annoyed. \" I don't know, but you'll be seeing Johansson soon.

Debates over who the prophecy referred to have been ongoing in the interim, to little avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, like all good prophecies, it was extremely vague and universal in its details, making it almost impossible to determine whether or not any individual or reign corresponded to the prophecy.

Since I can't run, the only option is to fight my way through these thugs and see if this whole thing was worth the trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ready my sword and wait for the nearest thug to get nearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's remarkable how quickly I managed to dispatch them. Their reliance on their numbers seems to have failed them in the confines of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make my way to the tower and proceed to search for the extended prophecy. It's long and tedious work, searching through the scattered and crumbling papers, and as I leaf through the final books in the uppermost room of the tower, I begin to doubt any such \"extended prophecy\" exists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I hear something out the tower window. I approach the window and look down to see a growing crowd of people gathering at the base of the tower, streaming in from a nearby town. They were already whooping and shouting, but when they saw me leaning out of the tower window, a wave of cheers broke through the crowd. Several voices rose above the cacophony, calling me \"lord\" and \"our savior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't actually be the Promised One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould I?</span></div></div>",

Then he heard the soft scuff scuff of sandals on the rough stone of the passage outside his tiny cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" she said through the narrow bars of his cell. \"I brought you food, I wish there were more, but the guards are the only ones here who get enough to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place, I remember a boat, and being sick from the rough water.

It was filled about half way with a thin broth with a few vegetables floating in it.  There was a cup of some kind of tea and some cooked rice on a little plate.  It was definitely less than he burned handling stone blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, what ever your name is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leila,\" She turned to leave, then reached through the bars. In her hand she had the shining disc of a penny from home.  She went down the passage the same way she had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squatted on the floor and ate with his fingers.  He tipped the bowl and drank every drop of the broth.  The rice was gone in three bites. Then he turned his attention to the bitter tea.  He drank it all at once and pushed te eating utensils under the bars. He stood holding the bars looking to see if he could see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe became dizzy and the sound of the dripping water took on the proportions of a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands over his ears he laid down on the filthy straw mat. Within seconds he lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a period of dark and dreamless sleep; He heard someone coming down the passage. The drip had mercifully stopped. His head was swimming and he had to urinate.  He used the toilet bucket with his back to the bars so if it was Leila he could preserve a tiny shred of decency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA male guard brought him a cup of water and a fist sized piece of dry hard bread.  \"Inde'ga Passo'.\" he grunted making motions of eating rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prisoner decided he had better eat in a hurry if he wanted to eat at all. The guard opened the cell door in a few seconds. The bread was still a lump half way to his stomach he desperately needed more water to wash it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard kept the sharp point of the spear tight against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the construction site he was shoved roughly into line where he would begin the tedious task of passing stone block after stone block down the line to where the builders were fitting them into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun rose higher in the sky he could feel the burning rays through his shirt and on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like many hours Leila came with a bucket of refreshing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ike beach guards killed your two friends when they put up a fight.

The brightest spot has been daily visits from Leila bringing water, and <br>\r\nher bringing what pitiful amount that was rationed for him at night. Each night he tried to get her to talk to him, with the same results.  She would place her finger over her lips. SHHH They are listening! Then she would leave down the passageway withe same shuffling sound as the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slept less each night, The amount of the drug in the tea must have been decreased or he was gaining tolerance to the drug in the tea. The guard brought him his stone hard piece of bread and a full cup of water. He let him finish the roll and even poured a little more water into the cup so he did not have a lump half way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning was different instead of being led to his place in line he was led to a shelter from the sun. There was an old gray haired man sitting in a padded chair. \"Do you understand me?\" the old man asked in heavily accented Minoan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prisoner nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" asked the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rus,\"he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRus shrugged his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiriti,\" said the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puzzled look an Rus's face prompted the old man to elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Seafarers have captured almost everyone who was not killed in the flood after Thera exploded.  Where are you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akrotiri,\" said Rus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been these last twelve years since Thera was destroyed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We fled to the west trying to stay ahead of the poison clouds. I do not know where we landed.  There were several storms.  I escaped slavery there around two months ago. Two companions and I stole a boat and left trying to reach home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no home to return to.  Even the birds avoid the dead island.\" The old man shook his head in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to live, you must do what you are told.  The Seafarers are terrible and think nothing of killing for sport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rus had seen three men beaten to death at their hands in the last few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't they run out of slaves if they keep on killing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time soon. There are still several cities left on the south coast that were spared from the floods after Thera exploded. The north coast is gone and there are two places the waves rushed over the land cutting Kiriti into three Islands until the water left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you lay stone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\"said Rus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, the stone layers get more to eat than those who pass rocks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand post and lintel construction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small blocks wedge the larger ones in place then smal blocks are placed on top of the lintel to raise the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man spoke in a strange tongue to one of the soldiers, who came and led Rus to another man dressed similarly to the old man with whom  Rus had talked. When the day was over the crew with whom Rus had been working filed to quarters for twelve.  One straw mat was thinner than the others.  It was also crawling with lice.  Rus was not sure this was better than isolation or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen food was brought, it was brought by three women, one of which was Leila.  The men squatted on the floor and ate with their fingers. There was twice as much food as Rus had received in isolation. When the meal was finished Leila motioned for Rus to follow.  Outside the quarters was a stack of fresh straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put a fresh layer on your bed,\" She picked up a bundle of dark green leaves with a strange odor.  Put this on top of the old straw before you put new straw on top.  It kills lice for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRus said, \"can we talk now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps tomorrow,\" said Leila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRus placed the leaves on the straw pallet and laid a four inch pad of new straw on top. That night he slept without the aid of the tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We did not question this until Man did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faith and Belief were no longer enough, Man started asking How, Were, and When and other such questions.

My husband at the time Carl was at work and we was headed to the park. After about an hour I noticed that the clouds were comeing in and it didnt look good. I had to get my three year old home before it started to rain. If I had known that it was going to be worse than that we wouldnt have left the house.<br>\r\nAs we were walking back to the house i heard sirens going off. My heart began to race and my son started to cry. All I could think was that a Tornado was comeing and we were still two blocks from the house. I picked him up and started running as fast as I could. I went through other peoples yards and cut through rose bushes but we made it just in time. I sat Christopher down and unlocked the front door as fast as I could.We then raced into the house and slide into the hallway I told him to stay put as I pulled a matress out and through it over him. I layed over the matress hopeing that it would be enough. After a few minutes I heard something that sounded like a train coming straight at us. I layed there praying that nothing would happen, that my son would be safe ,and that it would be over soon. And it was. I got my son and checked him over I then ran to the phone and tried to call my husband and then my parents. Just to come to the realization that the phones were out I then looked out side to see that the houses on either side wasnt just dameged but completly gone. About an hour later my husband showed up scared to death and happy that we were ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three other tornados that hit the town of beebe that day and over 16 people that were either injured or killed. including a friend of mines six month old baby tornados are scary and we moved within the week<br>\r\nOh and im right back in tornado valley Go Figure</span></div></div>",

I stopped to look at one of them, a white cross with only the family surname and the dates 1970-1988.

Why are we here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose brought up by parents with strong religious beliefs might say our purpose is to serve God. But if God is all powerful, why does he need mere mortals such as us to serve him? Can't he just snap his fingers or twitch his nose and immediately have whatever he wants? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers say there is no purpose, Life is just meant to be lived and enjoyed. You better do whatever you want to do now, because once you die that's all there is. But how can anyone be so sure that's all there is? What about all these people who come back from near death experiences and talk about seeing their deceased relatives, and the white light, and the feelings of peace and joy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome say our existence is a mere accident, a random byproduct of evolution that allowed sentience to occur on this little blue marble orbiting in just the right location around the Sun. And if that meteor hadn't come along and destroyed the dinosaurs when it did, intelligent life on this planet might well have been saurian instead of simian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers are convinced God created the Earth to be in the right place to allow life, and humanity to prosper. It's up to us to make the best of it and become the good stewards of this planet that he intended. And some say if we don't behave we'll be punished for all eternity when we die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for me, I'm too busy making a living to worry much about the meaning of life.

A stupid death is an excellent teacher, you can almost hear her saying \"Now don't choose to kick the bucket this way...\" Two deaths have heavily influenced me and my perspectives in life. One was the death of my father when I was about 13, the other was the death of a friend a couple years later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father died from complications of lung cancer, undoubtedly accrued from years of smoking no less than 30 cigarettes a day. That death's lesson was a reinforcement of common sense: don't smoke. But the impact of losing your father to a <i>habit </i>at a young age is quite forceful, and thus the lesson is learned quite well. I never really got to know my father. I was the last child of a second family, and he was always away on business. I surprised my parents by being conceived in their later years, when my mother was actually thinking of having her her fallopian tubes tied up so they could bear no more than three children, one dying from miscarriage. I admired what I knew of my father, and I still remember and am fond of his stories both fictional and otherwise. It was unfair that I had so little time to spend with him and with a complete family that subsequently fell apart without him, all because he fancies a smoke too often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good friend with whom I shared a second name committed suicide when he was about 15 years old. He strung himself up using one of the straps of his backpacks the night he got a good scolding from his father. His mother was promptly devastated, and us, his friends from school, were dumbfounded. I remember the wake. His mother was crying. So were some of my other pals. Everyone was quite affected, except me. And I never understood why. I never understood why I didn't feel a thing. I stood there and watched, careful of my expression and my words. I was also there during his funeral. I walked the line that went past his coffin that served as a final goodbye, and upon passing his wooden final resting place I knocked on its side twice, again, feeling nothing. I knew him enough to call him my friend. We shared some ridiculous moments as ludicrous pubescent boys. He hung himself and I didn't even flinch. Perhaps that was my unique reaction to the tragedy, the stupidity. My way of grief expressed by his family and other friends through streaming tears and consoling words. Anyway, the second lesson was taught: don't commit suicide. And was <i>that </i>not more ridiculous than the first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't smoke and don't commit suicide? Seriously?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, these lessons - though quite simple and self-justifying (not to mention self-explanatory) - are some of the simplest lessons people <i>never </i>learn and follow. So in the aftermath of both deaths I suppose I was lucky enough to learn without experiencing firsthand.</span></div></div>",

In the other was a .44 magnum, a smoking gun that saved his life.  </span></div></div>",

My eyes grow tired of watching the white lines. Sometimes they cross, and sometimes they zig-zag, but no matter, I keep the rig between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people say billboards litter the highways, but I like them. They give the mind something else to do, besides counting mile markers. My favorite thing to do, is to look down at the cars that pass me by. People do all kinds of things in there cars; drinking eating, doing drugs, and even having sex. I've seen it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun is higher now, and no longer glaring at me from the mirror. I didn't notice the state trooper that has probably been tracking me for the last five miles. I check my speed. Still within reason, but I let up anyway, just to give him his respect. There goes his lights. Time to make an unscheduled stop. Some of these guys can be real ball-busters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big rig comes to a stop on the shoulder of this barren stretch of highway. I gather all of my necessary papers and wait for him. He's your typical trooper, complete with the smokey-the-bear hat, shiny shin high black boots, and black shades to cover-up his bloodshot eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning officer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You skipped a scale - back about ten miles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never even saw it. Perhaps it was the sun blazing in my mirror, or the lack of sleep. Either way, I have just been busted for one of the most serious violations of them all. If I'm lucky, he'll give me a ridiculously huge ticket, if not, he'll make me follow him back to the scale and probably want to inspect my cargo. I wonder what's in there... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I didn't miss any scale regardless of the sun and fatigue. I'm tempted to ask to see his badge but decide to keep quiet. For now. My left hand finds its way to the weapon in the door pouch.

Beads of sweat started to form on my forehead and my stomach turned with nausea. I knew that I had to get out of there. Should I risk gunning it now and lose my job.  A job that took six months to get. No one really wanted to hire a woman even though they couldn't come right out and say that. There was always some lame excuse that the position was already filled or they will call me back but never do. Just like the officer said, there aren't many female drivers around here. A wave of nausea shot through my body again.  I was getting desperate. I needed to go now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sir! Did you hear me? I can't give you these papers without your badge and ID, it's company poli--\" I started to repeat, but was interrupted by the horrible sound of metal crashing upon metal. Then an explosion shook my rig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The trooper took off running, yelling for assistance into his radio. I sat in shock for a moment and then a surge of adrenaline coursed through my veins. I dropped my papers and grabbed the fire extinguisher. Jumping down from my rig I ran towards the back of my trailer. The smokes and flames burned my eyes and lungs. What happened? Were they still alive? I could see part of a car rammed underneath the trailer. My heart sank.</span></div></div>",

The metal is hot, and I squint as a flash of sunlight off the windshield stabs me in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is bound to be fun. I've never been a policeman yet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil yesterday, I'd never been a truck driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor,<br>\r\nRich man, poor man, beggar man, thief.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sing the rhyme quietly to myself as I open the driver's side door. Already I've been a sailor and already I've been a soldier. Certainly I've been a rich man, and just as certainly I've been poor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I am, and always have been, and always will be, a thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leather seat squeaks as I slide into the cabin, and I let out a low whistle at all the buttons and switches and displays. I never realized how many controls it takes to run a cop car. I figured you just needed an extra button next to the emergency lights to turn on the sirens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or what about a cowboy, policeman, jailer,<br>\r\nEngine driver, or a pirate chief?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can add policeman to my resume now, I think with a grin as I accelerate slowly back onto the highway, leaving the truck behind. I suppose I've been a jailer of a sort, too. That cop isn't the first person I've left behind, trapped in a trailer, or in a basement, or under a makeshift cairn of stones as I've made off with a new identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not enough, you see,  to steal the patrol car and make a run for it. I run my palms delicately over the steering wheel until I feel a patch of heavy smudge left behind by the cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's good. It means I won't have to search the rest of the cabin to complete the theft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep my eyes firmly on the road as I lean forward to run my tongue over the steering wheel, where the smudge of sweat and body oil and skin flakes is thickest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis DNA is delicious, and the old, familiar thrill runs through me. My vision blurs, but the highway is straight and empty, and when I emerge on the other side I've only drifted half out of the lane. I steer back to a central course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wish I knew how to run the sirens. I wish I had the uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least now I have the face. The rest will be easy enough to get if I can only find an address to go with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the cruiser and the uniform and the face, it will be so easy the next time I want to try for something new!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh it's such a lot of things there are<br>\r\nAnd such a lot to be<br>\r\nThat there's always lots of cherries<br>\r\nOn my little cherry tree!</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The car slows nicely and spins on a dime with a mere flick of the wheel. Momentarily, I marvel at this and wonder what else it can do. \"More importantly, where is it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome sort of natural instinct, or perhaps my fantasy about being a policeman, takes over as I follow behind the lumbering giant. I look over for button to turn on the siren. Unmarked, I press one that looks promising. There's a low pop and a shadow rises in the rear-view mirror. Trunk release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to stop and close as I scan the center console's array of knobs and switches. But what catches my eye is the radio's microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An elephant is running down, um . . .\" A street sign flashes before the car then quickly disappears beneath it as I swerve back onto the road. \"Broadway. I'm in pursuit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline fuels my actions. A hard turn on screeching tires almost slides me into the passenger seat making me wish I'd fastened my seat belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What elephant? Who is this? Where are you on Broadway and which one - avenue or street?\" squawks from the dash speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> A big gray one</i> stalls in my head as a reply because I'm not sure how to answer the other questions. <i>I'm just a guy who stole a police car after locking the cop in a trailer of monkeys</i> is probably not good either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant makes a turn into a park through a large gate, plenty big for the car to go through. It'd be easy to follow across the lawn and through the wide-spread trees. A large tent is behind them - a place to switch again? I don't have a uniform, and what will I do if I catch it. And I haven't found the siren and lights switch! Then again, I've always liked the circus.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her high-pitched laughs were brittle, sounding almost artificial. But she was too good. Too good at what she did to ever break the facade she had so carefully built. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the hot girl standing at the corner. One hand resting on her small hip, or perhaps accidently on purpose stroking her large chest, the other hand sweetly beckoning to men in expensive cars who wore business suits, and had wives and children at home. She knew what they wanted, and they knew she'd give it to them. For the right price though, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at her, and tried to smile. It felt wrong, as if my muscles had forgotten how to pull and twist my lips into a friendly grin. Her own smile faltered then, her pretty pink mouth curving downward. A deep, fatigued sigh escaped her. \"I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.......\" she confessed, eyes vacantly gazing over my shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're almost there, just five hundred more dollars, and he'll be safe,\" I told her, feeling a sense of sudden urgency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she sighed, and slumped against the side of the brick building. \"I know, I know.......I just-\" Her eyes squeezed shut, a lone tear slid down her sparkly cheek. \"What if it doesn't work?\" she whispered. \"What if it comes back, and he dies? Then all of this.........would have been for nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head violently. \"No, not for nothing! You <i> tried </i> and that's what matters. What if you had done nothing, and he did die? Would you have been to forgive yourself for that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp sob met my words. She sank down, holding herself in a ball of fishnet and shiny pleather, tears tracing lines down her face. \"I just want him to be ok.......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer younger brother, still a child, was in the hospital with a brain tumor. He was scheduled for chemotherapy, but no one knew if he would survive in the end. Though her family had long since cut off contact with her, she'd learned the news from a sympathetic aunt. It was this that had driven her to the streets to make money to send to him. Truth be told, I had no idea if what she was doing would actually help, but I couldn't bear to be the one to destroy the last shreds of hope she clung to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been outside a McDonald's that I first met her. I was walking home from my first day of tenth grade. We'd spotted each other at the exact same time - an expression of apprehension on her face, a look of faint shock on mine. I could have sworn several minutes passed before she plastered on a huge grin and walked towards me, sticking her hand out and introducing herself as \"Kitten\". Somehow, we ended up sitting across from each other in a booth inside the resturant chewing on greasy burgers and salty fries, and slurping large cups of pop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you say your name was?\" she asked me through a mouthful of soggy beef. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never did,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked momentarily perplexed, but then smirked as she leaned over the table and whispered conspiratorially, \"I think I'll call you..........Tinkerbell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at her, unsure if it was a joke, or if she was being serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to sense my discomfort, she patted my arm and reassuringly told me \"I'm not teasing. Tink is cool, and you are too, 'cause you bought me lunch!\" Her eyes sparkled with mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next two weeks, we met at McDonald's, my allowance slowly being drained from my pocket as I continued to treat us both to lunch. Through the course of that time, I found out about her job, her little brother, and her parents. In turn, I told her about my family, my teachers, and the few friends I had. She seemed almost desperately interested in what my life was like. \"It sounds a lot better than mine,\" she'd laughed. But there'd been no humor in her voice, only a deep longing, a wistfulness, that had made my heart feel like it was twisting inside my chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't bear to be the one to destroy the last shreds of hope she clung to..............<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked, Tink........it fucking worked!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I could only stand there, mouth hanging open stupidly. She grabbed me in as tight a bear hug as her thin arms would allow. \"It worked, it worked,\" she repeated breathlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother......he's gonna be alright?\" I asked, even though I already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right he is!\" she agreed, her teeth bared in a wild grin. She suddenly started laughing, the sound bordering on mania. As quickly as the laughter had begun, it stopped. \"You know what this means?\" she asked. Before I could say anything, she answered herself. \"It means I can leave......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave where?\" I cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.........\" she waved her arms in a vague gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I never did learn what she meant by that. She dragged me into McDonald's for a celebratory lunch, for the first time complete with dessert. I could not banish the sense of foreboding that hung in my mind like a miasma. Standing back outside the resturant, she hugged me again, this time gently. When she pulled back, there was a strange look in her eyes that I couldn't decipher. Like usual, I was the one to walk away, but this time, I glanced back after I'd crossed the road. She was gone. It was the last time I saw her since then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a year, and I find myself sitting in our booth at McDonald's. I've lost count of how many times I mused over her words: \"It means I can leave.......here........\" What did she really mean? I resign myself to the fact that I will probably never know if she simply left the city, or perhaps the state, or if she was dead, the purpose of her life fulfilled. In the end I suppose it doesn't really matter. It's who she was that struck me so deeply. A hooker with a heart of gold...........who'd have thought? </span></div></div>",

We may do the Mona Lisa with a spray can, but it is still the Mona Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't easy making our Glorious Leader look his best day after day. Sure the movie people produce more glamorous footage, but our work is all the greater, considering what we have to work with. Our Glorious Leader is not conventional leading man material. He has that little kink that unkind people are brave enough to call a hunchback and his eyes give the viewer an uneasy feeling. We just have to work that much harder to help viewers to understand his greatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of us in the Promotion of Happiness Department love our work. Malcontents like Theodore don't really count, especially when they get sent to the Camps for Rehabilitation. The rest of us put in extra hours out of relief to have whiners like Theodore gone. Boy is it ever great to be able to get on with our wonderful important work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am especially proud of the way the Department spruced up the story of our Glorious Leader's past regarding his Sex Worker sister. Some people might have wanted to give up on finding a way to make that cheerful. There is just nothing like a Sex Worker with a heart of gold to pluck at heartstrings. Having our Glorious Leader's sister working to pay for his chemotherapy was a really nice touch. I don't think we had better put in anything about her time in the Camp for Rehabilitation. Well, maybe we can have a cute starlet show her being deliriously happy learning to better serve the state and living happily ever after, when she becomes an asset to our Society. Yeah. That might work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is just so wonderful to work for the Promotion of Happiness Department. I already work twelve hours a day six days a week, doing my part to keep our Perfect Society functioning at its best. If I didn't have to spend so much time commuting, I would, of course, be working at least sixteen hours a day. It is too bad I have to spend so much time doing boring things like eating and sleeping. If I didn't have to do all of that, it could give me even more time to contribute to the Promotion of Happiness Department!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know that our science department is working away on the problem of losing so much productivity to eating and sleeping needs. Who knows when they might come up with an advance that will give us many more hours to contribute toward keeping our Perfect Society functioning at its best!  Words to describe my feelings fail me. I am sure everyone in the Promotion of Happiness Department feels the same way I do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease send a copy of this to all staff members and post extras on all bulletin boards. I am so glad to serve our Glorious Leader and our Perfect Society! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. Don't forget that attendance at the Celebration of Happiness Parade this Saturday is mandatory. Don't forget to have a wonderful time and smile a lot for all of the cameras. Big smiles are also mandatory. Have fun. (The last is optional.)</span></div></div>",

I'm in complete and utter rebellion as I watch the happy people posing perfectly with plastered smiles on their faces. Streamers fall down from the sky and I brush on of the obtrusive objects away from my shoulder. I have plans that I've made in my moment of mayhem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes scan the backpack I have hidden underneath my arm. I tuck it in tight and walk toward one of the floats that is covered in flowers. This shouldn't do too much damage but just enough to shake things up. I keep pace with the vehicle driving it and look across the sea of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA camera is shoved in my face. I push a hand in front of it to block but fail to do so in time. Now they have a picture of me, I'll have to take care of this guy after the fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're supposed to smile,\" he chastises me. There's some kind of cologne coming from him that smells divine. He has blue  eyes and is wearing an even bluer shirt. A tatto adorns his right bicep and peeks out from under his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To hell with smiling,\" I reply. My head tilts back as I take a long draw from my cigarette. The smoke fills my lungs and steadied my nerves. I know once I light the bomb he'll be an unfortunate victim from the fire. Lit by my own cigarette and tossed within the flowery confines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear that,\" he replies. The man gives me a cool look up and down. I hesitate with my decision of lighting this whole world on fire. What should I do? </span></div></div>",

Her indecipherable handwriting covered the charcoal-smudged pages like vehement red stitches. In between the ragged lines I found tiny pencil <b>sketches</b>. Tiny fragments of people that made my face heat. She had never expected those pencilled ghosts of desire to see the light. I felt like I was opening her skin up, cutting through her muscles and looking inside. It was like the first time I looked at porn, but worse. Her soul wasn't meant for my consumption.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I never could tell her about how I had violated her privacy while she was away.

It's as if I'll disappear, or blow up if he's not watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, it could probably be all my fault. I've never once stop him--never once objected to his hard-boiled stare. I know, I know. What in Pete's name is a hard-boiled stare? It's the way he looks at me, those deep piercing blue eyes full of cat-like curiosity and tides of incoming visions of me. He looks at me as if I'm the only one in the room--and I'm sure that sounds hell creepy--but honestly, I boil under his gaze. My soft center hardens slowly and I remember all the anger. I remember all those late nights we spent yelling at each other, awful words and harsh tones, when we were both just frustrated beyond our tired minds. And then there were afternoons where I wanted nothing more that to be in his arms as we lay the abandoned tree-house where we would watch the sun set in an explosion of tangerine and plum. It makes me bitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God, he makes me so bitter and resentful, like I'm some woman scorned... and then I remember why he tore us apart, why he changed. I expect many things to change a person, and hell, circumstances matter but it was never supposed to be like this. I was never supposed to act like this; like he was the last person on Earth that mattered. I hate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like I said.

Within minutes we're above the clouds.

So what went wrong with me?<br>\r\nFor the first thirteen years of my life i struggled to come up with an answer for you. I still don't know how to answer that question. All I wonder is, did you ever really pay attention to anything i did?<br>\r\nRemember 6th grade graduation? I got an award for the best improved in art, I thought you would be happy, but you weren't. When I got home you talked about how i should of stood up straighter and not have my shoulders all slumped over. Then you yelled at me cause i slumping at that very moment. Couldn't you see that I did that because i was nervous and uncomfortable. i don't like being in front of large crowds or being yelled at. Not once did you say anything about my art award, which i was once so proud to have gotten.<br>\r\nOh, and this is a memory i remember while. My report came in 7th grade and i was failing math. Chris had a B in math and Andy a A. What was it you told me \"You have two smart brothers, your mom is even smart, and I'm sure as hell no dummy, so why the hell are you so retarded.\"<br>\r\nDo you realized how much that hurt. Did you see the A in English or the B in history, I was even passing science. I cried myself to sleep that night. It only gets worse and worse from there. You abused me in more way than just those verbal assaults. You know you did and that's why you are where you are now.<br>\r\nI use to wake up wishing I was dead, I didn't know if i could face another day. I believe Chris realized this and that's why he told. We are proud people and like to deal with our problems ourselves, I know how hard it was for him to do what he did.  <br>\r\nWe move in with Mom, and for once I'm called beautiful and smart. I don't have to worry about what happens late at night or what will happen when that report card gets home. My grades still weren't good, I'm sure that's what you're thinking. I wonder if you noticed that I made the highest grade in history. Did you know that if I hadn't of failed a test on Shakespeare I would of made English Honors. Then there was that time when i spent every waking minute trying to write a book. I threw away so much paper that Chris finally snatched one out the trash and read it. He was amazed and he thought i would be the next best thing. I guess he was wrong.<br>\r\nMany years have passed since we lived with you. I'm 18 now and I have graduated high school. It's funny really, you always figured I'd be the one to drop out and Andy would be the one to graduate. Instead it was the other way around. I didn't get the highest grades in the class, in fact i believe i had some of the lowest. But you know something, that doesn't mean I'm stupid. I'm very smart, but I'm lazy. <br>\r\nI can go on and on but I won't. All I want to let you know is that I'm sorry I didn't meet your high expectations. I'm sorta glad i didn't. I know it may sound wrong but I've learned some stuff about myself through my failures. But the biggest changes in my life I have to give all the credit to my friends, online and off. Maybe you get some credit somewhere, we'll have to see about that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour daughter    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surreal confusion took over , as <br>\r\nI looked over the grass, shimmering as though strewn with diamonds. The pavement was clean of any broken glass. The blood had washed out of<br>\r\nmy clothes and my car. The windows had been replaced. I felt no pain , only a furthered detachment from any reality as I stared at the shimmering<br>\r\ngrass.

All it took was a millisecond for his world to shatter into a million pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been laughing, and he had been pondering the thought of how lucky he was to have such a handsome and loving man next to him in the car. His man was shining light on old memories they had created together, memories he relished dearly. Silly memories like how they first met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had both mysteriously gone to the same amusement park alone, pulled by the same desire of adventure and thrill. They had stood at opposite gates waiting anxiously for their turn on the roller coaster. Once seated down and strapped down, they both had confessed it would be their first roller coaster ride in both of their lives. They both chuckled nervously at the slim chance they encountered themselves in as the ride began. Fifteen seconds later, the roller coaster stopped. Half the carts were facing down the first big hill, theirs at the cusp of plunging down with them. The intercom system had shouted for patience as there happened to be a malfunction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So there they both found themselves, in another almost-impossible situation, trying not to freak out. His roller coaster buddy kept mumbling that only one in twenty-four million people died in roller coaster rides. Even though those statistic should have comforted him, all Jayson could think at that moment was that his day so far had been one of crazy chance and that one in twenty-four was looking awfully alluring. The man next to him glanced at him once, saw how horrified he was, took his hand in his, and said it would all be ok with a reassuring smile. A few seconds later the ride continued without a hiccup and Jayson took comfort on the stranger's hand the whole ride, maybe squeezing a bit too hard at times. Once it ended, Jayson realized he was still clutching the man's hand and let go with a sheeppish grin and few shades of red in his face. Like the marvelous man he was, the stranger only smiled and introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow their story ended at another impossible chance as he laid on the grass, ten feet away from his smoldering car. He had only glanced away for less than a second to tell the man he loved how much he meant to him. But he laid there, unable to make a sound as he saw the same hand that had comforted him, under the wreckage of what once was his car. Jayson was scared as hell, and now there was no man to tell him it would all be ok. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had to be seen by both of us.<br>\r\n     You understand?  Secrets, large or small, when they are personal and involve no one else but you and a friend can be shared.  If not, it's a good way to find out the value of friendship. Not to purposely put friendship to a test for it does that quite well by it's very nature, but somethings must be brought forward and looked at, together.  They can be the glue that defines one or the other and sometimes both.<br>\r\n      I was hoping this wasn't a deal breaker but I had to put it out there because I couldn't carry it anymore.  It was getting heavier and it was distracting me from what I considered to be more important things to focus on.  In hindsight I'm glad I spilled the beans when I did.  The timing couldn't have been any better.  <br>\r\n     Since we had been going together for over a year and felt comfortable with the ups and downs of each others natures, I was shocked but pleased at the fire that, I guess was there but lying dormant until activated!   Well I activated it!  It was LIKE KICKING A PUPPY THAT KICKS BACK!<br>\r\n      She went and got the sketchbook and made me describe my feelings about what I was looking at.  Each and every one of the sketches I had to describe in detail.  Here's the puppy kicking back.  There were many more pages I hadn't seen because they weren't written or drawn on back then.  She had me take my time and review her new sketches and read her comments as she had me describe what I felt about what I was seeing.  In the course of us going over her sketchbook honestly and together we learned a lot more about each other and our particular and unique to ourselves, way of looking at the world we are surrounded by.  <br>\r\n      We've been married now thirty years.

My buttocks had fallen asleep and the pins and needles<br>\r\nthere and in my legs when the circulation was returning, was so painful it was all I could do not to cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      I had learned a lot.  New Zealand is a country not an island state of Australia as Tasmania is.  Australians (aussies, pronounced ozzies)  are fiercely competitive against New Zealanders (called Kiwis-after a beach living small king-fisher).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Zealand is consists of three islands, narrow and about the length of California, made up of a population of about <br>\r\nthree and a half million people.  Apparently the indigenous people found in N. Zed when the first Scottish settlers arrived, the Maoris(Polynesians), had eaten the indigenous people they found when they arrived, the Morioris(Polynesians}. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The Maori name for New Zealand is The Land of the Long White Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The furthest one can get from the ocean in New Zealand is fifty-five miles.  They have more boats per person than any other country in the world which helps explain their dominance in international sailing competitions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Anything and everything that can be done on and with the water is available in N. Zed.  The South Island has tremendous snow skiing.  It also has volcanic activity for viewing and exploration.  It has many world renown hiking trails, day and overnight, with and without guides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Kiwis get along with Americans but do have a tongue-in-cheek type of humor and will, \"Have ya on\", but all in good fun.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      I love the ocean but my wife feels like salt and sand are out to get her.  She didn't swim in the ocean before she saw the movie, Jaws.  But after the movie she hates to even fly over the ocean!  So Why New Zealand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The only way I'm going to find out why she chose New Zealand is to come right out and ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The adults would sit on the couch and us kids would sit on the floor.  We watched whatever they chose to watch.  We were just glad to be able to see a television.  Usually one night a week is all Dad would allow.  The whole family went together; my mom, my dad, my little brother, and me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now we were to have our own television set.  We could watch what we wanted to watch.  As Dad and a neighbor carried the big box into the house, I was so excited I jumped up and down.  I knew this would change my life.  Now I could talk to the other kids at school about what we watched on TV.  That would be geat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelevision opened up an entire new world to me.  I would rush home from school to watch \"The Howdy Doody Show\" and then \"Ozzie and Harriet.\"  Saturday mornings there were back-to-back cartoons.  I was in heaven.  I grew up with Annette and Spin and Marty on the Mickey Mouse Club and learned to dance with all the kids on Dance Party.  Yes, television certainly enhanced my life.

Girls all over the school had been seen hanging around in small \" packs \" waiting to be invited to go to the prom. They all we're waiting to be invited by the more handsome students, the football players. Not the person i was. Although being 6.6 feet of height, it made me a gentle giant, not an athlete, so I would stay late in the library working on reports, studying and even reading for pure pleasure. Not what you would call a lady's man. But I wasn't the only one. My best friend, Frederic, or Fred for short, was always there with me. He was the comedy guy, the class-clown, and, nominated the funniest guy in school three times in three straight years. He wanted to become a T.V. Star, and have is own show. He was the best to talk too. But also, a girl from my year who also used to hang out in the library after school. She didn't talk much, she looked shy and further more, bullied by the cheerleaders. One night, I got feed up, so i made a plan that didn't involved violence to help her. One night, when she was being picked on again, my plan went into effect. I knocked over a book from a top shelve from the other side of it and quickly made my way down the ladder to continue my plan. When one of the cheerleaders when t check on who has dropped the book, nobody was there. Then it happened. Two snakes came out of the bottom of the shelves heading towards the cheerleaders. They ran off the library screaming that it was snake infested. But it turned out to be me and Fred pulling the so called snakes ,made of wood with gaps to slitter across the floor, with nylon strings at the end. The girl came to us and thanked us, to which Fred pointed that i was the true hero, he was simply the sidekick. her name was Rosanne, and in that moment i asked her to go to the prom with me. She accepted, blushing like the fading sun of a summer evening.<br>\r\nThe day of the prom came, and i picked her up at her place. She lived on the same street that the school was, so we came on foot, but that didn't matter. She was gorgeous like a rose that had just bloomed. It was a magical night. Even Fred had gotten a date for the prom. She also dreamed to be a T.V star, just like Fred, and also was the first who found Fred's Charming side. It was the best night ever for the two couples, and it seemed that it would go on forever and ever.</span></div></div>",

Like siamese twins conjoined at the head (sharing the same brain), they were magicians with batons. \"SWISH\" went the batons and my computer and cell phone vanished. Another \"SWISH\" and there went my car. The only way to escape their Alcatraz was to get pregnant and guilt Fred into marrying me. Then Fred would mortgage his life to buy me my own home!

He is paranoid schizophrenic.  I knew that BEFORE the wedding , but still married him anyway.  He wanted to keep his illness a secret from everyone, but my best friend had his number.  She was the one who schooled me in mental illness.  Just like he asked, I didn't tell my family.  I met his family, which consisted of his mother, who nwas also ill, his younger siblings, and his nephew.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking back on that wedding, April 4, 1992,  my  nerves weere on edge, I couldn't eat, and my mother took over everything.  My parents did put money toward the wedding, but she crossed very clear boundaries.  My ex-husband didn't have a car, and I don't drive.  It was pretty disheartening to ride in the car as a newly married couple with the bride's parents.  My ex had a strange look on his face.  This was a first marriage for me; it was his second.  At his insistence, we married in a non denominational church.  I was born and raised Catholic.  He was Methodist.  It seemed the only thing that I made a decision on was my outfit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The reception was held at a nearby hotel.  My best friend was my  matron of honor.  She also sang at the ceremony.  Everything regarding the reception was almost cancelled due to my mother's controlling behavior.  I did have the absolute best DJ in our area.  We nate, danced, laughed, and had a great time.  We were staying at the hotel.  Due to a trivia game that was played earlier nin the week, we stayed for the weekend.  My parents stayed until Monday because they had to take us to get important documents made.  So that was our honeymoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The morning after the wedding, my ex asked me if I wanted to stay married.  I was shocked at the question.  I asked him if he was sorry he married me.  He didn't answer.  We had a separation for seventeen months.  By this time we had a car.  It was used.  The reason for the separation was due to the fact that he abused me physically.  After we got back together, there were almost daily fighting.  During one of these, I asked him why he didn't speak up when the minister saide \"Does anyone have just cause why these two should not marry.  His reply was that he didn't want to hurt me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We were married for five years.  We didn't have any children.  I have seen nor heard from him in fifteen years.  I remarried twelve years and have one son.  There have been problems, and I wanted to get a divorce but will stay married until my son turns eighteen.  I am better off single.  </span></div></div>",

There were no strange phone calls or bizarre door-to-door salesmen. No unexpected house fires, or worse, unexpected cat infestations. For once, that dog across the street even decided not to spend the night wailing at the stars. Yes, this had turned out a perfectly quiet day. It was driving her crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying in bed, watching the minute hand on the clock tick ever closer to midnight, she wondered when it would happen. The conditions of their bet were very clear: by losing, Susan forfeited her right ever to have a normal day. She was Satan's plaything, someone he could torment all he wanted. Originally, she expected his tormenting to take the form of eternal fire and brimstone, maybe a chasm opening under her feet for a fast track to the underworld, but she soon learned she was wrong. Satan preferred more mundane methods. Like having some random gun send a bullet through her front window, only to miss her head by an inch or so. Or having the pipes under her house burst while her car rolled down the driveway to knock over her mailbox. There was even that one day where everything she ate tasted like it came out of the Red Sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan spent each day since the bet looking out for whatever Satan was going to throw at her. Like a mouse in an electric cage, she feared every spark; the smallest jolt made her run for fear of a greater blast. That fear had been her life for so long, she couldn't even remember why she had let herself be put into this cage. Oh, she remembered making the bet, but the details had faded to the point that she had no idea what that bet had actually been about, or what she had hoped to gain from it. Maybe that was how Satan kept her from getting out of the cage, or maybe Susan just had a poor memory. Either way, there was nothing she could do about it now except hope her torments in the coming day wouldn't be the ones to kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet for some reason, nothing bad happened today. She had been prepared for the worst since the past few days were relatively mild, as far as Satan was concerned, but now it was only five minutes until the next day. Only five minutes for Satan to make her day miserable. He never before failed to keep the terms of the bet, so Susan watched the clock, expecting and dreading something horrible to happen before that minute hand finally fell on the twelve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour minutes left. The moon was cresting the horizon, sending pale silver light through the bedroom window. Maybe Satan was planning for her to be attacked by a werewolf. That would be new. Not quite in keeping with what he usually does, but the thought still made Susan slip her hand under her pillow to grasp her small handgun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree minutes left. There were no figures out her window yet. She would be ready to shoot if one did show up. But what if that is what Satan wanted? Her window faced toward the street, so what if someone was just taking a late-night stroll, and she ended up killing that person? She didn't want to be unprepared, but she slipped her hand off her gun anyway, choosing to rest her hand next to it. No reason to take too many chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes left. Still nothing happened. The clock kept ticking, tick and tock without stop. At least, Susan thought it was the clock. What if there was a bomb? If there was, it would be set to go off before the strike of midnight. Shouldn't she run? Of course, even if it wasn't a bomb today, there would be something else tomorrow to threaten her life. Might as well just wait and see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne minute left. Now that she thought about it, the dog's silence tonight might not have been a good thing. What if there was a serial killer making his way through the neighborhood? He would have had plenty of time to kill the dog and anyone else before making his way to her house. Her eyes darted from the clock to the window. Nothing, at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked back at the clock. Mere seconds until midnight. Tick. What was going to happen? Tock. Was she going to die? Tick. Whatever it was going to be, it was going to be fast. Tock. Midnight. She was out of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up and stared at the clock. The hands were still moving; midnight had come, and nothing happened. She reached for the side table and grabbed her cell phone. Yes, that also said it was midnight. It didn't make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatan never left her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there, trying to understand. Was she free from the bet? She couldn't see how; nothing had changed. So why did nothing happen to her yesterday?  She was Satan's plaything. Tormenting her was something he enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she realized the truth. Nothing might have happened, but she had still been tormented. Satan toyed with her -- by doing nothing. Her fear and imagination did the rest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yes, Satan toyed with me. He is toying with all of us, everyone in this world. Because we feed him; our fear feed him. The fear of dying, the fear that none of us could get rid of. Ever since I felt the warmth that sunlight brings, I have known that one day I have to leave this all behind and go on a journey no one ever found a way back. That I have to disappear into the oblivion without receiving a warning beforehand. I have known day after day, year after year I am getting closer to the undeniable. Even after all these years, I was not prepared when the moment came; or at least as the Satan himself made me believe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years I prepared myself to welcome the death. I thought I'm prepared. It gave me a sense of superiority. I wanted to prove that I'm superior. Even to the Satan. Yes, I bet with Satan to prove that I am prepared; I fear the death no longer. The burning urge to prove myself made me do it. I challenged Satan. That I am no longer feeding him with my fear. I challenged that he no longer has any control over me. With the madness of proving myself, I bet that when the moment comes, I will be prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I angered the devil. He gave me till midnight to live with the fear of dying. Yet it was a triumph in my eyes. \"I will beat the almighty devil tonight\", I bragged. At that fraction of the second, I was superior, even to the devil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once he disappeared, a numbness started spreading through my body. All the fears I held up pressed against the walls of logics I built up and broke free. Since then fear consumed me. I could not force myself away from the clock, counting down the seconds I have left to live. I was suffocating, gasping for breath. Air seemed to be tightening around my body. I felt like I am about to explode. With the fear that I thought I had overcome, I awaited my death, dying in every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatan did not kill me. He didn't need to. I died thousand times in my mind. What difference could another death make? And Satan won. He must be laughing at my worthless soul that thought he could beat the devil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was wrong. No matter how much you prepare for the death, you will only be unprepared when the time comes. Death is not a test of one's strength or understanding. Death is a debt that that everyone should pay for the life that Satan loaned to us. You don't have to be prepared for the death. You can't be. You just pay the debt. Whether you like it or not, Satan doesn't care.   </span></div></div>",

I considered bringing her body back to her family, sealed in the biobag.  But then common sense took hold. Better to leave it in cryostorage back at the base, you can't be too careful. Whatever this bug is, it's lethal. And one little mistake is all it takes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeeka and I got along well. (I even considered asking her to marry me once, but neither of us really wanted that much commitment.) she was my \"go-to\" gal. Whenever an interesting job-op got posted on the Merc board, I'd ping her and see if she was free. Being together in a ship with nothing much to do but check the gauges once in a while and nothing else but the stars for company for a two or three month stretch seemed to work out OK for us. (We got along pretty well in the sack.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI called her as soon as I saw the posting. \"Fifty thousand credits each for a quick run out to Triton and back, easy money!\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they lost radio contact with Triton. It could be something horrible like a plague, or local life forms wiped them out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been watching too many old movies, you think we're gonna land on the base and find out they've all been attacked by head-crabs?\" I joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both liked watching classic old sci-fi movies, like \"Alien\"and the first three sequels. (the two after that don't count, they're crap.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, it's just a stray meteor hit the tower and they don't have the right stuff to fix it, that's why they're sending us out with a ship loaded with material to rebuild the antenna,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah, you're probably right. And it's been a while since we spent some \"quality time\" together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo a month later we landed on Triton and found out everone there was dead. We put on our hazmat suits and tried to figure out what happened. We saw that whatever it was, it made them go crazy. They wrecked the communications equipment, then they all killed each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeeka tore a hole in her suit on some jagged metal when we were taking blood samples from the bodies, we didn't notice it till we were back on the ship. I wasn't concerned, it was a small hole, but Teeka wanted to be sure she was OK so I took a sample from her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the ship I ran the samples through the processor. Hers didn't show anything unusual, but the others showed some strange bacteria, the computer didn't recognize it. As I was filing the data for futher analysis it happened. Teeka picked up an oxygen canister and smashed it into the communications panel and started screaming. \"We are death! Life is death! We must die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she attacked me with the canister but I managed to duck in time. I grabbed a fire extinguished and swung it around, knocking her unconscious. I tied her hands and feet with bungee cords from the cargo hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she regained consciousness she started ranting and screaming again, writhing like she was having a seizure. A few minutes later she stopped, and I checked her pulse and saw she was dead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took blood samples from her body and myself. Mine was negative, hers was positive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now, three weeks afterliftoff, I'm still feeling OK, wonderimg how I managed not to get the plague. I decide to check my blood again, just to be sure. It comes back positive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow I'm just a carrier, I don't feel any bad effects. Like Typhoid Mary, My blood is full of the bacteria, but I'm immune... Or am I? I'm starting to feel a little crazy, a little torn. One minute I'm thinking I should say the hell with it, not tell anyone about what happened, just land on earth and spread the plague. The next minute I'm thinking I should spare them, just reset my couse and never return to earth...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd never seen a lightbulb but my granmother used to explain to me how they worked.<br>\r\n      I wasn't going to SET THE CONTROLS FOR THE HEART OF THE SUN I was going to try what up until now was only theory as I was/am the perfect guinea pig or rhesus monkey (who were our first human stand ins as astronauts)  in the perfect position and circumstance and the right vehicle to attempt the David Effect.  <br>\r\n      The David Effect is a theory that using the speed of an approaching object at a maximum speed, no matter what that speed is, that speed is proportunate to the distance from the sun that the sun can be approached.  Forgeting heat for a minute.  Using the gravity in, to the curve and captured just for a moment then in the accelaration and a turning release from the sun's gravitional pull. slung at speeds impossible to attain with even nuclear projection.  Thus David and His sling that conquered Goliath from Gath.  <br>\r\n       No one knows what speeds can be attained but all scientists are aware of the magnetic pull of objects in space and their ratio of size to pull. They believe it might be close to light speed. How close can my ship get to the sun without meltdown?  The Earth feels it's warmth from 93 million miles.  Our moon is 275,000 miles away but it is held in place by the same power scientists believe we can manipulate from the sun, gravational pull.. This craft should be able to withstand being one million miles from the sun but even if I can't get that close the tremendous gravity it exerts can be utilized in a descending speed to distance from the sun ratio that isn't going to matter to me.  I've bought a one way ticket and just hope my transmissions will relay to Earth the information I gather if this theory holds water.  I've informed Earth of what has transpired and why I can't return.  I haven't heard from them because transmissions are never real time.  Our technology isn't even close.  Got hung up with fossil fuels for far to long and lost ground not just with our space program but with Earth and it's peoples.<br>\r\n      It's time to plot the course and speed and program the ship for the David Effect.

On this particular day the tour group was headed out in a glass bottom boat where we could look through the glass and watch the fish. By the time we were bored with that we had reached a small island with luxurious sand beaches. We couldn't really enjoy them because the sun was too hot. Instead we were<br>\r\nherded into bure (Fijian thatched cottage) which was one big room, dark but cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat down on the floor of the bure and were treated to a sumptuous meal followed by \u2018do what you like on the island but be back at the boat by the time they had chosen\u2019, which actually meant walking round the island or dozing off under a coconut tree, not necessarily a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked around the island with a group of people which included Americans, New Zealanders, a British couple and three Australian men who kept making strange remarks to the New Zealanders who didn\u2019t seem to understand them. May have been Kiwi bashing by the Ausies but only the Ausies were laughing and the rest of us were enjoying the beauty of the island even though being sizzled by the sun. I didn\u2019t know that in the future I would remember this island as so small that a tsunami wouldn\u2019t even notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the boat and being checked off a list by one of the tour people I noticed the sun low the horizon, a huge ball of red fire. I clicked many photos with my little plastic brownie which could take only 12 square photos that didn\u2019t do such beauty justice. But this beautiful scene didn\u2019t last very long, it was there and then it was gone by the time we arrived back on the main island of Viti Levu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we disembarked many of us couldn\u2019t take our eyes off the horizon where the sky was still red although the sun itself was out of site. It was so spectacular that we stood there on the shore as if mesmerised by the beauty of nature\u2019s glory. We were being called to board a bus to take us back to our hotels but it was as if we had to be pried off the ground. Who wanted to get on a bus and go back to a hotel, even a lavish one?

Two of the Australians in our tourist package bending over me and slapping my face is the first thing I saw coming from my ethereal wandering.

I was living a kodac moment on undeveloped film. Drab and dismal. I knew I could not call this home ever again.  I had been infected with a pecuilar but well known disease in certain areas of the World. There are two seperate reactions to this disease.  One is negative and is a form of anger madness and usually leads to violent acts.  The aspect of the disease I contracted instills an almost cellular instinctive compulsion, like a salmon returning to it's birthplace to spawn. The disease is called,\" Going Troppo\".  <br>\r\n     A friend of mine I had graduated from college with said he could get me on a boat sailing on an extended voyage through the South Seas with it's destination, Australia.  He said if it worked out I could remain aboard as crew indefinately.<br>\r\n     That was ten years ago. I can't remember missing a sunsplash in all these years.<br>\r\n     That was yesterday.  Today we hit a reef, not any reef but the largest living thing on the face of the Earth, The Great Barrier Reef.  We're not sinking but we are hard aground.  Our radio's down so we can't radio for help.  We've whittled it down to two choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)  It's 35 kilometers to the mainland.

Then all of a sudden I\u2019m immortal!  Let me start from the beginning\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a typical Friday. I just got off work and stopped by the Blue Moon to have a couple of drinks and watch the ladies, occasionally slipping them a few bills. Chantelle comes over to see me after her set, trying to convince me to come up to the VIP lounge for a private dance. And as usual I refuse, pleading financial inability. But this time she\u2019s more insistent, she says it\u2019s on the house. I say OK, figuring I got nothing to lose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI buy her a drink in the lounge she\u2019s all over me, teasing and pleasing, it\u2019s better than I could have ever imagined! Then all of a sudden she leans over and bites down hard into my neck and starts to suck my blood! It scares the hell out of me at first, but then I start to feel all warm and aroused, and I bite  into her neck too. And her blood tastes so good, so satisfying, it\u2019s way better than sex! She pushes me away and tells me me to stop. I beg her to let me drink more but she tells me If I don\u2019t leave now, she\u2019ll have Leroy walk me out, and I\u2019ll never see her again. I ask her what she did to me, and she says now I will live forever. As long as I come back and pay the hundred bucks admission to the VIP lounge to drink blood from her or one of the other girls... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might say a hundred dollars a day is a small price to pay for immortality. After all, it\u2019s less than some drug addicts spend just for an early death. But immortality isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be, especially if all you\u2019re thinking about every day is getting enough money for your next fix. My advice is, if any of you guys out there get a free invitation for a lap dance you better think twice, you might be getting a lot more than you bargained for.</span></div></div>",

Imagine making an important impression with your handwriting alone!  Where has this art form gone?  Well, the answer is quite obvious, given this day and age.  It seems no one cares about the handwritten word.. does anyone take the care to hand write anymore because still, there is a beauty to the handwritten note.  It's rare in and of itself it seems.  Even if the words are not uniform and they are barely readable, they are beautiful because they were applied by hand.  Every hand written note I receive which mostly arrive inside birthday cards, are framed and nailed to the wall.

A second, three cars behind, pulled in to the curb, its trunk perfectly placed to minimize the distance my stack of luggage would need to be carried.  The trunk popped open and a cheerful-looking man of around 30 with African genes and Jamaican-themed attire stepped out to help me with my bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you going, my friend?\" he asked. \"Airport?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please,\" I said. \"Domestic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure.  Hop in.\"  He grinned broadly as he hefted the second of my four suitcases into the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded a thank you, picked up my carry-on and opened the rear door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"  A woman's voice, from behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned.  She was forty-ish, her hair dirty blonde, dressed in a conservative blue skirt-suit. She was holding a monogrammed briefcase.  The initials read \"T.L.C.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in rather a hurry to get to the airport and the supply of cabs seems to have dried up,\" she waved her hand to the suddenly empty street.  \"Would you mind sharing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked from her to the cabbie, who just grinned and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not, please -\" I waved to the open rear door of the cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, so much,\" she said and climbed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I climbed in after her, the driver slammed the trunk shut with a heavy thunk and dashed back to the driver's seat to get us underway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Richard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Diane.

It's hard not to be dour when your life falls apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you headed Diane Taylor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home, to Chicago.  You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"California.  To start over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you expect to find there, that you can't find here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.

Just as it was starting to feel awkward, the cabbie turned up the radio so that the jaunty strains of Caribbean music filled the space between us.  The man knew his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we pulled into the airport gates, Diane turned to me again. \"Can I give you some free advice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" I shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't run away,\" she said. \"Stay and fix things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?  I've tried.  It all fell apart anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing at a time.  You have a list of things that you've failed at, but I'm guessing you failed at them all at once.  Your business was in trouble, so you got stressed, so your music and your relationships suffered, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kinda.\"  Not kinda.  She nailed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so don't try to fix it all at once.  Pick the one thing that's most important to you and fix that.  Then fix the next thing and the next thing, until you're not a failure any more.  You won't find it any easier in California.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cab pulled up in front of the terminal.  I reached for my wallet.  She put a hand on my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one's all mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got out of the cab and waited while she paid the cabbie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, Richard Barnes, and thanks again for sharing your cab,\" she said.  She strode off into the terminal.  I never saw her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's it to be, boss?\" asked the cabbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  She makes some kind of sense, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart lady, yah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?  I'm tryin' to decide that mah self.  I got mah own troubles.  Thinkin' she's maybe right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.  Alright, take me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sho' thing, brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe climbed back into the cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you play, brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you was a musician.  What you play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, guitar mostly.  Electric acoustic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now.  Ain't that a coincidence.

Two figures lurked around a fenced in dumpster. A large, burly black man dressed in overalls looked up instinctively, knowing I would be there. He stopped for a moment, resting his well worn gloved hands on the tip of his rake. In just one glance his kindly face, full of wisdom spoke a thousand words. His gentle smile resonated through me, assuring me that all was as it was supposed to be.  As I interpreted his gaze, I looked left to the second figure. A tiny, fragile blue eyed boy around the age of seven re-erected himself, hands full of strewn garbage. He too looked at me. His gaze wasn't as kind. It was perplexed. Full of regret and sorrow. He too spoke a thousand words, though not as easily interpreted.<br>\r\nI woke up!  This time to what was real. But it was always so real. Every time I dreamed of my son, it was always so real. I began to cry as I always did when I was torn away from him. I clenched my fists over my tear drenched eyes and screamed aloud. \"Noooo, please nooooo. Please let me fall back asleep. Please, please let me go back. I don't want to wake up.\" <br>\r\nBut God's grace comes to me in cherished slices. I clung to it with bittersweet thankfulness and tucked it inside my heart where all the rest of my cherished dreams lived.  \"I'm sorry Brandon. I'm so sorry son. I wish I could understand you. I wish I could hear your voice.  What are you trying to tell me? What did you want me to know? I love you, and I miss you so much. Until next time when I see you from my bedroom window.\" </span></div></div>",

The forest elves dance around me as the flames from the bonfire dance in their eyes. I can't believe this is how my life will end. By the hands of hundreds of forest elves, the most foul creatures on the planet. I watch a couple of elves nearest to the fire. They are grabbing fistfuls of earthworms and throwing them into a kettle on the fire. I can only imagine what else is in there. Five different elves run up to me and with sharp little blades, cut my arm. I watch my blood drip into their bowls. They gleefully run to the kettle pour my blood into it. the contents glow for a quick second and the elves fall to their knees. I shift to see more and my arm rubs against one of the blades. I guess one of the little vermin dropped it in their excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old elf dips a cup into the kettle and walks over to me. He stares at me malevolently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must drink the potion. You must <span class=\"clred\">dream a little dream</span>,\" he says in a high pitched voice. I struggle with the blade, slicing through the ropes as quickly as I can without drawing attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dream a little dream! Dream a little dream! Dream a little dream!\" the elves chant. A few of them grab my head and tilt it back. The older elf tips the cup over my face. I can see the worms in the liquid. With my free arm, I knock away the drink and plunge the blade into the old elf's neck. He screams as I rise up, knocking away the other elves. I cut away the rest of the ropes as the elves watch fearfully. I see a ladder ascending up the largest tree in the forest. I can climb it or I can run through the elves hoping that I can get away with hundreds of blades slicing my skin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was nothing more darker than perilous clouds above New York, threaded with caterwauls of angry wind on that fine, summer day. A little white blouse that I wore fluttered around my bony torso, putting my ribs on display to wicked strangers passing by me, or better yet through me. I couldn't tell if I was really <i>that</i> hollow or New York was a city full of selfishly obnoxious people who cared only about their own needs. The only <i>thing</i> that payed attention on me was shinny mirror of Tiffany's, showing me my own reflection and calling me to stop by and chat a little with nine carat jewelry in its shop window. You can't resist such thing if you are a woman, can you? Neither could I. Sparkling diamond ring caught my attention and my mind took me to the place in the future that I will never be part of. I saw myself in rich white dress, walking down the altar where he was standing with his lips slightly curved into satisfied smile. Like some kind of God, his body filled the black suit perfectly, accentuating firm muscles of his arms-- one more reason why I fell in love with him in the first place-- telling me how he can't wait to have me in his embrace. I bit my lip gently as his eyes threw a spark which stirred my heart and made my knees weak. They tottered a little when I stepped on the first stair but he reached out and kept me from falling. I heard sighs of the guests in the background but I knew I was safe in his arms. Nothing really bad could happen in this piece of heaven. Or could it? Sudden gush of wind made the angry announcement that the storm is building up few miles away, threading dark clouds above my head and he leaned on, placing a warm kiss on my lips, leaving metallic taste in my mouth. I licked my lower lip because it started to hurt and I felt thick liquid soaking my skin. His mouth were still slightly curved into satisfied smile, only this time it was more evil kind of a smile, the one you put on your face when you realize you did something bad but you felt good while doing it. I don't know if it was the first rain drop that fell on my forehead, slowly and dully killing my nerve for the balance, or his hands disappearing under my back and letting me lose support. Before I could even let the scream out, I was falling down into the black hole that opened under me. I stretched my arms, waving them through the air, hoping he will catch me, but he just stood on the edge with his wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, watch out!\" I felt someone hit me hard in my shoulder and I was back in front of Tiffany's shop window. Back to reality which wasn't too much different than the one I just came back from. I looked above and saw the same dark clouds and my white blouse fluttering in a way the wind wanted it. My reflection in Tiffany's window looked like I have been starving for months which wasn't far from the truth-- I did starve but for three weeks only, since he was gone to be precised. I know what you think now-- why would any woman want to starve herself after a man leave her? I'm asking my self the same question every morning though and I don't know the answer either. I just... starve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! Hello!\" A fine lady knocked from the inside the shop window. She then made hands movement as if she's trying to make me go away. <i>Am I really that hollow? Scary perhaps? It's just that these clouds won't leave me alone,</i> I argued with myself but she was persistent. She even made an angry face that looked like she's about to call security or someone and tell them to remove me away from the shop window because I might scare the customers. I was too tired for public drama so I just started to walk away by myself. I have no idea for how long I walked like that, I couldn't tell. I assume New York supposed to be asleep already but its lights were shining as bright as morning and the city was just about to become alive. Except me. The more it shined the more I was falling into darkness. I was wondering how long it will take until my light finally extinguish? And if anyone will ever notice that it's been missing in this city of eternal mornings and obnoxious citizens?</span></div></div>",

I didn't expect of her to be polite and gentle. I mean, who would? I came to this place to commit a murder, there was no any reasonable excuse to treat me better than I deserved. The window of the room was half opened and I've heard birds singing. The summer was in its fullness and you could see beauty of life everywhere. Well, everywhere except at this place. Strange, only one wall separated me from the smell of mown grass but it was built so high and I couldn't overjump. Instead of it I had to satisfy myself with thought that bleach smells much better. I took the hospital gown in my hands and I sat on the chair. Thousands of thoughts run through my head in that moment. I felt like I'm on threshold of the execution, waiting for my last minutes of life. Can someone bring me tuna sandwich, please? No one heard me. I guess they don't fulfill penitent's last wishes. How cruel, I thought. <br>\r\nI unzipped my floral dress and I put it on the hanger. I briefly run my hands over my, already visible, pregnant stomach before I put the hospital gown on. There wasn't a mirror in this ugly room and I couldn't see how I look like. It was better like this-- emotionless faces, sterile smells and empty rooms-- a place where sane person wouldn't step in if she didn't have reason good enough to not feel guilty. The hospital gown was too big and I thought that it's comfortable. I'm sure I didn't look like one of the Victoria's Secret models though. I looked back through the window one more time to see if I can find a good reason to save this life. I couldn't hear birds singing and sterile smell became stronger, reminding me that I belong to the other side of the wall where there was no excuse for living. I put my hands on the stomach for the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm sorry thing. I wish that everything is different now. We'll be together one day I promise. I hope you will forgive me.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could anyone forgive me the fact that he will be dump in some plastic bag in the garbage behind this institution? I opened the door and called for nurse. She came as fast as she could.<br>\r\n\"Doctor is ready for you now,\" she said as she led me to the operation room. The room seemed equipped with all gadgetry necessary for this type of operation. There was a table in the middle of the room where I was suppose to lay down. The light inside was too bright for my eyes. I found it abrasive, enough maybe to bring up a migraine. My eyes fell on the empty flowerpot on the table in the corner. I didn't need to see that to realize how death is the only thing that dominated here. <br>\r\n\"Lay down here, I need to prepare you for the operation.\" Nurse pointed to me table in the middle of the room. I took off hospital shoes and I laid on my back. Fluorescent light forced me to close my eyes. I heard male'a voice came inside and assumed that was the doctor. I was afraid and ashamed at the same time to open my eyes and face him. I didn't know who was the ugliest monster in this room- him or me. I peeked a little bit while two of them were talking about anesthesia dosing. A tall man in his forties with dark and slicked hair supposed to be a monster that will kill me. He was too handsome to be a monster I thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna give you general anesthesia now because that's what you asked for.\" He approached to the table where I laid. His hands were cold when he touched mine. I opened my eyes and saw the nurse and him staring at me. I knew they are not going to ask me any questions anymore. Deep in my mind I was begging for one more chance, for one more question to make sure if this is really what I want. I opened my mouth to say something but words didn't want to come out. I tried harder and harder but no one couldn't hear me. My screams were trapped inside and the fluorescent lights got blur. Just a few seconds later I saw nothing and screams drowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up at some point laying on my stomach. As soon as I opened my eyes I saw the nurse sitting behind the table in front of me. She looked too busy to notice that I was awake. I felt so numb and I couldn't move anything except my eyes. I opened and closed them over and over again. As the moments were passing by I successfully moved my right arm and I turned my head to the wall. Nurse approached to me and she asked if I was alright. Her voice reverberated in my head and I couldn't get used my eyes to fluorescent light again. It looked like real nightmare when my stomach started to growl giving me some feeling of vomiting. At the same time I felt so weak for any movement so I put all my effort to finally ask for glass of water. She brought one quickly, helping me to stand up in sitting position. My head frown as my eyes were closing and I was ready to sleep again. I don't remember how hard she slapped my face then but I didn't feel any pain when she did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, you have to wake up now, you cannot stay here forever!\"<br>\r\n\"I think I need to go to bathroom please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't remember how I came to bathroom or if she helped me then because I was half sleeping. I only know that I was sitting on the toilet and vomiting, asking myself where the hell am I and what happened to me. I looked at my hospital grown to see if it got dirty and I saw that it was totally opened from the back and I was naked. I felt ashamed of the fact that I was walking around this room like that but soon realized that it was probably just normal thing. It looked like flashback when I saw the table I laid on and I remembered why I came to this place. <br>\r\n\"Here is some more water and you have to sit in that chair. You cannot go back and lay down again because you need to wake up, you can't stay here.\" Nurse repeated but somehow her words were more clear to me now. She brought me my floral dress and she said that I can wear it now. I was sitting in the chair, listening her speech about medications she'll give me and their prescriptions. She knew she had to write these down because I was still almost unconscious. My stomach hurt so bad and that was the first time in my life that I felt empty. That feeling never disappeared. I hugged myself when I realized what have I done and I swallowed hard when she gave me medicines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're alright?\" Finally she started with the questions again but they came too late. This time I didn't want to answer. I took the medicines and thanked her. Nothing really to be thankful for but I tried to keep my good manners. Her face wasn't emotionless anymore, she looked like she feel for another woman. Maybe I was wrong or anesthetics had weird effect on me.<br>\r\n\"I thought you'll never come out,\" Elizabeth's face was frightened. She run to hug me. <br>\r\n\"My stomach hurts a little bit Elizabeth..\" I tried to stay away from her hug when I needed it the most. Her eyes filled with tears for someone who she knew two months only. I didn't pour not even one tear. Monster did his job very well, I didn't feel anything except emptiness. You can't cry when you're empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here, it's late already.\" She took my hand and we left the waiting room. Smell of the mown grass tickled my senses and I heard bird's song again. I finally found the way to jump over the wall that separated two different worlds. I really hoped that I was on the right side this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aha, wafters, one on either side of the ice cream slice so that it was like a sandwich. Calling them ice cream sandwiches would have people thinking of ice cream between bread which sounds messy unless of course you toasted the bread!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know if ice cream slices still exist or if the ice cream company still exists because when I last had one it was in a country far away and a long time ago but I would like to think they are still being produced thus I can imagine buying the ice cream slice, removing it from its paper, one side first, add one wafer, turn it over remove the rest of the paper and add the other wafer. The wafer and slice of ice cream were delicious together whereas with ordinary ice cream in a cone not much of the cone and ice cream are eaten together unless you push the ice cream as it softens down into the cone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh cherished days of cherished slices, Ice Cream Slices.

As a man got up, slapping his alarm clock to make it end that unbearable noise it always makes, he looks outside the window. What a dreary day.

At one time, the gates may have been just as nice, but alas, that is not so much the case anymore. Time takes a toll on everything - as the man knows more than anyone. Before he pushes it open, a man comes up. \"Listen, you're always going up here to take care of the place, but why not sell it and buy a better place for yourself instead of stretching out your inheritance from him? Maybe a job could ease your mind.\" The man looks at the concerned stranger, but just shakes his head no. He couldn't bear to see it fall into anyone else's hands, be tainted by their presence. He moves on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Walking up the long path to the abandoned mansion, a few dog houses, barely visible due to the snow, lay in a neat little row.

You've done it before, but this time - this letter has stirred up a hornet's nest in my mind and the stinging little bits refuse to settle. I sure hope you wrote this for me because if you didn't you're going to have some explaining to do. Wait - you're coming up the driveway! Do I really want to get into it today?

You'd know I got all worked up while you were gone, was bursting to find out the truth behind those words and... I can't ignore that little bit of letter you left out for me. It has to be for me. You love me. You married me. Shouldn't I relax a little and let you do what you do without butting in? But is that bit of text scrawled on that piece of paper a cry for help?

I could barely see through the relentless drops. As I turned a corner, I bashed into someone coming the other way. \"Oh, sorry!\" I yelled over the sounds of pounding rain and rumbling thunder. <br>\r\n\"That's ok!\" a man's voice shouted back, \"Are you alright?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm fine! Thanks! Are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Fine! Well, nice meeting you!\" he laughed.<br>\r\n\"You too!\" I laughed too. This was ridiculous. As I turned to continue on my way, the man shouted after me, \"Hey, I never got your name!\"<br>\r\n\"Anna!\"<br>\r\n\"Carl! Hey, Anna, why don't we duck into this coffee shop and wait out the rain together?\"<br>\r\nI hesitated. He was a complete stranger. I hadn't even been able to really see his face. Oh, what the heck?<br>\r\n\"That's fine with me!\" We rushed down to the coffee shop door where he held it open as I ducked inside. Oh, it was warm and smelled deliciously of coffee and pastry.<br>\r\n\"Do you have any towels for two soaked travelers?\" Carl hollered to the bored-looking barista.<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" the kid grunted and tossed a few small bar towels to us. After we had dried off a little, Carl and I ordered drinks and seated ourselves in a cozy nook near the fire. Through the window we could see the water still beating the sidewalk with a passion. I sipped my steaming coffee contentedly as I studied Carl. \"What a strange way to meet a man,\" I thought. He was tall, a little chubby and baby-faced, but still pretty cute. He had thick, wavy blond hair and deep, blue eyes. No movie star material, but not too bad for a stranger on the street.<br>\r\n\"So,\" he began, \"Other than your name and your tendency to bump into strangers while walking, I don't know much about you. Let's start with the basics. Where did you grow up?\"<br>\r\nI laughed and began to tell him about myself. As we talked, I felt myself warming up to this charming stranger. He was witty and funny and, I soon found out, loved children and was very kind. He was a pediatrician at the local hospital and lived alone with his Siamese cat in a little apartment downtown. Before I realized how much time had passed, Carl looked out the window and announced that the rain had stopped.<br>\r\n\"Well, my lady, may I escort you home now that the sun has been allowed to shine once again?\"<br>\r\n\"I would love that.\"<br>\r\nA few minutes later, we reached my apartment and stood in front of it rather awkwardly. I waited for him to say something.<br>\r\n\"Well, Anna, this has truly been a delightful, albeit wet, afternoon. We should do it again sometime. Perhaps excluding the part where we get soaked,\" he grinned.  <br>\r\n\"I agree,\" I giggled and handed him my number.<br>\r\n\"And that's my cue to leave you, my lady. It's been a pleasure.\" He bowed and danced away whistling \"I'm Singing in the Rain\".<br>\r\nI sighed and wondered if I'd ever have such a lovely rainy day again.</span></div></div>",

My old Ford needed a tune-up, but I was confident I could make the 250 mile trip safely. I needed solitude in order to write an article on Mediteranean cuisine that I had over-optimistically promised would be completed by the beginning of the next week. My father's cabin met my needs. High up in the Appalachians in West Virginia, remote and without cell phone coverage, peace and quiet. My first mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree miles from the cabin the deluge descended, a horrifying storm, wind howling, blinding rain. Suddenly a car came around a corner and I panicked. Mistake number two. My old Ford slid off the road and lodged against a tree. Miraculously unhurt, I scrambled out of the car and squinted through the torrent. The other car was gone. My car was mired, and I knew there was no hope of regaining the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this remote area I despaired of another car coming. I decided to trudge on to the cabin. Mistake number three. My clothes were soaked within the first hundred yards. My luggage weighed me down, and then the rain turned to sleet and snow. For the first time in my life I feared I might die in this wilderness. Push on, don't give up. Keep going I exhorted my exhausted body. Twice I fell, and the second time I dropped my suitcase. Clinging to my laptop in its waterproof bag, I saw the cabin up ahead. I cried out in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I saw the motorcycles outside the cabin.</span></div></div>",

He opened it, noting it appeared to be dry. He looked at the other men. If Janine had Internet access, they had a problem. Arnie needed at least a day before he could finish his part of the project.

I knew that, at least I thought so. That's why I had hidden the candy in the back of my dressing closet, away from hungry hands. How anyone found it, puzzled me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After mulling the idea that whoever stole my candy needed it more than me and ridiculing the idea in my head, I headed out in search for the culprit. Today I was feeling territorial.  I had a few suspects in mind. First i excluded all the girls, because my closet was in the boys' bathroom and girls were strictly chastised for entering. Then I excluded all the boys I had some kind of friendship with. That left no more than 4 boys. All these fell under the 'naughty' category. I excluded one from the group under the fact that if he was the culprit, I couldn't do anything about it because he was twice as big as me. This meaning he could easily beat me to a pulp. That left 3 boys and I decided to play a little game of trap the mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen our caretakers shouted it was time to turn in for the night and we all went to change into our pajamas, I made an exuberant motion of stashing something behind my clothes. I made sure to be the last out of the bathroom, watching the 3 suspects closely. They all saw my act but pretended they didnt. I caught on quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as lights went off in the orphanage I sneaked out into the bathroom and hid in a closet adjacent to mine. There was a perfect peephole and I waited patiently. No more than 5 minutes passed before my candy thief opened my closet and dug behind my clothes. Arte finding nothing I looked around the room and left with a curse. I saw his face clearly. My mission accomplished I headed to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day I confronted the boy and demanded he tell me I did it. The more he refused, the angrier I got. Why would he steal my candy from my dresser? Did he not know that candy was a piece of happiness in a place like an orphanage? Finally my anger boiled and we entangled into a fistfight. I punched and I cried and I yelled all my frustration at this boy, blaming him for the place I was caged in. It took 3 caretakers to separate us and by then I was throwing a tantrum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, only I got punished and was sent to my room for the rest of the day. I spent it crying at the unfairness of it all. The orphanage took me away from my family, took me away from living a free life. They took my wings and clipped them, and as if that wasn't enough, they built a caged and trapped me in there. A parakeet in a cage full of eagles. The orphanage was supposed to be a doorway into a better world and I had waited 3 years to enter it. I was beginning to lose hope. All I wanted in life was to matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost bedtime and I had refused to eat dinner, punishing myself for something that really wasn't my fault, when one of the caretakers entered my room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have good news,\" she said. I replied, \"Go away.\" But she stared at me with a perplexed expression and informed me I was adopted before she left. I was left alone to piece myself together until the new finally sunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was adopted. I was going to get out of this prison. No more candy thiefs, no more cages, and no more eagles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good news indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I remember how we talked about what we'd want done if one of us were to get killed on the trail. I wanted to be buried beneath the tallest tree you could find, so you could tell my momma where I was in case she wanted to come find my grave. And you wanted to be cremated so your spirit could soar up in the clouds and find the soul of your Cherokee wife that got killed by them raiders. Looks like you got out of the digging. I better go get some more wood, make sure it's a hot enough fire to get the job done right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl watches Lester burn, adding more wood as the night goes on.

Once Joel knew he was on the right path he started to run. He saw there was only one set of tracks, this was encouraging. Maybe his dad had managed to kill the other Ranger before he was killed?  At any rate Joel would only be facing one man, so his odds were better than he originally thought. But as the afternoon wore on and he began to tire, he figured he would not be likely to catch up with the man before dark, no matter how hard he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting hungry too, so Joel decided to make camp and find some supper. He spotted a squirrel eating seeds from a pine cone near the base of a tree. He slowly pulled a throwing knife from the sheath attached to his belt and with a quick flick of the wrist sent it flying. It pegged the rodent square in the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel was still alive when Joel approached. he pulled the knife from it and used it to quickly slit its throat to put it out of its misery. \"Sorry buddy, but I gotta eat,\" he said as he did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later Joel had a fire going, and the skinned animal roasting on a stick.

I think we should check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaylin, you know I ain't never been much into listening to no preachers. I believe in the Creator and  in honoring him by living my life the best I can, but I just can't see myself hanging around with a bunch of holy rollers in some old school building. You never were much of a church goer either, from what I can recollect. So why are you so interested in this now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the thing, Lance. In his religion a man is allowed to have more than one wife, hell, it's even expected of him! So all we gotta do is go down there and agree to join the church and then he can marry us. We don't have to hang around after that if we don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Kay, I'm not so sure Susan would approve of me having a second wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says in one of these pamphlets that the man is supposed to be the head of his household, and his wives are obedient to him. Susan couldn't really argue with your decision to take a second wife if it was part of your new religion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not so sure about this idea, Kay, I gotta think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting kinda late, Lance. why don't we just go to bed.

You want me to get this arrow out of your throat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel steps on his head and pulls the arrow from his neck as he moans in pain and loses consciousness. \"Sorry, Hiram, looks like I accidentally cut your jugular vein with the arrow.

It had become a bit of a craze with all of us and we were forever arguing about who's was best. What you had to do first was spot a suitable branch, it had to have a nice thick stem and two forks growing in equal thickness to each other but slightly thinner than the shaft, quite simply we looked for a nicely symmetrical  letter Y.  Once the desired candidate had been selected we climbed the tree and hacked the entire limb off using an old axe that Cliff  had relieved from his father a few weeks before and that we kept hidden in a plastic bag that went in a hole in the ground, all very clandestine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe would then drag the branch from the woods to  Steve's garage, his father was a great bloke and his garage was chock-a -block with wood working tools and he was always in either the garage or the garden because he was building a boat in his spare time, (I'm going to talk about the boat later, I bet you can't wait) and he would gladly help us to saw the branch to the right size. I was always a bit jealous of the relationship Steve had with his father. He was an only child and was clearly doted on. He loved showing the three of us how to do stuff and it was he who had shown us how to make the catapults, not the chopping down of tree's bit you understand, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was cut to size and stripped of bark we would chuck them on one of the bonfires for a few minutes to dry them out and then we would buy a yard of quarter inch cat elastic from Gentries the sports shop and cut notches in the top of the two forks, cut the elastic in half then force one end of each piece of the elastic into the notched ends then bind them together with a wire that we had stolen from an electrical shop in Bexleyheath. The other ends of the elastic were then attached to a square of leather using more wire. When Steve's dad had made the first one he had bought a piece of leather especially for the job. Cliff and me didn't have such luxuries, no we just cut the tongues out of our shoes, they were perfect for the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we're back in the woods and we had come across this tree that was about 30 feet tall but very thin, it had loads of spindly branches on it , nothing suitable for us, but Cliff had decided to try and climb it, he had only got about half way when the tree started to bow, he was only about seven stone wet but even his weight was to much for the puny tree, suddenly it bowed right over and brought Cliff back to within a couple of feet of the ground, when he let go he more or less just stepped off, but the tree whipped back upright a lightening speed. If anyone had been in it's way they would most certainly of been killed, but I think all of us had the exact same thought at the exact same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n We immediately set to work, the mission was to strip the whole tree of all it's branches, this took us hours, I still to this day can't believe that we were so dedicated to one tiny bit of mischief. We took it in turns to shimmy up the tree hacking off all the limbs as we went. We had to return to finish the job the next day because it had got to dark to continue and it was a bit scary in those woods after dark. <br>\r\nSo it was Sunday afternoon when finally the last branch had been removed and the top ten feet cut off, so basically what we were left with was a 20 foot pole, have you worked out where I'm going with this yet, no? Then I'll continue. We were almost ready we went back into the street and collected half a dozen milk bottles off some random doorsteps and a sledge hammer from Cliff's and a massive steel spike that was about three feet long and had stood against the wall in my garage,  it had been there for so long that no one knew how it got there or what it was originally for. But finally we had found a use for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later and we rendezvoused  back at the pole. We hammered the spike into the soft ground with the sledge hammer, that was the hardest part of all Cliff had insisted on doing this because the hammer was his, but the trouble was the bloody hammer was almost as big as him and he could hardly swing it and when he did manage to lift it above his head the weight of it dragged him over, but eventually between us we got it hammered in so that there was about six inches sticking out of the ground. Next I climbed the pole until it bent over enough for the other two to grab it, then with all three of us hanging onto the end we secured it with a length of rope to the spike in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat! It was finally ready. We stuck one of the milk bottles onto the end of the pole and stood back to admire our weekends work. I think that if it hadn't taken so long to get to this point we might have had second thoughts about doing this, but we had come to far to turn back now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUsing the axe I chopped through the rope, it went in one because it was under so much strain already I suppose.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nI think that we all thought that the bottle would probably fly straight up into the air and we would get loads of fun doing this over and over again. What actually happened was that the milk bottle got launched up into the stratosphere, we didn't even see it leave the end of the tree, It couldn't possibly have stayed within the woods. We didn't see it leave and it wouldn't of been possible to see it land because it must have flow across Iron Mill Lane over the school on the other side of the road and carried on into town<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course we did what we always did when we came face to face with our own stupidity, we ran.<br>\r\nWe legged it out of the woods and went home. We stayed out of those woods for at least a couple of weeks, and when we did venture back in all our handy work had been removed. The old boy must  have come across it and he had cut down the stripped tree and pulled up the spike. I think we were secretly pleased, all the evidence was gone and there had been no reports on the news about anyone being killed by a mysterious flying milk bottle, so we had got away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later, when Cliff and I would be in the pub our REMINICENCES always included that story, and the more he drank the further that bottle went.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I ask myself in resignation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut really, I already know the answer to that question. It started going wrong shortly after we married.  The day I woke up to discover that no matter how much I loved you it wasn't enough. The chase, the capture, the infatuation was all gone now. Married with no challenge left except to survive each and every day without the thrill of the pursuit. Those letters, penned during our courtship, were mute testimony to what was now lost. No longer did my stomach tingle when I thought of seeing you. No longer did my pulse race and my body ache for the need of you. Long hours spent writing of my love, my need, my absolute adoration of you -- all done now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I stood up. I can hear you weeping softly behind the door.

But it has been a while since I had to look for a job, and I'd heard it was now common for interviewers to ask questions unrelated to job skills to \"get a feel for your character\". And the clumsy construction of the question could be explained by the fact that my interviewer's native language was Chinese, as was true of many new business owners these days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica, once at the top of the heap, was slowly sliding into third world status. Our failing education system, along with high unemployment and unaffordable healthcare, had been driving the middle class down to poverty levels for some time now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese saw this, and being good businessmen, started building factories here to exploit the new cheap American labor. How the tides had turned from when I was young. Kids graduating high school with basic skills barely above what used to be expected in grammar school were now more than happy to take a low paying job with no benefits at the local plastic factory. Me, at my age, I was competing against them for one of those jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I was set, put in thirty years at a major aerospace company before I retired. Then, five years later, my pension disappeared and the company declared bankruptcy, a victim of the \"2012 Credit Crisis\" and subsequent stock market crash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me how you are going to your destiny?\" he asks me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I better answer the man if I want a chance at getting this job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I am going calmly, quietly, and respectfully to my destiny,\" I reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, I have confidence you will be a good worker.

I wasn't too concerned, at least the Dead were peaceful, not like the bloodthirsty brain-eating monsters in the movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dead didn't cause any trouble. They mostly just sat around on benches in neighborhood parks, conversing with each other in low whispers.<br>\r\n Police stopped enforcing loitering laws against them when they realized the Dead didn't care if you put them in jail. They had infinite patience, they would just sit there until you released them. In the meantime your jail would absorb the odors of decay, and the other inmates would soon be contacting their lawyers and the ACLU, filing lawsuits against the city for inhumane treatment or cruel and unusual punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen asked, the Dead allowed themselves to be examined extensively by the doctors of the CDC. They could not determine a physical cause for the condition, or a reason these people were still ambulatory or able to think and carry on conversation, they had no pulse, they did not breathe, and had no need of food or drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat men of science and religious philosophers questioned them, asking why they thought this had happened to them. Was Man evolving beyond death? Was this part of God's plan? The answers they got  were noncommittal, disinterested. \"The Dead do not concern themselves with such things,\" was a typical response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't understand, this was such an amazing new development, unprecedented in history! How could they be so apathetic about their condition?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen this morning I woke up dead, I imagine it was a heart attack in my sleep.

But when they do they like to be discreet, dressing as ordinary citizens, wearing dark glasses to hide their large eyes, et cetera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who can blame them? I'm sure most commoners would react badly if they knew extraterrestrials were among them. But do go on George, sorry to interrupt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, well as it were I was at a collectors convention, and I had heard through the grapevine that aliens might be about. It turns out many of them are quite avid collectors, especially of American historical artifacts, one of my specialties. And they are known to carry amazing technological items with them for trade purposes. So I kept my eyes open and I spotted one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you tell, George?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was wearing loose fitting clothing to disguise his oversized limbs, and the grey complexion showing though the flesh tone makeup was a dead giveaway. So I approached him and struck up a conversation, we started trading, and that was that. <br>\r\nAlthough it really hurt to part with that astrolabe, I do believe I got the better part of the deal.

Emily and Sarah wanted to go home, but I wasn't ready to leave. Oh, they left without me. I should have gone with them,\" she says. \"Oh well, nothing I can do about it now. I just have to remember what happened next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill looking out over the world below, her pen moves across her sketchpad almost automatically, as it always seems to when she's in deep thought. After a moment, it hits her. When the party was over at Jingles, she decided to try the bar down the street in hopes of making a good time better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few doors down from Jingles was the Local Pub. As Daria entered the building, she looked around, recognizing no one. \"Oh well. Strangers are only people you haven't met yet,\" she thought as she sat down at the bar. Lost in the rhythmic groove of drums and bass, Daria did not care that she was alone for the moment. As she sat perched atop the bar stool, she closed her eyes and threw back her head. In her mind, she was up on the dance floor with her hands in the air, swaying back and forth to the sweet sounds filling her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goodness. I have to move,\" she thought. \"Bartender, don't throw my drink away. I'll be right back,\" she says as she tries to take to her feet. Slowly, she made her way to the restroom. Once inside, she placed a hand on either side of the sink. After standing there for a few moments, she threw water on her face and then blotted it dry with a towel. That's when Daria decided to go back to the bar to finish her drink before heading home for the night, but that's also when her mind's light goes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sits, unable to conjure up any more memories, she reaches over for the tv remote. As Daria turns on the tv, she hears,\"This morning a local man was found murdered in a nearby hotel room. Bob Connelly was found with his neck torn open and he apparently bled to death on the bed. He was last seen leaving The Local Pub with an unidentified female\". <br>\r\n\"What?\" Daria screams as she jumps from her chair; her sketchpad flying out of her lap. \"Wow,\" she says, leaning down to pick up the sketchpad. As her eyes fall upon the paper, she sees the words, 'BOB... Back to life.\" </span></div></div>",

As much as he wanted to change his life style it seemed impossible.  He was a prisoner of his decisions.  Slowly walking toward McDonalds he based at the sun rising over the mountains and wondered where he could get help.  There was no medical insurance he could afford.  He had enough money to not qualify for assistance and as far as he knew there were no other options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sipped his coffee enjoying the fine and wonderful aroma and glorious taste, a stranger took the stool next to him.  Long hair hanging over the shoulders and a baseball cap caught his attention because this was exactly what a life long friend used to wear.  Surprisingly this person looked almost exactly like his friend.  He blinked and shook his head slightly in amazement and then for no apparent reason extended his hand in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they clasp hands and nodded Harry felt a strange sensation.  Wonderment showed on his face and the stranger smiled.  <br>\r\n\"I know, it happens all the time.  I must have extra energy which ofttimes needs an outlet. Sorry to surprise you like that.  I'm Joe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHi, Joe.  Harry didn't know what to think and wasn't certain if he wanted to be this close to the stranger.<br>\r\n\"I'm Harry.  And, please keep your distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Harry, can we talk?  I promise not to touch you, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"stay away from me!\"  Harry rounded his shoulders and leaned away from Joe as he started to get off the stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammon, Harry, I promise not to touch you, please don't go.  We need to talk, absolutely need to talk.  How's your stomach?  Joe waited for harry to sit again but Harry just stood there with his mouth open in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd,..geese, how'd you know...OHHH...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry went pale and started to shake.  The room started spinning and Harry sat quickly to make certain he didn't land face down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Harry, try this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly he took a sip of the beverage Joe was offering.  Within seconds he feltt a little better.  Then a few minutes later it was as if nothing had happened.  Starring at Joe he pushed the remainder of his coffee far away and sat like a statue.  How could this be?  For years he had trouble with his stomach but now suddenly he was healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later Harry understood everything.  He realized his choices made all the difference in how things would work out for him each day.  This stranger soon became a close friend.

Her foster parents Clara and John Smythe had told her about the new arrival, a girl ten years old, like herself.  As she stared out the window, waiting for the car to arrive, she day dreamed about playing barbies with her new friend, her only friend actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn school, Sarah did not fit in, no matter how much she tried. No matter how many foster homes she went to, or however many times she changed schools, she felt like the outcast. Children were often mean, picking on her for her gap between her two front teeth and larger than normal ears.  It didn't help that she was scrawny, pale, and half a foot taller than most of her classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in excitement as a black sadan arrived in the driveway.  She grabbed the gift she had wrapped for the new arrival, her favorite mermaid barbie. She strategically chose her because of her red hair, which Clara had told her the new girl had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was halfway down the stairs when the doorbell rang. Clara looked up at her and smiled, before opening the door. She greeted the heavy set older woman at the door. \"Come in Mrs. Tedesco.\" She bent down. \"And, welcome home Samantha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was peeking behind Clara. \" Oh, and this is Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stared at the freckle faced redhead and wondered if she was teased as much as her. She handed her the present. \"I got you a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said looking towards the ground, but she was smiling at the new gift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went into the living room.  Samantha was still holding the unwrapped present. Mrs. Tedesco nudged her. \"Sweetie, open your gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha ripped the paper off, revealing the used mermaid barbie. \"Pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma Clara told me you had pretty red hair. That's why I chose her. Sorry that her eyes are green instead of blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alrght, green is my favorite color.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls why don't you get to know each other while Mrs. Tedesco and I talk. Sarah, show her the room you will be sharing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah perked up with pride. \"Come on, you'll love it. I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dragged the new foster girl up the stares, smiling in excitement. One they were in the room, Samantha slammed the door behind them. Her shyness transformed to a scary assertiveness. \"Let's set some ground rules. I'm the boss. You do what I tell you, no matter what or this will be you.\" She ripped the head off of the mermaid, and shoved violently into Sarah's chest. \"And, keep your nappy headed doll. I don't want your used shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes pooled with tears. \"I-I hoped we could be friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we'll be real good friends if you don't piss me off.\" She burst into laughter. \"Now stop being a cry baby and smile. You wouldn't  want to get me in trouble, now would you.\" She pointed at the headless barbie in warning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tried to wear her best smile, even though her lips were quivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 512<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Standing at the side of your grave, thinking savage thoughts, I wonder how you can stand to be where none but I can heed you. Like an invisible poison, dripping slowly through my veins, you lurk inside my core, waiting for when we are alone. Don't think I don't know your game. All those years spent standing in your shadow; you'd think I could recognise your intentions by now, yes? Don't blame me for your demise, either. I was not the one who drove the steel support home, to rest snugly in your corrupt heart. Not I. Nor was I the one who laid you to rest here, amoung the willows in a grave too shallow for the likes of you. So don't go and pretend; we all saw through you a lifetime ago. Anyway, I would have buried you somewhere far away, in a desolate valley where no one goes. It would have been a deep grave too, with no headstone and a tainted soil warning posted nearby. So consider yourself lucky. Within, I feel you beginning to stir, and I know you'll see these thoughts and feel vindicated; avenged. And not without reason I suppose; I DID provide the alibi for your killer, so he could live out his life without being hounded by the police as well as you. Not long to go now, love; the night is nearer than you think. It'll all be over soon, and then we can fight this battle anew, in a higher realm. The birds begin their chatter, settling down for the evening, and I realise I want to too. But where we're going, you and I, we don't need rest or peace. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, they say, and true enough I'll give them something to think about, when we get there. Don't you worry. Its going to be finished. The lump in my heart begins to swell unbearably as I recall those I'll leave behind. What will they think? But now is not the time for reasoning or thoughts. Standing at your graveside, breathing in the cold air I'll not be feeling again, I think it's time to bury this burden. Shaky hands reach into my vest pockets, searching for what could have been some sort of solace. My rough, callused fingers pop out the pills one by one, and when I have a handful, stop. I take a long swig of the vile gin you used to drink, wondering how you could stand the stuff, spluttering as my throat is burnt by the strong liquid. Coughing hasrhly, I raise my hand to my mouth and swallow.</span></div></div>",

Looking down, there was a tiny horned man, no taller than five inches. \" Hey, Jackass, you can't kill yourself with asprin.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kicked at the annoying creature, causing him to fly a few feet away. \"It wasn't asprin. I told you not to bother me anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaffected , the little man jumped backup and crawlwled up my leg from the inside of my pant leg.  I swatted at him as the oddly rodent like feeling crawled up my flesh, but my attempts were met with laughter.  So, i removed my pants, in hopes of ridding himself of the little monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tossing the pants on the ground, the little guy walked out of the wasteband, arms crossed, holding his gut in an explosion of laughter. \"Oh, you are funny! You know you can't get rid of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're  not real!\"  I closed my eyes wishing the annoyance away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very real.\"  To prove it, the little shit jumped up from the ground as if some sort of magical acrobat, landing  with his teeth clenched  on the tender web of skin between my thumb and pointer finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, instinctively, I banged my hand into the nearby tree, sacrificing damaging my hand, to loosen his razor grip. He let loose, falling to the ground. Yet, again, he sprang up, unharmed. He stuck his tongue out, blowing a rasberry, before hiding in the overgrown grass. \"Let's play hide and seek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObliging, I began stomping at the ground, my heavy foot banging against the ground everywhere I heard laughter.  The little bastard  was fast. In exhaustion, I gave up, refusing to play his game anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give up. Why don't you just kill me? That's what I came here for anyways. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you're  not finished yet. You promised!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made no promises!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, to be fare, your brother made the promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not my brother. Besides, those pills should take effect any moment now. Then I'll be relieved of you and this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was more laughter. \" You sure are funny for a self-loathing poet. If it is a headache that you plan to be relieved from, then those asperine should do the trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEY WERE NOT ASPERINE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, yes they were. I watched your brother trade them out. Or you, same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by the same thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a brother. He is just another part of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy nose flared in anger. The little shit was playing with my head now. \"Stop telling lies, demon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a sarcastic exhale. \"Cope however you wish, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cope with what? Choosing to protect my jealous brother over allowing justice to be served in the murder of the love of my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon rolled his eyes. \"You,, umm, sorry, your brother was just fulfilling his promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man clenched his fist, looked down, and shook his head. \"Why did you send me up here to deal with this mentally unstable moron?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT a moron! I will have know that I have published several books of poetry and novels. In a review of my last novel, the New York Tmes proclaimed me a literary genious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice carried a sarcastic tone as if taunting me. \"Oh, dear, and do you actually remember writing anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing honest with myself, I didn't remember writing anything.  Typically it was as if I went into a trance, waking up with the finished works. \"Now that  you mention it, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe docked his eyebrows. \"You see, you are just some moron that traded his soul for fame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never do that! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was fun at first, but now you're  ticking me off. I wanna speak to your brother now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my dismay, the demon crowded under my feet, causing me to trip and hit my head on the gravestone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 665<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was mesmerized.  Suddenly, I awoke in my room.  I could still taste the saltiness in the air and feel the breeze harsh on my skin.  Jumping out of bed I ran to my window shoving aside the curtains and searching the shoreline.  Somehow my heart knew you were there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember at the track meet in Baton Rouge?  I was lingering in the girls locker room trying my hardest to psych myself up.  I so desperately wanted to break the long jump record and I knew I had more than a whisper of a chance.  Already, in my private practice I had broken it twice.  Today, it would count.  As I left to join the others on the field I was suddenly grabbed from behind and pushed into the first bathroom stall, hard, falling backwards on the toilet seat.  The breath had been knocked out of me and my right arm hurt horribly.  I looked up into a masked face and seeing a bat raised over the head of my attacker I opened my mouth to scream when suddenly, I was back in time sitting on the same bench psyching myself up.  The difference was, I remembered what had just happened.  Running all over the locker room I tried to find a sign, any sign that what I thought had just happened, had.  My arm didn't even hurt.

You would swear it was impossible for a fly to fly his(or her) way there.  Up your nose, behind your sunglasses, behind your clothes (meaning underneath), pant legs and open shirt, all body parts are accessible to an Australian fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It would be commercial suicide to inform a tourist industry that those wonderfully unique Australian hats with<br>\r\nall those corks on a string bouncing and vibrating in a 360 degree circle around the hat were to distract (only briefly) the continual and relentless bombardment of the Australian flies vehement focus on making mankind miserable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Here is how you do it.  Everywhere a fly starts to land move your arms and hands to not let him (or her) land on your body.  You get better with practice.  No worries.  You'll be a pro doing the Aussie Salute overnight.

'Seize the day,\" as they say, rather than just muddling through and doing what you have to do to get by. After all, life is pretty short; it's better to experience it than watch it on your iPad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Get up early and stop at the local donut shop and pick up a dozen to bring in to share with your coworkers. Even if (especially if) no one else ever does this. And don't expect anything in return for once, just do it to be nice. <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Go through your closet/attic/garage and gather all those things you no longer need or no longer fit you and give them to a local charity. You don't really need all that stuff anyway, and it would be a big help to others in need in these hard times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) \"Cowboy up\" and do something you have been considering for a while but weren't sure you had the guts to do. Join your local community theater group and try out for that part in the next production you've been thinking of; Sign up for that river rafting or zipline adventure you saw posted on the bulletin board, even if you are afraid of water/heights, And convince a brother/sister/friend to go with you. Conquer your fears, you'll feel better when you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) Pick up the phone and call that old friend or relation you haven't spoken to in years. Maybe it was because of some petty disagreement in the past, but now rather than anger  you just feel bad that you no longer are in touch. Just call them and say you're sorry (even if it wasn't your fault), and see where it goes from there. No guarantees, but you might be pleasantly surprised. And if not, at least you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you gave it an honest try. <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Our Church is called,\" Curch of the Picnic Table\".  We have a very large congregation and have visitors from all over the World sit and discuss God, Jesus, His Holy Spirit from scripture.  We have no doctrine.  In our Church members  have found through revelation the Bible is alive.  It is a living Word.  Doctrine is an agreement and a traditional man made belief system.  It can be incarceration and is position and seperation.<br>\r\n     The living Word transforms.  As one's perception changes so does one's interpretation.  What I read in the Bible yesterday, when read again today, does not have the same meaning.  A changed and different person is reading John  1:1-5.  Today is today.  So we give on to today what is todays.<br>\r\n     If we had a doctrine it would be this;  I believe in Him who He sent.  I believe Jesus is AND that He is a rewarder to those who diligently seek Him.\"<br>\r\n     The gold we receive at the picnic table on the American is baptism by fire.  The Word of God is creation.  It creates. We don't.  It's the jeweler's fire removing the dross from the gold and silver, releasing the impurities, purifying till what is left is one thing.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     When I was whistling, walking and thinking, I was seeing Saul of Taursus and the process of him undergoing overcoming and receiving a new name, Paul.  <br>\r\n     He witnessed a rapture in Stephen when martyred by Saul's conviction.  He was visited by Jesus on his way to Damascus.  Experienced his first but not last revelation.  Was blinded and did not see until a prophet of God was ordered to release Saul from the bondage of sightlessness.  The prophet reminded God who Saul was and what he did and he was still doing. <br>\r\n    This zealot, this leader of the Pharisetical Party or belief system, turned 180 degrees in his faith and wrote most of the New Testement.  \" How can you break through the rock hard heart of a Pharisee?\"  I can't and would never try unless I was told to by God.  He does fine as the author and finisher.  He told me He has it under control but would let me know if He wanted any help.  <br>\r\n    The battle isn't of the flesh.  It is strongholds, dominions, territories and principalities.  Traditional religion preaches, a rapture of the Church, Armeggedon, 2ND coming of Christ, satin's power, burn in a hell, for eternity, self transforming excercising will, guilt, works, emphasis on the wrath of God, tithing which was finished with the Levitt Priesthood replaced by Jesus and an immortal Melchizeldeciann Priesthood, having no mother or father, no beginning nor end.  In essence, what is being taught or at the least suggested, is that God is broke and weak and stands a chance of a satinic victory.  He reaps what He does not sow, He's jealous, He doesn't perform what He says He will or has performed.   Much more, depending on which denominational doctrine that particular cult or sect worships.<br>\r\n    When God said He was finished from His works and entered into His rest, was He finished?  When Jesus said, \"  It is finished,\"  did He lie?   <br>\r\n    The demonstration of God's plan and will for believers in Him and His son and the Holy Spirit  in linear time (worldly) was over two thousand years ago! <br>\r\n    Paul says, satin transforms himself into an angel of light and his minions into ministers of righteousness. Pharisee is a word. Saducee is a word.  Christianity and Christians is a word.<br>\r\nReligious people aren't automatically spiritual.  Many people and peoples saw, touched, stood near, spoke with Messiah and didn't receive him as God's son, their salvation and savior. Very few saw him as friend, brother and His Father as their Father?  Why not?  It is written.<br>\r\n    Pharisee is a state of mind, a stronghold! A stronghold has a stongman.  The Bible speaks of what must be done to free the prisoners incarcerated and shackled by this strongman.  Unfortunately this is impossible when no one knows who or what the strongman is!  Why don't people know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The answer is:  A teacher can't teach and a preacher can't preach what they don't know.  There is a drought for the speaking of the Word.  This means there is no hearing.  Our very faith comes by hearing.  Our hearing comes by every Word out of the mouth of God. The traditions of man make the Word of God to no effect! <br>\r\n     God didn't invent Catholicism or any of the 1,000's of denominations all calling themselves Christians?.  Man did. So what is a Christian.  God didn't create Christianity.  Christ didn't create Christianity or ask anyone to become a Christian.  He was a Jew.  I follow Jesus.  If I am anything, I am a Christ follower.  I am not a Christian, nor could I ever be.  It isn't scriptural. <br>\r\n     A last thought as I am whistling, walking home and thinking:  What did Christ mean to you, when He said,\"  Beware of the leavening of the Pharisee?\"  Peace be with you, Marlin<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

These very jaws are what made Bird Island a perfect sanctuary for breeding pairs of Albatross, who thrive on the solitude and predator free environment of the blue water of the open Ocean.<br>\r\n     They rarely come ashore and then only to breed and hatch an egg or two.  Both awake now, they slowly came to the realization they were in the presense of their mortal enemy, a feral cat!  Feral cats have done more damage to the Albatross breeding colonies around the World than any other single disease or predator!<br>\r\n      They were in luck and both knew it.  Unburdened by the necessity of protecting a young chick, together they are a formidable opponent against any man or beast.  With unusually muscular wings for birds and  eight to ten foot wingspans, one feral cat is at their mercy.  Their main weapon is not seen but rather experienced.<br>\r\nThey are very intelligent and capable of unique, original and unpredictable behavior.  <br>\r\n        Albatross knock their beaks together making a loud tock-tock-tock sound like soldiers slamming their swords on their shields.  The cat had no idea what this meant.  He had come for an uncooked omlet not a confrontation with two giant flying creatures that could take him out over the Ocean and drop him where even a fish couldn't make it back to safety and shelter!<br>\r\n         Knowing the little pussy wasn't ever coming back to threaten them, they continued knocking beaks.  This is also a form of communication and part of their mating ritual.  There was plenty of food off shore around Bird Island.  Friends and family were arriving every day.                                                                 Albatross like salmon and many species of turtles always return to the same breeding ground as their parents had and their parents parents before them.  It is just the way of things.  Maybe this year they might have two chicks.  This had happened two seasons back.  Though it was a lot more work, it was worth it.  He and the Duchess had been married for ten seasons now and it felt like he had only met her only yesterday.  Albatross pair up for life.

I'm Ross the cross boss Albatross, asking my partner what was so funny about me mentioning that a long dead relative had passed on a story about Magellan, discovering and then dying here at Terra Del Fuego, never reaching the Pacific Ocean but his ship and crew did.<br>\r\n        OK Ross, don't be cross.  No mas, boss Albatross and Lois Albatross busted up again!  Ross felt rather than saw the proverbial light bulb go on!  She was pregnant.  Now beaming with parental joy he changed his tone and asked Lois to start at the beginning and let him in on what is or was so funny?<br>\r\n       Ross, it's probably only funny to me but I'll give it a shot.  Here is the short version.  <br>\r\n       We were gliding along and I was only half listening to you going on and on about Magellan and crew out of water and them in one of the most dangerous places to sail on Earth, in uncharted waters, which was pretty much the entire Earth at that time.  Most believing the Earth was flat and that there was an edge you would sail off and fall forever through space in a perpetual saltwater waterfall!  That brought me back and it in itself is funny.  <br>\r\n     When you said in the story passed down  by family members that they became so thirsty <br>\r\n they begin trying to shoot Albatross to drink our blood.  We, being the only bird they had seen for some tiome. For some reason I can't explain, I saw over a hundred men tearing apart a seagull they had managed to shoot by some miracle and not one of them got even an ounce of the four ounces coursing through a gulls circulatory system.                                                                                                                                Have you ever seen the rifles of Magellan's time?  Shooting a flying gull from a rolling deck with solid shot from a blunderbus is an impossibility.  That also is funny but when added to what you said next, I broke!<br>\r\n     With gull feathers blowing around on the deck gathering in little eddies of air currents, all that was left of the gull who had been torn into very small pieces, similar to what the Hawaiians had done to Captain James Cook on the Big Island, you said,\" and this was the moment Captain Magellan said his famous,\"  \"Water, water, everywhere but not one drop to drink!!\"<br>\r\n     I then invisioned his crew tearing him apart on the spot and drinking his blood for saying something so stupid and reminding them that they were made to crew for him and he alone was the reason they were dying of scurvy and dehydration and they hadn't even an idea yet of what is in store for sailors who attempt rounding the Horn.<br>\r\n     None of this happened Ross, the boss Albatross.  But what did happen is Magellan died there.  The ship had found a safer way to round the Horn and made the Pacific Ocean.  Many of the crew made it back to their homeland but not many of their teeth did!  <br>\r\n     You and I go almost a year sometimes with no fresh water.  To bad we don't speak their language.  We could have taught them how we do it.  But then anyone who thinks blood is less salty than saltwater should just cut themselves and drink their own blood.  How about urine?  Now that is funny!  Lois Albatross, you have a warped sense of humor brought on and emphasized by the egg you are carrying!  <br>\r\n    Oh Ross, You figured it out!  Let's hele on to Kauai!  The cliffs of the  Kiluaea Lighthouse are calling us home.  Kauai no ka oi!<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

In this pause in time, I wonder - but there is no answer to be found in the depths of your eyes, blackened as they are by the night. Behind me, the wall weakens as the moments pass; in every second there is a growing sense of decay that threatens to swamp both of us. Fluid leaks from my shoulder, the quaking earth tearing at the knife you thrust so hard it cracked the wall. Like the colours of war it seeps everywhere, painting your hand a savage crimson as it gently grasps my throat. Out there, in the land we loved so well, the antiquated lives of thousands are lost with such ease as still others advance, driven by a strange fury that sees all reduced to dust. With bated breath I stand, pinned to the wall, well aware that the gun in your hand is pointed solely at the culprit. Me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did I do to you that warranted this? Somewhere in the back of my mind, the chant begins anew, but the time for words is long past - these allegations that hold me here in thrall can never be resolved... there is no hope left to set the truth in motion.<br>\r\nThe wall shudders angrily, freeing me from the constrains of the knife. Your grasp tightens ever so carefully, those darkened eyes never leaving mine as around us the world dies. Even as you pull the trigger, love blooms within me as I remember. The end this may be, but I know who you once were. That is enough to sate the souls of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprise, like a fleeing deer, splashes across you face as the empty chamber clicks. An expression, no doubt, mirrored by my own - but what did I expect to see? Sorrow consuming your soul even as you destroy me? Or something less; the primal anger that drove the knife home? Instead I find misery, chasing away the shock. The gun falls, the hand slips away. A silvery tear escapes your eyes, now shown for the hazel they are, as the blinding light of an aircraft's searchlight sweeps the plain. The choking love inside my chest swells and leaves me breathless, seeing you illuminated by brightness, like my own angel sent to set me free. With careless joy I pull the knife away, the pain merely a momentary blight on my mind; eyes trained on yours. The wall creaks threateningly, but we know we've reached the end at last. The knife clatters as it hits the rubble, but the sound is nothing compared to the rhythm of you heart as we embrace, crying as though at a funeral. Our funeral, but strangely our union as well, for in this second I know there is no greater love than that I feel for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second explosion, greater than the first mortar, rocks the ground on which we stand, and the wall renders all the love in the world useless as it falls.</span></div></div>",

Looking in the mirror,the face looking back at me seemed as puzzled as I was.  Without my beard and ponytail I looked high school age, still wet behind the ears, definately<br>\r\ngoing to get carded!  <br>\r\n     What the hell was I thinking?  When I was younger it would have been tequila to the black hole. Waking up two or three days later, where only God knew, while looking for clues through eyes so red if I kept them open, I would bleed to death. Stumbling to a mirror and sink, multi-tasking.  Vomitting in the basin, looking up feeling I was AWOL from myself when the reflection returning my gaze was a total stranger. Someone else had cut my hair and shaved not only my beard but my eyebrows also!  <br>\r\n     If I had have crossed paths with the Barber of Seville, that day, it was a killin matter.  Today, I would thank him for doing me one of the biggest favors anyone has ever done. That reflection, my reflection had an effect on me that to this day I still have not totally come to terms with.  The force from that mirror death experience was comparable to being struck by lightening!  In the twinkling of two bloodshot eyes I was a changed man. I didn't find out who I was till the next day when I found my wallet where the dog that had chewed it to pulp had almost finished burying it, planning a snack for a time to be announced.  The miracle was the only piece that survived the action of Buster's hydrolic compactor with shredder and in pretty good nick considering was my driver's licence.  Thank God it had a picture.  I saw instantly why I hadn't recognized me!  I had hair past my shoulder blades and a full beard, like Moses not Charlie Manson.<br>\r\n     That was it for me.  I was in Utah, two states from where the party started.  My car was gone.  I was only now beginning to fill in the missing pieces of the John Doe puzzle.  I had no money and no friends and Big John Henry, the steel drivin<br>\r\nman, was laying track for the Union Pacific Railroad in my freakin head.<br>\r\n     I've never been drunk since that horrific Houdidi (a disappearing act)! I can't even say the word, uuurgh, you know.  What made me errased.  Once I got my identity back, I found I also had friends in Utah and plenty of money in the bank.<br>\r\n     Dick, who should have the table down by now, and I went to college together.  Mark isn't here yet, it's early but he and the three girls that are coming at seven are alumnus also.  We've been friends for a long time, close friends. Tonight is going to be a first, which is saying a lot!  We've been around the block once or twice.  Maybe a few more times than that!<br>\r\n    Tables down and ready to go but I've got some bad news. Marlin.  I had a feeling what was coming and I didn't want to hear it.  I could tell by the look on Dick's face, he didn't want to say it.  \" Susie called.  That's Mark's next door neighbor.  They watch each other's backs. It looks like Mark is on his way to the hospital with bee stings covering his entire body.  It's bad but not critical, yet.  I'm going.  You're wel\"  \"I'm in!

So from now on, K-Now, now.<br>\r\n     She left satisfyed.  Another asked,\" What is the meaning of that sign\"? He explained she would be seeing a lot more hanging soon.  The head office has done sturies and because of the hypen between the capital K and Now, it draws peoples attention to the word know and it places an impression in people's minds,<br>\r\nlmprints like a branding iron does to a cow, so in an emergency, they are herded to the exits robotically, they have been programed to already subliminaly to their locations through out every store.  Your Safety first.<br>\r\n    I went from this old greeter is a full blown looney to struck dumb.  He was having fun and so was I.  He did two more spins on the K-Now Exit sign before my mom finished her shopping and yanked me out of the store by my ear like I was <br>\r\neight years old again!  I wanted to see all the greeter had.<br>\r\n     His next to last spoof was he convinced a shopper that the company that had made the sign mis spelled No!  They were sorry and were working on the problem as we speak.  In the meantime we still need our customers to know this K-now is No.  When they really know K-Now is No, They'll know there's no exit.  Did I make myself clear?<br>\r\n     He saved the best for last when he explained that all the greeters in times of an emergency directed customer panic traffic.  To stop panic and people being crushed by the weight of the people behind them all trying to squeeze through the same door at the same time.  This sign,  K-Now Exit, is a vertible life guard ring at your favorite pool.  I am the life guard at the door.  I look in people's eyes directly and when it is determined that it is safe, I say,\" K  Now  Exit.\"  Brings tears to my eyes when I think of the human lives that will be saved!  Happy shopping!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

How do I know this or where did this thought possibly originate? <br>\r\n      My brother Dale and I used to speak of infinite possibillities before he was sent to a private school as I was also, here.  Dale and I knew we were different.  Not just from our parents and our relatives but also from the friends that we made as we started meeting and making them from kindergarten on. They didn't see or question ideas, the world, as seen through our eyes.  The only way Dale and I came to this understanding was by us questioning and answering each other as curious children.  This curiousity seemed to be lacking or of no importance to most adults and if not in them than even more rare in their children?<br>\r\n     Dale is older than me by two minutes.  He calls himself, \" The Ancient One\"!  We, when we were younger, came up with a conceptualization that we were at least two beings.  We both had an outward self and an INNER self.  We weren't sure if there were more but we were sure that not just us but everyone had these two characters within and without.  We figured the inner self couldn't lie to itself because it knew the truth or what stood in for it.  But the outer self could tell a teacher or a mom or dad a fib.  A white lie!  A fabrication or a shuffle the deck of cards imaginitory, inventive and extremely creative lie to protect knuckles or butt from corporal punishment that existed before the days of political correctness!  <br>\r\n     So while my brother and I were discussing stars in the sky, the Sun and Moon, time and distance and light, and capital God, our friends were breaking into houses, stealing coins out of the church money basket and spending no time wondering if their life would have any signifigance or be meaningful to anyone but themselves? <br>\r\n     Dale and I know the reason we are in private school.  Our combined inner self was far to hard for our parents and friends to bare.  Thinkers think.  Their questions strike home.  When shallow people aren't shallow but have chosen the path of least resistance they can't hear a Noam Chomski, Alan Watts, Aldous Huxley, Hermanne Hesse, or even their own conscience?  <br>\r\n     Dale and I are fourteen now.  He just sent me a letter with a great insight.  Thought provoking.  \" Allison, isn't it interesting when your inner self asks a question and your outer self handily answers?\"  \"I believe when this comes about the two that were seperate are now one.\"  \"Can you see this?\"  Your brother in Spirit and Blood, Dale  <br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

Picking up a leaf that held a bright red color, I show her and she was delighted. <br>\r\n\u201cOh how pretty!\u201d She gushes as she takes it from me it from me. Folding it neatly into her wallet she puts it in her back pocket. <br>\r\nI know I blush as she takes my hand in hers, hers far colder but soft and gentle. We talk of nothing because what subject could really matter when we\u2019re both so lost in this happiness? <br>\r\nThe sun begins to set on us, silly orb knowing that she can light my day better than it could ever hope to try. But in its absence she grows a bit chilled, the autumn air only holding its warm breeze in sunlight. But neither of us bother considering that we should head back, that would be a waste of an evening, so I slip off my sweater without a sound and wrap it around her. She looks cute in gray even though she doesn\u2019t like it. <br>\r\nWe come to a ridge overlooking the field we were just in with a glorious view of the stars and she sits down, pulling me down beside her. Leaning into me, I can\u2019t see her face but I know almost certainly that she\u2019s smiling. I wrap my arms around her.<br>\r\nShe whispers, as if not to disturb the peace and pure zen that surrounds us, that she loves me. Was I growing a bit cold before that? It matters not, I\u2019m filled with a warmth I\u2019d never known before her. <br>\r\nI hold her close to me, my only wish to never let her go. I\u2019m struck, however, by the fact that I must. With an almost inhuman certainty I know that our time is painfully finite. I don\u2019t know why but I cry soundlessly, silent tears finding their ways over my cheeks to sprinkle her gorgeous blonde hair. \u201cI love you too, Mari.\u201d It will only come as a whisper.<br>\r\nShe can tell there\u2019s something wrong in my voice; that I\u2019m upset so she leans away slightly to look me in the eye. And as her blue eyes meet mine I know what\u2019s wrong. Only in my dreams would things feel so perfect. The world won\u2019t let us be like this. <br>\r\nI have to tell her however I can, even if it\u2019s only a dream, \u201cI\u2019ll always love you Mari. Please never forget that.\u201d <br>\r\nI can feel reality coming back as she becomes less and less subsistent in my arms. <br>\r\nI wake alone, tears covering my face, with nothing but the music I\u2019m listening to for company. <br>\r\nThe snow outside spins happily, mocking me. It\u2019s covered over all of our bright red leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes were closed and her chest... Still... It was a lovely service.<br>\r\nBut I was filled with disgust and anguish regardless. She looked all wrong, my beautiful Olivia. her hair as never neat, not even for church. In fact, it was usually full of braids, or some other decoration. Her face was never, ever, peaceful. She usually ranged from fury without rival to the inquisitive look of a million questions. My favorite was her look of pure, unbridled joy. And her hands... They belonged fiddeling with something of writing or... Interlaced with my own...<br>\r\nRegardless, I spoke at the ceremony. Her mother cringed, never quite approving and now she lacked any reason to pretend otherwise. I sat through the other speakers, as it ran through my head how much better I knew her than them. I'd seen each and every one of them distance themselves as she deteriorated. They did anything to get away and save themselves the heartbreak. But not me. As I reflected, my mind naturally went back to the evening I found out. I looked up at the dried little sprig I'd brought her laying in her casket. She would've liked that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was months ago, late spring I think. We were out for a walk because all the trees were heavy with their beautiful little blossoms she loved so much.She lead me to the park and we sat by our tree, the one that still bares our initials, holding each other in bliss. <br>\r\nBut something was bothering her, I could feel the tension in her skin. I finally nudged her and kissed her on the top of the head. \"What's wrong lovey?\"<br>\r\nShe sighed deeply and I felt her push back against me, looking for comfort. \"I'm sick Kate.\" She stated simply. The statement hung heavily on the air. On some level, I could tell that it was something serious, I just wouldn't admit it to myself. I simply assumed she had a cold and everything would be just fine. I still feel so bloody stupid. <br>\r\n\"Well then lets get you home hun, why on earth did you decide to come on a walk with me?\" I laughed quietly and moved to help her up before she put her hand on my arm, finally catching my eye. I saw the tears in her eyes and my heart sank into my feet.<br>\r\n\"No, not that kind of sick baby...\" She pulled me back down to her and buried her head in my chest. I could feel the spots of moisture through my shirt. \"I needed to see the blossoms with you again this year because I may not be around for them next year.\" Her voice was still so flat and acceptant. It terrified me. <br>\r\nTears pricked at my own eyes as I struggled for composure. She needed my strength, and I'm thankful that I maintained the presence of mind to realize that. She told me the specifics, what it was exactly, how it worked... She's apparently inherited it from her father, who'd died five years earlier.<br>\r\nOnce she'd told me the lot, I just held her, my breathing forced into a steady rhythmic pace to comfort her but I wanted so badly to just break down. I wanted to scream. I wanted god himself to present himself to me and explain exactly how he justified taking my everything away from me like this. I cursed the world because without her it would become the very picture of empty, sad oblivion. <br>\r\nBut my anger wasn't what she needed. Her life hadn't been easy but I resolved in that moment, even if it killed me, that I would make what she had left amazing. I tilted her chin to look up at me and I kissed her forehead gently. I'd done it a million times and the sensation was so much... More... When I realized that I had a finite time remaining. <br>\r\n\"No more of this, beautiful. No more crying.\" I took her now cold, still hand in mine and held it tight. \"I promise to cry plenty for the both of us when the time comes but what's the point of the time you have left if you spend it sad?\" <br>\r\nI wiped her face and showed her my makeup-darkened hand. \"I mean look at this. Do you want to be remembered as a mess?\" I forced a mocking grin, hoping it was at least close to my usual standard of teasing expressions. I kissed her deeply and it was a comfort to feel her lips form a smile against mine. <br>\r\n\"You're right, I'm sorry.\" she hugged me tightly and I felt her reign in her own sadness to calm herself. She put her hands in mine, where they so clearly belonged and pulled me to standing.<br>\r\nShe didn't say a word as she lead me to the clearing. She didn't have to. We had so many memories, and even if we weren't going to be making anymore, I knew exactly what we were doing. For year now, we'd always, at least once, danced under the spring blossoms, savoring their beauty and each other. It began slowly, both of us holding the other, each moving to the internal music that we shared by some miracle. Thankfully, there was no thought. There was no future, there was no past. There was only this momentary feeling, our wholeness found together, our consuming love. <br>\r\nSlowly though, we sped up, each caught up in the power our bond gave us. The pastel flowers became a blur behind her face as we began to spin, laughing and smiling. Her hair was freckled with the fallen petals and I swear for all the world that she'd never been more beautiful to me than in that moment. It was most likely that smile. She'd truly forgotten, in that moment anyway. It was that look of joy I mentioned. That look I willy probibly spend the rest of my life missing.<br>\r\nDizzy and breathless, we collapsed, falling against some tall grass. A content glow hung around us and she was entirely free of her tension. I held her tight to me, savoring the way she felt in my arms, so full of life, and she smell of her hair. But I felt it come back to her, slowly, like a heavy cloud and there was nothing I could do about it.<br>\r\n\"Kate?\" She looked up at me, thankfully free of tears. <br>\r\n\"Yes Olive?\" I kissed her forehead again, trying my damnedest to ignore the stormcloud that still hung.<br>\r\nShe smiled at the use of her nickname but it looked bittersweet. \"I understand if you want to bail out.\" Her voice was soft but sure.<br>\r\nI was speechless for a moment, my mind blank. \"You're crazy,\" I finally managed. \"Olivia- I love you with all that I am. And every day you have left on this earth, I intend to spend with you. Whether that means tomorrow or fifty years from now, I'll be there.\" I kissed her again \"You're my whole world baby.\" <br>\r\nShe simply nodded and buried her head in my chest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a few months since then. I watched her become frail and I kept her spirits up as best I could. Thankfully, there were more good days than bad. She never saw a day without smiling, I made sure of that.<br>\r\nBut the day came eventually. I'd held out hope right up until that point, in the hospital, holding her hand... That now so still hand... Five days ago. But it's ok baby. You can't come see the blossoms with me next year but at least a handful will go with you, ours forever. <br>\r\nI'm still waiting for that explaination god. Because what I wouldn't give to have that dance back. Just one more time.</span></div></div>",

A woman wearing a pink bikini with fringe around the bottom half gyrated enthusiastically, if not in tempo with the \"music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid onto his usual stool at the end of the bar. At least &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; hadn't changed. Tiny's Tavern only had six tables. Men sat at four of them, in parties of two to five. Ernie recognized a couple of them. He waved, but their eyes were glued to the stage. A fourth table was occupied by a young couple sitting very close together. Ernie squinted, then looked away. The girl was giving her companion a hand job! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya, stranger, where ya been?\" Tiny yelled from behind the bar. Tiny didn't like being called Tiny, but Ernie figured the regulars were doing him a favor - His real name was Ambrose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErnie turned. \"Tiny, what's going on here? I go away for two weeks and come back to ... &lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt;.\" He raised his voice to make sure the barman heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya like it??

One of them yelled an explicit suggestion at the dancer. She must have heard him, even over the music, but didn't react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErnie sipped his beer sadly. Why did everything have to change?? Maybe he was just getting old. This wasn't his scene, but what could he do?? It was the only tavern within walking distance, and he sure wouldn't risk driving after a few beers. What to do?? Join in the spirit of the new Tiny's or do his drinking at home, where he'd slowly turn into a bitter, lonely old alcoholic??</span></div></div>",

Is the monster, that bug eyed, evil, grim reaper whom I can't seem to face properly, toying with me? Am I dead or not? Give me an answer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut everything goes dark for a few minutes after I feel my body, bumping very hard into something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing, I feel, is a warm, soothing hand on my forehead, which occasionally dabs small amounts of cold water on it. Very slowly, I start to regain consciousness again. Then, my vision becomes less blurry as well. I can see the contours of a person. The width of the head, I can make out now, tells me that there is a lot of long hair. Long, brown hair without curls. I look at it for a few seconds, during which I notice the intensity of the total silence that is painted on a beautiful canvas of stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The desert is one of the best places to look at stars, you know?\", the person whose soft hand is still on my forehead says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lift my head up a little, tilt it forward and have a look around. It seems to be true. I am in a desert, and the person with the long, brown, non-curly hair on their head seems to be a girl who is solicitously crouching on her knees to watch over me. She brushes my forehead again and dabs some more water on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\", I ask, while I wonder, if this is the same girl as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" She replies. \"But I am still holding your heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like, I have been asleep for a very long time.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dreamt about angels... I dreamt about being a rock star... But for the life of me, I can't figure out why?\", I continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter?\", the girl asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no... Or yes, I guess. I mean, dreams are just a reflection of our subconscious mind. They are just situations and circumstances that we wish could happen in real life... Except for nightmares, of course. But then again, how do we differentiate dream and nightmares? How do we know, when a dream stops and a nightmare starts?\", I say, pondering my thoughts out loud to the girl. \"And when you add alcohol or drugs to the mix, as I am sure, we must have done tonight, since we ended up here, the dreams and nightmares become even more vivid, or does that just happen to reality, while the sleep gets disturbed? I mean, I know that alcohol lowers the quality of sleep, but tonight seems to have been so much worse than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pause for a minute. Total silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\", the girls suddenly says. \"...Looks like our minds have been quite <b>obscured by clouds</b> tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\", I ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\", she responds. \"... Just that you sometimes can't see your own existence amongst all the clutter of distractions in the world. And then you kinda forget to search your emotions to know, how you feel about yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I guess you're right.\" I stipulate. \"You know, what the ironic thing is, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out here there are no distractions from life. From our own existence. Yet, out here, death is most likely awaiting us. But of course, not before the monster of the universe lets us experience some of the good old pain and suffering, because instant death is too kind of a way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's dark.\" She says, a bit shocked. \"But hey, at least we aren't alone after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe runs her hand through my hair, as if she was petting me. I counter by sitting up straight and putting my arms around her to keep her warm from cold desert air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe just sit like that for a few minutes, until I notice a couple of branches and a rock on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know? We could try to light a fire with that.\" I suggest. \"Would be nice to do something to keep busy at least, until the monster gets us. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just as good as waiting for a vehicle to show up on that road.\" She nods mockingly at the deserted road behind us. \"Whether it is a lonely Land Rover or a crazy Lamborghini owner who has confused themselves into this part of the world, both scenarios sound equally unlikely to happen.\"</span></div></div>",

The sinking feeling in his chest made it feel as though he were hurtling through a sinkhole, the quagmire encasing his body in a tomb of mud.  \"No....\"  Without hesitation, he cradled her in his arms, trying to recall a time when she had lived, when she had been his childhood confidante, his youthful lover, his beloved wife, the mother of his young children.  <i>'\"Had been\"?  \"Was\"?'</i> he pondered, only crossing his mind for a moment.

Taking her slender hands, he pressed each blessed finger to his lips.  Nothing.  The guilt was overwhelming as he studied each of her stunning features, and a lump rose in his throat.  The eyes, so deep a green, had lost their enchanting, lively sparkle, the <i>joie de vivre</i> that had brightened his own life every time she lifted her clear voice in song, or even whispered in his ear with the brogue accent indicative of her previous home.  Touching her creamy skin, he instantly missed the soft, rosy glow emanating from her cheeks and the broad spread of her full lips as they turned up at the edges, revealing perfectly white teeth.  The silky, raven black hair did not sway temptingly about the soft lightness of her pleasant face; it was marred by the dark, crustily dried blood spreading out from her neck and head.  No sweet dimples dotted her face.  Even her pert nose seemed pinched at the edges, a disturbingly pink froth bubbling on her dry lips.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Absolutely nothing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cM-my God.\u201d  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tears burning his throat let loose as a moaning sob escaped his lips.  Tentatively, he touched her lips first with his fingers and then with his own, hoping for a response, for soft, giggling laughter or her slender fingers running through his hair.  Nothing.  Cold guilt icily coated his insides while the hot grief streaked down his face, but there was no answer, no response, no life left in her dear body.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGoodbye,\u201d she seemed to whisper as he tightened his arms about her, venturing to lay a final kiss of farewell on her dead lips.  \u201cGoodbye, darling.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Burying his face into her graceful neck, the gentle scent of roses, ruined by the metallic odor of blood, brought the proceedings full-circle.

No matter how fast Jack's hand moves up and down<br>\r\nThere is no sensation and nothing is coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does one repair, without the right tools,<br>\r\nthis worn, flat tired, worthless vehicle in despair without a Jack<br>\r\nthat works?  Look, Jack has been found and is trying to work. I put Jack down. I wish I hadn't but maybe it was for the best? He seems to be fixing his problem!<br>\r\nTogether we patched things up.  It was easy for me to see the problem of why my pal Jack's off.<br>\r\nIt's the hole thing that has him flat tired. Shore up the breach and give it some air and maybe our Jacks back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car stopped to give us a hand and Jack is back.  With no hole in the wall the old jack was back and working like a champ.<br>\r\nFilling with fresh air our Jacks pumping<br>\r\nlungs a bellows, healing the vehicle that a short time ago had felt and looked worthless and unrepairable.<br>\r\nThe kindness of the man brought our old Jack back.  He made new, the flat tired and worn Jack.<br>\r\nHis knowledge left us all with a working, functioning, good as new Jack.<br>\r\n                                                                                                                                                             What depression?  It is as if the hole thing never happened.  Jack's good tired now and good to go!<br>\r\nWe were both happy to be retiring. The motel behind the gas station where we left the car was #1.<br>\r\nNewly attired in polkadot P,J's I said,\" HiJack some of those little booze bottles sound good?<br>\r\nHe said,\"  HiGene is important looking and clean is a good thing but what is with the dots?\"<br>\r\nThey aren't dots.  They are black holes surrounded by the real focus material that is important.<br>\r\nWhile changing I had a brain fart.  I'm glad my friend wasn't black!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew there was nothing I could do about what I was hearing.<br>\r\nI almost laughed out loud.<br>\r\nI guess some people only have two switches?<br>\r\nWhen my pal Jack's on, my friend Jack's off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He asked me to come along. No way, I told him. I'm not going to spend my summer reading boring books when I can have my own adventures. But he told me we would leave the library as soon as his mom drove off and explore the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was really excited. I wasn't allowed to play far from my house. The chance to explore the city center was too good to be true. My mom was happy that Randy was being a good influence on me and agreed to let me go along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, we decided to explore an abandoned building right behind the library. The entrances were boarded up but even the boards were old so we just kicked them in and walked around. The first floor was one large open space so we went up the stairs to the second floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stood in a dark corridor that seemed to have no end. I was a little scared, and I think Randy was too, because neither one of us moved nor looked at each other. If I looked at him, I'd have to start walking or he'll make fun of me, so I bent down pretending I was tying my shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up,\" I heard him say. I could tell from the tone of his voice that hurrying up was the last thing he wanted me to do. \"Cole...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, alright! Hold your horses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cole...I think there's something here,\" he whispered. My heart stopped the moment I heard those words. I was afraid to lift my head but I quickly shot up and looked around. Randy was frozen in place. I couldn't see anything, but what was that noise? Where is it coming from? I turned around to go back down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next sound I head was a scream that still haunts my dreams to this day. I knew it was coming from Randy. I looked back. A dark figure stood looking over me. I couldn't see him properly but his smell was pungent. He took a step towards me, and I could hear his heavy breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cole! Run!\" In a moment of panic, I ran towards Randy instead of escaping down the stairs. We tried to run around the man but he just stood there like a tree, blocking the exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Push him Cole!\" Randy yelled. I didn't want to, but I didn't have time to think. I put all my strength into my two arms and pushed the man down the stairs. He took a tumble, his large, dirty coat flying over his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit the bottom with a loud thud. We ran down behind him, stopping only for a second to look at his body as we flashed past him to the bottom of the stairs and out the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange angle at which his neck was snapped is burned into my eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe waited in silence on the stairs outside the library for a lifetime. When Randy's mom finally appeared, we got into the car and sat silently. His mom chattered on, asking us about what books we read, and something about ice-cream? I don't know, all I could think about was how we were getting away with murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's 'That Seventies Dance', so you're wearing thrift-store bellbottoms, which chafe a little, but you don't care, because you've been swept into the middle of the floor, your compatriots swirling around you as you all sing along, rising and falling with your overdramatic gestures.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nobody's mocking it.

And it's what we are now that confuses so many: they think Man + Woman only ever means one thing, as fixed a fact as 2 + 2. It's widely assumed that we are together-- when I touch his wrist like that and whisper in his ear, what else can it mean? Little do they know that I'm whispering an in-joke to him. Teachers have assumed that we are together, asking friends discreetly (but not discreetly enough) behind our backs. One one memorable occasion, a classmate even asked him if we were having sex, having mistaken intimacy born of many years for <i>physical</i> intimacy. We really laughed at that one, albeit in an uncomfortable way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We're friends.

But <i>this is real life</i>--we are what we are, <b>complementary angles</b> fitting together to make a whole, opposite and equal. Partners in crime, a dream team. We love each other, and we make each other whole. But it's sad that no one today believes me when I say that if we were boyfriend and girlfriend, we wouldn't be as close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rarely do they pass without some sort of buzz. Children with fluttering flags and denim hats grabbing at their mothers' jeans and asking when they could eat. Joggers sweating in the heat and chill of the morning. A woman with her hair in a bun speaking about agriculture subsidies, a man talking to a woman about dinner reservations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They don't even know</i>, he thinks to himself, his tongue bitter with self-inflicted venom. <i>Or, they don't even care.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat venom is his status quo. Not his favorite taste - he regards any taste as dull, and any effort to choose anything as his favorite as far too much of a resignation to this self-destructive society. But that venom, that disdain for external life, is the lifeblood of his illusions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he resigns to going home. That, he figures, is inevitable. But there is no point in pursuing something better, for finding something worthwhile in the cold, materialist, dull Gomorrah under this bleak sun. He has fallen into the routine of traveling here, so he might as well go back to that dingy brick building where he stayed in Rosslyn, Virginia. He stands up, and begins to walk to the subway station a few hundred paces away. He ducks his head and looks to the hazy sky to avoid eye contact until he grasps the impure escalator handrail that carries him down to the train.</span></div></div>",

She was, after all, an actress.  An A-lister at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had only taken her one year to reach stardom.  Her \"tragic\" history and apparent triumph over it are accountable for much of this, since she'd only done two movies, one single, and one guest role on a sitcom.  Yet here she was tonight, at one of the most prestigious events for actors and singers, with a nomination for \"Best New Artist\" and \"Breakthrough Actress.\"  Producers were already fighting over her to produce her biography, and she was only 24!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even now most people knew her biography.  She and her twin Dorothy were born to Ian and Gina Engle, a famous politician.  Gina kicked Ian and the twins out when they were only four and remarried her second husband.  Since then, Destiny and Dorothy had been excommunicated, from the famous bloodline of their mother, and their five older siblings would in the future rule the city without acknowledging the twins.  Gina once told the press that marrying Ian (husband 3) was a mistake and regretted ever doing so.  Ian was forced to raise them, and he tried his best, though they struggled.  At age 13, Ian married Zelda Elfman, his former step-daughter and half sister of Destiny.  For the next two years, the twins were generally ignored.  Then Zelda murdered Ian and got away with it.  She was pregnant with his son when Ian died, but she never allowed Destiny or Dorothy to see him again, since they accused her of murder (which was not a lie).  The young teens were left to finish raising themselves.  According to common knowledge of the public and the press, life was pretty much a struggle for the girls until age twenty, when they both fell in love.  At 22, Destiny married Gustavo Belmonte, and one year later started her career in acting and music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, tonight, everybody was wondering why Gustavo wasn't accompanying Destiny.  \"I heard they had an argument.\"  \"Is he cheating?\"  \"Is <i>she</i> cheating?\"  \"Maybe he's just sick.\"  \"No famous couple ever lasts.\"  Destiny chose to ignore all of these rumors that she heard from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Destiny Belmonte was the only one there who knew the real story.  There were problems.  Gustavo could no longer cope with the problems resulting from Destiny's new fame and had finally threatened to tell the paparazzi about Ignacio.  Destiny tried to level with him to keep it secret, saying that it's the only way she knows due to her unfortunate upbringing and lack of a mother.  She would say that never had a mother, and turned out fine.  She completely ignored the psychologically abused little girl that she had been and still was, ignoring her lack of strong emotion for anything other than the spotlight, which Gustavo had once given her.  She even threatened to leave Gustavo if he spilled about Ignacio.  She loved both Gustavo and Ignacio, but couldn't bear damage her reputation.  Not yet, at least.  And so there she walked alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, in a mansion of a gated community was Gustavo, hoping to save his marriage.  He wished that he could return to Zephyr Park where his friends and brother were, but this was the life that Destiny had chose for him and Ignacio.  He went to check on one and a half year old Ignacio.  He looked at his son and tears fell from Gustavo onto the babies gentle cheek.  Gustavo bent down into the crib and kissed his forehead.  However, this was not the kiss Ignacio wanted.  Ignacio, who bared a striking resemblance to Ian Engle, was the secret baby boy who was <b>waiting for the kiss</b> of his mother, a kiss that he had never ever felt before.</span></div></div>",

Hot, dusty, with the faint scent of dying pine beetle infested trees...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie left me years ago, after our two boys were old enough to get out on their own, I guess she got tired of my ways. Me stayin' out late most nights drinking and playing cards with my buddies at the casino, while she sat up and worried if I was gonna get arrested again, or gamble away the rent money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eventually realized I couldn't keep on going the way I was. I  knew the guys at the casino were only my friends as long as I was losing money to them. One night I finally scored big, hit a progressive jackpot with an honest-to-God-royal-flush. I tipped the dealer a couple hundred, cashed in damn near twenty grand and walked out, determined never to go back. But I knew to make it work I'd have to leave town...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one good thing I did in life was manage to keep my job as a machinist for Boeing for 35 years, which qualified me for an early pension. So I turned in my notice and went looking for a place to start over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I was driving around up in Big Bear looking at foreclosures when I saw this little log cabin for sale that looked like it might be in my price range . I called the number and made an appointment to meet with the agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place needed a lot of work so I was able to get it pretty cheap. But I'm good with my hands, I knew I'd have no problem fixing it up, and it would give me something to do since I wasn't working any more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo two weeks later I move in, and two months later after fixing the place up I'm bored. I'm talking to one of my neighbors and he mentions how he's a volunteer fireman, so I go down to the next meeting with him to check it out. It seems like something I can do, I started working out again so I'm in pretty good shape for my age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pass the test and join up, and after being called in and fighting my first fire a couple months later, I'm hooked. The adrenaline rush of battling the flames, and that feeling you get after successfully putting down a big fire. After quitting work I really missed the sense of accomplishment you get from a job well done, and this is a way to get it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't sleep as well as I used to when I was younger. So when I wake up and see the glow out my window and it seems like it's too early for sunrise. I look at the clock and it says 3:20 and I realize it isn't the sun. The phone rings and I pick it up to answer. Looks like it's time to go to work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He drove the women in town wild, not that they wouldn't have gone over for any new bull's swagger, but then he shot pool with those hands, he tipped his hat with the long fingers, his motioned Old Bell over for another beer and the rest of us sitting there like chumps, dirt on us from fields, our own palms black as sin with worked over skin. And him sitting at the last stool at the end of the bar doing coin tricks, throwing dice, gesticulating like a madman as the women went crazy and the firehouse plugs drooled. So it was his hands I hated, and the hatred only grew the more I saw of him. And the more I thought that a man with clever hands like that gets them clever because he has no real work to do, and then he comes to a new town like mine and trigs up all the women, including the brat in the bar who twice now has almost been mine, and a fire gets out in some ramshackle nowheresville ranchhand's rusted tin shed, and he busts it up and is the new hero?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the brat goes home with him, and Old Bell the next nights gives him free drinks, and his name gets in the paper, and oh how all the women keep swooning, and the dirt just piling up under my nails, and somebody even buys him a dog to layabout his godsforsaken house sniffing at passing farts. And when I go up to talk to him about the brat situation, he acting like he's never met me, never passed by me every day in the fields for the last three weeks, the sun beating up the back of my neck? And a grimace flickers over his face when we shake. He looks down at my cracked knuckles and frowns. And cracks his own and a wide, beaming smile busts out of his unseamed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I did it. I did do it. I am that firebug, doing everything anybody said I did. And more. Did the big one, that one that burned so hot men halfway across the county went soft with fear? and the hand-man's pool boiled in his backyard? and his gift dog became a wasted cinder in the wind? You bet that was me, and I got more intent where I found that.  Better believe it. Fair is fair, after all, and I earned what I earned, and nobody's going to take it.</span></div></div>",

I figured once I was there I could jump ship and get to know the locals, interview them, take some pictures and notes about how poverty and the breakdown of society had led them to their actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could write a book about their plight and make enough money to pay off my school loans, and maybe make a name for myself as a writer in the process. I could see the cover of the book already, a grainy photo of a couple of skinny black kids standing on the bow of a speedboat, holding their AK-47's, the title \"Pirates!\" in jagged red type above the picture. I thought my forture would be made! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a week I was \"arrested\" as an American spy and thrown into a cell, presumably by the man who hired the local kids to hijack the ships. I try to talk to my captors:  \"I'm not a spy! Don't you realize he's taking advantage of you? He's keeping most of the ransom money while your people take all the risks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Arale said you are an American spy, and you will try to say things to turn us against him. And even if your words are true, what does it matter? There are no jobs here, no way other than the ships to make money. He pays us enough to put food on the table for our families, what more can we expect in these times?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the courtyard, my leg irons are fastened to a post in fron of a wall pock marked with bullet holes. I know I'm screwed, but in a perverse kinda way I gotta admire Arale's traditional approach to dealing with people like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a last request?\" the guard asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how about forgetting this whole thing and letting me go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a funny man, Mister American, I have not heard that one before.

I take a deep drag off the smoke, cough a little as the nicotene buzz hits me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a blindfold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I want to see it coming,\" I say with false bravado, as I try to keep my legs from shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard steps to the side and calls out to the riflemen: \"READY!\"... \"AIM!\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

While in the produce section, she was examining the heads of lettuce.  When she placed one back on the pile, a chain reaction of falling head occurred.  She tried to stop the onslaught, but to no avail.

I only realized this when after slapping me hard enough to leave her handprint in my beard, I woke up from a dark, deep, narcotized sleep that only those who have driven in infinity on the open road and when sleep overtakes isn't really sleep but an uncomfortable sweaty type of limbo or purgutory!  An in-between, never-never land where dreams are the labraia tar pits!  You are a slow moving dinosaur that is sinking while escaping and with a brain that doesn't know the difference between living or not living?  Doesn't care.  <br>\r\n      I'd never seen so many eighteen wheelers in one place before.  It reminded me of when I was tuna fishing off Midway in the northern Pacific.  We were in the pile (albacore ).  There were over two hundred tuna boats in the middle of the Pacific Ocean going around like we were all cruising the major boulevard in any city U.S.A.  It was a small moving city on the water, thousands of miles from anywhere but the tiny Island of Midway which is itself in the middle of no where!  It was like that for four days and nights until the tuna dispersed.  Then we dispersed to go out and find them again.<br>\r\n       This place wasn't about fish.  This was about petrol, sleep, a good meal, a hooker, a shower, comradrie and a clean book.  They only let you be on the road so many miles and hours these days.  No more truckers whites, cross tops, speed and Ocean to Ocean mom-stop!  Those days are long gone along with route 66!<br>\r\n       Here is what I did not expect to find and was glad Louise was taking a shower.  A guy invited me to his table.  I was leary and didn't like his looks but that's never stopped me before from hearing someone's spiel.  He bought me a cup of coffee and came quickly to the point.  His point.  He placed a card on the table in front of me and asked if I'd heard of the Klan?  I responded,\"  The Ku Klux Klan?\"  He said,\" That's the one\".  <br>\r\n     Louise and I had just seen a young black kid shot by people just like this guy.  We found his body and they fired into his already dead body again and thought that was funny!  I'm 6'3\" with a full beard.  I looked into this sweaty, beady eyed, red necked cackers face as I tore up his card, just halves and said, \" I hope you aren't asking me to join\"?  \"What if I was\"? his s sounded like a zzzz.  \"Well, if you are asking me to be a member of the Ku Klux Klan, I'd have to decline\", I said continuing, \"Do you want to know why?\"  \"Naw\"' he said making it sound like what a dog does to a bone!  \"Ya'll come around sooner or later\". I started laughing!  Could not help myself.  I thought his head was going to explode it was beet red and getting larger if that were possible.  This of course made me laugh even harder,  The entire restaurant was looking as he got up and waddled out the door into the blazing lights and sounds of trucks in perpetual motion.  I managed a, \"  Ya'll come back now y'hear\", in my best Beverly Hillbilly imatation!  He never looked back.<br>\r\n        It relieved a lot of pressure Louise and I had been feeling but had been keeping a tight rein on our emotions.  We had seen hate for no reason which is worse than madness because it can wear the appearance of sanity and reasonableness.  I was glad she didn't witness the confrontation but she did enjoy it vicariously.  She asked me only once if I thought we might be followed and I said emphatically no.  But if we were what could they possibly drive that could keep up with my GTO with trips?</span></div></div>",

His bleary eyes nervously flitted around the room, panic feeding his dream to make it seem as real as if he were again a child.  Blurred, dreamlike vestiges of twisted, grotesque shadows painted their distortedly misshapen forms across the widely contrasting structure and continuity of the monolith that were the cold, gray walls boxing him in.  Until a large, trembling hand flew to relight the waxy candle stub on the night table, those nightmarish horrors remained a fragmented connection between the not-yet-forgotten past and the present day, a link forged irrevocably by the unforgivable physical and psychological tortures he still felt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ominous shadows evaporated in the sudden light, shrinking back into the dark nothingness from which they dared to approach the wary, uneasy sleeper.  Bare walls of dull limestone coldly greeted his unfocused, shocked eyes, as did the sparsely spread furniture.  Ornate designs on the chair and legs of his oaken writing table glinted in the dim, orangey glow, as did the woody leaves and earthy, curling vines of his ceiling-length wardrobe and bookshelf, filled with leather-bound volumes in his personal collection, too precious to remain either in study or library.  Forest green bed curtains framed this picture, obscuring the other sights, but he knew of the three doors: one leading to the corridor, one leading to his personal washroom, and the third leading to the his wife\u2018s chambers, adjacent to his own apartments.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He lay his head back down and pressed his eyes with the heels of his palms.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\u2018\u2026it was simply a nightmare.  Why do dark demons of the past haunt my footsteps, in wakefulness and in sleep?\u2019</i>   The questions rang in his mind like the peals of mourning death knells from the silvery-sweet bells hidden in the lofty spires of the not-so-distant monastery.  Just the thought of the cold place brought back less-than-fond memories of the time he had spent there as a child and the years previous to that--the somewhat happier days before the end of life as he had known it.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\u2018Have I not suffered yet enough?\u2019 </i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It had been nearly two decades\u2014a long time to pass, but nowhere near long enough in his time-aged eyes.  For his were the eyes that had seen more than enough death and horror to last a lifetime; the eyes that had watched so many ruthless, unjustified murders; the eyes that had shed far too many tears for too many dear, loved ones in his time on this earth.  His were the eyes that spoke of the dark places in the man\u2018s past, of the black things that so many had buried and refused to mention; his eyes spoke of the deceit and the treachery and the tortures through which he had come; his eyes spoke of a troubled soul hidden deep within. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He briefly shuddered at the waves of cold rolling down his tall spine, feeling the goose pimples collecting on the warm flesh and the fine hairs stand up on edge in response to the familiar fiend: fear.  It played on his mind like the cool shadows cast by the orangey-red glow of a heated blaze.  All too real was the horror of those frightful days in his childhood and still all too fresh in his grief-numbed mind for the cycle of human emotions to thoroughly and naturally run their course.  The gruesome past lurked in those shadows, waiting to grab him in icy claws of darkness and to remind him why he had survived.  It burned as a black beacon in his mind, the overwhelming dark consuming what little light still shined in the bleak coolness.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now, as the man stared up at the ceiling's flickering shadows, he could do nothing but remember and cower helplessly in fear at the unwelcome memories flooding his mind and overwhelming his swimming vision.</span></div></div>",

'Mm ... define often,' I said, shifting in my chair. He simply stared and I felt the old frustration coming in waves. I blew the air through my gums, rotating my neck. It cracked, making me wince - boy, did I hate these damn questions. 'I wouldn't say often,' I said with a weak smile, 'maybe ... I don't know - once, twice a week. But it's not all the time or anything; I'm not crazy.'<br>\r\n        The old familiar prickle coursed over my skin and it felt like someone had popped me into an oven. I willed my heart to beat a little slower. Not only did I feel like a bug beneath a microscope under his gaze, but the fine golden hair at the throat of his shirt was messing with my concentration. <br>\r\n         A hundred dollars a session, just so I could see that face; those tanned pianist's fingers curled around that clipboard. Huh, maybe I really was a nut; straight jacket material. Yes, he had a knack of making me sweat, in the most delightful way, and I couldn't stay away. Most of my issues were sorted, but it was easy enough to create more, and if he ever suspected that I was telling a tall one, he never let on. I wouldn't let on for a hundred dollars a go, either.  <br>\r\n         'What about re-living those <span class=\"clred\">childhood memories</span>?' He asked with appropriate concern. He crossed his leg and I examined the length of his thigh, defined against the sinfully soft fabric of his pants. His loafers almost gleamed in the light and I pondered over an estimated price tag. My guess would have to be well in the hundreds ...<br>\r\n         'Christine?' The lulling tone of his voice broke through my thoughts.<br>\r\n         ' ... Oh, sorry.' I tucked a stray piece of hair behind my ear and wished for a mirror, or some lipstick, perhaps a splash of perfume. 'The memories,' I said, struggling to remember my own lies. 'I'm still having the flashbacks,' I paused, clearing my throat, 'but they're less frequent now.' I traced the outline of the pink rose on my skirt and forced my self to meet his eyes. I could feel the colour flare to my cheeks and had no means of concealing it. Without thinking about it I plastered my palms to my face, the cold skin a contrast to the heat I found there. <br>\r\nA small grin decorated his face, just enough to show the impeccable row of teeth behind his smile. 'Can I get you a glass of cold water? He asked. 'Then we'll talk more about those flashbacks.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

I always proudly told people that I was the oldest of a family of all girls.  Only now do I know that I have lived practically my entire life as a lie.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I only recently found out that I have an older brother.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ma said that I knew him when I was very little, and she had hoped I was too small to remember him.  My sisters were, but I guess I wasn't.  I still remember watching him sit on the couch, eating cereal from one of our little plastic bowls.  I always thought that he was weird because he put bananas in his cereal.  Now that I'm older, I like to, too.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I'd asked Ma about him before, but her excuses never added up.  Age five, he was the bogeyman; eight, he was my cousin; ten, he was a ghost.  The last excuse she gave me before finally telling the truth was that he was her godson.  Only, I'd seen pictures of Ma's godson before--he was Samoan, and the person I remember had the palest skin in the world, hazel eyes, and short, blonde hair.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ma finally surrendered and told me he was my half brother.  She made me promise not to tell, because my sisters were too little to remember him and she didn't even want us to know about him.  He'd been messed up since he was a kid and got into some bad stuff like gangs and drugs and all that.  It was to protect us, she said, because we were good people, because she didn't want us falling into bad stuff like he did.  But he only got so messed up because he got kidnapped when he was real little.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Obviously, he was found, but the damage was already done.  He couldn't cope with it, Ma said, and the only way he could recover was by acting out.  So, as soon as he was old enough, Ma kicked him out of the house.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wasn't sure what to think, so I guess I'm still getting over the shock of it all.  I'm an aunt, but my both my nephew and my niece live out-of-state.  They might not even know each other because they were adopted into different homes and they're only half-siblings, too.  They probably don't know that they have aunts, either.  Does <i>he</i> know, though?  Does he know how his little half-sisters are?  Does he even know what each of us does?  Ma keeps in touch with him, so does she tell him how everyone in the family's doing, or does she just keep in touch to know how much bail money he needs or makes sure he isn't offed by a drug lord or rival gang?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Would Ma even have told me I have a brother if I hadn't found out first?</span></div></div>",

He stood beside the rusting hulk of my father's 'vintage' car; legs spread commando style, eyes squinted at the rising sun. <br>\r\n      \"That <span class=\"clred\">big brother</span>  o' yours owes me five hundred bucks, and I aint leavin' till I see some of it.\"<br>\r\n      I surveyed him from my hiding spot, my heart beating like a wounded sparrow's. He was terrifying. A tree trunk of a man with impossibly large hands - hands that were clenched around a heavy piece of timber. <br>\r\n      I realised that it was doubling as a weapon, and the corroded nails extruding from its tip seemed all the more terrifying.<br>\r\n      Snorting, he wiped his arm across his wide nose and spat a wad of phlegm at the thirsty earth. He scuffed the ground impatiently and dust billowed around his legs. He was an angry bull, and I, the red flag.<br>\r\n      Inching the door back I tested the lock. Still jammed. \"Damn it,\" I hissed. <br>\r\n      Dad was no handy man.

I was supposed to be in bed; resting. How could I rest when I had Steven Roberts to deal with - the biggest loser in school. He should have been expelled a long time ago, but when your uncle is the principal, you reap the benefits. If he got kept back again he would need a retirement plan.<br>\r\n      \"... I ... he's sleeping right now. We don't wake him when he's sleeping,\" I warned. The tremor in my voice was as transparent as my nightgown - that I was all too aware of.<br>\r\n      He laughed, a noisy gurgle that split the silence. <br>\r\n      I could smell my toast burning from the kitchen, but couldn't leave my post unattended. \"But, I'll tell him you were here.\"<br>\r\n      \"How 'bout I tell him myself, sweetie pie?

Detective Adrian Gorge had been politically outmaneuvered before. Rural routine was forced upon him, while his big city 'pals' ensured he would not be in the way of their ambitions. He had faced it like a man. He simply did his job as best as he could. Modern technology allowed to stay in contact with friends and family, that was, since the traditional divorce, his friend Jack Daniels and his family Razorback the Cat. Occasionally spiced-up by paying a visit to Michelle, who once per fortnight performed the willing mate to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian had been in the area for a while now. He had even read the secondary sources, one even suggesting it was all for a porn screenplay. No, one does not go to College and succeed as a detective by falling prey to false leads and red herrings. A malevolent atmosphere could be felt by all who did not fearfully shun away. This morning he had spoken with the one Police Psychologist in the vicinity. Abandoned cars, even expensive ones PLUS several missing persons, repeated arrests of people seemingly influenced by drugs. Something was amiss and obviously that something was a someone damn skilled in using the little failures of everyday-life people as a camouflage for more sinister deeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet for now it was a routine part of the job. half a mile ago he had arrested a suspect under suspicion of illegal trespassing and stalking. With the only housing in the area being this one house he would soon know, if the suspect belonged here properly, or if he would have to haul him into a prison cell for the night.

With heavy clouds darkening the sky and the few lights already turned bright it took Detective Gorge a moment to estimate this building project properly.  'Must be one of those alternate design fancies by the richer ones.' came the thought to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main building had eleven visible levels, ground level inclusive. Besides that were compact buildings, one obviously a small diner, one a repair-service and one an outdoor-shop. In the twilight of early evening it was hard to imagine, what kind of thought was behind this isle of modernity in the middle of a forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d came a voice from the communication panel at the main door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetective Gorge gently moved his suspect into position and answered the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa'am, I am Detective Adrian Gorge, I must speak with you. Please come down here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian felt that smart. Entering an unknown building, full of unknown persons, while already having a suspect to be tagged along was risky and henceforth to be avoided by the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, what he found lacking in TV detectives. Like with soldiers the manuals for members of the police task forces were designed as a fallback. A safeguard versus the human-factor which could endanger any officer or detective while criminals roamed around or lurked. Of course being smarter than the books was a known and unspoken competition among detectives, yet in the real profession those were men and women willing to face the tougher truism of life. On TV it were mostly immature and unstable egomaniacs, mockeries of any honest work, who worried only about their fame, fans and quotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and a woman, estimate in her twenties, smiled shyly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetective Gorge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Ma'am. Please tell me, if you know the man besides me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at the suspect, recognition clearly in her eyes. \u201cJacob, you really made it here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Detective could react the woman, obviously overjoyed, had catapulted herself into the hugging arms of the stranger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger still looked absent to Adrian, yet finally started to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cViola, I promised. Just ran out of luck, half the way in the forest my medication stopped working.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe new laws, I had nearly forgotten.\u201d Viola seemed concerned. Turning to the detective she  added: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacob's heart. By law he could not bring foreign medication along.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe get this solved, I already have a supply in my atelier, don't worry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian sensed no contradictions and nothing overtly suspicious. Artists were among those people who could easily be mistaken for drug-crazed or lunatics occasionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob turned towards the Detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetective Gorge, the diner offers a free meal to all public servants. Its an old tradition we hold to. Why do we not handle our affairs and meet there to talk in lets say... ten minutes?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Gorge knew this was a tourist. Criminals would be happy with getting away while most citizens always surprised themselves with some kind of etiquette or sense of duty when meeting police detectives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of his extra training course in public relations he answered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is a fine offer. Thanks. I really could take a break and I would enjoy some coffee.\u201d   </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Where will this story go next?

Yes, coffee. Not something with caffeine, Adrian smelled the purest aroma of coffee since his last visit with Aunt Gena. The old lady was iron in her enforcement of one ritually held family discussion per month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Gena tended to be even more rigorous with her insistence, that a good coffee and a homemade cake based in fresh ingredients were absolute musts for any civilized family of decent income! Adrian had already grown up with fast-food and sugared cakes from the cool-boxes of countless supermarkets. Yet on her good side Aunt Gena really made cakes of a fine though antiquated taste and her coffee, innumerable the nights at work within which he had longed for one cup of her elite-coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not the cheap crap which came like a punch to the stomach.\" Adrian thought. No, coffee with Aunt Gena had meant still mineral water was heated to flow through the powdered beans which were prepared just minutes before usage. \"They must breath a moment, boy.\" was what his aunt tended to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian was far from ignorant. He was no homely type either. Already back in high-school had he realized, that his family was exceptionally normal. No child-abuse, no frequent beatings, no crack-smoking parents or anything else from the media. Banally adapted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma Hows eyes fell upon her newest customer, just as he reacted to the aromatic smell of her secret brew. She had always loved to be a caretaker for the wandering folks. When her youngest daughter was killed in a car-accident, she even had found comfort in her self-chosen role. Norma was the patron, provider of some food and drink, as well as the local elder, provider of a mother's touch and wisdom on occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new customer was obviously one of the big city folks and clearly a Police Detective. Before she had seen the badge at his belt she had already known. The way they walk, hold themselves and watch around telltales of certain professions. This was an upright and forthcoming young man, she could sense that her eyes gathered the proper clues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatron she was she had readied a cup of her legendary coffee and even unleashed her professional smile. Either the throat-quencher or the heart-warmer would surely score. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they did. Adrian had finished his proverbial inner monologue just in time to see Norma, smiling a broad smile born of honesty, approach him with a steaming cup of coffee on her little tray. Holy Chorus, he felt like touched by an angel that moment.</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">I now pass the writer's baton, as I contributed my parts.</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/note.png\" alt=\"*Note*\" title=\"Note\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> On the contributor's request, I edited a word in this addition. --Joy<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

While she would never claim to be a theologian, she has a pretty good grasp of what heaven promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanesha puzzles her.  He waits patiently for her answer, but the size and shape of him intimidates her.  Like most people, she didn't spend much time thinking about death or the afterlife.  She was far too busy living.  Still, if she had, she never would have pictured the colorful Ganesha, not blue, not purple, something in between the two, and decked from head to tail to the end of his trunk in jewels, gold, silver, and all sorts of shiny adornment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heaven sounds awfully nice, at least from what I've been told.  A fresh start in this life sounds interesting, too.  I've heard though that you can't really start fresh because every life is wound in among too many other lives and those lives have a vote on what you do through the choices they make for themselves.  Tell me about hell.  Is it really fire and brimstone and eternal punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanesha shrugs again, but answers, \"I wouldn't know.  I've never been there.  It's quite a popular choice, though.  Less popular than either of the other two, mind, but popular enough to surprise those who fear it most of all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I change my mind if I don't like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Ganesha doesn't shrug.  It almost seems like he smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is but one thing I know: every choice is permanent but no choice is eternal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gets her attention.  It defies everything she has ever been taught.  Then again, sitting in her car listening to a radio talk show host babbling about politics and taxes, while being quizzed by the Hindu god of death is also nothing like she's been taught.  Death is turning out to be full of surprises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No choice is eternal, eh?  Okay.  Let me try hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish...\"</span></div></div>",

Would she be taken to new and better pastures to roamand be content for however many days she had left or was she goong to be slaughtered and made into dog food. Her heart trembled as she lay, caged, worn out and wishing that she was like the humans who had over the years come to see her in her prime. The children in wonderment and the old nodding their head and telling tales of the war and meeting Lions face to face in the jungle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her spirit rising above the cage that hed been her home for the past twenty years and as she looked down could see the the wardens looking at her limp body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The old girl's gone... worn out and probably too weary to be moved.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped and felt a shock like electrisity go through her body. When she woke up, she had no recolection that her former life had been that of a lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheila! You fell asleep on that garden chair. I hope you havn't got sunburn honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila stretched and yawned, her mouth now full of beautiful white teeth.

Daniel has football tonight and Ariel has Ballet. Come on my sleepy head, I know you stayed up last night finishing your book.\" <br>\r\nAs the couple drove off to collect the siblings, James asked again.as Sheila looked in the wing mirrer thinking, is this real? Am i a human now? Whaw! How amazing is this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he paused to listen. \"Did you finishe it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, i will let you read it later honey. She glanced at the handsome man driving beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.\" she murmered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the school the couple got out and walked towards the playground. Sheila looked at a man  who was pacing up and down as if in a hurry, she glanced again and screwed he face. I know him from somewhere she thought, then almost falling over one of the children running to get to the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch what your doing honey,\" James remarked. \"You almost fell there. Oh, here they are!\" he said.  </span></div></div>",

You know, if you put a lobster in a cold pot of water and turn on the stove, the water warms slowly enough to where the lobster doesn't realize he's getting cooked until it's too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone told me they do this because if you throw a live lobster into a pot of water that's already boiling, you can hear it scream before it dies. (I don't believe it, but I'm not going to boil a lobster to find out.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, it seems like only yesterday when the whole swine flu thing was just another big non-event, like the bird flu, or terrorists on airplanes after 9-11. Then there started to be more people dying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the news just kept on saying there was no cause for alarm. Just wash your hands, keep you kids home if they get a fever, the usual BS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a woman at work told me her friend's daughter had died. She had no previous health issues, just a normal twelve year old kid. Then she got the flu. Fever, chills, vomiting, the usual. Then she got a nosebleed. Then she started bleeding from the eyes, and coughing up blood. And then she died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was nothing about it on the news...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I heard that, I knew things weren't right and it was time to get the hell out of Dodge. I told my boss I wasn't feeling well so I could leave. (Since nearly half the department was out sick by then, he didn't think I was faking it.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped at Albertson's on the way home to stock up on supplies before heading for the cabin. Got a little fresh fruit and meat, and a couple two pound blocks of cheese. But the rest was purely survival stuff, no refrigeration needed if the power went out. Salt, pepper, canned corn, peas, pears, tuna, spam, sacks of rice, dried beans, flour, sugar, coffee, and a couple bottles of whiskey (for medicinal purposes, of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraffic was pretty light going out of the city, I don't think anyone realized what was happening yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust outside of Joshua Tree a guy standing next to a pickup tuck flagged me down: \"Mister, my wife's really sick, can you help me out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the man, blood was starting to drip from his eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you know anything about medicine?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled out my cell, punched in 911 and hit \"Send\" as we walked over to the truck: \"You have reached 911. All our operators are busy. Please be prepared to explain the nature of your emergency...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI punched \"End\". The way this thing is spreading, I wasn't surprised. I imagine the hospitals and EMTs are pretty much overwhelmed by now. It looks like we're on our own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at the woman stretched across the bench seat. She had dried blood beneath her eyes, but they were now leaking a translucent yellow liquid. She was staring catatonic-like, shallow panting breath. Looked to me like she was about ready die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at me like he still thought I could do something for his wife, but I'd pretty much done all I could by dialing 911. Not wanting to disappoint, I reached out and put my hand on her forehead to maybe check for a fever or something. In hindsight, it was a stupid move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman hissed at me like a snake, reached up real quick and grabbed onto my arm with a grip like  a linebacker. Before I knew what was happening she bit a big chunk out of my right bicep! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed in pain and jumped back, pushing her away, started running for my truck. The guy came running after me shouting \"She didn't mean it! She's sick! You gotta help us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slammed and locked the door, turned the key and put the pedal to the metal.

That should keep me cool for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly making my my way down the trail I almost walk right into the snake again, he's sunning himself on a flat rock. I stop dead in my tracks. The snake stares right at me, bobs his head as if nodding to me in recognition, then slithers away, disappearing into the rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Johnny,\" I say, still not sure if what I experienced last night was real or a fever dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep on walking, best as I can...</span></div></div>",

I must have drifted off the trail somewhere. Sun's getting pretty low in the sky, looks like I won't make it back to my cabin tonight. Hope Jenny &amp; the boy are OK...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance I spot a small cabin. As I get closer I can see the place is surrounded by the rusted remains of times gone by. Old metal and neon hotel signs, vintage gas pumps, and some crumbling junk cars that were already old long before I was born. I know where I am now, Ben Walker's place, Jenny's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk up and knock on the door and call out: \"Mister Walker, you in there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember Jenny telling me since her mom died, her dad spent a lot of time camping in the desert, \"prospecting\". He'd come back with old salvaged objects, and rocks and crystals that he'd make a few bucks selling to the kids that ran the gift shop down the hill. Guess he must be out there somewhere now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know him all that well, just met him a few times years ago  when I was seeing Jenny. But I'm pretty sure he'd forgive me for breaking in, considering my circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost folks out here hide a key somewhere. I look under the doormat, not there, too obvious. I check above the door sill, no luck. Then I look underneath the potted plans near the door and find the key underneath the one on the left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let myself in and immediately run to the sink to gulp down some water. Then I look for something to eat. I find a can of Spam and some bread, make myself a couple sandwiches that I wolf down with another large glass of water.

Sixteen long, numbing years of running and all it has culminated to is this dull waiting, standing at the side of one I've learnt to hate so well... you. Your shallow breathing is the only human sound echoing in this claustrophobic space; the hum of your life support systems nearly conceals the labor of your lungs, but I listen for it, and so it I hear. Somewhere in this hospital, a long time ago, my adopted Grandma was trying her hardest to go quickly, and with a heavy heart I recall those heart-wrenching days of sorrow. Unlike you, she was loved, so completely that even now the gap remains, weighing down my thoughts like the lies you spun so well, but as I watch you die so slowly, I see the logic behind her accelerated death. Should I cry? Laugh? Open the scars I hold inside my head, and recall what you did to me all those years ago? I wish I could bleed, as slowly and painfully as your dying gasps, but I know the mere scratches would linger long after the relief had worn off. Besides, some promises must be kept, and I promised I'd bleed no more. Not on the outside anyway. Your wizened feature swim in and out of focus, and I realize I'm crying. How embarrassing, I think as I hastily dry my useless tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all you've done, I still love you. Resentment rises strong within me as I consider this bitter prospect. How can I love the man who was supposed to protect me; who was meant to be my Father, but who tore my life in two? You <i>hurt</i> me, for heaven's sake. And here I am, sobbing and weak, at your deathbed. {b]I should dance smile maniacally; sever the frail threads that keep you here. But somehow, I can't. Salty blood erupts suddenly in my mouth, and I remember I was biting my lip when I entered the room. \"Looks like you're a little tense, girl\" I mutter to myself, laughing softly at my sour misery. Such sweet, acidic irony. The 'victim' watching the perpetrator succumb to one of his most dominant fears. But why fear dying, Daddy? You didn't mind when it was my siblings and I on the line, losing our childhood to your perverted ways. You didn't mind when it was my mum who had to pick up the shattered pieces of our lives and fit them back together into something remotely whole. And you didn't mind that because of you, I can't trust anyone without being scared that they'll be just like you. Now I'm in the mood to end your worthless life, but I know my pity hurts you more than death itself. Seeing the fear in your clouded gray eyes, knowing you know how long I've waited for you to die, I grin, unnerving the nurse who comes in to check on your vitals. \"Good to see you, Miss\" she quavers, preparing to leave, but a sound from my father makes her turn round. Eyes wide, she sees the lines on the screen spike, and calls for backup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the defeat resonating from your eyes, I think I've won. As I leave, I whisper one final word to the dying sadist: <i>Goodbye... </i></span></div></div>",

The desk was filled with papers, books and measuring instruments of unusual shapes. He was writing with a quill and on exquisite parchment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the right, a wall of books with a curtain dressing a door in the middle, the curtain was pulled back with a knotted silk cord revealing a  large bedroom and I could see a carved bed with eloquent covers draping over the sheet and pillow sham.This man is of nobility and wealth, I thought as my normally lubricated mouth dried up and my tongue stuck to the cleft of my mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marble fireplace on the left of me was cluttered with more books and papers and above on the wall, a portrait of Sir Francis in his youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit on that chair where I can see you.\" He pointed to a large armchair bound in worn leather and I sat down.<br>\r\n\"What is the purpose of your visit.\" he said putting his pen by the inkwell on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I---I was wondering if-- <br>\r\n\"To be ignorant of cause is to be frustrated in action.

Now go and report to me on Monday at ten and I might have some thing that you can pursue to keep your roof and your wife while your vanity will have to be in your shortest time. A  man has to follow his heart and also keep wisdom in his eyes. Good day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI passed the man in 2C who was still holding his door ajar, I nodded and descended the small stairs to my rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

C'mon in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured for me to enter.  I hesitated, then thought what the hell, I didn't have anything better to do.  I went inside.  The entryway was a bare white room, with two closed doors.  No one was about, and neither door had a sign.  \"Which door?\" I asked, turning to the toothless guy.  He just shrugged his shoulders and grinned at me, making me think about Jack-o-lanterns from Halloweens of my childhood.  I turned back to the doors.  The one on the right was black, the one on the left, red.  The black or the red, which should I choose?  Strangely indecisive, I approached the black one and put my ear against it.  Nothing.  Going to the red door it suddenly swung open, and the toothless guy I had just been talking to emerged.  What is this, I thought, some kind of nightmare?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed his shoulder. \"Hey, how'd you get in there?\". He shrugged my hand off his shoulder and again turned that disturbing Jack-o-Lantern grin on me.  Repelled, I let go of him and headed for the black door.  Reaching down I grabbed the knob and twisted.  The door slowly creaked open.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, how I wish I had chosen the other one, the red door.</span></div></div>",

If it goes off in your hand, so do a few fingers.  <br>\r\n     \"Mark, is that you?\" I asked in the direction of the twig breaking?  \"Whose askin?\" the maybe Mark asked me.

Do you see that flashlight?<br>\r\n     \"Mark, is that you?\" I asked in the direction the flashlight was coming from swinging back and forth making shadows<br>\r\non shadows and everything in movement  black and white!  \"Whose askin?\" the maybe Mark asked me.  \"Marlin\" I answered stacato!  I'd had enough of this cat and mouse and my nerves were drawn as tight as Andre Agassi's cat gut tennis strings!  \"No\", he answered.  \"My names John, and sometimes I'm referred to as beloved\".  \" Who are you looking for friend, if you don't mind me asking?\"  \"Maybe I can help you\". \" Why thank you, John, by Jesus thats awful kind of you!  Would you happen to know a Mark?  I'm sorry I don't know his last name but we've been trying to meet  and haven't been able to coordinate our combined efforts so that our physical bodies could get close enough to speak with each other.\" \"As a matter of fact I know Mark and Jesus too!\"  \"They're right behind you, as we speak\" \"Marlin, is your middle name Philip?\"  \" Why yes John it is\"  \"How did you know to ask that?\"  \"  I'd like to say Spiritual discernment but can't!\"  \" Your're the reason we are all here, Philip!\"  \"Your meeting isn't with Mark although it is in a way, It's with Jesus and us.  He's asking you to join us and our quest.  To join him and become something more than you were.  It's a bit tricky and He explains it much better than I .  I never get tired of listening to him and questions are welcome.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I've been waiting in this desert for an eternity. I've tried countless times to reach him, each time a different scenario within a different dream. Dreaming is the only way I can reach him. If I am to bring him to my embrace before the dark comes to claim him for good, I must find out what will resonate within his subconscious. My heart breaks when I dwell too long on the idea of never having him for my own. I look down at his beautiful face, his heavy black lashes lapping at his cheeks like the waters of a serene ocean as he dreams. His hair is gold and cornsilk and starlight. For a moment, my throat flutters and I don't think I can resist kissing his full lips. Then I remember what happens if I touch him physically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I tried first to frighten him. From the little I know of human nature, nightmares seem to have the greatest effect on heightening the senses. Fight or flight I think they call it? Anyway, my strategy of hunter (me) stalking out her prey (him) didn't seem to get very far. I only succeeded in stoking my own desire for him, I found myself longing to capture him and treat him as my prey. The human subconscious is a mysterious and personal thing, apparently his psyche went somewhere hidden and wasn't ready to be caught just yet. Perhaps his curiosity was stronger than his fear.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMy role as siren was just as unsuccessful. I tried to seduce him, to break his heart in order to wake him so I could give him mine. This only resulted in stirring melancholy, which is not exactly an emotion known for inciting action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nuance of comedy can sometimes have an invigorating effect on the human condition, so I dug deeper within to anticipate his sense of humor. Turns out he had an Uncle with an insatiable appetite for practical jokes. Particularly if my love was the target and was preferably under the age of fourteen. I didn't have time to rifle through them all, so I used the first I found. It was something about attempting to get the poor boy to stick his hand into a tank full of piranhas in order to retrieve a ring belonging to his uncle's \"boss\" that he had somehow managed to lose down there. I found myself detesting this Uncle, and I resolved to claim vengeance upon him for his dishonesty. For a moment I thought this was the one that had done the trick, for he moaned and rolled his head toward me. I thought he was going to open his eyes and I eagerly anticipated the focus of his gaze. Instead he muttered something about speaking to God. At least we were making a little progress, maybe somewhere deep in that dark well inside his head he was beginning to comprehend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the point at which he began to moan fitfully. He tossed and turned on the dune. Panic sat heavily on my chest and I found it difficult to breathe. My time was running out. \"Just stay calm!\" I screamed into the wind, entreating it to stop howling around me, but found my pleading in vain. The wind answered mockingly, informing me that I would never be able to barter my immortality for a mortal life lived with this man. This man whom I loved more than all the wonders I had seen and all the lovers I had taken in my 3,000 years combined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were so close! I could feel his mind reaching for mine. \"NO! I screamed to the dead, heavy sky. Dark figures surrounded us. Tears fell from my cheeks, making indentations in the sand as they turned to ice. All I could do was look at his face and weep. \"Can I at least hold him?\" I pleaded. The forms were silent but I knew the answer. It was forbidden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis precious form began to fade. I could see the outline of his beautiful body in the sand as he slipped away from me. I knew I'd never see his perfect face or swim the deep ocean of his mind again. The tallest figure stepped forward, looming over me as I sat curled in the sand. I drew my knees to my forehead to hide my icy tears but I know he could see my sobbing. My wings heaved too heavily along my back to hide this. I looked sternly into his black face. \"I hate you, I said evenly. And I promise next time it will be you sobbing alone in the sand, begging me for mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am walking calmly through a big city, and everyone's running around screaming.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Flashback to about ten minutes ago. I am a small wolf. I'm feeling the energy building inside me. I'm bound in a scientist's lab with metal restraints, but I grow bigger and break out of them. There's something I don't want to, but need to, can't, but have to do and that's kill. The impending kill makes me crazy, and the crazier I get, the sooner I'll kill.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I'm asking the scientist why has he let the werewolf escape. He tells me the werewolf let himself loose. I say I don't think it's letting loose if it's he who wants to get out. The scientist says the werewolf doesn't want to get out, but it's the hate itself that drives him to do what he hates.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I am the werewolf. I run the streets. I rip people to shreds. They run away. It's futile, I'll get them anyway. Funny, I don't see others in their eyes as I tear out their hearts. I see myself. I'm making it worse for myself as I try to get better. The hate of the very thing I hate to do drives me to do what I hate. I know I'm going to keep killing, to ruin my hopes of it ever stopping, but it will only stop if I stop hoping. It may be too late. Look what I've become.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A monster doesn't believe it's a monster, right? It believes it's doing the right thing? Maybe. The scientist and I are the only two left in the city. Everyone else has been destroyed. We make our way to the top of the tower of the tallest building in hopes that we'll think of a way to kill the werewolf off before it corners us at the top.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I've done it. I've killed everyone. But wait. I still have some unfinished business. That's why I'm still alive. Is the only way to kill myself and end the killing of others to kill all others? There's someone left. I've got to find them, there's got to be a way. No, I shake that thought out of my head. A new one just fills its place.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If I were a werewolf, why would I be killing people? Maybe I don't know any different. Maybe I'm being driven to do what I do because I hate what I do.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>If I were a human, where would I go to hide from a werewolf? Maybe, I'd get as far as possible. Maybe I'd get closer and lure it into a trap.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I tell the scientist to show me the way back to his lab. He says are you crazy? Do you have any idea how dangerous this thing is? No, I only know how dangerous I am. That's how it is, right? The things we want to change in others are the things we need to change in ourselves? How can that be true? I've never killed anyone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>The humans need to get away from me. I'll kill them. I'm already killing myself even faster than I can wrap my claws around their soul. I'm destroying myself. Why do I care about myself more than I care about killing others. Maybe because I am those others. I'm suffering because I'm hurting myself. Weird how hurting yourself hurts.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We find the destroyed restraints the werewolf broke out of. We don't have much time. We need to get inside the werewolf's head. Make me a werewolf, I say to the man. The only way we can fight him is if we are him. No one fights with something that isn't part of them. If I hate something, it's still a part of me as much as if I love someone with the same strength. He's hesitant, but he realizes my point. He gets a large syringe from his table. Swearing under his breath and averting his eyes, he points the needle at my shoulder. It sinks in. I am suddenly in a state of no thought, but just as soon am in the worst pain I've ever felt. I feel myself becoming bigger. My heart palpitates. The wolf is growing. I'm growing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I'm running through the main street when a chill down my spine freezes me in my tracks. Something I'd never have expected is near. I look at the dark window of a shop, and I see my reflection. Out of the corner of my eye I see something move. I turn straight around, but I'm looking into another mirror. I'm staring face to face with myself. I back up a few steps, but my reflection gets closer. I'm dreaming. No, my reflection says. I'm not you. You may have killed thousands, but I'm only taking one life. That's you.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I'm staring the werewolf in the eyes. I'm eye level with the best because I am also a monster. My intent is different, I tell myself. I'm killing to make things better, and he's killing to make things worse.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>This monster will kill me, I realize. Then, what will he learn? That destruction is the end to destruction? The only way I can kill myself is if I kill him. But what if we were both alive. We could keep each other sane.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This creature is insane. I step forward again. I begin to crouch, when I see his eyes. He stares back at me with fear, not anger. Now I'm a werewolf too, so why would he be afraid of himself?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I realize he is the one who is afraid to make things better. Destruction doesn't cure itself. We'll just fight to end the fighting. This is idealistic, but as we're the only two left, I suppose it's worth a shot.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Why do you kill? I ask.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>To destroy what I've done.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What you've done is destroyed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Then what's done is done, but we need to rebuild what is left.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is idealistic, I know, but it was a dream.

Not the type of book I can discuss with my redneck buddies, who probably think \"personal growth\" has something to do with those ads on late night TV about male enhancement. But it really struck a chord with me when I first picked it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book poses the premise that we are all living our lives through the lens of our own personal idea of reality, our own \"dream\". Our view of reality as we are growing up  is distorted by what we have been taught by our family, our peers, our religious and political leaders. The message we are taught is to take life seriously, don't take chances, be responsible, follow the rules, so we often do what is expected of us rather than taking the path that we really want to follow, fearing what people will think about us if we don't do what is expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you follow the priciples of this book it will allow you to break free of this way of thinking, maybe make a new start in life. Or at least be aware of the sad situation you are now trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, when you ask one of your acquaintances in passing how they are doing on any given day and they answer facetiously \"Just livin' the dream,\" you'll know they are really telling the truth. <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a wake-up call for objectivity. One which was not brought out in a long jargon-filled bunch of theories in a science journal, but in a captivating down-to-earth tale of a maverick called Howard Roark who apparently lived ahead of his time; embracing change in the field of architecture where others, including his envious peer Peter Keating, acted like the only right way was to follow historic leads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was left thinking that if this world had more Howard Roarks in it, then we would not be waiting for the likes of Obama to bring change to the world; we would bring change to the world ourselves. </span></div></div>",

Its fine, razor-like tip burrowed threateningly into his flesh, doubling as a harsh promise of ruthless violence and a stark reminder of his fragile mortality.  Fear coursed through his pounding veins; he could hear nothing but his rapid heartbeat and the silent prayers begging to Yahweh for deliverance by His immortal, supposedly merciful hands.  Finally, after a sharp, alien command rang in the dreadful semi-silence, the man lowered his <b>cold</b>, unloving weapon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Large hands and uncouth instruments forced him forward and on his trembling knees to the biting ground, covered in the virgin snows of winter.  The hands\u2019 gloves chafed him like the tough restraints preventing his escape.  Their crude metal devices glinted menacingly, steel sentinels looming above the captive like the cruel prison guards that had tortured him day and night.  The hard, frozen ground made his knees and hands ache as he forced all his weight down.  However slight he was, exhaustion, dehydration, and hunger had conquered his feeble body and mind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Harsh laughter rang from above, below, and all around in the demonic, living nightmare; it caused his stomach to churn sickly and his insides to burn with the all but snuffed-out flame of inward fury at the wrongs suffered by his kind.  The wan, afflicted faces of his family swam before his eyes as their anguished cries perforated the mirthless, disquieting laughter on their way to the cold, toxic gases of a misnomered shower and the alternately hellish heat of the incinerators that reduced the last vestiges of their existence to ash.  His head pounded with the noise and eyes welled with tears, an indelible ache coming from somewhere in the depths of his chest at the humbling, pitiful sight of his fragmented family, so easily lost at the hands of such a group of monster-like demons.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>'It's just a dream,'</i> he thought.  <i>'A nightmare, a memory, and nothing more.

Yet he somehow already knew what was said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The captive gritted his teeth angrily, the booming, gravelly voice still quite clear in his throbbing head.  He did not know the speaker, but he recognized it immediately as the voice that had ridiculed him each day he had spent a captive, not only to the Germans but, in following decades, to his thoughts and memories, the gravelly, menacing voice that laughed at his pain, worsened his daily sufferings, and haunted his tormenting dreams.  It was the voice collectively embodying itself as those monsters that, as one, were the most unthinkably cruel villains, thieves, and murderers.</span></div></div>",

I know some of my family thinks it stupid to miss people that I've never known in real life. Let them, every night for the last four years these were the people that I gamed with and told my troubles to. They helped me out of my depressions and encouraged me to finish high school. With them I am me and I know they like me for being me, not for how I look.<br>\r\nIt's day right now and as I type this I wonder if they'll log on to night. <br>\r\nWill he get a new laptop soon?

Bitter and silent, I watch my classmates with their so-called 'friends', observing in sadness the petty arguments that tear their carefully crafted facades apart. 'But what do I care?'

The air tasted, smelled, and felt like having the most beautiful kind and loving person as a friend and companion. All the romance of my interactions with taking in breath and letting it out had a profound effect upon my sense of being alive.  The movie played before me with the colors smells and textures of trees, bushes gave me full sensory stimulation which made life well worth living to the fullest.  Moving was easy and carefree as if my contact with the earth, grasses, leaves, and other items which were on the ground transported me effortlessly.  This for a mountaineer is heaven.

I stood up knowing full well that after this minute me and God would have a little chat in Heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of the guns went of sounding kind of like an atom bomb dropped on an unsuspecting village. The bullets stung my skin sending me into a standing seizure the kind you have when pain grabs hold of you and squeezes. I fell to the floor eyes starting to cry I looked up at the wall where my blood splattered on it like some type of grotesque finger-painting. The last thing on my mind before it goes blank, the last thing in my heart before it explodes are three words. The three words said before I killed her and sent her to where she belongs; I love you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And if I didn't stray away from my night's objective, you'd still be at it.\"<br>\r\n\"She's beautiful.\"<br>\r\n\"You've told me that some one-thousand times now, so much so that I think I'm the crush of your life. You should tell her that.\" Chad sipped at his wine and looked back at his college friend that, undoubtedly, had helped him get out of college. Aaron was back at it again, lost in the unique and divine beauty that was Maria Fields, Aaron's college crush that had, of course, gone unapproached. Seeing that Aaron was at it again, Chad stepped to the left of his friend and snapped his fingers in his face. \"You have issues, man.\"<br>\r\nAaron blinked to signify that he was conscious of his staring. \"How so?\"<br>\r\n\"You've known of her for four years. Why not say something?\"<br>\r\nAaron's admiring was interrupted by the suggestion. \"Like what? I can't sat anything to her.\"<br>\r\n\"Why not? You act as if she's the President or something. Secret Service won't attack you if you ask a simple, 'Do I know you?'\" Chad explained, extending an innocent hand to the crowd of party goers.<br>\r\nAaron fought back. \"But what if she doesn't remember?\"<br>\r\n\"Then make her remember.\" Chad paused as the words left his mouth sounding a bit more aggressive than usual. \"On second thought, you likely wouldn't know how to do that.\" Aaron casually looked to his left and right before shrugging his shoulders.<br>\r\n\"No idea.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you know what women like?\"<br>\r\n\"Money?\"<br>\r\n\"N-.\" Chad stopped and considered the fact that there were indeed women that solely took advantage of people because of their wallet. \"Well...yes, but that wasn't the point. Women like two things: confidence-\"<br>\r\n\"-which I don't have.\"<br>\r\nChad paused and smiled again before swishing his wine around in his glass. \"Luckily for you, women like first impressions.\"<br>\r\n\"How do I do that?\"<br>\r\n\"I know just the thing.\" Aaron looked at his eight-year friend in nervousness as Chad's thick and mischievous smile rose on his face. It was that smile that Aaron grew to fear, but before he could protest, Chad gently patted his friend on the shoulder and walked into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron grew increasingly anxious the longer Chad and Maria stayed out of his sight. He searched the entire hotel lobby and the ballroom for either of them, but his search always turned out empty. It was this that tested his nerve even more and it was this that triggered his asthma. Aaron was a fragile kid, so fragile that Chad almost thought he killed the guy when he tackled him to the ground while playing football. It wasn't the tackle itself that almost killed Aaron (technically, Chad just ran him over with his huge size), but the asthma attack the occurred in response. Chad was a pre-med student at the time that they were in college and was roughly aware of CPR, but was he prepared to do so on a guy in front of his college team members. He contemplated letting Aaron die.<br>\r\nLong behold, a paramedic was on the scene within seconds of the collision as was able to revive Aaron with ease. After a few seconds of gasping for oxygen, that was when Aaron erupted  in a frantic, unintelligible, verbal rampage that few could understand. It was the birth a beautiful friendship, one that Chad knew he owed and what was expected, but he generally enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this, Chad was using this card again Aaron. From the balcony above, Chad watched his anxious friend down another glass of white wine before knowing that four glasses of Conte Priola was enough to sooth his friend and disable his guard.<br>\r\n\"You're up.\" He pressed send on his Blackberry and casually placed it back in his tuxedo's inner pocket. Below him, to his right, was a setup being put into play. Chad's ex-girlfriend, but good friend, Claire, located a suddenly mellow and soothed Aaron McCoy. Her iPhone buzzed once before she read the text and smiled as she looked up at Chad and shook her head. Before she could pull out her lipstick, her phone buzzed again.<br>\r\n\"Not too much.\"<br>\r\nShe giggled to herself and she put on her lipstick and typed her reply.<br>\r\n\"No promises.\"<br>\r\nChad watched from above as Claire quickly typed up her reply, sent it, and immediately engaged Aaron, walking directly toward him. His heart raced in excitement as he saw Claire tap him on the shoulder. Aaron stiffened in surprise, almost jumping in fright, and slowly turned around. He assumed Claire was telling Aaron something along the lines of, \"Very nice bow tie,\" \"What political party do you belong to?\" or, \"Do you like dogs?\" Generic chatter to just establish some sort of conversation. But before Aaron could disable any conversation, Claire went in.<br>\r\nAnd Aaron went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move! Move!\" Chad dashed down the stairs and towards the circle of people surrounding a collapsed Aaron McCoy. Chad's speed was no match for the cheap tuxedo that he rented and did not slow him as he pushed through he crowd and toward his friends.<br>\r\n\"Chad, you didn't-\" Claire started, resting Aaron's head on her lap and fanning him air. Chad's eyes widened as she spoke, signaling her to say no more. He was also nervous; Aaron wasn't breathing.<br>\r\nHe stared at a still Aaron. \"I thought he would hyperventilate?\" Claire glared at him. \"Uh...\" He began to look around the circle of concerned neighbors, business owners, and statesmen. \"Doctor? We need a doctor! Someone!\" No one moved, only looking around in confusion. \"There's not a single doctor in this building?!\"<br>\r\n\"Move!\"<br>\r\nWith almost-perfect timing, Maria Fields dashed into the circle and slide to a stop right above Aaron. She quickly knelt down, untied Aaron s bow tie, and ripped open his shirt<br>\r\n\"No, not the butt-\" Chad started and then silenced himself.<br>\r\nMaria placed her left ear against his chest. \"He's not breathing.\"<br>\r\n\"No shit!\" Chad covered his mouth as the words bellowed out of his mouth; he was scared that he may have indirectly killed his friend. Claire glared at Chad again, but Maria ignored him.<br>\r\n\"Someone call an ambulance if you haven't already. I'm going to try to bring him back.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're not-\" Before Chad could even finish, Maria opened Aaron's mouth, plugged his nose, and placed her mouth on his and attempted to resuscitate him. But as soon as her lips met his, Aaron's eyes opened.<br>\r\nChad covered his ears.<br>\r\n\"AGH!\" He quickly crawled to his side and stared at a confused and just-as-surprised Maria Fields. He breathing was rapid, but his asthma was not trigger. Aaron's face was red from lack of oxygen and heat, but he showed no signs of anxiety.<br>\r\nHe froze.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Maria broke the silence with an honest question, perplexed by Aaron's silence and stillness. As if on cue, Aaron blinked before crawling to Maria and going in. Claire looked at Chad in shock and Chad returned a confused look. But instead of denial or immediate rejection, Maria did not attempt to flee and, instead, grabbed onto Aaron and held the kiss even longer.<br>\r\n\"What the fu-\" Claire interrupted Chad's comment with a gentle slap to the cheek.<br>\r\n\"It's a lasting impression; let it be.\" Chad spared Claire a glare and then turned to see Aaron and his dream girl still making out in the middle of a circle of previously concerned citizens.<br>\r\n\"Seven seconds and they still aren't even...\" Chad gave up and gently started to clap. The rest of the crowd eventually joined.</span></div></div>",

He has emotional problems of which I would be considerate towards if he weren't also such an arrogant ass.  He needs to have followers and he finds them amongst the newly hired.  Soon enough though, people see that his power ends at the tip of his lips.  He sits in his office doing online searches of his name, talks with his mouth full and it most always is.  He highlights words in his 99 cent store thesaurus and uses them when making his doctor appointments so as to impress the receptionists.  He is a hypochondriac to be certain and his office always smells of disinfectant and I try as little as possible to be in that room much less touch any document he passes my way.  I smoke most days because of him.  <br>\r\nWell, seems the gift isn't in my right pocket.  </span></div></div>",

Why do we not see pictures in the blackness of space's vacuum and name those, as well?  Are we so close-minded as to not be able to see what is in front of our faces?

It was called Pudding Island because that's what it looked like when you viewed it from the high road on the peninsula. From the low road on the peninsula you could walk across to it when the tide was out. Of course if you stayed too long and the tide came in you had to make sure you had brought with you something to eat, drink and perhaps a tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never stayed at Pudding Island over night but a friend and I often stayed until the tide went out again.

The ferry named Wahine went down with a boat load of people, cars and goods on the Easter weekend of 1968 in a terrible storm, high seas and fog. The pilot had the boat headed for rocks instead of the shore and th Harbour Master couldn\u2019t see the Ferry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were 610 passengers and 123 crew aboard. 53 people died but many others were saved as people with small boats headed out into the stormy seas to rescue the survivors. Some people made it to shore on pieces of wreckage or by swimming but who would have thought that when they boarded the Wahine at Lyttleton Harbour the boat would smash into rocks at the entrance to Wellington harbour and 53 would not make it to shore alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA life on the sea is not for me!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Twenty foot waves rocked the boat, and lightning threatened to strike our mainmast.

If our heart doesn't work as it should we slow down and get weak and deteriorate, if it's not fixed then it is inevitable death. Take our brain, we have been given a brain to use to the best of our ability. If we don't learn as we grow and take in the correct knowledge, or dis-regard the correct knowledge that is offered and go our own way, for instance. How to manage money; how to clean a house or wash and iron our clothes, looking after our teeth, personal hygiene, Training our children in the way that they should behave in the world. How to be good and treat our neighbors as we would like to be treated ourselves. <br>\r\nEvery small detail, every good or wrong in life has to have a consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's go back to our world, our planet, spinning around in the space given to it in the infinity of creation.

If no wrong, or suffering, ever came to an individual, would she or he ever fully grasp what Jesus actually showed in his human life on earth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is hard to say Jesus was selfish in forgiving humans all their sins; but He wanted us back \"walking with God\" as Adam and Eve had done, before the Fall, in the cool of the evenings. We could never meet the standards of perfection. Or even TEN commandments or rules. Jesus had to be human to die like us, to sin, though he was tempted like us in every way. Even the devil tested Jesus in the desert as Jesus fasted and prayed before beginning His ministry of teaching and healing. Each time, Jesus forewent all the enticements of this world (controlled by Satan, since Adam and Eve gave up \"dominion\" by sinning).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, every nightmare - of hell - and every good dream, tell us we are receiving messages that seek reconciliation. I can forgive without asking the perpetrator permission. Most great dreams begin inside the individual. Did society encourage Einstein, or Mark Twain, or Abraham Lincoln. I believe the Spirit of God deposited inside of us, beckons toward His Plan of Reconciliation. Only the lateral thinkers can agree with this Plan. Naturally, we love having the power we get by holding grudges, or waiting for revenge. \"Vengeance is Mine,\" says the LORD. Even Gandhi - an average student and lawyer - was a lateral thinker who noted, \"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth will make the whole world blind and toothless.\" As we see in the Middle East, there is no end to revenge, be it for honor, or avenging the previous battle, conflict, or war!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many people talk of wanting peace in the world. Again, it has to be selfish to be meaningful. What do I mean? You can hope for peace in the world, when you hate your brother, or sister, or parent - never wanting to forgive their mistakes, ignorant errors, or their deliberate cruelty. If no wrong was ever done to us, we would know goodness and forgiveness only as a distant star. But investing in peace-making at home, will snowball into the community, society, nation, and the globe. I am not surprised that soldiers who kill in the Middle East sometimes kill family members when they return. Call it PTSD, or anything. We must be selfish: forgive ourselves and others! Self-condemnation is a horrible virus, that goes on infecting all of life, everywhere. STOP IT INSIDE YOU! By forgiveness, the only sure-fire medicine and cure. Try it ... most of us have not. Yes, it is a very selfish act: forgive yourself for not having been perfect (God knows it; that's why He sent Jesus to do all things well for His followers). Don't stop with self-forgiveness: keep expanding the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to join Nelson Mandela and forgive my horrible, semi-fascist government in South Africa. I was not excited about joining Mandela. We had good grounds to take leaders to the Hague, to face justice and jail-time. But Mandela was wise to know HEALING of a nation cannot come from the courts. He admitted he did not want to let the whites off so easily; but the nation needs ALL its resources, especially the human beings! Are you wiser than Mandela, Gandhi, and Lincoln? Are you seriously concerned about global peace? Then forgive your neighbor, your imperfect parents, even the abuser ... we have so many role models. Otherwise spare me the easy talk about loving people and wanting to save the planet! The planet and God wants you to start by saving yourself from hate and hell. Blessings.</span></div></div>",

What if they don't deserve it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he sits, smug and spectacular, with a coffee in hand, as if he hasn't realised that I'm here too. I know he has because that's what the smirk is for. He is very obviously not looking in this direction. Did he come in because he'd seen me through the window? I am sitting right next to it, though I hadn't seen him in time to get up and go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether for over five years, our relationship had become dry and brittle and easily broken. I took a week-long trip abroad. After I returned to find the house a mess, I started cleaning and was putting things away in his bedside cabinet when I found a lip-gloss from a brand I'd never even heard of let alone purchased. Whose is that? I wondered, taking it out. I didn't think much of it - he picked up some colleagues who lived local before heading to work on a morning and one of them was a lady. Maybe she'd dropped it and he'd assumed it was mine and brought it home? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I found a certain item of ladies' clothing that had not been mine when cleaning around the bed. That definitely rang some alarm bells. I confronted him with it. He paused a moment, looking from the garment dangling from the tips of my fingers to my face. \"Well,\" he began at last, \"we...uh...had a party at work. I must have got drunk. I...I don't...I just assumed that this girl was...you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pathetic excuse had me screaming the house down. The house was his so I packed up my things, though it would have been so much more satisfying if he'd left. The bastard. He kept pleading with me not to go but I was so angry. Was it Rachel? I asked, referring to the lady he took to work. Was it Libby? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still remember slamming the door shut as he continued to plead. I wish I'd slammed it harder, broken it off its hinges. And then thrown it at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present, he has stood.  I sit up a bit straighter, turn my attention to my phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he comes up to you, how would you want to be treated right now? I thought. Do you want him to beg you to take him back? Is that what you want? Do you want him to sweep you off your feet again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scowl at my phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering what you were looking at,\" a voice says nearby, \"you seemed so angry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my face redden and quickly put the blank phone down screen-first. \"What do you want?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I don't even deserve a \"hi, how are you?\" anymore?\" He casually pulls out the chair opposite me and sits down. He smiles. It's a smile that would have left me a gooey puddle on the floor, once upon a time. He has a youthful face and a dimple in his cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try not to look at him. What do you want? I asked myself. You're pleased he's come to sit with you. You're not as angry as you thought you were. What do you want? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile fades away when I say nothing. \"Look, I know you don't like me but...won't you at least forgive me? If you were in my position, wouldn't you want me to forgive you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, very nice,\" I hiss. \"All right, you wanna switch places? Ok, so you come home from a holiday and find another man's things scattered across the bedroom. What would you do? Sit there and tell me \"Oh, it's all right. These things happen\"? Well they don't! They're done very deliberately! I leave for a week and come back to find that you'd allowed another woman in my place?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes a deep breath and lets it out. \"I'm sorry, okay? I made a mistake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has attempted to speak with me a few times since I left and every time, I could not contain myself. But I have been thinking about it. About forgiveness. Do I forgive? Do I want to forgive him? Clearly, I do. Some traitorous part of me wants to be with him again. But then what? Peace, perhaps? The ability to move on with life? Or would I really get back together? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like a sad song the sun insisted on setting... I wondered again, for perhaps the hundredth time; \"{Why does it bother, always the same?\" I meant the sun of course, in those days I thought it made a difference. I thought I made a difference! \"<i>Was it ten years ago?</i>\"  \"<i>No A hundred!</i> I decided, and with that  I continued to reminisce about my first days. I had been out of the military for some time, so that was no longer an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I was lying in my special day bed thinking about how I'd made it. It had to be, some, story, but was now the time? This of course was an important question to me, as my success was so long in coming. At least I had no doubts about that. Time was everything, whatever else is said about the enemy, it was certain that, indeed, time was everything. That was why I was reminiscing, or maybe daydreaming about my, \"Great overcoming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I'd walked away that evening from more than a sunset, indeed, I was walking away from any number of ignorant beliefs, schools of thought, lists of drugs, and their requisite trips... I was walking away from a delusion; \"The life delusion.\" It was already not necessary to consider the others that had walked before myself, nor was it any longer a care as to the ones whom would not succeed. The revelation, or perhaps awakening did not come to the accompaniment of any trumpets, fanfare, ticker-tape parade, or even champagne bash. It was not any sudden plum into the depths of some unknown genius, there was not a drum-roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n To this day I am not satisfied for a justification as to why none of the above was, or was not appropriate. There was no special secret divulged, no \"in,\" vouchsafed me. Just the same disgust with the worlds incomprehensible willingness to fail in my stead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the years that would come to pass, for a time I had missed a thing here, and an event there that could be experienced no more. That too finally faded into obscurity. You could say that as I became calm, not complacent, I eventually did find myself occupying a world that you might describe as a dream, but no dream of any note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I soon found that there had once been a time of steamships, and airships, as in dirigibles. Without any pomp, and circumstance I was introduced to the well to do, and realized that people generally mix naturally with that which they often deny. It was not an earthshaking news-flash to find that all that was wrong with the world had been instrumented intentionally. Though it was of course a better thing to know, and separate myself finally from whatever vestiges of ignorance had kept me losing. Inarguable the fact I must be away from the wrong doers, still no answers were here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still that's why although far from the madness it was yet the work of investigating the one overall mystery. How and why was it so long a process? So painful. This question continued to plague my peace of mind, I would have answers. I did have some insight, in that I had learned that the depths of ignorance knew no limits, that the reach of deceit was crushing. The dream quality did not come unfounded either, verily the foolishness of magic is far more consuming, and encompassing than the average person could ever comprehend. Indeed, it reaches its depth, and fullness of destruction in the name of society. Under that heading drugs are introduced, then justified, once it comes to justification all is lost as regards society. From that point on it is but a matter of time before the wolves die off, and then those sheep that have milked the Earth bare for their conceit, die off. Who\u2019s left; owns the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So in some sense as I lie in my special day bed, I am something like, taking assessment of my world. No I don't have any illusions of creating a new world, or even seeing one come to be. If it is to be, it will happen of its own doing. It may repeat the whole nightmare again for that matter, you know that it does not matter, you go on every day facing things that cause the most staid, and thoughtless to shudder in the depths of their sleep. Yet you barely notice the thunderous tsunami of ignorance, or its necessary destructive end, only certain that you can do nothing about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mystery ensues, however, and we can not truly rest until we know, after all if you let the parasite continue its reign unchecked there would never have been any solidity. What we in the know call reality. Do you think for one second that the pathology of the delusion is not hounded down, controlled, is left at all free, for even a second? Go not under such a misconception, for you the bell tolls, and while their at it, the Gods may serve the wine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This entire delusion, as destructive as it is, does not even touch on my reality. So again, it was necessary to get away from it all, it is all one, extra, large distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The rest is profane, by what \"Authority\" do they commit this crime?\" You say, and with that, give them \"Bread and circuses.\" You would not waste an instant of your existence considering this, yet you count on it, and expect just enough of the world to fall victim, that society must rise and fall, and with it the pain.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dirty, dingy walls breeding who knows how many species of mold offer the tiniest bit of protection from the outside world and I welcome their meager comfort.

Their training still courses through my veins like poison, boiling my blood, making me itchy and uncomfortable until I can no longer stand it.  The anger triggers it, memories of  wrongdoings, mine and others against me, come bubbing up and like the taut wire of a warrior's bow I snap.

The man approached me, and I could see his skin sliding from his face, the bone from his jaw extending through what was remaining of his skin. The next thing I realized, is that this man was not a man at all, and his teeth had sunk into my chilled flesh. It was a sensation much like a child biting your finger when they are young and unaware of the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tore away, and ran home. I laid there with my thoughts all evening, fell asleep for mere hours and awoken, feeling the pain in my chest first. Then finding that my skin itched, and my heartbeat was slowing.

Sitting here, drowning in my eternal solitude, I hope for reprieve; a copper lantern to light my path back to normality, but I know just how fruitless <i>wishes</i> are; I know nothing ever changes and that this state of inert existence will be mine forever. Each breath I take feels as if it should be my last, but death will never knock at <i>my</i> door.

I'll soon know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the light begins to fade away, and I see a shadow creeping closer, sneaking through the twilight. Smiling through the rain, I greet my other half, glad to see it skulking ever closer. <i>We've put this off for so long\"</i> I murmer, feeling myself being drawn into the sweet embrace of my destiny, knowing I'm free to leave the stage. We finally collide, and I melt into the warm silence of my death.</span></div></div>",

I figure this Genie is gonna get we with the first wish. I might not ever have to work again but then I might be broke, and end up starving on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for my third wish I say I want everything I touch to turn to gold. After all, no matter what else happens, gold is always worth a lot of money, right?<br>\r\nThe genie says \"Done!\" Then he vanishes, along with the lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I start touching things. My old guitar that I could've pawned for fifty bucks is now worth at least fifty grand as gold, right? <br>\r\nThis solid gold kitchen table with matching chairs are probably worth more than I make in five years!<br>\r\nThen I get thirsty and go to the fridge and grab a beer, that's when I realize why that damn genie was laughin' as he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, my drinkin' days are over, Steve. My eating days too. Soon to be followed by my living days, I expect. I want you to have all this gold stuff when I'm gone, somebody ought to get something good out of this. I'd shake hands on the deal, but I don't think that would do you much good...</span></div></div>",

OK, I'll see what I can do to end this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rubbed the lamp. Of course the genie appeared, gave me the three wish line, and waited for me to make a fool of myself. I didn't have an agenda, and I knew how tricky these genies could be. So I didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The genie said, \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \"Are you in a hurry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie grimaced. \"You're supposed to wish for something. It's in the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" I said. \"Aren't I the one in charge here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie became cranky. \"Everybody wants something. Just tell me, so we can move this along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens if I don't wish for something? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" the genie growled, \"I can't stay out more than an hour without granting a wish, or else I lose my powers and get thrown out of the genies guild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh,\" I said with false concern,\"That would be terrible.\" I then just stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went on like this for about fifty-five minutes. The genie got desperate. \"OK, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \" I'm not going to make any wishes, but what you're going to do is undo all the mischief you did to this guy who's starving to death and all of the other fools you've let trick themselves with their greed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie started wailing. \"Come on man I can't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" I told him as I started walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing I knew, the starving guy was hopping around yelping with joy. \"I'm free,\" he hollered. He rushed over and hugged me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie chuckled as the wise guy with the lamp turned to gold. \"Genies always find a way to outsmart these idiots,\" he said as he disappeared into the lamp. </span></div></div>",

With my eyes closed, I could almost smell mom's home-made blue berry pie, or grandmother's blue ribbon winning apple pie.  Of all of the things that I should be thinking about after realizing I had come to the end, had decided that there was nothing else to be done, I sat there thinking, wishing for, pie, my favorite thing to eat.  I always felt better after eating pie.  Maybe this was just another time that I would feel better, after all, I was thinking, wishing, almost tasting it, I like pie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud noise, a loud scary noise, then, everything seemed to change.  It was cloudy, misty, I was not on the rock anymore, but in a strange bed in a strange place.  Something had changed for me.  I felt different.  No pain, no fear.  I was different, but there was still one thing in my mind, something I was totally aware of, something that I knew for a fact.  I like pie! </span></div></div>",

I feel my body again and prop myself up to see a gurgling stream and a green valley with fields running on to the horizon.  I sit up and listen.

Then, when finished, my gaze returns to those dear, precious angels and their striking, distinct personalities.  The one on the left stands tall with a statuesque grace, hair flowing about her smiling, gentle features.  On the right, the angel stands not quite so tall, slightly stooped as he offers to those below the fruitful bounty he carries in his strong, comforting arms for those too weak to attain it for themselves.  I watch their frozen forms from my lowly pew, staring at their cozy home on the wall beside the symbol of Jesus's sacrifice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rather, it <i>was</i> their home.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now, the wings are no longer there, their shadows no longer cast upon the peeling wallpaper.  No more does the angel on the left stand guard and watch, nor does the one on the right spread for all the world small blessings of heaven like occasional raindrops upon the lush greenness of the Pacific Northwest that lies beyond the walls of our little church.  Instead, it is just the cross that is comfortably nestled in the freshly-painted alcoves.  And no longer do I stare at that cozy alcove from my pew, for there are no more pews of which to speak.  The Angel of Protection and Angel of Blessing, the two that kept company the now solitary golden cross, are no more there, for their graceful silhouettes are buried under a layer of brown paint over the peeling paper.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once, I was the only one to see the gentle angels hidden in the wallpaper of the sanctuary, enjoying the soothing comfort they brought me.

I'll come back with more coins.\" He coughed heavily and then nodded his head. \"Go and get some dinner okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt bad, leaving him there alone but I was off to my night-job and couldn't take him with me.

Witnesses said he pulled the young man out of his house in broad daylight screaming, \" I told you to stay away from me,  I warned you,\" while stabbing his uncomprehending and now dead, victum, long after the poor young man's lifeless eyes glazed over.  The occupant was no longer in residence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The word if and saying, I wish, fit into the hindsight is 20-20 category.

Looking from side to side there was nothing but trees. I started to worry. What was I going to do? There was a large snap as I heard a tree fall somewhere off in the distance. I started to run that way. Maybe I could crouch by it, maybe it was hollow, maybe anything. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ran towards where I thought I heard the tree fall and found nothing.

I must have twisted it. Standing up I looked around and started to act quickly. I gathered some brush and branches to make a small roof for my hole. I would stand in the water and mud and hope for the storm to pass quickly.</span></div></div>",

When I was in school, compliments for winning the spelling bee and pulling off a perfect rendition of Fur Elise made no sense to me. Why were my classmates complimenting me on something I could do in my sleep? Hell, my mother still tells the story of when I recited spelling words in my sleep throughout much of fourth grade. For the most part, I'm glad I don't remember doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis path of perfection made me bored in middle school. For the first time, I started to see chinks in the armor. I still maintained a 4.0 while managing nine hours of sleep every night, but I started mouthing off at the teachers. Things came to a head when I got into an argument with Mrs. Rowell over whether or not to use a common before \"and\" when listing various nouns in a sentence. For the first time, I was punished. I actually felt something, and it wasn't pleasant. With my IQ tests off the charts, the school counselor recommended that I attend Exeter Academy. My parents moved mountains to pay my tuition, a move that reaped rewards when I got my scholarship to Harvard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during my time at Harvard that my mind's non-processing of positive behavior was demystified. I saw an ad in The Crimson looking for volunteers for a psychology department study. Despite being a business major, I decided to dabble in the arts and letters school for kicks and giggles. The lark soon turned serious as someone my age showed up to begin the first battery of questions. Simon was his name. After asking the standard questions meant to suss out the schizophrenics from the ADHD suffers, he mentioned something called atypical autism. I gave him a look that must have reflected pure denial because he gave me a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are definitely not like anyone else around here,\" he said. \"When I called you in, I saw five guys ogling your backside, but you paid them no mind. That's...almost impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a bad thing?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you can decide that, but one thing's for sure. You push everyone out before they have a chance to get in. Do you want that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"Doesn't make any difference to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Simon slammed down his pen and ran his hand through an impressive mop of brown hair. \"Didn't think so. You are not qualified for this study. Go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left and didn't return to the psychology department for the rest of the year. Even so, I did some research on atypical autism, which illuminated a lot of my past behavior and shifting my world view almost exactly 180 degrees. The material I learned in my business classes came through with an almost disturbing clarity and I discovered why I could analyze everything so quickly and with an assertiveness that frightened half of my professors. I was actually dismissed from one of those classes mid-session the following autumn. When I arrived at my residence hall, I found Simon standing by the door as if he was waiting for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like you took my remark seriously,\" he said. \"I'm glad to see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and gave him a small smile. \"I did. So what brings you over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came over because I owe you an apology about the study last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you said I wasn't qualified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Simon fidgeted. \"It's a lot more complicated than that. Come on. Let's go inside and get something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe guided me inside by the elbow, and I knew better than to resist. As we walked to the dining hall, his gentle grasp never wavered, and I suddenly knew everything he came this far to say without him having to utter a single word.</span></div></div>",

But in order to create what it is that I actually want, I need to figure out what it is. Am I grasping at power? No, though I wouldn't mind it. Do I want to know what all there is in the world, hoping that I'll find myself? Surely not, as not even I would know what to do with that much knowledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps I know what I'm doing, even as I dance around it. Maybe I don't want to drag my intentions into the light, because that makes them real. And if they're real, then failing at completing them becomes real. Yet, even as I try to push it away, it creeps around me and the truth shows itself: I'm seeking love in reality. Not just any reality, mind you, but the one I live in. I want the fantasy love I've always dreamed of, where my partner and I are best friends, where we tell each other everything even though we don't have to because we already know it. I don't want to be afraid anymore. I don't want to be afraid of waking up in the morning alone, even though there was someone there last night. I don't want to be afraid of being happy for so long, only to have it crushed by one little thing. I'm seeking a love that is truly everlasting, a love that sprouts happiness and security like Eden produced fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm wondering where fantasy and reality intersect and how I can get there. I want to know what it feels like for those two worlds to mesh together perfectly, with no gaps or spaces or holes between them. I've been told all my life that there is someone for everyone, spoon fed this belief by culture, had this belief ingrained into my mind by society. It has to be true, doesn't it? Love has to be real, it has to exist not only in a perfect world, but in this one. In my world, however small or large it may come to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I want, all that I'm asking for, is the impossible. I'm seeking love in reality, a love that is so real it's almost tangible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease, make me feel it. I'm counting on you.</span></div></div>",

Around him, the bodies of his fallen comrades lie, shattered by the deadly rain that struck them down with unerring accuracy. Somewhere in the distance, the rebels torch another building, paying no attention to the pleading of a woman who has seen her sons go to war and never return. \"My Jono fought for you\" she screams, trying to escape her burning home, and cries as the commander cuts her down with his machete. The soldier sighs, knowing the woman could have been his neighbor, or the teacher who taught his children, or the nurse who cured his malaria. She could have been anyone, but still the young rebel killed her, just because she was on the wrong side of this so-called 'civil war'. <i>Such ignorance...</i>he thinks. Shouldering his rifle, the soldier enters the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing his head to his superiors, the teenage rebel tries to hide his unbidden tears. The lady he has just watched die was one of his own, yet there she lies, her head split in two. <i>I never wanted this</i>... the boy thinks, wishing he was dreaming. The bomb-scarred, bullet-pocked landscape looks just like one of his nightmares. Seeing his clumsily hidden distress, an older man pulls him aside. \"Harden up, lad\" he says, speaking with his eyes on the ditch ahead. \"We're fighting for freedom; sure there's gonna be a few casualties on the way. You gotta learn to forget the things you see; it ain't no good gettin' all weepy over it, you know?. You'll get used to it, you'll see\". Smiling through the blurry veil of tears, the boy thanks the veteran and beats a hasty retreat. From the ditch the rebels can hear a man loading up his weapon; it is the only sound to be heard in the strangely quiet landscape. The commander nods at the veteran and the lad; <i>you two take this one</i> his eyes say. \"Lock and load, boy\" the veteran grunts, and the teenager shoves another round into his gun. Nervous and fearful, the two rebels start off towards the ditch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So many die in the name of justice and freedom; it makes me wonder how we can justify it all. The people who declare war on other countries aren't necessarily the ones who fight it, and more and more fall victim to the failed schemers with wounded egos who decide that conflict is the only path to peace. The irony of such a solution is that with conflict removed from an area, the resulting non-aggressive neutrality could quite often be called 'peace'. It seems we live in a mad, bad world after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wore a short jacket and no gloves, inadequate for the sudden turn of cold, windy weather.  She stood within the bus-stop booth not wishing to sit on the icy cold bench. Meridith gave up a silent wish for the bus to be on time this afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man stepped into the shelter of the bus stop dressed warmly in a long wool coat and scarf. He carried an expensive leather bound brief case with a key lock. Meridith looked enviously at his hands and the lined leather gloves protecting them. He nodded his head tipping the brim of his felt hat and smiled. Meridith smiled as a reflex then turned away to peer down the street, looking for the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes several other men and women came to huddle within the scant shelter afforded by the bus stop. Meredith welcomed the crammed bodies. She no longer felt the cut of the icy wind on her bare legs and hands. Her feet however still ached with the cold. She promised herself she would never find herself in the cold without a change of sensible shoes, again. The low heels were killing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the sound of a bell. Meridith looked over the shoulder of a young woman and spied a sight she had no experience to describe. A young man dressed in khaki wool cap, wool pants, heavy wool coat, cloth gloves with his fingers exposed, and black polished boots walked toward the bus stop pushing a small steaming cart. The bell was attached to the handle and jangled with every crack, stone and twig the cart rolled over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the bus stop watched the young man as he stopped and opened up the top of the cart. He silently counted heads and then started handing out hot coffees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeridith reached into her purse to take out a few dollars before taking the coffee offered her, but he young man shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and pressed the hot paper cup into her icy hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank-you.\" She managed to croak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the young man shook his head and shrugged as if what he did was as natural as breathing. Everyone in the bus stop offered their appreciation for the gift of hot coffee on a very cold day and watched as the young man silently closed up his cart and walked around the corner, presumably heading for the bus stop on the next avenue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My word.\" breathed Meridith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, indeed.\" Agreed a young woman next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone either spoke in double word confirmation or simply nodded their heads. Then as one the group with the only things they had in common was the bus stop, the cold and a cup of hot coffee lifted their steaming cups and sipped the warming brew. Smiles followed, if not conversation for at that moment the bus chose to arrive.</span></div></div>",

For so long, I had waited, knowing that eventually you would return and try to draw me out with your apologies that you whispered in my ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandbags piled high, I knew they wouldn't be enough to hold back your thick, black waters. As I peeked from behind the curtain, I could see the river, thick as molasses, headed straight to my front door. Who gave me away? Who fell for your charming, honey-baked words and led you to my lair, even though I had begged them not to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI boarded up the doors with wood I had left over from the mantelpiece I carved all by myself. It's funny to think of the things I can do without you here to criticise my every move. Whoever would have thought I could make a fire, upholster a chair, live? But I can, and I do. Without you glued to my back with your sledgehammer and fists, I have freedom for the first time in my life. Freedom, you hear that? I can do what I want. My life belongs to me, not you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I boarded up the doors, knocking the nails into place. Red-faced and terrified, I stood, steeling myself for the storm when it hit. The rumbling had begun a week ago, when the letter dropped onto my mat. The postmark from the prison where you had sat for eighteen short months signalled a change in the weather. It had been temperate, warm for the time of year. I was still wearing tee shirts; yet to change to long sleeves. But then the letter arrived, and a chill set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started in my spine and branched out with its fingers to all of my extremities. The words jumbled in front of my eyes. I had to be getting it wrong. But I phoned to speak to my case worker and the tone of her voice was like hail raining down on me. <i>Good behaviour</i>, she said. <i>A model inmate</i>. \"Oh,\" I replied. \"Is that in the same way as he was a model employee who couldn't possibly have hurt his wife? Or, maybe, in the same way as he was a model son, trying his best to deal with a crazy wife? Or, maybe, just maybe, it's in the same way as he was a model husband?\" The wind left her lungs in a puff of pity as she assured me there was a restraining order. Which, from what I could tell, meant he had been told where I live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, to the barricades. I knew he was coming. The ground was grumbling, and the trees were swaying. I boarded my doors and waited for the storm to hit me. One week. That's all it took for him to pass through my town and leave his trail of destruction. Perhaps I should have stayed with my family until the storm had died down. But I couldn't leave. I had to face him one final time. But I wasn't going to make it easy for him. He would have to fight his way in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The color was a chocolate raspberry, a color that made me happy and each brush stoke was done with care. The day was gorgeous and I had opted to do my chore under a huge elm in the back yard.  I spent my day painting and humming and praying and thinking. Sixteen boards were about to get a second coat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first I heard the sweet cooing song and then I heard an answer, a different voice in a different direction.  I looked around to see if I could spot the lovely couple, but they were nowhere in sight. Painting, painting. Again, he called to her and she answered and for a long time I was serenaded with the love calls.  Painting, painting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming quietly to myself and enjoying the sunshine, suddenly I realized there was only one voice.  I scanned the nearby trees and telephone wires and then quite unexpectedly there was a flutter in my peripheral vision.  There on the fence, not 10 feet from where I stood, was Mr. Dove.  I've never had a conversation with a bird, but today it seemed a very appropriate thing to do.  He sat there cooing and then I would answer.  I didn't coo; I spoke English.  He must have liked it because he stayed about 20 minutes, the two of us having a wonderful conversation of cooing and English and cooing and humming and cooing and painting, painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boards are painted and the tenants have moved in.  Autumn has arrived and I haven't seen Mr. Dove since that summer afternoon.  He gave me quite and unexpected gift, one I shall treasure.

It was an ordinary dull day when it had been finished, there was a light breeze teasing the trees into batting it's limbs at it. The sun wasn't visible, but it was by no means a sad day, there were shouts coming from the nearest park, shouts of children that picked up the spirits of all who walked by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirens blared in the distance now.

Nice to meet you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me Darren, what made you decide to come here today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve both been into VR for a long time now, I mean, why go through the inconvenience of flying and staying in hotels when you can experience traveling anywhere in the world from the comfort of your home at the flick of a switch, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo true, Darren. And if you think about it, we started down this path a long time ago. Even back in your grandparents days, most people decided it was better to watch the game on their 65\u201d Samsung than it was to go to a stadium and fight the crowds. VR was just the next step, and this is the final one. So, are you two ready to make the leap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite, Tom. Darren and I have a few questions first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Mrs Baxter. I\u2019ll be glad to address any concerns you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, what if we decide we really don\u2019t like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, the process can be reversed at any time within the first thirty days.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about after thirty days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter that, the physiological and psychological changes you will incur make it difficult if not impossible to leave. I will say that we have very high retention rate though, only .01% people actually decide to leave within the first thirty days, and I have not heard of anyone wishing to leave after that since I\u2019ve been here. Any other questions? Darren?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, can we go see where the long term residents stay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately no, due to personal privacy concerns. But you will be able to speak to them, once you are inside. Anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I guess I\u2019m satisfied. How about you Sandy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m good. Let\u2019s do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK then. You two just follow Annie to your docking station, and before you know it she'll have you hooked up and you\u2019ll be enjoying your amazing new virtual life!

There have been days when I have indeed done such a thing and the effects are strange, like mild visual distortions or a flash of illogical fears.  So naturally I thought that I had over medicated when I saw a grandma carrying a jar of eyeballs down the adjacent apartment alley way.  The alley way was only used for one thing and that was to deposit garbage in the bins located at the end.  She slowly walked down the brick walkway and lifted the black dumpster lid, carefully placing the jar deep down in the bin, turned and walked back towards the street. <br>\r\nHonestly!  The jar looked like it was filled with eyeballs.  Whitish balls, each one with a circle of color in the middle.  Natural colors, with a dot of black in the middle of each and so what else on earth looked like this?  Only eyeballs.  There was no questioning it first off.  They were eyeballs and she was transporting a jar of them.. to the trash.  Was there a clinic nearby?  If so, and if she worked for that clinic, wouldn't there be a proper way to dispose of such things?  Wouldn't she be dressed more medically appropriate rather than the rounded floor length skirt, peasant shirt and apron?  I couldn't honestly say that she was indeed a grandma but she certainly fit the stereotype.  And as I recall, she herself was wearing the thickest pair of spectacles I have seen to date.  Something was wrong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to follow her, making mental note of the number on the trash bin (3 out of 13) at it's location.  She took a left out of the alley and walked 4 blocks south.  The door she opened without a key was not that of a clinic but seemingly of a residence.  As she opened the door she brushed her feet on the mat, stepped in and started to shut the door behind her.  Well, at first, she did shut it but then she opened it again and left it cracked open.  I stood there, across the street mind you, watching that front door, wondering who she had left it cracked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly I saw for whom she had left the door open for. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn't doubt for a minute that it was that granny.  Yet the cat walked in willingly and the granny, just before she locked her eyes to mine, looked down with such tenderness toward the returning feline that surely she was cruel to this animal.  Perhaps she was a safe refuge for this cat and others like it.  Perhaps she was the ultimate nurturer for such crazy fates.. such as sewn eyelids!  Who was I to judge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, guess what?

It was dim and there was a faint breeze coming from inside and it smelled like lavender.  Oddly drawn to this I came closer to the crack and said \"May I see the cat?\".  No answer.  As my eyes got adjusted to the dimness I focused in on a rocking chair.  A pillow upon the chair held the cat with the sewn eyelids but this time the cat had his eyes wide open.  Although this could've been any other cat I was so certain it was the exact same cat.  I made the little noises I tend to make when trying to get the attention of animals.  Something like a \"tsk\" and a clicking with my tongue.  The cat was staring straight at me, and I kid you not, he <b>rolled</b> his eyes!  What nerve!  I was speechless at the sight and I furrowed my brow.  Stupid uppity cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, don't mind him please.  He has no social skills to speak of.\" Granny stated as she came into view.  She a smile on her face and as she leaned over to pet the cat, he rolled his massively round and green eyes again and looked directly at me.  \"Would you like to come in?\" Granny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though I am naturally curious,<br>\r\nit has never been a prime motivating factor, compelling me to alter or make my decision on<br>\r\nthe basis of satisfying it's hungar.  It can't be satisfyed or at least my beasts!  What is the word?  <br>\r\nInsatiable!  <br>\r\n     How does one turn curiosity off?  If a question is answered another mystery takes it's place!<br>\r\nIt's like those old Carosel slide projecters.  The colored slides were placed in a round cannister like a Thompson Machine Gun's (Tommy Gun) ammunition position. I used to set a full carosel, fifty photos,<br>\r\nand end up going around and around until the hypnotic effect of the light, the material I was viewing and the cadence repetitions.  Now that I think of it, that may have subliminaly established or created a revolving<br>\r\ndoor allowing curiosity free rein to operate like breathing and our heart beating.  <br>\r\n     Curiosity, like some women can be caty and crafty, even round-about and misdirection if necessary to finish the race.  I like that! That's probably why curiousity sits in the back seat and surfing, sailing, scuba and free diving, fishing, spinnaker flying, even walking on the beach sand are priorities.  While in the operation of these reasons for living, curiousity is like a kid in a candy store, almost tearing himself apart as he tries to <br>\r\ngo the four opposing points on a compass simultaneously! Then, almost shuts down from the sensory overlord.<br>\r\n     We both know that was all me.  I file things on a shelf.  (in my head)  Two deep breaths I'm myself again. Back on the bridge, retaking the helm, driving the vessel  with my crew, going anywhere I want to.  <br>\r\n     The actual baited hook, I didn't see at first.  The chum brought me to the trap and had I not been so inside myself working on a solution to a problem I had never encountered before, it wouldn't have worked.  I wanted to buy all the eyes she could get her hands on but for the life of me had never known anyone who had them for sail. <br>\r\n     To be frank, it is only two weeks ago an oriental buddy of mine from Pendleton: went to Nam together Bumped into each other at the Apothecaries Shop near the pier. Hadn't seen him for a year.  While catching up he dropped the eye bomb!  Boom! I didn't bat an eye or even ask him why he needed eyes, human eyes! While he was explaining his very weird request he mentioned what the opthmologist was paying. While saying our Aloha's I assured Kim Chee that I would do my best but not to hold his breath as it was unexplored terrain and hadn't a clue where go was on this gameboard or how to play it. <br>\r\n      Usually, I just read the directions but I was relatively certain this was a game with no board or rules and was played one time only by the players. There were three major life-changing possible outcomes and I'd bet the odds were just about even on the three biggies: Prison, the Big Empty or the gold ring and ownership of Life's Merry-G0-Round. Worldly people know when something isn't right or doesn't fit into the equation, it doesn't just sound like a lie it is one!  Warning claxons are telling this submarine to dive but I just had to prove,\"  He who hesitates is lost!\" I was thinkng ( that was my first mistake) it couldn't hurt to recog a little, see what made eyes the original owner had no use for worth more than The Star Of India?<br>\r\n     I've hunted and been hunted by humans.  It was their turf not mine. The VC had already fought a first World Country and won, humbling France, evicting all frogs and recovering their country from foriegn control only to be replaced by septic tanks ( Yanks). I fought hard but to this day haven't a clue why we were there and what we hoped to accomplish. It took me a month before I knew we were in some deep s&amp;%$! They were fully prepared, trained on the job, not at rehersal, dug in is an understatement.  What I saw, if someone tried to tell me, I would have called them a liar! Bottom line. It took me quite awhile to find out we were playing from pages of the same rule book. I wasn't surprised but they were. I surprised the life out of them.  In the bush, there are no surprises!  Let me rephrase that. As a boonie rat there is only one surprise. The VC wrote the book on Guerilla Jungle Warfare. I was to far in-country with far to many irons in the fire to find the time to edit and publish, adding a new chapter to their jungle book. We did make sure the personel that could make use of it were informed. I know and the others like me know, when someone gives you good advice, take it.  Two tours and I was back in the World. That was a surprise I can live with! The VC I surprised are in the agricultural industry.  They make great fertilizer.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

All I wanted to know was the price she would sell her eyes for.  I was in the middle of the street, indicisive, stalled, when the door opended but just free of the striker plate.  <br>\r\n     This is the baited hook which I went for.  Behind the door was the rest of it; line and sinker. They reeled me in and might have caught a sardine. There were three of them counting the wandering eye holder. I was not in the World any longer!  This was no flashback either, me back in the Nam! I was a dolphin.  My mate and pup, our entire family trapped with a purse seiner's catch, already lifted from the sea is when I, in the blinking of an eye, returned!  What returned was not what had left!  I've been in a tight spot or three but it was just me. Never have I felt anything comparable to what was filling every fiber of me with a hyper-awareness, time had become slow motion. I was sensing the intentions and movements of everything around me, even behind me where I could not see. yet, I could see?  The dolphin's rage, frustration and a hopelessness and futility left me stripped clean, devoid of any human mercy or restraint for I was not human.  This was to the death for myself,my wife and child who were together, crying and dying, already dead the moment the Earth Killer closed his purse! <br>\r\n     The robber baron pursre seiners are worse than the long liners and neither are or should ever be refered to as fishermen!  Take fish out of the word and while you're there grab men too!  What's left is what they are and should be called,\" ER\"! They combined, are depleting fish populations to extinction!  They know and don't care!<br>\r\nAre they stupid or insane?  Two choices.  Not only are they bringing forth in the near, forseeable future. Oceans with nothing in them, just like an empty fish tank! Their unbrideled greed will be the cause of their redundantcy!  Where will anyone with his limited skills find work?  He's killing himself and to ignorant to see it!<br>\r\nI think ERROR is a perfect fit. <br>\r\n    The disquised eyeholder and her two mystery men were federal special investigaters on a fishing expedition for one man in particular selling stolen body parts to a wide variety of people who needed them for scientific research. The eyes were the bait and had caught the shark already.  His apointment is for four.  I came in while they were still in the process of setting up the sting. I didn't tell them they had also caught a dolphin.  They didn't need to know, ever.  <br>\r\n     I didn't find any of this out until I was able to revive them. I had rendered them unconscious brfore one word was said.  The shorter of the two was reaching............for his badge, I found out later.  He would have identified himself and team he told me, if he had had the time. It was odd hearing that, about time.  For me it was surreal, more like a dream than a reality.  All three were asleep before their brains could come to a realization and send a signal, a mayday, that they were in the presence of a force, not of civilized man but of nature.  More like a raging storm than a dog fight.  As fast as it came is how it left me and returned me to myself.  I would say and fortunate for them but I can't.  When I made first contact with them I felt the dolphin<br>\r\ndiscerning even through that emotion which was devasted and insane.  He somehow new these were not guilty and would not assuage or effect any change to kill innocents as they had done to his family!  Was he like them? Very softly and musical is the only way I can describe it, he answered no and was no longer with me.      <br>\r\n     I found myself on the floor wailing in an agony that was all of creation pulsing and wailing in deep, sad sorrow,tears running and paralyzed, not wanting to be in a world where innocense is taken for weakness and abused by a consciousness that is not yet. I vowed to fight harder than I was.  I knew the change in me by the presense of an alien was permanant and would like to think the dolphin had been a part of the transfer.  I now know we are even closer to them than anyone is aware of.<br>\r\n     When everything had returned to normal and nobody was anybodies enemy.  It was almost four and the body snatcher had his eyes on the disguised eyes of the holder!  I couldn't wait to tell Kim Chee I knew where he could get some eyes.  Heh.  <br>\r\n     Oh yea.  One last pot sweetener and I'll have to say, Happy Trails to you. They all begged me to do them a great favor and would not let me say no. So, who am I to fight the law?  They put two thousand dollars for service rendered in my hand and took it from petty cash set aside for the body parts dealer.  They did have one condition which I gave them. I gave them your word that you would tell no one about them sleeping on the clock. In all the confusion and well, shame, they never asked me my name and I never give it willingly to anyone in the government.  After the Nam, we have an agreement.  I leave them alone and they me.  It's a symbiotic relationship, a win win. Happy trails to you, until we meet again.  (Fade to Black)</span></div></div>",

I had always wondered at that expression. But, sitting here in my tower room, I envied the simpleness of their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I was, for want of a better word, a prisoner. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing to stop me leaving my surroundings, my room with its meagre furnishings. I was a prisoner in my own mind. This room was all I could remember for many years. One high window on the south wall let in all the light I would need by day, and candles provided me with a means to see at night. I turned my eyes back to the task at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A letter. I had several rolls of parchment at hand, spare quills should mine snap, a pot of ink and some sealing wax. The ring on my finger would serve as my seal. With a heavy hand, I lifted a quill and dipped the end into the ink. I held the writing implement there for several seconds, trying to delay the inevitable. It was no use. Shaking off the excess ink, I slowly drew the end of the quill across the parchement, making marks on the clean sheet. It was hard at first, but just like the others it got easier. It always did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After re-inking my pen a few times, I made the last few ink strokes required before signing my name with a flourish. I gave the letter a cursory glance, but I had written too many of these before to know I had made no mistake. After sealing the letter, and stamping my ring down into the cooling wax, I pushed my chair back from my desk, I walked over to the door and tapped lightly. It opened almost immediately, and I resisted the familiar urge to recoil from the large space on the other side. Instead, I focused on the male that had opened the door, and handed him the letter without a word. The letter that would see another life ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  I turned away with a feeling in the pit of my stomach. I knew it all too well, but also knew it would pass. I heard the door close behind me, but paid no attention. I went to sit back at my desk to look out of my window. The birds had flown away. </span></div></div>",

I slammed the key in the ignition, censured the idling engine.  Standing on the rock pit in front of the crumbled sidewalk, I could still feel the hum of the engine in the balls of my feet, the crinkling my toes, the singing in the hollow of my glass bones from shin to hip.  Muscle followed the apprehension in my tendons; the rusted house keys tinkled in a delicate pavane from my limp fingertips in my sputtering ascent along the barren driveway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Moss and weeds thundered from every crevice, every crack, every fault in the foundation like a green-brown beard along the sagging house.  They whispered against the caress of a hot breeze, against my pant leg, against each other: Look, here, now, a wanderer, a new being, a stranger has come.  Silvery veins of a spider\u2019s intricate home had caught the sparse rain drops, and the wailing captives used the sharp shafts of sun to communicate their glinting plea for salvation.  As always, the bottom step of the porch groaned in delight at my passage, however tentative.  A pot of flowers, now dead, caught my stumbling foot where the terra cotta mass had been tossed and left on its shattered side.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My hand freed the entrance of its netting, trembling and pale as death, knocking the filth that had taken hold of the tarnished handle.  I thumbed the ring of keys and, though I already knew by sight and feel which would open the door, I struggled to place it in the scratched keyhole.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The secure click meant admission, soft and echoing in the deathless void of the porch.  Hushing their inane gossip, the weeds taciturnly bent back into submission along the walkway and walls of the house.  I need only touch the door; the tense hinges squealed in delight at my entrance and the mouth of the house gave a shattered grin.  Finally inside the familiar creature, I locked myself in and set to my work.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dust and cobwebs ornamented each corner, every untouched inch--essentially the entire house.  A leaky roof had sobbed at its abandonment, the ceiling sporting a dark brown liver spot and the floor a stagnant pool of rancid water.  The thought came to me that, now the sole proprietor, I should probably take some sick leave, take my vacation time, swaddle myself in steely determination to do what my cousins would not: clean the house, restore it to its former glory, maybe sell the worthless thing to the contractors down the street.  But, for now, just use the last day of bereavement to scour for things I might have forgotten and things I might remember.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A streak of light across a greasy window pane sent disgruntled dust particles from their rest as I walked, an ireful flurry at my heels.  The kitchen was uncharacteristically neat, mismatched dishes and cups and silverware frozen in their glass coffins, waiting for the kiss of life to reanimate them.  No smell of the gas stove and half-finished sweets to lure me home from school.  No stick of Pillsbury sugar cookie dough across the cutting board, no tiny hand creeping over the lip of the too-tall counter, watching the movement of the knife, slyly waiting for the entrance to steal a medallion and happily nibble away the picture.  No smile.  No hug.  No \u201cMommy!\u201d yelped in happy greeting.  Just the memories that filled the empty house.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I moved to the adjacent utility room.  It was there, awaiting me as it always had when the warm, fleshy hand ushered me from my thieving ways--but now, I need not pull my little wooden chair across the floor to clamber onto the dryer.  Somehow, a dent had formed in my spot after all of these years--I had never noticed, for Mom had never complained--and I willingly reclaimed my throne.  And, yes, I still automatically reached for that wondrous medley of fun: the button box.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though I had not touched it in years, it was the only thing in the entire house that still seemed to breathe and had batted away the dust that had grown since Mom went into the hospital, then the hospice, then--\u2026  The temptation was too much, the cold tin on my palms and lap, the warm memories dancing in my head.  I freed the lid and raked through the mound of buttons: blue and black and red and green and sparkling and dull and soft and hard and pretty and plain.  My childhood favorites were carefully nestled on top, ready for play, ready for the stories that I would weave.  A smile cracked my dry lips: I couldn\u2019t resist clanging that pair of flat, brassy buttons together like a pair of cymbals; it was imperative that I investigate the beautiful grain of Great-Grandma\u2019s old wooden buttons; and run the soft satin ones--green and blue and purple and burgundy and black and all so very smooth--across my forefinger, then my flushed cheek, then my upper lip.  Under the staleness of inattention, I could still smell sugar cookie dough and the faint comfort of Mom\u2019s lavender perfume.  Yes, I couldn\u2019t help but smile and turn an ear towards the oven\u2019s shrill buzzer for when I could return to the kitchen and spoil my dinner.</div></span></div></div>",

Either way, the ever-lasting punishment would torture one's soul into madness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch twisted thoughts winter inspired within me!

When the tide was in, water swooshed and swirled under our feet, and I would half-squeal, half-giggle as it almost rose up to touch my toes. At least, that was how I remembered it. Stepping over the slats as an adult still made my stomach flutter. It was like walking on water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a big wheel <span class=\"cgrape\">on the pier</span>; right at the end. It's empty right now, but it won't be long before it's filled with children and their reluctant adults. I smile as I remember the last time I rode the wheel. Memories of Dad fake-protesting as I dragged him aboard saunter before my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts return to today. It's early morning, and the pale, yellow sun is just emerging from its slumbers. I'm glad the sky is blue, even if the sea breeze bites at my neck. I move along the pier, hand in hand with my husband. When we reach the donut stand, I being counting the wooden panels. When I get to seven, I check the railing next to it. And there it is: my past. A small indent in the metal that is almost a letter P. \"Here it is,\" I say to myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand as close to the edge as possible, and watch the gentle eddy that swirls beneath me. The tide is in right up to the sea wall. It's not very often I see that. There's something calming about the swishing of the water. I breathe deeply, and know I have made the right decision. As I lean over the edge, I take the small, black urn and remove the lid. I hold it upside down and watch the silver and black ashes, that were once my father, as they drift on the breeze out to sea.</span></div></div>",

When a kid grows up on a farm in a farming community, rural, and the farms sustain by hard work the family or families that derive their livlihood and survival by the success of their ability to produce and harvest cash crops.  At one time in the US 80% of the population lived this life. His life isn't that of a city kid.  It's long hours but when you have known no other life, you have nothing to compare it to.  All the kids you grew up with are doing the same chores as you.  I remember the food was always so good.  Not just nuitritious but it had a depth to it you can't purchase anywhere.<br>\r\n     We had a lot of Amish scattered through our county. I had Amish friends growing up a few still are friends though I live far away now, we still see each other when I'm back visiting relatives or someone dies.  My best friend was Absalom Tract.  He had two younger brothers Disraili and Substantial.  Abs and I were unseperable and I was welcome at his home and in the Amish community as all the farms in our county still relied on each other for help when it was needed.  You know the occassional barn raising or rebuilding a house after a fire.  The reason I've told you a little of our community is twofold.  <br>\r\n     First it is well known that the Amish pick some pretty weird names for their offspring.  I told you that my best friends name was Absalom and his brothers names were Disrali Tract and the other was Substantial Tract.  It was powerful funny or coincidental that Substantial really was. He was going to be humongous when he grew up but he didn't get to.  But that's in a minute.  So what these boys had to grow up with is Absalom was ABSTRACT, which he was. Disraili was Distract or Distracting. Which he was. And last but the beast, Substantial or Subtract.  Their Dad's name was Aaron, Attract and their moms name was Annebelle Eve Tract, Attractive.<br>\r\n     Isn't that just the cutest thing you've ever come across?  Well this is the worst.  When Abstract and I were 15 a county killer roared through.  To this day it's the biggest, baddest I've ever witnessed.  It's name was Hurricane Jessebelle and in a way there were two miracles that it was responsible for.  One , for the force of it and the damage it done by other comparisons of lessor hurricanes it spared the four counties tied to us.  The other miracle was the death toll.  It only killed five people in the entire state of Iowa!  Unfortunately, every one of them was a Tract!  In a way the hurricane subtracted the tracts.  For ten years after that when anyone started playing with their names jokelike, woth them gone like they went, but one look at the seriousness on my face and the subject changed real fast.  When that storm took my friend, it took me with him.  It was never my home from that day forward.</span></div></div>",

The gazebo for our town Umpa band, children's playground, public swimming pool, baseball diamond, bike trail-jogger's path, dog-walk and what would a park be if it didn't have barbique grills and picnic tables.  It's real name has been lost in the passage of time and is now called, The MainLand.<br>\r\n     By the time I was under the shade of the giant oak which is one of the more obvious reasons Randolf chose this corner over the other three, the crowd (if you could call it that) had grown to twenty-two seemingly somewhat interested people. No one was asleep.  All but three were almost facing him. There were no hecklers, as of yet and a few were nodding their heads as if they were agreeing with something Randolf had said.<br>\r\n     I didn't hear what the audience was agreeing with but I was just in time, he informed me using the name he had given me, Samuel , (he and I were friends-not quite the right word)for something important that he requested we pay special attention to as it might be of great value to remember what he was about to bring forward. I don't know which of you this will be of importance to or I would just share it with those who will have need.<br>\r\n     I give ti you today a mystery.  It is very old-Ancient.  It's meaning has been left behind and forgotten by the snails pace that time keeps.  Time's time does not keep time as the Age of Man messures  Time like God has all time  Where there is all time, there is no time.  It has no meaning because it is not in the sphere of duality but one.  When it is the appointed time, you will understand the sphere of one because you will be in it, one with it, you will be it.  And it will be you. You may think of this as the place you call Heaven.  It is that and it is more.  Here is what I am told from there to tell you here.I have been given the words but not their meaning.  The meaning will come when it is necessary and only to him or those that it is for. Listen and hear these words of truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHear me! Hear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne ring, was never on a finger.  Find what made the ring<br>\r\nHelp is listening to a singer sing, Linger on the finger, then on the ring<br>\r\nAnother ring stops a thing from becoming what it is.<br>\r\nYou will know when to use this ring, you have something that is his.<br>\r\nListen well and I will listen well and hear.  The last three rings<br>\r\nBegin and end things, all planned and hidden in plain sight.<br>\r\nWhen you look between these lines not using your eyes<br>\r\nClose them and hear what you are looking for<br>\r\nSee the ring? Find the thing that made the ring. Make the thing sing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As Randolf finished the last words, he crunpled onto his box and said one word, \" tired\".......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is there really little creatures that change our actions, telling us to do horrible things or just causing people to be straight up jerks? Or is it just our way to explain what can not be explained, the human brain. Sure we may be able to tell certain things about the brain like what part controls growth, what part controls breathing and so on but besides that it is all just a mystery to us. Perhaps this is why the thought of Demonic Influence and a High Power came to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease do not take this as a bashing of religion, I respect all views as long as it doesn't hurt anyone, I am simply addressing a certain view point. Take for example people who think someone who is showing massive mood swings may need a priest and some might see it as they need mental health. To one side it is demonic influence that is causing that person to have mood swings, to others it is a mental disorder. Each one sees the same thing but registers it as different items. Another example would be people who think homosexuals are sinful and others see it as a normal relationship. It is all a mater of perception dear reader, something that none of us have been able to fully comprehend, why does that one person see things in that way and one in another? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could very well explain demonic influence as just being certain peoples views on why someone doesn't think like they do, that there must be some evil thing making them think that way when really it could be just their brains are a bit different then ours. Now does this prove that their is no such thing as demonic influence, of course not, this is just a way of possibly explaining it just like demons are the cause is a possible way of explaining it.

For the remainder of my life, I resisted, uselessly, against a force of nature. I was lost and desperate, and turned to the matters of the afterlife. I pretended to repent of my sins, of murder, theft, and wanton destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought that it worked. Even as I struggled to breathe in my age, I thought that death would now be nothing to me, nothing to fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the time came, and I passed through what I thought were the pearly gates of heaven. I walked everywhere, taking in the sights. But something seemed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people here smiled, but their smiles were too wide, almost artificial. It had the effect of looking particularly creepy. Before I could look closer, I was guided to the center of heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shining light emanated before me, and I was standing in front of a Presence. I wasn't sure what was going to happen next, but I was in bliss. What did it matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the angels branded me. Suddenly, I was wracked in pain, and my face suddenly forced into a too-wide, artificial smile. What was happening to me? What kind of heaven was this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light in front of me enveloped me, and I was transported elsewhere. And then I realized something. All those stories of a man who thinks he went to heaven, but really found himself in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I was face to face with a snake. The biggest I ever saw, whose body coiled around me. It didn't take a genius to figure out who this was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serpent's smile was awful, and I shrank in fear. He said to me, \"Welcome to eternity. I assure you, your repentance for your sins will be very...thorough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brand given to me burned with pain. Pain I would feel for eternity. Damn it all.</span></div></div>",

These three guys just shoved me down and I hit my head on the sidewalk, and when I woke up my wallet and glasses were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it was the day I got out of my car in the Walmart parking lot and got harassed by this crazy old guy  who was  leaving in the F-150 that was parked next to me. He yelled out \"You goddamn socialist scumbag! If I had my shotgun with me I'd waste your sorry ass!\" as he drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a minute to figure out what he was talking about. (I forgot I still had the \"Obama '08\" sticker on my bumper.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I guess I started to think the world was out to get me. Too many crazy and dangerous people out there. I figured the only place I was reasonably safe was at work, or maybe in my apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt work it was pretty secure, I work for a government contractor. We have armed guards and electronic ID badges to open the doors. I started going in early and staying late most days because I felt safer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home my apartment had a gate with a security code access, but my neighbors could just buzz anybody in. So I put an extra deadbolt on my door. And I bought myself a Glock 9mm for backup, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I tucked the pistol in my belt, put on an old baggy hoodie, and drove down to the grocery store to stock up. Mostly canned goods, and enough meat and frozen veggies and orange juice to stuff the freezer. I got enough food to last a month or two, maybe more. Charged it all on my Visa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy girlfriend dumped me soon after that. I kept making excuses of why I couldn't go over her place, or take her out anywhere. (I guess the thrill of coming over to my shabby apartment to watch TV all the time got old for her.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I get up early every day and drive to work before the sun comes up. I stop at the self serve gas station on my way in once a week to fill up, and I pay at the pump. I drive home after work and walk straight from the parking lot to my apartment, don't say nothing to nobody, even if they say hi to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know this isn't normal, I really need to change. A friend of mine at work recommended you, that's why I made the appointment. Do you really think you can help me?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I listened to my patient with a varying degree of interest. At times, I wasn't so sure how to take it, how I should visibly respond to the source of his inbred trauma. Others, I tried to resist contemplating about the girlfriend. I couldn't reason as to why she didn't stay, didn't make the attempt to provide comfort and solace for his anxieties. But then I concluded, it mayhave not been entirely her fault. Perhaps, he was simply too reserved about his rationale to stay home. Maybe it just didn't add up for her. I also was forced into resistance when I found myself disbelieving the measures to which he went about trying ensure his safety. I mean, nothing so seemingly mundane and simultaneously harrowing had ever happened to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the murkiness of cynicism crept into my ticking brain. How could I ever extend the hand of assistance to an individual whose experience I had never touched on. Sure, the psychological medical practice was a fine way to pick at humans in our society. The mostly objective approach was a fine way to stick and push yard long needles into others without the damagin reprecurssions of absorbing to oneself the disturbance of another. I could easily peel back the scalp and peer into the brain. And pick, pick, pick until I've hit a nerve. But the patient doesn't have the, the, the <i>blessing</i> to peel back my stomach skin and see my intestines. He can't see what's in my brain. That information is not accessible to him because it's necessary that I stick to the traditional method. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nListen. Or pretend to do so. Give him an expression of a statue. Blank in the face, so as not to arouse his emotions. And respond artificially. But I didn't want to appreciate our new relationship in that fashion. That's what would become of this, anyway. We strive to form relationships. It may sound distant, ideal, farfetched and outlandish, but for goodness sake, it's written in our medical oaths! I'm not hoping to help this man. I'm not even hoping for him to help himself. What I hope, is that, by stripping my skin and showing a bit of muscles, and bones and organs, maybe I can show him a reflection of himself that he once thought was perilous. And maybe, he'll also recognize a part of himself that he once thought was safe, comfy, <i>healthy</i>. And if he can reorder some things, and balance himself, then light will go back to being light. And darkness will go back to being darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny. He reminds me of a young female patient I had back when I was a school therapist. She was an outlandish creature, but then, if she had opted for \"normal\" in a school environment, a <i>high</i> school environment, then I may have been more compelled to have the young thing admitted. She was just like this one, though, she seemed to have the ability to be able to discern as to what lightness and darkness was. <i>This</i> young man seems to lack this ability. Or rather, he has the keeness to understand darkness in a real, tangible sense, but could not distinguish darkness in its multiple forms. Cynthiana was always going on about that. That was her name. Cynthiana. Strange girl, philosophically anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really didn't see what was so significant about shadows and spirits and souls and lightbulbs and dark rooms. They seem like such drab things to be worrying about when homework and farming and gardening seemed to be so important. But my buried, trenched personality trickled out of me, beyond my control. I asked her what a regular day for her was like, in the same fashion that my current patient before me relayed his day. And there was nothing to it. There was not a damn, singl thing that was particularly unusual about her day. Nothing happened. Literally. Nothing happened. And somehow, recalling Cynthiana's daily activities made my heart grow weary. I began seriously considering how painful it may have beenfor this man to go about his business and have to worry if someone was planning to jump, and other related acts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I went back to thinking about her. Cynthiana. She went about her business with seemingly no response at all. Certain events she described should have roused her like any other person. And this was a girl, that, from the knowledge that I've collected from her personal academic records, instructors, peers and even neighbors, did exceptional in her life. She never attributed any of those actions, skills, and abilites to anyone else. And strangely, she could not seem to bring herself the comfort of attributing these things to even herself. It was almost as if she lacked both the light and darkness that one would find in an individual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here, sitting in front of me, was a person who deeply felt all his surroundings. Everything he went through, he experienced with the fervor of someone who was virtually without a predisposed disorder. It's strange to consider all this now. It's strange to compare such a distant, and yet close patient to a man who seemed so, so, so normal! His logic, while considerable extreme, was a very basic, simplified reaction to unfortunate, but tangible, real problems. Cynthiana, on the other hand, reacted in a zig-zag pattern that would suggest trauma was present, though none had occured based on wisdom of her being. 'Water off a duck's back,' I thought, whenever she would trudge through my office door. I even told her once, never ever to see me again. There's nothing you need from me. And nothing I need from you, so crawl away from here and try your best not to return. I even managed to say all that as calmly and austerely as possible, without making myself seem like a despot or a firebrand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut darkness doesn't seek lightness out because it wants balance. And light, certainly does not choose dark because it need an equillibrium. Not the way I view things, at least. And not that my views should take center stage. It's just that realized why Cynthiana was there. I realized why this young man was here. She had no known kin, parent or guardian. And this man, who lost his girlfriend - perhaps the only constant companion that he had at the time - now resigned himself to living his life, permanently, at home. They were seeking humanity. Humans. People. <i>A relationship</i>. I was beginning to feel like I actually knew what I was doing, like I always had, with this profession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, I didn't throw Ms. Cynthiana away. I actually befriended that strange creature. It was peculiar having such a young friend, but she didn't seem to mind my status in life, so I forced myself to stop worrying about hers. And I will do the same for him. He who sought not therapy, but himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, though, I must say something a bit crude that's been nagging me since he before he even relayed his story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably more normal than you give yourself credit for - even now, sitting here in my office. But before I can help you, I need to establish something very pertinent. I need you to hear my story first.\"</span></div></div>",

We could hear vile creatures slithering and cackling and hissing, just waiting for when our flashlight failed. And I knew it would. The flashlights were holding out much longer than they should have. As if on cue my flashlight flickered then went out. I held my breath, willing for the light to come back on. When it didn't i dropped it to the cave floor, no use caring around extra weight.<br>\r\n\"Guys hurry up! You got to see this!\" Hunter called froom around the bend ahead.<br>\r\nWe ran to him and then stood in jaw dropping wonder. \"Have you've ever seen anything more beautiful?\" Chris sighed as tears sprang up in his eyes.<br>\r\nNot much but enough sunlight shone down from a crack in the ceiling, and it did wonders to out spirites.<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" I yelled.\" the exit has to be close!\"<br>\r\nWe charged down the tunnel, laughing as we saw the exit around another bed. We only had one stretch of darkness to go and at our pace it wouldn't take long to cross. None of use had noticed that the flash lights had gone out. Hunter disappeared into the darkness and emerged on the other side a few seconds later. Anna and Mary did the same. C.J, Chris, and I hit it at the same time and we knew we were screwed. I screamed as something wrapped around my leg pulling me towards a hidden hole to the side. An evil cackling laughter assuated our ears. Chris grabbed my arm and C.J grabbed his. They pulled towards the light moving me an inch forward before the creature dragged me back again. It laughed again, find us amusing. I could hear more creatures coming closer, not wasteing the promise of an easy meal.<br>\r\n\" You have to go NOW!? I roared at my brothers.<br>\r\nThey looked at me like I was an idoit. There was n oway they would leave me, we had lost to much already. I heard human feet runninf towards us and felt the rest of our group run to the light. They hadn't been apart of the group long enough to really get to know me. They knew what had to be done thats why they had survived so long.<br>\r\n\"Go.\" I said looking at CJ. He just shook his hand and pulled harder. By no the creature had lost interest and just wanted to feed. With a massive thug i was wrenched from my brothers and dragged further back. I grabbed hold of a rock jutting from a rock. Chris was heading towards me, a srubborn look on his face.<br>\r\n\"Daddy! Sta Sta!\" A childs voice called.<br>\r\n\"Go. You have to be there for him.\"<br>\r\nI didn't see what he did next since i let go of the rock. I quickly reached for the knife at my side. I may be gonna die but i was gonna go down fightig. With that thought i was fully swallowed by the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sorry i know it was bad T-T. I was trying to see if it would help with my writer's block*<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Many people in his condition would be in a Hospice but he was fortunate because he had money and could afford home care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there he lay in his bed facing the casement windows which were opened every morning so that he had a view of his garden. Of course when the weather was not suitable for having open windows he found himself with only the gloomy view of his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes he listened to music and other times he explored within his own mind, thinking of what had happened in the past, what was happening, what he would like to have happened and what eventually would happen.

The sadness of the violins at the beginning, the shivers up his spine as the wood winds joined in followed by a harp and then the full orchestra as it tells the story of what is to come, \"They have murdered Turiddu!\" Dorio said out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dorio exclaimed this his son Tito entered the room. \u201cYes papa, Cavalleria Rusticana,\u201d he said sitting on his father\u2019s bed. \u201cThe intermezzo shall be played at your funeral.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Tito no,\u201d Dorio said stroking his sons cheek. \u201cI cannot hear it when I am dead.<br>\r\nWhy will you make all the mourners cry when already they will be in sorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorio\u2019s 30 year old son took his father\u2019s hand in his. \u201cWho will cry hearing this music? It will remind us of you and how much you loved it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorio was sad as he said, \u201cIf you do not feel emotion, tears streaming down your face and your whole body becoming one with the music, then you have not heard Mascagni\u2019s intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true for you papa but we do not have your ears or heart so we cannot feel as you do but we can remember you in this beautiful music.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlay it to me now my son and we will share it together while we both can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTito selected the CD of the opera and put it in the player by his father\u2019s bed and set it to play at the intermezzo. Tears started to come from Dorio\u2019s eyes as father and son looked at each other, then as the music ended Tito realised that his father\u2019s eyes were no longer looking at him but vacant as if looking into some distant place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo papa,\u201d Tito cried out as his eyes filled with tears. \u201cPapa, you have made me hear the music, I am crying for the music and I am crying for you.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had her hands on her hips and hair tied in a tight bun which made her face prominent and look bigger than it actually was. She inspected the entire room and her eyes landed on Jack on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack slowly got up to his feet and shuffled his feet, clearing off the dust that covered his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing happened, mum, I just fell,\" Jack mumbled, his eyes avoiding meeting his mother's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's mother just hmphed and went back upstairs, satisfied because there wasn't anything broken. Well, at least nothing broken she'd seen. Jack bent over to pick up the shards of the broken glass and disposed of it. He cleaned the floor and made sure there was no dust, no piece of glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had cleaned the basement and removed the covers from the bed and all the furniture, it looked as good as new. He had moved back in with her mother after a year spent in Ireland, interning in a video game company. When they offered him no job, despite how hard he had worked and proven himself, he saw no reason to stay there and decided to come back home. His mother was always strict but she loved her kids and she made sure Jack knew that the doors to her house were always open for her babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another reason why Jack returned back. He had discovered something inside of him, something that made him scared of himself. Now that he was surrounded by familiar environment and people, he had eased up quite a bit and he was learning how to control his thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inhaled and exhaled, slowly and deeply. Rubbing his hands together and breathing in and out, he paced the room and then stopped. He closed his eyes and moved his legs up as if he was sitting in a posture in yoga. He felt himself in the air, light and touching no surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squinted one of his eyes and opened slowly to see what or where he was and looking at it, he opened both eyes and chuckled, his features were a mixture of confusion and interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, I can actually fly in air, I can frigging stay in the air like this,\" He slowly eased himself down on the floor and searched the internet with the words 'The Worhound Effect' but there was nothing on it among the search results. Not even one result showed up. Looked like he had to go outside the house and hit the libraries in order to answer all the buzzing questions that kept arriving in his mind. Like why was he the only one who knew about this incident, why was he influenced by it, what were his abilities besides being able to fly in the sky or the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack packed a bag and hung it over his shoulder. He went into the kitchen and kissed his mother on her cheek, \"Bye, mum. Going to the library now. Will be back late at night. Don't worry about me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he had said that, he left the house and walked down to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started when Jack was walking on the countryside in Ireland, taking a break from all the hectic  routine and the internship when he saw a meteor fall right in front of him and he blacked out probably by the impact. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n608 words</span></div></div>",

Such guarded rage against the unfairness and the emptiness of my personal loss; rage locked in so tight that even the tears of my great sadness dwindled into silence. The sleet pounded the glass and the trees writhed like I wanted to scream and pound and tear apart that monstrous unholiness that gripped me into unnatural quiet calm. My happiness was thrown away with little to no disregard for myself, but through the manipulations of she who had promised wonders and all the while lied about those promises she'd made. The treachery went unnoticed because I believed, I so wanted to believe her. And she got away. I stand watching the wind, listening to the sleet, smelling the wetness and the cold, and tasting the bitterness of abandonment and she got away never to witness the destructive torment she left behind. She smiles and laughs and jokes as if nothing ever happened and has the temerity to ask if we could remain as friends. She is clueless and I am unable to let loose the bindings of the insane rage and grief locked so securely within me. In truth I have traded a new monster for the old.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, there's this thing called Awful Writing, which kind of sounds like something from English class, but it really isn't, due to the general tendency of high school English teachers to avoid using the word \"awful\" in order to remain politically correct and to prevent criticism, like that one article about the teacher in New York who attached a McDonald's application to one of his student's papers. You can bet he had a lot of angry parents after him. But he could have been right, because his student's paper could just as well have been filled with long-winded sentences that have nothing to do with anything, such as that one haiku someone wrote about randomness and refrigerators, as well as that one sentence some clown wrote comparing his nose hairs to trees after a rainstorm... actually, I forgot exactly how that one goes. But whatever, let's move on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Awful Writing is also chock full of comparisons to other items which really have nothing to do with the original item being described, but these comparisons are worded in such a way that it's hard to tell, such as the fact that the intellectual movement and phenomenon popularly known as Awful Writing is merely a singular metaphor for the loneliness of human souls in eras of corruption and disillusionment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are also random tense changes throughout pieces of Awful Writing, so you may have seen places where you will be unsure of what the characters involved said or did, or would have thought if you were right there in the story with them. So if you were reading a piece of Awful Writing about how a girl learns to tie a shoe, the girl will be struggling with her laces which look like worms and totally grossed her out, though she would be proud of her efforts by the very end of the story when she finally will have learned how not to look like an idiot when faced with a pair of shoes with laces that look like even more disgusting worms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwful Writing includes references to the people reading, as well as to the author, so you can be sure that personal pronouns are sprinkled throughout the text like... like rainbow sprinkles on an ice cream that people who love rainbow sprinkles crave. I happen to be one of those people. Are you one of them? You are? Cool! Sometimes I wish I was just a rainbow sprinkle myself, just sitting in the midst of a scoop of ice cream, waiting to be devoured and savored by the person eating me... yum... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention the fact that there are hardly ever any transitions or proper conclusions in a work of Awful Writing. The pure genius required to master the craft of Awful Writing lies in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>(purposefully discontinued - you figure out why <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">)</i></div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why would i do this?  Think about it!  What better way to balance out the scheme of things.  Balance is good and beneficial for all individuals.  Even animals do well when there is balance.  So, off to balanced writing or non-awful writing which ever works for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNon-awful writing which has balance generally has a good variety of ingredients.  Not too much of this or that.  Enough of this and that.  The this and the that can be what ever works well with your choice of topic(s).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good example would to not put a lot icky over done unnecessary descriptive words which do not make the writing better.  I like a vivid picture of what is being written about as long as I don't get lost in the words or get completely lost in the written piece.  If I get totally lost in useless stuff, I'm gone and probably will not read anything like that again, then again you never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI prefer reading something which isn't too full of fluff and awful words.  The cat ran up the tree says enough about what the cat did, where it happened, and as for the tree, well the reader gets to decide what kind of tree the cat ran up.  Certainly if there were two beings doing something and the writing was written so that the action of what these two were doing was close to the identifying who they were, then I would know who and exactly what they were doing.  If there was a lot of awful fluff in between the action of what the who was doing I would certainly be confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI like writing and want to share information with people, so I make certain that I'm not confusing them by writing awful.</span></div></div>",

I started writing because I couldn't draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother was skilled with the pencil - the 0.5mm lead stick that etched the foundations of great artwork, or perhaps the literal foundations of architectural wonders. I wasn't. A good friend who was a graphic artist once commented that though he accepted writers as artists, he thought the latter were more creative. I thought otherwise. How can you not be creative with so many ways to communicate at your disposal? A brush. A spray paint canister. A pencil. A highlighter. Anything that can be arranged with the resulting mesh aesthetically sound can be deemed tools of art, and the mesh itself the artwork. Writers only have words. These words with which we are forced to communicate a concept, these letter-weavings that impart abstract ideas - these are what writers work with. Does a writer not need as much creativity, perhaps more, than the artist when he has words to work with while the artist has images? In the aftermath of my friend's comment years after I already embraced writing, in silent contemplation of his probably thoughtless uttering, I realized that I didn't write because I couldn't draw. I wrote because I can never draw as well as I write. I was an artist whose canvas was filled with paragraphs of words, not swathes of colors. And with these words I have grown to learn more and more about myself and the world as I experience it. To the day my fingers ache with arthritis (or carpal tunnel, whichever strikes first), I will be writing (or typing) away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI write because my every word etches my reality in the greater whole. And of course, I write to make a living, and am blessed to be able to do what I love and earn doing it.</span></div></div>",

This writing is a bit experimental because I'm writing what I'm thinking about for this chapter.  I'm not concerned about how long the sentences may be or if they might be too long.  I'm curious about what you think of this writing under these circumstances.  So, I guess I'm a scientist/researcher when it comes to wanting to know what if and relating my experiments to writing, especially prose.</span></div></div>",

Of course, people can be near perfect but it's rarely so. The reason for that is because each of us has different standards, standards of how we want other people to be like, standard of how people clothe themselves, how they talk, what education they receive, how they look, how they present themselves, their financial status, their properties and houses and jobs and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the last interactive entries have been about marriage in particular, I'd like to take that as an example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suppose you are looking for marriage proposals, someone to marry. You have to set some standards in your mind like:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Handsome<br>\r\n-- Honest<br>\r\n-- Has a decent job and no bad record<br>\r\n-- Does not smoke<br>\r\n-- Is family oriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese above requirements are easy to find and real. On the other hand, these are the standards of another person:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Salary above $100,000<br>\r\n-- Should have a ferari or limousine <br>\r\n-- Must have a Banglow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand etcetra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not common, this is extremely rare and if you ask me, you are asking for someone perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should have an open mind and be flexible. Sure, have some standards in your mind, see the good qualities of the person and then select him or her as your future better half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI, for one, do not think that ideal in person is possible. But of course, jobs, professions, there can be ideals. For example, my ideal job or occupation would be the head of the cardio surgery or maybe neuro surgery or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that when you set an ideal in your mind, you are restraining yourself from looking at the vast possibilities around you. You, yourself, bound yourself within walls and boundaries, refusing to come out of them, comparing every person you see with that ideal standard or personality and the harm of doing that is, you find fault in everyone and with everyone. You don't like that person or thing. In your entire life, you keep struggling to achieve your ideal when maybe, the ideal you had been looking for was never good for you, instead the boy you turned down, the woman you called a snob, the job offer you said was not paying enough, maybe those were way better than your ideal. What if the ideal you have been searching for, been trying to achieve for so long in your entire life doesn't even exist? What then? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, instead of wasting precious time in this small and short life of ours, we should always try to have an open mind and see others for who they are, what we like in them and have moderate and decent ideals that are easy for others to cross and for yourself to find so that you are satisfied and happy and so is the other person or the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n489 words.</span></span></div></div>",
