Wait, WHAT!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay.... before anyone asks the obvious questions, I think we should just start from the beginning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <u><i><b>A Few Days Earlier</b></i></u> ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto Uzumaki, the only human that lived in Equestria, was approaching the town of Ponyville. As he was getting closer he couldn't help but think back about how his life was while he lived here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was brought to the land of Equestria when he was just a baby, after being sent there by some jutsu and then was found by family of Ponies in Neighpon, with the only evidence of his original home world was a letter from his real mother, Kushina Uzumaki, lying next to him; upon reading the letter it said that she had died from an attack by a beast called the Nine Tailed Fox and she knew that the beast was sealed inside Naruto's body, but the letter also said that the ponies should love Naruto as he is, because love is what can make the seal more powerful and Kushina was asking the ponies to love and care for her son and to raise him as if he was their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that they couldn't just leave the baby all alone, the two ponies did just that, as they always wanted a foal of their own, no matter what it looked like, and they had raised Naruto like any other foal. As the years passed, Naruto knew while he was growing up, he was different from the other fillies and colts, for one thing, Naruto had no magic, he also had little to no fur on his body, no tail either, but he was still able to make friends with some colts and fillies around his age with some of the fillies and mares who thought that he was also cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto turned thirteen, his pony mother and father had sat down and told Naruto the truth about how they had found him and they showed him Kushina's letter, Naruto always wondered why his real mother did what she did, but after reading her letter to him, he somewhat understood why she sent him here. He still had plenty of questions to ask about his mother, but he knew that they would never be answered, so he settled with the fact that even though he was different from them, he knew that Equestria was his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day after, Naruto then decided to go off to travel all over Equestria and to make a name for himself, with his parent's blessings, he left his home and after a few years, Naruto had eventually found his way into Ponyville and settled down to live there while sending letters to his pony parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe meet the ponies who lived in Ponyville and at first he was nervous about how they would react to see a human but soon enough, those fears where put to rest as they all welcomed him with open arms and had surprisingly understood his situation, and after living in Ponyville, Naruto had became a good friend to everypony in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had also learned how to make potions from Zecora who he was very good friends with as they shared the feeling of being a different creature in a different land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then snapped out of his thoughts as he saw that he was now arriving to the gates of Ponyville after going on another long trip around Equestria, he was so excited to finally be back home again to see all of his friends and wondered just how all of his friends were doing while he was away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once Naruto passed through the gates, he had a feeling of sudden dread, almost as this was not the same Ponyville that he lived in or left before, something just didn't seem right, until he heard a loud and thunderous roar through the sky and he looked up and his eyes widened and he felt his jaw drop and felt a deep crimson blush cover his face as he saw giant, naked female dragon pony hybrids of all the mares around the town, he could see one at Sweet Apple Acres, one by the School, and one eating Sugar Cube Corner like it was an actual treat to eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that Naruto could say to himself was, \"What happened, while I was gone?\" then he heard a noise from a building close by and knew that somepony was inside so he carefully ran into the building and he saw his best little dragon buddy Spike, though he looked roughed up, and his shirt was torn in places and his shorts were nearly gone and as Naruto approached and tapped the young dragon, he saw Spike jump a good five feet in the air in fear until he saw Naruto and quickly hugged him while saying, \"Naruto! It's you!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto returned the hug but asked the quivering baby dragon, \"I'm glade to see you too Spike, but please tell me, what exactly happened while I was gone? Why does Ponyville suddenly have dragons in it? What has happened to you and where are the others? and why do you have a collar around you're neck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike then hung his head down and gave out a tired sigh as he then said, \"Well Naruto, it's like this...\" Spike said as he began to remember the events that lead up to this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all started earlier this week, after the... \"incident\" I had a while back, I'm sure Twilight told you about it in one of her letters... Anyway, Twilight had somehow managed to extract some of my greed from me, I still don't know how she got it from me but she was then trying to experiment with it... for what I have NO idea for... but she seemed to be getting close to making a break through until... well... Pinkie happened...\" Spike said to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and urged the young dragon to continue, as he was giving Spike his full attention, \"Then suddenly a big flash of ominous green light shined throughout all of Equestria, at first we all thought it was nothing, but the day after that... I saw that Twilight was beginning to change... it started out small, like she was VERY clingy to all of the books in the library and as it went on Twilight started to keep everything close to herself... she even tried to keep me as close to herself as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I managed to slip away from her and into town apparently Twilight wasn't the only one to be affected as the other mares were now showing the signs of a dragon's greed. Soon fights started to break out, then the growing and then I saw the mares start to show dragon features and then for some reason or another, they started to snatch up the stallions and or anything that was a male, I had to run until... Twilight grabbed me and claimed me as her's... that's why I'm wearing a collar to show that I now belong to Twilight...\" Spike said as Naruto seemed to understand the situation a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden both Naruto and Spike heard a very loud but feminine roar call out, \"<b>SPIIIIIIIKKKKKKEEEEE!!!!</b>\" which caused the young dragon to flinch as he quickly turned and ran towards the source of the roar, \"Uh-oh... I gotta get back to the library before my curfew is up and Twilight gets mad and comes looking for me! Please Naruto stay out of sight or they'll try to catch you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after Spike quickly began to run off and left Naruto inside the ruined building alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a while to let everything sink in but he just couldn't believe it... but there must be a way to undo the spell right? There just HAS to be a way, but how? As Naruto exited the building, he was still trying to think up a way to get everything back to normal, until he heard a very loud series of stomping just from over head and Naruto saw a large shadow pass by him until he saw another Draco-Mare land right infront of him with her back facing him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly and quietly went back behind the door of the building he just exited and placed his back against the door and held his breathing as he heard the low breathing of the Draco-Mare, and when he thought she wasn't looking, Naruto would take quick glances at the Draco-Mare when he was sure she wasn't looking, it looked like it was originally a ____ before Twilight had casted the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the Draco-Mare that Naruto was looking at?</span></div></div>",

Oh no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all ponies to find him, it just <i><b>HAD</b></i> to be <u><i><b>HER</b></i></u>!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra Heartstrings...the biggest Anthropology nut in all Equestria!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra used to follow him all around Ponyvillie while holding a note pad and take notes on everything he did; like what kind of food he would eat, what kind of items he would use to compensate for his lack of magic, what kind of ingredients he needed to get for certain potions to make, where does he usually hangout...Anything and everything he did and about him, she made her business to record on a level even Twilight said was unnerving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne time he didn't like was when Lyra attempted to see Naruto fully naked to do \"research\" on the anatomy differences of a human compared to a pony. Basically, she unintentionally made him feel like some kind of research specimen due to her general fascination with humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had spoken about it more than once, since it bothered him. Heck, he'd even taken it up with the princesses, but only Luna and Naruto's self-proclaimed \"big sister\" Cadence seemed to find anything wrong with just how far Lyra seemed to teeter on the brink of obsession with the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paled. If Lyra was on the brink of obsession before, that plus a dragon's avarice....he did NOT like that combination at all! That thought in mind, Naruto tried to creep away from the towering unicorn Draco-Mare but just as he was about to leave, Lyra suddenly stiffened and began to sniff the air, she closed her eyes and continued sniffing...then she turned her face towards Naruto as she sniffed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly before Naruto knew it, Lyra was now too close to him until she took in one last sniff then her eyes opened and she saw Naruto her most favorite (and Equestria's only) human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto... <b>LYRA WANT!!!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Naruto quickly ran to get as far as legs could go as Lyra chased after him not caring that she smashed her way through the empty and abandoned buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto kept on running not looking back as he zoomed passed the town hall and knew that Lyra had just knocked it down as she chased after him while running on her hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NARUTO..... <b>LYRA <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">WAAAAAAANNNNNT!!!!!</font>\"</b> Lyra roared out loud as she was getting closer to her prize.</span></div></div>",
