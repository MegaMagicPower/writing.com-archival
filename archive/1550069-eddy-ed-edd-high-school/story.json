        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">                                   eddy ed edd high school<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eddy grew big and is even stronger than Ed. His hairdo contains 5 more hairs of which every hair ends with a half curl. He wears a long sleeved white shirt with a black t-shirt over it and his pants is also black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough his clothing would prospect he has a dark nature, Eddy still has his old habits like scamming people (more honest scams, only way too expensive to pay) and letting his friends get attacked if he could get away. He's the strongest teenager in the Cul-de-Sac, especially because of his big posture. Also because of this he grew quite fearless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdd's hairdo was awful because his parents didn't have the time to cut it properly. After Edd as a toddler tried to fix it himself, it turned out even worse and after his parent discovered his action they hid the scissors from their son and ordered him to visit the barber. But he never did because he didn't want any more humiliation, so hid his hairdo instead, without furter questions from his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdd's empty places are now fully covered and he traded his trademark hat for a smaller green one. He also wears his dad's special shirt that he used to wear when he was Edd's age, a black tie and purple trousers. Edd's behavior didn't change much either, since he still cares for others and has a great intellect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest change Ed received is getting glasses from his parents to help him stop looking \"crazy\". His striped shirt changed into a basic red one, and his green jacket has stayed the same, except with short sleeves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd didn't change through the years and is still as silly as he always was. Since his grades haven't improved either, Edd once asked the question how he actually passed the previous classes, on which Ed replied \"I got through because I wear glasses, Double D\". What means he actually did just because of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin hardly cares what's going on as long he can ride his shiny scooter and no one bothers him. He has a green cap with the letters SKL, even though nobody even knows what that means. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolf's hair grew a bit longer, but still has the same hairstyle. He wears a dark-green turtle neck sweater and tries to improve his English more, even though he fails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNazz wears a peach-pink sweater that hangs on her shoulders with a skirt (that resembles a Scottish skirt) and normal pants. She still has the same hairdo and she still steals everyone's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah likes to wear short tops, especially pink ones and tight pants. Also her hair grew incredibly long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tries more than ever to make Edd notice her. Now she has more problems since Jimmy started to shows signs of his love, his jealousy and almost hatred for Double D. She still likes yelling and is as fearless as Eddy, since she still tries to stomp Eddy whenever he irritates her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, her attacks all fail<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy tried to follow all the other \"cool\" kids of the Cul-de-Sac, and styled his hair, but he basically wears the same kind of clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy tries to be brave to impress Sarah even though he isn't good at it. There aren't many little things that scare Jimmy anymore, but he's no hero when he should be one. He still wants to play with dolls with Sarah even though he has the same age as the Eddies in the original series, which tires Sarah sometimes. Because Edd's new appearance got so many attention from everyone who's female, Jimmy often makes fun of him when he's not looking. Which is appreciated by Sarah, only because she loves Jimmy act like Edd because she loves Edd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonny turned a bit skinny but still has great health. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe listens to music alot ever since Plank left the scene. Nobody knows what happened (most don't care too) and whenever someone does ask, Jonny turns sweaty and nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eds tried to make him answer and tried to sell him a new friend (again), but both failed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee styled her hair and has improved her love for clothing with spots. She wears a white dress with red spots and clear white shoes, she's the opposite of Eddy, so it seems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee turned more annoying than she was and is even more fond of Eddy than she already was, because \"he's a REAL man\" now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay turned into a very fashionable girl since she never wears the same costume twice. Same goes for her hairdo's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she still fancies Ed, she's actually more busy with improving herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nno kill off any plz</td>",
