I got nothing to do all damn day\" Jack told Pete as they walked home from school. Pete had been over to Jack's house every day this week and although Pete really appreciated letting him use Jack's PlayStation 4 and letting him drink all Jack's booze, he was exhausted. Pete didn't get much sleep last night, and had three midterm exams today. He just wanted some alone time. Pete decided to let Jack down the easy way. \"I don't know if I could stand to see your ugly face for one more second, I'm going home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your face is ugly,\" Jack laughed, \"Tomorrow's Saturday and I know your not doing anything. Can you manage to stomach my ugly face then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, sure\" I replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Awesome, see you tomorrow,\" Jack said, and started walking towards his house. Pete felt a little bad, knowing how lonely it can be in Jack's big house all by himself, but he could't spend every day there. \"He'll be fine\" Pete thought, as he continued walking back to his house. Pete wondered who would be home, never getting there this early before. His mom's shifts are pretty long, so she won't be home for another hour. His sister Emily might be there or she might be out searching for a new apartment. His grandmother was definitely there, but she's probably taking one of her naps. Pete got excited at the possibility of some quiet in his house. It's not like he particularly disliked anyone he lived with, he honestly loved each one of them.  It's just they were all so loud. After a long day of school, Pete liked to just relax and listen to some music or maybe read a good book, but one of those ladies was either watching TV too loudly, practically yelling into a phone, or stomping across the house. Pete wondered if all of them had bad hearing and couldn't tell how obnoxious they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0VRRRR! Pete's vibrating phone interrupted his thoughts. He pulled it out of his pocket and looked at the caller id. *Mysterious Stranger (666)666-6666* \"Well, that's odd,\" Pete shrugged \"I probably changed my contacts when I got drunk last wednesday. Damn you past Pete!\". Pete hit answer and brought the phone to his ear. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They've changed, Peter.\" An unfamiliar voice whispered. Pete assumed this was just one of friends messing around with him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh hu, who's changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Someone you don't suspect,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god, is it you? I love you mysterious stranger, and I've been waiting to tell you all these years. Please tell me you feel the same...\" Dial tone. Pete laughed to himself, \"No one can prank call me, I'll ruin it every time,\". Pete was about to completely forgot the whole instance when he immediately got an emergency text from..</span></div></div>",

Doesn't sound good, Pete thought, worried that he might be in trouble. Although he couldn't recall doing anything wrong or at least not recently. His mother not usually being the strict type, she let most stuff slide. She only really got upset when Pete did something obviously wrong. Pete remembered how she blew up over him getting into a fight at school once. Pete got a lecture nearly ever day for a month after that. But he doubted anything like that was happening now. Unless she found the empty beer bottle in his room. Suddenly very worried, Pete sent his a quick confirmation text \"Am I in trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not right now,\" she responded. A rush of relief flew over Pete. Not wanting the feel the wraith of his mother for his secret new drinking habits. But if I'm not in trouble, than why does she need to see me? Pete wondered as he picked up the pace towards his house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom, I'm back,\" Pete exclaimed as he entered the house \"You wanted to talk or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, come to my room, honey,\" Pete's mother echoed from upstairs. Pete shuddered, he hated being called that. As he walked upstairs, thoughts flooded his head with what his mother wanted. Was she going to talk to him about college for the millionth time? Doubtful, Peter thought he made himself pretty clear to his mother that he was wasn't sure what he wanted to do after high school. Was it about girls? His mother has mentioned concern over the lack of women in his life. Again, probably not true either, Peter having told his mom many times he's just not very interested in the girls at his school. Was it about the mysterious stranger? Peter stopped and wondered why he thought was a possibility. That was clearly just some bad prank from some weirdo from school. Peter kept walking and shook the preposterous idea out of his head. He reached his mother's bedroom door and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come in,\" His mother soprano voiced answered. Peter opened the door and was greeted with his smiling mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://105.imagebam.com/download/M4sMNGFkeZuOaEuqSFVoGg/40210/402097719/dan004021003946002.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://105.imagebam.com/download/M4sMNGF...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, hey,\" Peter said, \"So, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, Peter.\" She smiled, \"The most amazing thing happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happened mom?\" Pete asked, growing concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, do you remember Cassandra?\" Pete tried his best not to roll his eyes. Cassandra was this nut job his mother started to spend time with about two years ago. His mother met Cassandra at a book signing, after Cassandra got kicked out for claiming that the author was an alien and kept screaming at her to \"Show your real face!\". Pete's mother initially spent time with her out of sympathy, seeing that Cassandra didn't really have any friends. Pete thought this was very noble of his mother and was proud of her, at least at the time. As time went on, Pete's mom seemed to believe Cassandra's conspiracies and magic crap more and more. She even started to do some kind of rituals over at Cassandra's house recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How could I forget Cassandra?\" Pete sighed, \"Last time I saw here she told me she painted her face so she wouldn't be recognized by goblins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can make your jokes, Peter. But to this day, she hasn't been attacked by any goblins,\" She looked at Pete matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You got me there, mom,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But that's besides the point,\" She said, as she picked up a rectangular box lying on her bed, \"Look what she gave me,\" She opened the box to reveal an necklace and a ring. The necklace was simple, just a silver chain with a perfectly spherical sapphire hanging from it. The ring on the other hand, had golden bands twisting and intertwining to creating a small halo. In the center of the ring, was a perfectly spherical ruby. Above the set of jewelry, embroidered into the box itself in deep emerald letters \"JOIN\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom, what is this?\" Pete asked, worried what Cassandra has told her this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This, Peter, is a magical set of jewelry,\" She said with excitement, \"If one person wears the necklace and another wears the ring, than they are both granted amazing powers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh come on, mom.\" Pete became very frustrated, \"This is ridiculous, do you really believe this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course I do,\" His mom's smile began to fade away, replaced with a frown, \"Cassandra promised me it would work. She's my friend and she wouldn't lie to me. You know, I could have decided to share this magic with anyone in the house, but no, I chose you. I thought you would appreciate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I don't\" Pete turned around, \"I'm gonna go to my room. Go bother Emily with your magic bullshit,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Peter, please,\" His mom sniffled, Peter could hear the tears coming but chose to ignore it. He couldn't enable these bizarre fantasies. As he was walked out of the room, he noticed an opened letter on his mothers armoire. The words on the page were the same deep emerald as they were in the box, \"Don't read that!\" His mother yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Or what? I'll be cursed,\" He ignored his mother's orders and began to read the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Jane<br>\r\nI know you feel your son no longer cares about you, but I have a strong feeling otherwise. You two just can't communicate and that problems stems from the both of you. If you don't do something quickly, you two might grow apart forever. Here is something to prevent that. Wear the necklace and tell Peter to wear the ring. You'll be closer than ever after that.<br>\r\nCassandra</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pete put the letter back down and looked back at his mother. \"Do you really feel that way?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We barely ever talk nowadays Peter. I mean, all you do is avoid me. You come home and you..\" She was interrupted by a Pete giving her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom, He said looking up at her, \"I just like my space. It has nothing to do with you. I love you just like I always have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh,\" She smiled, \"Good,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry I said all that stuff,\" He stepped back and sighed, \"And if you really want, we can try out this necklace and ring thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really?\" Her eyes brightened up, \"You mean it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure,\" Pete sighed, \"I still don't think it'll work though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just you wait and see young man,\" She laughed as she put on the necklace and handed Pete the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, uh,\" Pete said nervously as he slipped on the ring, \"What's it supposed to do,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not sure,\" She responded, \"Cassandra said I would understand when we wear them at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well we are wearing them at the same time, where's the magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm....\" She closed her eyes for a moment and her necklace began to glow bright blue. Oh shit, Pete thought as he looked down at his ring, which was glowing bright red. Very worried, Pete tried to take off the ring,  but it wouldn't budge. It was like it was super glued to his finger. He looked at his mother and she still had her eyes closed. Pete ran up to her and began to shake her shoulders, \"Mom!\" He yelled at her, trying to wake her from her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know the power,\" She opened her eyes and the necklace stopped glowing. Peter looked down at his ring and it had also stopped glowing. He looked back at his mother's face and she was smiling again. \"Peter, you may not like this, but... </span></div></div>",

Although he had just witnessed his mother's necklace and his ring glowing, he still doubted that this whole thing was real. \"And what was up with the light show earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you talking about?\" His mother responded, oblivious to what had happened while her eyes were closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, never mind,\" Pete said, abandoning the the thought entirely. He had hoped that his participation with the jewelry would help disprove some of his mother's beliefs in the supernatural but it only seemed to strengthen them. Pete was a little annoyed by his mother's stubbornness, but at least he could appreciate that she was doing this for him. After all, this whole magic thing was all just to get closer with him. With that in mind, Pete decided to play along. \"So, why would you want to swap bodies with me? How does that make us closer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh Peter, I don't really want to do that,\" Jane said, shaking her head, \"It's not like I chose the power I got. And I'm not sure how it's supposed to make us closer. Maybe if you spend a day in my shoes, you could understand my life better and vice versa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe,\" Pete rubbed his chin, \"So...what are you waiting for? Try it out, mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I was going to ask you if you were ready before doing anything,\" She said, turning serious again,\"Peter, are you really sure you want to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Totally,\" Pete shrugged, \"Swap our bodies,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't say I didn't warn you, Peter,\" Jane said, as she closed her eyes again. Once again Jane's necklace began to glow bright blue. Pete, no longer finding his mother's light up jewelry something to worry about, noticed that his ring was glowing bright red again. Pete assured himself that nothing was going to happen, the necklace was probably just rigged to glow when the wearer closes their eyes. <i>Magic doesn't exist</i> Pete thought, <i>So why am I so worried?</i>. Without warning, Jane necklaces started to glow ten times brighter. Besides his glowing Red ring, Pete couldn't see anything but bright blue. <i>It's like the sky.It's like I'm staring into the clear blue sky and nothing else.</i> Just before Pete could yell for his mother, the blue light began to fade away back into the necklace it came from. Only the necklace was no longer on Jane's body, but a very familiar looking teenage boy. \"Now way,\" Pete said in shock as he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://106.imagebam.com/download/WeJWhJl62BqfR-_02qeXZQ/40210/402097730/dan004021003946005.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://106.imagebam.com/download/WeJWhJl...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pete couldn't believe it. He was now in his own mother's body. Everything was so different. Even though his mother had put on heels, Pete's old body now stood at least 5 inches taller than his current one. Not yet ready to look his mother in the eye, <i>I can feel the \"I told you so\" coming</i>,Pete looked back down at his mother's body. From this new angle, it was hard to deny that his mother wasn't attractive. Pete and his sister would always make fun of their mom for taking as long as she did to get ready for the day. She would wake up early, exercise for 45 minutes, shower, then spend 45 more minutes doing her daily ritual in front of the mirror. Although it seemed ridiculous to Pete at the time, he could at least now appreciate all the hard work his mother has done to stay in shape. Although most of his view was blocked by his mother's bountiful cleavage, he could still see a little bit of Jane's slim stomach and shapely legs. <i>That's mom's cleavage you\u2019re staring at,</i> Pete reminded himself, as he noticed a long stray hair in front of his face. As Pete pushed it aside, his hand met his mother's long black hair. Pete then ran his hands through his mother's hair, admiring it's length and volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://107.imagebam.com/download/zDsb0-jKM7SbZunw1FYSGw/40210/402097754/dan004021003946012.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://107.imagebam.com/download/zDsb0-j...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahem,\" Pete was interrupted by his Jane, now inhabiting his body, \"I told you it was going to happen,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess...\" Pete put his manicured hand to his throat, surprised by his mother's high and lovely voice, \"I guess you were right. Mom,  this is crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know, right?\" Jane smiled, and flexed a muscle, \"I'm so big and strong now.

Much more delicate than I was before. I also feel like I'm unbalanced as hell. Did you have to wear heels today?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I didn't get dressed thinking how comfortable my son would be in my body,\" Jane shook her head at her son's reasoning, \"I didn't get the package from Cassandra until this afternoon. Besides, you'll get used to heels eventually,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eventually?\" Pete asked bewildered, \"How long do you plan to keep me this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well it's funny you mention that,\" Jane replied, still focused on her bicep, \"You see, the swap...\"</span></div></div>",

I doubt anyone but Cassandra would believe us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom, I'm having trouble matching your optimism here,\" Pete pointed a finger at his new face, \"You honestly don't think anything bad will happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" Jane stopped mid-sentence, as her eyes went wide, \"Wait a minute, what day is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's Friday,\" Pete rolled his eyes, \"What, is Friday not a good body swapping day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Actually Peter, no it is not,\" Jane said, as she began to nervously chew on her fingernails, \"Friday is incredible inconvenient for me,\":<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Inconvenient? Are you fucking kidding me!?\" Pete asked furiously, , \"How can you look at me with a straight face and say that? Look at me, mom! I'm a middle aged woman! I didn't sign up for this! Literally no one else has ever been more inconvenienced than me right now,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Watch your language while you're in my body,\" Jane ordered her dumbfounded son, \"And you did sign up for this. The moment you put on that ring, you accepted the possibilities. Now I know this isn't an ideal situation for you, and now, it's not ideal for me either, but we gotta stick with it. I'm going to go see Cassandra to see if she can switch us back sooner, or else today will be a whole lot harder for the both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, you're leaving?\" Pete watched his mother walk towards the bedroom door, \"You can't just leave me like this! What am I supposed to do if someone comes up here to talk to me or if someone calls your phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, you're fine,\" Jane brushed off Pete's concerns as she twisted the doorknob, \"Grandma's asleep and Emily\u2019s at a friends house. You can just ignore my phone, I can afford to miss a few calls. I'll only be gone for a little bit, I'm sure you'll survive. Just don't do anything I wouldn't do.\" And with that, Jane left a very confused Pete in her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't believe this,\" Pete was blown away, finding it hard to grasp the situation. One moment, he was a regular teenage guy, and the next he was a busty older woman. <i>Alright</i> Pete tried to think calm thought, <i>Just relax. Maybe sit down</i>. Pete decided that was good idea, and took a seat to relax his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://108.imagebam.com/download/akQfnQgGrPZ8oXHLT0jRkw/40210/402097770/dan004021003946016.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://108.imagebam.com/download/akQfnQg...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>This isn't so bad,</i> Pete tried to convince himself, <i>I'm just sitting down like usual. Just chilling. I can barely tell a difference.</i> Pete found himself staring up the ceiling, it being the only angle in his sight where he couldn't see any changes. But even looking up was a challenge now with this new body. His mother's breasts were so large, that just bending his head up slightly put immense strain on his neck. <i>So much for denial</i> Pete rubbed the back of his neck with his hand. There was no way Pete could ever pretend like things were normal, at least not for twelve more hours. He was his own mother now, there no way past that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well fuck,\" Pete said out loud in defeat, \"This is happening and I need to accept it,\". Pete, now self-motivated, looked back down at his new body. He had only taken a glance before, but in order to truly grasp the reality of it all, he needed to understand this was who he was now, or at least the moment. <i>Can't just not look at myself</i> Pete reassured himself, as he looked over his mother's body. Pete decided it was best to examine small things and work his way up to his mother's more noticeable parts. He started with her skin, noticing how smooth it was for a women her age. Not perfect by any means, but still pretty smooth. Pete realized how much darker his new skin was in comparison to his old body. Pete was mixed, with his father being Caucasian and his mother being mostly African. He had often wondered what he would look like if his complexion was darker, always assuming it would make him more of a ladies man. \"Not what I meant by ladies man\" Pete laughed at his own stupid joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Pete was starting to get more comfortable with the idea of being his mother, \"Maybe this won't be so horrible,\" Pete brought his new hands up to his face for closer inspection. His mother's hands had such thin and dainty fingers. Pete hands were much bigger and rigid in comparison. Pete wondered how hard he could punch in mother's body, or if would have any affect at all. <i>I'd probably break a nail</i> Pete chuckled as he moved over to his new fingernails. Pete had a nasty habit of biting his fingernails for as long as he can remember. To have nails this long was a little mind racking for Pete, but he shrugged it off as just one more tiny thing to get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh man,\" Pete sighed, as he couldn't avoid getting an eyeful of his mother's cleavage through the empty spaces between his fingers. He knew this was coming but was hoping he could stall before having to face them just yet. \"No, now's the time,\" Pete told himself, \"You have tits, now. Time to get over it.\". With that, Pete moved his hands out of the way, and tried to take in the view. Pete, again, was shocked by the sheer size of them. Pete remembered overhearing his mother talking to someone on the phone about how she got asked if her boobs were real or not. She was terribly offended by the question and assured whoever she was talking to that they were in fact real. <i>They look real enough to me</i> Pete thought as he ran his eyes up and down his mother's cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Maybe I need to get a closer look?</i> Pete continued to stare blankly at his mother's boobs, <i>Not that I want to see anything! I just need to do this in order to accept it. That's it. I'm not some creepy guy who wants to see his own mother's boobs!</i> Pete's thoughts weren\u2019t so convincing but he moved forward anyways, as he pulled back part of his mother's shirt, exposing her bra clad breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://105.imagebam.com/download/pxzr7T4Kr3IMMWzLXeTmSw/40210/402097804/dan004021003946024.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://105.imagebam.com/download/pxzr7T4...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa,\" was all that Pete could mutter, amazed at the tight, beautifully designed fabric around what was now his boob.

He opened it, revealing a full length mirror nailed to the opposite side of the closet door. Pete was met a with a slightly flustered, but excited reflection of his mother looking back at him. <i>I might as well get a good look while I'm doing it,</i> Pete ran his eyes over his new reflection, <i>In order to get used to my new body,</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where should I start?\" Pete was trying to think of what to take off first, \"Might as well take off this skirt. I can barely move with this thing on\". Pete reached his hands to the hem of his mother's pencil skirt. Right as he was about to pull it down, Pete decided to turn around, getting a better look at his mother's backside in the reflection. <i>Can't accept it if I don't see it,</i> Pete thought as he stared at his new shapely rear and pulled down the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://106.imagebam.com/download/Y3c8xxILjnQ9fFtpwL3scA/40210/402097834/dan004021003946032.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://106.imagebam.com/download/Y3c8xxI...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Geez,\" Pete's view of his mother took his breath away, \"Mom's ass is huge!\". Pete couldn't take his eyes away from his new large butt.The countless squats his mother did every morning really having paid of. If Pete had seen this ass on anyone else, he might have called it amazing, but the fact it was his mother's brought him back to reality. Slightly ashamed of drooling over his own mother's ass, Pete focused on taking the skirt completely off. It was a little difficult for him to step out of the skirt while wearing his mother's heels, but he managed and tossed the constrictive material on the bedroom floor. Pete was immediately more comfortable, his mother's thighs no longer being confined so closely together. Turning back to mirror, Pete now had the front view of his mother's pantie clad body. Lewd thoughts again filled Pete's head, as he ran his fingers through the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://107.imagebam.com/download/8anM3z9W1UQj3lKEc50MLw/40210/402097845/dan004021003946036.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://107.imagebam.com/download/8anM3z9...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So soft...\" Pete felt the smooth material in between his fingers and a sudden realization hit him, \"Oh my god, I'm wearing a thong!\" Pete was too mesmerized by his new ass to notice before, but he was wearing women's underwear. <i>I mean...</i> Pete felt stupid, <i>I don't know what I was expecting, but it's not like Mom was going to wear boxers.</i> Any shred of masculinity Pete had left was now gone. Pete quickly shook the negative thoughts out of his head, and reassured himself that point of getting undressed in the first place was to get more comfortable. And maybe in order to get comfortable, he would need abandon ideas of being a man altogether. At least while in his mother's body, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But she just had to wear a thong, didn't she?\" Pete complained, as he unsuccessfully tried to pinch his underwear out from riding his new ass, \"So that explains the wedgie I've been feeling this whole time,\" Pete looked closer at the panties he was wearing, admiring the beautiful flower design. It looked like it was matching set to the bra he had, based off the glimpse down his shirt earlier. Pete wondered why his mother had on such fancy undies, they almost looked like lingerie. <i>Why would mom just walk around with lingerie underneath her clothes?</i> Pete looked even closer at the thong, <i>Wait, is this thing see-though?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oookay,\" Pete shot his eyes up, not nearly reading to see the vagina he currently had, \"Time for the shirt.\" Pete, trying to forget the slight glimpse of his new downstairs, gripped the bottom of his mother's low cut top. Pulling upwards, Pete's hands ran into his mother's breasts. Having to slowly pull the shirt over these massive obstacles, Pete practically ripped the shirt off once they were out of the way. He tossed the shirt out of the way and tried to take in the semi nude reflection of his mother's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://106.imagebam.com/download/9rJWObfLq20MURTz5OPA2g/40210/402097882/dan004021003946047.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://106.imagebam.com/download/9rJWObf...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Pete breathed heavily, awestruck at the image before him, \"This isn't so bad. Could be a lot worse. Who knows what that stupid jewelry could have done to me. I could have been turned into a toad, for all I know. Compared to that, maybe being mom isn't so bad,\". Pete couldn't help but stare at the large breasts, encased within the intricate bra. \"No,\" Pete mischievously grinned, \"This isn't bad at all,\".</span></div></div>",

I mean, if I'm ever going to be comfortable in this body, I should see everything.\" Pete felt fairly justified, as he reached behind his back and tried to unhook his mother's bra. Easier said than done, Pete found out, as he struggled with clasps. Never having gotten anywhere near second base before, Pete didn't really have the opportunity to pick up the skill of unhooking a bra. After a couple failed attempts, Pete accidentally pinched and separated the right spot, and the bra practically shot off of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god!\" Pete practically yelled, as he marveled over the two wonderful breasts before him. Pete had never seen a naked pair of breasts (at least not in real life) before and he never imagined that first ones he would see would be so amazing. They were huge, decently perky, and just right kind of nipple size. If Pete had to describe what would the perfect boobs look like, these wouldn't be too far off. They were so great in fact, that it didn't seem to bother Pete that they actually were his Mother's. <i>Shouldn't I be grossed out by this?</i> Pete wondered, as he twisted his torso to get a profile view, <i>Maybe that just means the exploring is working. This is my body right now, not mom's. Is it so wrong to admire my own body?</i> Out of curiosity, Pete placed both of his hands underneath his impressive bust and tested the it's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://108.imagebam.com/download/gA5TmApQ4YlhjHIjvxOojQ/40210/402097943/dan004021003946063.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://108.imagebam.com/download/gA5TmAp...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Holy shit!\" Pete said with a smile, \"These things are heavy,\" Pete made note that although he certainly appreciated the view, his mother's lower back would probably be really sore without the support of a bra for long periods of time. Pete decided to worry about that later, as he continued to play around with his two new favorite toys. He removed his hands,  wondering how gravity would affect his new chest. The result was something between dramatic, arousing, and most of all, amusing. Pete, loving the sight of his mother's tits in motion, continued to find every possible way he could make them jiggle. He rotated his shoulders, shook his chest and even jumped up and down. Pete found that each method had it's own unique bounce effect, but all them were equally entertaining to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is better than everything on the internet,\" Pete laughed, as he reached a hand up to his right breast, \"But I wonder how sensitive they are,\" Pete's hand wasn't nearly big enough to cover the whole breast, but tried his best regardless. With a playful squeeze, Pete felt a wave of pleasure go through out his whole body. An involuntary moan escaped his lips, blown away at how incredibly sensitive his tits were. Finding himself unable to stop, he continued to squeeze the breast. Moaning even more so, Pete's other hand had started squeezing the other, unoccupied boob as well. The combined sensation was some kind of sexual intensity Pete had never felt in his entire life. A kind of pleasure Pete didn't even think was possible. But it only increased when he looked back at his reflection. Once Pete had started groping his boobs, he had lost himself in some kind of blissful daze. Now bringing his attention back to the mirror in front of him, he could truly admire the image before him. With the visual aid of a gorgeous older woman playing with her breasts, Pete practically felt like he was going to explode at any second. But before Pete could reach whatever boob oriented climax he was building up to, he stopped immediately due to strange dampness he felt in his mother's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Did I just wet myself?\" Pete was embarrassed, before he realized the obvious, \"Oh that's just my, I mean, mom's vagina.\" Pete shuddered at the thought of accidentally referring to the lady parts as his own, but decided to worry about that later. Although Pete should have expected something like this would naturally happen if he fooled around with his new body, he was too preoccupied playing with his other parts to think about it. Now that he had momentarily stopped caressing his tits, Pete realized that the part of his mother's body that demanded his attention more so than anythings was not his breasts, but his crotch. <i>Maybe I got pretty carried away with this whole thing,</i> Pete thought, as he looked up at his Mother's face in the mirror, <i>Even if this is my body now, full out masturbating seems like a lot. I've gone pretty far, maybe I should draw the line here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck that!\" Pete smirked, way too horny at the moment to care about morality, \"Let's do this thing!\". Pete positioned his mother's closet mirror so it had a good view of the couch she had in her room. Pete then giddily made his way to the sofa and made himself comfortable. Making sure he was in direct reflection of the mirror, Pete spread his legs in order to get the best possible view. <i>Alright, everything is set,</i> Pete mentally prepared himself, as his hand reached down the front of his thong, <i>Let's see what Momma's got!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright sweetheart, I've got some bad news,\" Jane said as she barged into the room, back turned, making sure no one saw her enter, \"It turns out we are going to be stuck like th-OH MY GOD!\" Turning around, Jane was startled at the sight of her own body, occupied by her son, just moments away from masturbating. Absolutely mortified, Pete couldn't move a muscle. He was so incredibly embarrassed, that he couldn't wiggle a toe if he tried. Unfortunately, this left him in the already awkward position of being in his mother's nearly naked body, with one of her hands millimeters away from her vagina. But no matter how uncomfortable it had been, it only grew more so as the only thing Pete could do was stare at his male body like a deer stuck in headlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://105.imagebam.com/download/U5r19Kzu_qgxRuI2btcaMA/40210/402097953/dan004021003946065.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://105.imagebam.com/download/U5r19Kz...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um...Mom, let me explain.\" Pete managed to stutter out the beginning of an explanation, but drew a blank. He couldn't think of anything reasonable to say, or at least something that would make him sound innocent. Pete could say he took off his clothes in order to familiarize himself with his new body, but he wasn't sure that was actually true and it wouldn't explain why he was about to jack off in his mother's body. Anyway you sliced it, it just looked like Pete was a huge pervert. Hanging his head, Pete awaited any kind of punishment his mother deemed fair, when suddenly Jane...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing but sex on their mind, 24/7. And anyone with a healthy sexual drive would be interested in seeing what it's like for the opposite gender. I just thought it would take you longer to be that comfortable with my body, but boy was I wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh,\" Pete sighed, relieved he had avoided the wrath of his mother, but still found the situation to be incredibly awkward, \"Mom, despite your, uh, blessing, this is still really embarrassing for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh sweetheart, there's nothing to be embarrassed about,\" Jane tried her best to sound comforting, \"Look, I'm sorry for laughing, that was inappropriate. I was just very surprised is all. I want you to know there is nothing wrong with experimentation and you have nothing to be ashamed about. Why don't you put my clothes back on and meet me by the dinner table? We have important things to talk about. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, mom,\" Pete said sheepishly. A satisfied Jane smiled and left the room. The moment the bedroom door closed, Pete did the fastest facepalm of his life. Once in fifth grade while Pete was presenting a book report, the local school bully ran up the classroom and pulled down Pete's pants in front of everybody. All Pete's friends, Pete's crush, and even the teacher all saw him in his tighty whities. Up until this moment, that had been the single most embarrassing moment in Pete's life, but this couldn't possibly compare to that. No matter how cool his mother was with it, it didn't fix that fact that she caught him masturbating with her own body. <i>This is the worst,</i> Pete couldn't believe how he got into this mess, <i>How am I ever going to look mom in the eyes again/</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing no point in dwelling on his humiliation forever, Pete decided to get dressed, not wanting to keep his mother waiting. <i>She'll probably think I'm still playing around</i> Pete thought, as picked up the bra he let fall to the ground.  Pete then placed each breast into it's respective cup and pull the straps over his shoulders. He tried to pull the clasps behind his back, but the bra wouldn't cooperate. Looking back down at his mother's expansive cleavage, Pete sighed as he encountered his first disadvantage of having large tits. Pete pulled back once more, this time with extra oomph, and managed to succeed in clasping the pesky thing. With that out of the way, Pete had no trouble putting the rest of the clothes on. Pulling the skirt up his waist with ease, and pulling the shirt on over his head. Although everything felt right, Pete wanted to check his reflection just to make sure he didn't screw anything up. \"Everything seems to be in order,\" Pete said, as he struck a pose, \"All things considered, I guess that could've gone a whole lot worse. At least she isn't angry,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://108.imagebam.com/download/SAjj3UoifelH58_-2-QuDw/40210/402097716/dan004021003946001.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://108.imagebam.com/download/SAjj3Uo...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't think I'm ever going to get used to this reflection,\" Pete chuckled, but stopped as he realized something, \"Oh my god, the mirror was out the whole the time and she didn't notice!\" Pete knew know that his mother was completely fine with him exploring her body, but he had no idea how she might react if she knew he was getting off while watching it happen. <i>She would think I'm some kind of sick pervert if she saw this thing out!</i> Pete was beginning to panic, but tried his best to calm himself <i>But she didn't see it. There's nothing to worry about, she just thinks I was curious. I gotta relax.</i> Pete took a deep breath and closed the closet door. Bracing himself, Pete then left his mother's bedroom and headed towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, Peter, there you are,\" Jane said, as Pete entered the kitchen, \"Take a seat please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Pete did as he was told and sat down across from his mother at the dining table. Pete found himself looking down at the table, still too ashamed to make eye contact with his old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, keep those hands above the table, mister!\" Jane teased, \"No more funny business down there, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom!\" Pete blushed deeply, \"Can you knock it off with the jokes please? They aren't making this any easier for me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh honey, I was just trying to lighten up the mood. Jeez, you're uptight,\" Jane brushed off her son's comments, as her tone grew more serious, \"Listen Peter, I've got some bad news. I've talked to Cassandra and she has confirmed that when we swap bodies, we can't swap back for twelve hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No way!\" Pete whined, \"I have to be like this for twelve more hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well no, it's more like 10 more hours now, since we swapped a while ago,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, great, only 10 more hours stuck looking like my own mother. That's not so bad!\" Pete yelled sarcastically, \"How could this possibly get any worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey buster, you didn't seem to mind having my body a couple minutes ago,\" Jane reminded her son, whose cheeks turned a shade of red again, \"And it actually can be much worse, for your information,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you talking about, Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well you see, Peter...\"Jane paused for moment, searching for the right words to say, \"When your father passed away, may he rest in peace, it was hard to support you and your sister by my salary alone. Sure, your father's life insurance helped a little, but that ran out eventually. We were barely scraping by each month, but I managed. But then, Grandma needed a place to stay and how could I say no? I love that woman to death, but her medical expenses alone were going to make me bankrupt. So I had to pick up another job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom, I didn't know we were doing so bad,\" Pete suddenly felt very guilty asking for those expensive birthday presents earlier this year, \"But why have you kept it a secret? Emily and I wouldn't think any less of you just for having a second job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I'm not so sure you and your sister would alright with what I do,\" Jane chuckled uneasily, \"It's not very ladylike,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh come on, Mom,\" Pete said, \"It's no big deal. A lot of people do jobs they didn't see themselves ever doing, but that doesn't make it wrong. Whatever it is you do, I promise I won't judge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Seriously?\" Jane perked up, \"No judgement? None at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well you didn't judge me earlier, for doing stuff,\" Pete mumbled the last part, not comfortable enough to talk about what happened in detail just yet, \"So it's only far, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I guess so. I don't think the two are very comparable though,\" Jane scratched her head, \"Alright, Peter, my second job is...\"</span></div></div>",

Pete knew what he heard, but needed to hear it again just to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm a professional webcam model, Pete,\" Jane said, trying to make it sound as normal as possible, \"Back when I was started getting desperate for money, I got contacted by one of my old college friends. When I first met him, he was a photography major and used me as a model to build up his portfolio. While we parted ways, he somehow managed to get himself his own studio. It just so happens that his studio primarily creates adult films. When I told him I was down on my luck, he offered me a job as one of his models.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And you just said yes!?!\" Pete couldn't believe what his mother was saying, \"Jesus, Mom, You're a cam girl!

What happened to the whole no judgement thing?\" Jane defensively reminded her son, \"And yes, I did take the job. The money was good and I wasn't in a place to say no. He promised me I never had to do anything I wasn't comfortable with and that he would provide me with all the materials necessary. And to be honest, Peter, I kind of like it. It's easy, gives me an excuse to dress up, and I can sit back and literally watch the money flow in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I just...\" Pete couldn't find the words, \"I just can't believe this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's true, Peter,\" Jane grabbed her son's nearby laptop and opened an internet browser, \"Look, I'll show you,\" After a few quicks taps on the keyboard, Jane had arrived at her destination. Spinning the laptop around, Pete could see a picture of his mother in just a large white, button up shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://114.imagebam.com/download/57AGzf_0trywF_HRuHeYVw/43639/436380138/tumblr_mlhc36UfXg1r4tl3bo1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://114.imagebam.com/download/57AGzf_...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Busty Beatrice?\" Pete read out loud the text under the image, the only part of the webpage that was his mother practically naked, \"Who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's my online persona,\" Jane sighed, \"My boss came up with it, I'm not a huge fan of it either. Keep reading, all the details are there,\"  Pete scrolled past the image and found a long paragraph explaining what people got into when they signed up for an account. Pete only skimmed through it, but it all seemed legit. Same stuff he had seen on similar sites, like how it was all confidential and how you were just a credit card number away from good time. Lining the sides of the paragraphs were still images captured from what looked like Jane's previous streams. Clearly there to further entice someone to sign up. Usually these kind of pictures of his mother would have been enough to make Pete hurl on any regular day, but after what he saw upstairs, he couldn't help but admire his mom's body now. <i>Hell, mom probably does really well with this stuff,</i> Pete thought, as he scrolled back up to the first picture, <i>I wonder if she has any pre recorded videos...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom!\" Pete accidentally shouted, making his mother jump. Pete slapped the laptop closed, in order to prevent any more of the strange thoughts he was having, and took a deep breath, \"Mom, I just don't know how to feel about this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, Peter, I'm not so sure how you're supposed to feel about this,\" Jane placed a reassuring hand on Pete's shoulder, \"But you need to know that I only did this for you and your sister. I love you two more than anything in the world and I would be willing to do anything for you guys. I want you to know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know. I love you too, mom\" Pete exhaled, looking back at his old face, \"It's just a lot to take at once. I'm sorry if I overreacted, this is just kind of changing the image I have of you in my head. But I know you have your reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh good, that's good,\" Jane put a hand up to her chest, like a huge weight had just been lifted, \"I had this sinking suspicion you were going to hate me after I told you this,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, come on, Mom,\" Pete said, \"I could never hate you. Sure this is...uh, weird, right now, but I'll get over it. Eventually. And so will Emily when you tell her. I don't even know if she would mind at all, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I'm not going to tell her,\" Jane crossed her arms, \"And neither will you. I would have liked to keep this a secret but I had to tell you, because otherwise we would both be in big trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you talking about?\" Pete asked, \"What trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Well you see...\" Jane started to fiddle with her thumbs, \"When I signed the contract with my college friend, he made me agree to one rule: That at least once a week, at an agreed upon time, I would put up a half hour live show. He said I could do additional shows throughout the week and I do, but the agreed time has to happen, every week. And we decided that the time would be 10:00 pm on Friday.\" Pete's eyes went wide, as his mother continued, \"I'm so sorry Pete. I had completely forgotten what day it was. If i knew it was Friday, I would have swapped our bodies some other time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Holy crap, mom! That means you are supposed to be on in...\" Pete looked up at the kitchen clock, \"Less than an hour? Oh, man, are you going to get fired?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Well...\" Jane trailed off, looking hopefully at her son, \"As I am right now, I don't think my usual customers would appreciate me like they usually do. You on the other hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god,\" Pete groaned, \"You cannot be suggesting what I think you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Before you make a decision, hear me out,\" Jane began to explain, \"If you do this one thing, you would be helping this family more than you have ever before. Imagine earning 3 months worth of wages from any of those crappy fast food jobs you've had in a mere half hour. And all of that money goes to good use, I don't spend a dime of it. I know this may seem gross to you, being in my body and all that, but this is incredibly important. If you don't do this, not only will I love this job, but I won't even be able to afford groceries. That website is this family's lifeline and I'm asking you to fill my part. Will you please do this, Peter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Geez, mom\" was all Pete could say. His mother just asked him to parade her body online for money. Some extremely pornographic act, that his mother apparently did all the time, was now his duty to perform. As if the pressure of now being the sole source of income for his entire family wasn't enough as it is, Pete would somehow have to presume the role of a cam girl on the spot. <i>I could never do this, this is a ridiculous thing to ask a son to do,</i> Pete's thoughts were going a 1,000 miles per second, <i>But if I don't do this, we wont be able to afford anything! Shit! What do I do?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Considering his options carefully and understand the repercussions, Pete decides to...</span></div></div>",

I'll do it, but man, do you owe me big time for this,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh thank god! And I do owe you, very much so,\" Jane said with relief, as she then grabbed her son's wrist, \"But we can talk about all of that later. We don't have a whole a lot of time. We need to go get you ready. Follow me,\" Jane then lead her son back towards the stairwell. Pete was expecting his mother to lead him back towards her bedroom, but was surprised when she had stopped towards the attic door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The attic?\" Pete asked his mother, \"We aren't going to your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I guess there's no point in hiding this either,\" Jane shrugged, as she used an unfamiliar key to unlock the door. Pete followed her up the steps and found that instead of the dusty, cobweb ridden attic he was always told to avoid, was actually some elaborate sex studio. At one end of the room was a collection of neatly organized sex toys and at the other end was decorated couch, with cameras pointing at it from all different angles. Pete also noticed 4 large dressers next to each other, with their own individual label. There was \"Lingerie\", \"Secretary\", \"Leather\", and \"Other\". Despite his interest in what was inside the \"Other\u201d dresser, Pete was shocked once more, by the discovery of this lair of perversion. Right above his own head, his mother was recording herself getting off, letting who knows how many people watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Heh,\" Jane let out an awkward giggle after seeing her son's expression, \"Didn't you ever wonder why I didn't want you going into the attic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course, mom,\" Pete put a hand on his forehead, still blown away by his surroundings, \"I just didn't expect all of this. Why here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well it's sound proof, for one thing,\" Jane noted, \"And I didn't have to worry about anyone accidentally stumbling into it. And judging from the look on your face, it was probably the right thing to do. Now, no more questions, we have work to do. The outfit I was planning on wearing tonight is laid out on the couch. Go put it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, why?\" Pete asked, not wanting to change clothes right after getting used to the stuff he had on, \"What's wrong with what I'm wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well first off, those are my regular clothes. I have special clothing for shows,\" Jane explained impatiently, \"And secondly, my manager and I agree on every outfit I perform in that day. And we decided on those. Now get to it, we're running out of time,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OK OK,\" Pete groaned as he made his way to the bed, \"But can you turn around while I get dressed, I would like to at least pretend I have some privacy,\" Although Jane didn't see any point in it, she complied and turned to face the opposite wall. Pete moved past the cameras and saw his new attire neatly laid out on the cushions. It was a crimson lingerie set, including a shawl, high heels, stockings with matching garter belt, a thong, and a bustier. Pete heavily sighed as he looked over the lingerie, knowing full well his mother's body was going to barely fit into this thing and how that was kind of the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pete, reminding himself he was on a deadline, quickly pulled off his blouse and skirt. Pete knew if he looked down at his new body, he was just going to get turned on again and get distracted. So Pete tried his very best to focus on the ceiling, while he removed the bra, panties and stockings. Kicking off his heels, Pete was now fully nude in his new body for the first time, something he was desperate to be twenty minutes ago. Frustrated he didn't have time to enjoy it, Pete looked away from the ceiling to the outfit on the bed. Pete decided to start with the stockings and garter belt. Without the ceiling to distract him, Pete tried to find something else to take his mind off being in his busty mother's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, uh, mom,\" Pete said, struggling not to look down at his body, as he shimmied the garter belt up his thighs, \"If I'm supposed to be wearing this stuff, why were you wearing that, um, fancy underwear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, Are you talking about the flowery ones,\" Jane said, like she had just remembered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, those ones,\" Pete said, who had successfully put on the stockings, and was now pulling up the thong, \"It seemed strange to me you were wearing them. Doesn't seem very comfortable,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well Peter, I guess there's no point in keeping anymore secrets with you,\" Jane sighed, as Pete struggled to pull the bustier over his mother's breasts, \"Truth is I am comfortable in that. I only really dress in what most women would consider normal underwear when I'm in a bad mood. Any other day, I'm usually wearing lingerie under my casual clothes. It's the way I've dressed for most of my life. I'm not entirely sure why, but I guess it just makes me feel powerful beautiful. It's really not as weird as it sounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nothing sounds that weird anymore after what I've been through today,\" Pete said, putting on the shawl and slipping his feet into the heels, \"Alright all done. Did I do alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/danamrk/3351969/759126373/donna_s1-005.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/danam...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Perfect,\" Jane smiled at her lingerie clad body, \"Weirdly perfect actually. Must be my body's instincts or something. No matter, we have 10 minutes left. Sit down there and I'll give you a little makeup.\" Pete did as he was told and sat down on the couch while his old body approached him with a makeup kit and began applying light touch ups to his new face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So  how does this whole thing work?\" Pete asked while his mother worked on his eyelashes, \"It's like a live stream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, it's a live show,\" Jane said, as she applied lipstick to her old lips, \"Members of the site pay 20 cents per minute to watch the show. There's a chat feature, where members can send compliments or requests. I usually ignore that if I'm busy. Sometimes certain wealthy members will request a private stream, which is more expensive, but I will usually do whatever they tell me to, as long as is it doesn't go against my rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your rules?\" Pete inquired, as his mother finished up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's a list of things I'm not willing to do.\" Jane said, as she closed up her makeup kit, \"I don't do anything with urine or fecal matter, I don't do anything involving animals, and I don't preform with other models.  Everything else I can manage, but you don't need to worry about that. You're just going to a do a simple stream. Now let me hook it up for you,\" Jane then turned on the the laptop that was in the center of the cameras and did some quick typing. Having done it hundreds of times before, Jane only took 30 seconds to connect to the website.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, that about does it,\" Jane turned back to Pete and pointed towards two monitors and a camera, \"Today we will be using the center camera, as I thought it would be easiest for you. Make sure you focus on the camera or at least face towards it. Now the monitor on the right has the chat on it, you can ignore it if you like or you can use the messages as hints on what to do. And the monitor on the left will be a reflected image of yourself, just so you know you're not making a stupid face or something. When the monitors turn on, that's when you'll know your live. You're on in 5 minutes. Good luck, Peter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa whoa, wait!\" Pete stammered as his mother walked away, \"You're just leaving? I still have questions! When do I know it's over? What do I do if someone wants a private stream? And more importantly, what the hell do I do? I've never done this before mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Calm  down, Peter.\" Jane said over her shoulder as she headed down the stairs, \"You have to stream for at least 20 minutes. You can go longer if you'd like. I don't think anyone will request a private show, that's only happened to me 4 times in 4 years. But if it does happen, you can just ignore it. And as for what to do, don't be ridiculous. You know what to do. Hell, you knew the term cam girl in the first place. You've probably seen this kind of stuff before, so just copy what you saw those anonymous girls you see online do. Besides...\" Jane grinned, \"You weren't having any trouble when I caught you in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Leaving her son in an embarrassed silence, Jane exited the attic. With his cheeks still red, Pete had no choice but to wait for his fate.  If someone would have told him yesterday that today he would be turned into his own mother and then be forced to parade her scantily clad body in front of countless strangers on the internet, he doubted he would have been prepared. <i>Oh my god,</i> Pete couldn't help but chuckle at the ridiculousness of the situation, as he took his first glance at the outfit he now had on, <i>This is so crazy. No one would ever believe me if I told them this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two monitors in front of Pete began to flicker. <i>Guess that means this is about to start</i> Pete tried his best to collect himself, <i>I can do this. I've got to do this. This isn't a big deal, I've must have seen 20 different videos of girls doing this. How hard can it be?</i></span></div></div>",

Just as his mother had said, the right screen turned on to a familiar sight of random people sending messages. The common lude, unappealing comments he had seen countless times before. Pete looked at the left screen, and saw the image of his mother, standing perfectly still in lingerie. Seeing his mother's body from this angle felt very different from seeing it reflected in the mirror. When Pete was fooling around in front of the mirror, it had felt more like his mother's body was now his. Like it was just the way things were and there was nothing wrong with checking out his new goods. But now, with this camera perspective, he felt like some weird pervert, peeping on his own mother. <i>No, can't think like that</i> Pete thought, trying to remain focused, <i>I'll worry about the implications of this later</i> Pete then realized he had just been awkwardly standing this whole time. Acting like a deer stuck in headlights,, Pete had been doing absolutely nothing for about a minute. Everything he had remembered other cam girls doing he had now forgotten, making him utterly helpless. Panicking, Pete resorted to asking the chat what they would like to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, uh, guys,\" Pete said, not sure how is mother referred to her viewers, \"So what do you want me to do?\" Almost immediately, the chat exploded with responses. Pete only managed to read a couple of the ones scrolling by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Cyclops33</span>;Just do something!<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\">MilfLover96</span>:I've been waiting all week to see that ass!<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">Eros</span>: Is it just me, or is something off with her today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Ass!</i> Pete noticed one significant word among the flurry of messages, <i>People just want to see mom's ass, I can do that!</i> Pete then turned himself, so his new rear was in the direct view of the camera. For extra measure, Pete decided to bend over, trying to give the viewers the best possible ass shot he could give them. Pete turned his head and smiled at the positive response he was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/danamrk/3351969/1831081898/donna_s1-008.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/danam...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Just give the pervs what they want,</i> Pete grinned, as he looked over at the reflection screen, <i>Hell, who can blame them? That ass is breathtaking. If this wasn't my mom , I'd probably want to see this too.</i> And suddenly, a light bulb went off in Pete's head. <i>What I want to see..</i> Pete thought as he sat down on the couch to concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/danamrk/3351969/1736007951/donna_s1-010.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/danam...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>All this time, I've been worrying about what mom would do or what the viewer would want to see, I never even thought about what I would like to see,</i> Pete thought, as he made sure to show off his legs, so the viewers wouldn't get bored. Pete realized that the unique position he was in gave him an incredible advantage. Being a straight male trapped in a voluptuous older woman's body meant he could make her body doing anything he wanted. Obviously, Pete already understood this, but he didn't think about how he could use this opportunity. The matter of the fact was, Pete knew what men wanted, or at least what he wanted, to see in a woman. No matter how much experience a woman has, they would never completely know how a man's mind works as well as an actual man. This unique perspective meant that Pete could possibly be the best pornographic star in the entire world, being able to manipulate his new body in all the ways he would want to see it. <i>And how would I want to see myself?</i> Pete smiled over the countless opportunities, <i>Well I haven\u2019t seen my tits in a while,</i> ,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You know what?\" Pete asked the camera in a sultry tone, \"I think my big titties need to be liberated. Don't you guys agree?\" Without looking at the response he got, Pete shimmied out of the crimson shawl. Too impatient to take the entire bustier off, Pete just lazily pulled down the straps. With less tension, Pete easily pulled his breasts out of their cups, putting them on full display<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/danamrk/3351969/417347505/donna_s1-034.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/danam...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll be honest with you guys,\" Pete said, as he caressed and massaged his tits, \"I probably missed these bad boys as much as you did!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She figured she'd give him a demonstration, to prove that her power was real. \"If you need proof, you'll have it sweetie.\" she said to him, her face contorting into a little smile. Pete then saw his mom looking down at herself, looking first at her legs, then her arms, and her hands then rested on her ample breasts. \"You know, I don't think men appreciate what it's like to carry these around all day.\" she mumbled, causing Pete's eyebrow to arch in apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom... stop feeling your tits, it's creeping me out.\" Pete stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother frowned. \"And stop calling them that, they're boobs, or breasts.\" she admonished him. \"That word is so vulgar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah whatever,\" Pete chuckled, \"so what, you're gonna give 'em to me or something?\" he called his mom's bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom gave him a stare, then tilted her head and ran one of her hands through her black hair. \"Actually you know, I think I will. Just to give you the 'proof' you need, and to show you what it's like to have breasts. Maybe then you'll show me and your sister some respect in future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, this shit is getting old.\" Pete sighed, rolling his eyes. He then reach up to relief a sudden itch on his chest. But the itch came back a moment later... and spread to his entire chest area. He scratched vigorously as his skin seemed to heat up. Panic began to set in, but that as quickly replaced by shock as he looked at his mom and saw her large breasts seemed to be shrinking. \"Mom... I...oh god!\" he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete suddenly felt his own chest pushing outwards, expanding against the fabric of his shirt. His hands tried to push it back in, but to no avail, and after just a few seconds... he had his mother's \"tits\" on his chest, stretching his shirt. And they were heavy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness... it worked!\" Jane exclaimed, patting down her flat chest. She now had teenage pecs instead of her usual ample cleavage. \"A weight off my chest - literally.\" she grinned, glancing up at her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the shit?!\" Pete whined, as he groped his new 'assets'. He couldn't believe they were real, or that his mom would do this to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his mom and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trust me you don't want those things hanging without support all day, they'll be hurting after an hour.\" she told him with a mischievous snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete couldn't believe his mother was treating this whole thing like a joke. \"Are you for real mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on sweetie, relax.

The age gap was inappropriate, Cassandra was 47 years old, or rather she was 45 years old in Jane's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra looked at the now dickless Pete with a look of lust on her face. \"Don't worry stud! I'll give you your dick back before I go to work and do your mom's shift at the strip club!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what? Mom's a stripper?\" Pete spat in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra giggled wickedly \"Oh honey, you didn't honestly think your mom could afford this lovely house just by working as a secretary did you?! Your mom may be a part time secretary at a legal firm, but once a week she strips at a club a couple of towns over. That way no-one from around these parts is going to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete was speechless trying to take this all in. Not only did he just have his dick stolen by Cassandra who was now wearing his mom's body, but he only just found out that his mom had been stripping to make ends meet. No wonder she was so willing to swap with Cassandra for a few days, Pete knew his mom and stripping would definitely not be something she'd do unless she absolutely had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra ran her hands over her borrowed body \"God Pete, your mom's body is so tight. She keeps this thing in fantastic shape. If I were her I'd quit working at that law firm and I'd strip full time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete growled at Cassandra \"Well mom's not a pervert like you! That must be why she only strips once a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra unzipped her tracksuit top just enough to expose her new cleavage from behind one of Jane's yoga vests. She thrust her chest out and pressed herself against Pete, his own former dick now pressing into his thigh as Cassandra began to grind her stolen package on Pete's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a prude stud. Admit it, your mom's a total hottie and it might be fun for the two of us to have some fun! Especially with me wieding this dick of yours. I can feel it needs to cum badly!\" Cassandra purred into Pete's ear, her warm breath causing Pete to become aroused as he could feel his mom's mature twat grow wet between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete was conflicted, this was wrong, but there was something kinky about this. He always thought his mom was hot, he'd even jerked off while thinking about her, but for the most part he'd always managed to keep those thoughts out of his head. But with Cassandra in control of his mom's body and practically offering it up on a plate he was having confusing thoughts. If Cassandra was in his mom's body, it surely wouldn't be incest...  right? Besides Pete was curious about getting his mom's pussy filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra pouted with Jane's cute face \"Please Pete, let's have some fun. Let your auntie Cassie get her dick wet. I haven't had sex in years... I've never had a dick before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete gulped as Cassandra slipped one of his mom's hands into his underwear and began to tease the lips of his mature snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra gasped \"My oh my Pete, you're soaking wet. Maybe I can corrupt you after all?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete tried to protest \"Please Cassandra. This is wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra raised a sexy eyebrow and purred \"Call me Cassie!

Cassie wasted little time with foreplay and forced Pete to lie face down. She aggressively held his head down on the mattress as she forced her way into Pete's snatch from behind. Luckily Pete's borrowed snatch was loose enough so that it didn't hurt, but Cassie was a particularly aggressive lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie slammed harder and harder into Pete from behind, it didn't take long for either of them to climax for the first time wearing the genitals of the opposite gender, Cassie grunted as she erupted inside Pete, his own sperm filling his new pussy was enough so send him over the edge. He moaned like a man whore as his cunt contracted on his former dick. As Cassie finally got her breath back, she pulled out, leaving Pete and his bed sheets a sticky mess.</span></div></div>",

Do I act like them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nope,\" She smiled, \"You'll only look like them.

And even if your power did exist, I don't see how it would be useful in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, Peter,\" She sighed, \"I'm not exactly sure if my power is supposed to be useful or not.

Pete, although still entirely sure there was no magic in his ring or in his mother's necklace, was still shaken by that blue and red nightmare that happened while his mother was unconscious. Pete reassured himself that he probably just imagined the whole thing, or that he was dreaming, or that Cassandra was playing some awful prank.  Assuring himself that nothing like that would ever happen again, Pete looked up and saw a familiar glow from his mother's necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh god no,\" Pete said in fear, knowing full well what was about to happen.

And anyone who wears the ring will transform when they wear the enchanted clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Transform?\" Pete was pretty sure his mother was making this up, but was interested where she was going with this, \"How would the person who wears the ring transform? Would they transform into the person that wore the clothing last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not really, but good guess!\" Jane smiled at her son's sudden interest in the matter, \"It's a little bit more complicated than that. You know how you shop for clothes that fit your style?\" Pete nodded, still not really following, \"Well, Pete, clothing has style. Halloween costumes, elegant dresses, even dirty socks have style. Now when I enchant clothing, I amplify that style. The style becomes so intense within that clothing, that the moment you make contact with it, you're entire body will change to reflect it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So if I put on an enchanted sock, I would become a sock?\" Pete scoffed, losing any previous interest in the subject, \"Doesn't sound like a very cool power, mom,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You wouldn't turn into a sock, Pete\" Jane sighed at her son's attention span, \"Here, I'll give you an example, let's say I enchanted a fedora. If you put of the enchanted fedora, you would probably transform into some kind of suave detective. Or if I enchanted a tiara, you would probably turn into a pretty princess. You would become the perfect person to wear that piece clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh,\" Pete considered the possibilities of his mother's supposed powers, still not entirely believing her, \"Well, how is this power supposed to bring us closer together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sure,\" Jane's eyes darted towards her closet, \"But we won't know until we try, will we?\" Jane then giddily ran towards her closet and rummaged through the clothes within. Pete wondered what crazy thoughts were going on his mother's head at the moment. Jane got excited very easily and this usually led to her going overboard on certain things. Pete remembered accidentally introducing Breaking Bad to his mother and she ended up watching the entire series within the next four days. It was this obsessive behavior that made Pete uneasy about his mother's fascination with magical clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This will do,\" Jane exclaimed, as a strange blue glow emitted from her closet.

Clothing that could transform you. I'm pretty sure what I just did was enchant that underwear, but we are not going to know for sure until you try it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mom, are you being serious?\" Pete looked down at the bunched up panties in his hands, \"You really want me to wear this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Peter, didn't you say you would do this for me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I mean...\" Pete mumbled, cursing his past self for being so considerate of his mother's feelings, \"I did say I would, I just didn't think it would lead to you making me wear women's underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Enchanted women's underwear,\" Jane corrected her son, \"Look Peter, I know this is still a little hard for you to believe, I might even have trouble believing it if our roles were reversed, but I swear this is the real deal. Look, how about we make a deal? If you do this one thing for me, I'll get you one those new Xbox things you keep asking me about. Sound fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hm,\" Pete mentally weighed his options. <i>An Xbox One would be nice. I really was looking forward to playing Fallout 4 and now is my opportunity to be able to.</i> Pete rubbed the soft material of the panties between his fingers, <i> All I have to do is put on some panties. Sure it might be a weird, but it's not like anyone will ever know about it. Plus, I did agree to do this.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine, I'll do it,\" Pete resigned, much to his his mother's delight, \"But you better not be joking about the Xbox one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course not, Peter. It will be yours,\" Jane smiled, proud of her son's commitment, \"So, in order for the transformation to work, you have to be wearing the panties alone. So, get to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What, like right here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I don't mind,\" Jane shrugged, \"Besides, it might look strange to your sister or grandmother if a stranger in their underwear came out of your room,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, guess so,\" Pete couldn't argue with that logic, \"But could you at least turn around? That way I can at least pretend I have some privacy,\" Although Jane didn't see much of a point to this, she turned around for her son's comfort. Pete put the panties on his mother's bed and began to undress. He pulled his T shirt over his head and took off his jeans. Looking up to make sure his mother's head was still turned, Pete then took off his boxers and kicked off his socks. Now fully exposed, Pete picked up the panties again. Pete thought they looked pretty small and wondered if he could even manage to put it on in the first place. <i>Won't know until I try,</i> Pete thought as put brought the panties towards his feet. He clumsily put his feet through and pulled them up. He had to stretch out the waist to get past his man business, but after that they were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Pete could even mention how uncomfortably snug the lacy piece was around his his lcock and balls, an overwhelming feeling spread over him. It was subtle at first, but grew larger immediately. Pete couldn't find the words to describe it, it being like something he had never experienced before. He felt pressure over every inch in his body, like he was being compressed into a diamond, but he also felt like he was lighter, like he had lost 60 pounds within 20 seconds. Whatever air that was left in Pete's lungs, were forced out during this process. Suffocating, Pete looked desperately towards his mother for help. But she was still turned around, completely oblivious of her son's turmoil behind her. Pete frantically searched for anything nearby that might save him, but there was nothing, <i>\"I'm doomed</i> Pete's thought grew cloudy as started to pass out from air loss, <i>Oh my god, I'm going to die in a thong.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahhh!\" Pete choked, as air returned to his lungs. Pete, although still disorientated from the ordeal, couldn't be more happy to be alive. \"Mom, you are not gonna believe what....\" Pete stopped mid sentence and reached a hand to his throat. <i>Whose voice was that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Holy crap Peter!\" Jane yelled in excitement, \"It worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pete looked down, only to confirm what his mother said. His own male teenage body had somehow become that off a woman's. Still mostly nude, Pete's could see he now had a slim figure, long legs, and perky breasts on his chest. Pete tentatively brought a hand towards one of his new breasts in a last ditch effort to prove that none of this was real. He poked his new nipple, only to find it to be ten times more sensitive than his old one. Now certain that this was all actually happening, Pete looked up to his mother, \"Mom, What are we going to do? I'm really a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/C17/5557632/1750070880/Sophia_Delane_070.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/C17/5...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well Peter,\" Jane scratched her head, not exactly thinking this far ahead, \"I guess we should...</span></div></div>",

We are testing out powers beyond our understanding. Considering the importance of the situation, I think we should both try to be mature enough to look past the awkwardness of it all. Besides, it's only as weird as you make it,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess so,\" Pete said, looking at his insisting mother, \"Alright, fine,\" The truth was that although Pete did find the thought of being nude in front of his mother, no matter what his body looked like, uncomfortable, but that wasn't the real reason he wanted to stay in his new magical underwear. The strange thing was, he found himself enjoying his new body, almost immediately. Sure, his initial thoughts of his new form were shock and near terror. But in the exact moment he brushed against his new, more sensitive parts, he felt sensations he had never felt before. Even the slightest rub caused an amount of arousal that Pete did not think was possible. His mind boggled at the idea of doing more to this body and was more than tempted to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That would all have to wait though, knowing that although his mother is pretty lax with nudity, she might draw the line at masturbating. Sighing deeply, Pete did his best to ignore these urges as he grabbed the waistline of the panties. Pete stretched them out and dainty pulled them down his feminine legs. Stepping out of them, Pete was now completely nude and had no physical contact with the delicate garment that transformed him the first place. But nothing had happened. Pete was still in his new womanly form, just now naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/C17/5557632/1440062556/Sophia_Delane_156.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/C17/5...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that didn't work,\" Jane said, trying to remember what other messages the necklace might have given her, \"Just stay still for a moment while I figure this out,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Pete mutter as he was amazed at the sight of his new body, trying to bend his head to get a better view, \"Do you have a mirror somewhere in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Honestly, Peter, there are times and places for these things,\" Jane sighed at her distracted son, \"Let's see...Oh yeah, now I remember! All I have to do to change you back is poke you on the forehead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really? That seems pretty simple,\" Pete said, as his mother rushed forward and jabbed her index finger into his skull, \"Hey! A Little warning fir...\" Pete was cut short at the sound of his old male voice. He grasped his throat, his hand gripped his familiar semi-muscular neck. Looking down, Pete saw the same dick and balls he had seen his entire life. No doubt about it, he had turned back to normal. Looking up, Pete could see his mother's face filled with wonder. Quickly reminding himself that he was naked, Pete quickly covered his genitals with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is amazing!\" Jane exclaimed, \"Peter, do you know what this means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It means you've seen me naked in two different bodies,\" Pete blushed, too embarrassed to marvel at his mother's powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This means you can be a different person!\" Jane said, ignoring her son's comments, \"Can you imagine it? Out of all the people in the entire world, how many of them do you think wish they could do it all over again, or just be someone else entirely? Almost everyone feels that way, at least at one time or another. But you're the only one who can truly experience that. You are the only one who can just be someone new. You could live a whole new life, or maybe lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know about that, mom,\" Pete meekly said, \" I mean, this is really cool and all, and I did like being a lady for a second, but I'm not really sure about looking like that all the time. Let alone pretending to be someone new. This is all seems like a lot. If I could just get my clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course of course, you're right,\" Jane interrupted her son, \"I was just thinking out loud, I didn't mean to impose any rule that had to be the way we use this power.

With this set of magic jewelry, I can send some kind of direct signal to one of them. Pretty neat, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, real neat mom,\" Pete sighed at his crazy sounding mother, \"So getting past the fact that there are apparently many gods, what gods are we talking about? Are we sending a message to every god or one in particular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm...\" Jane rubbed her chin in thought, \"I'm not sure. Guess well just have to try it out and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,  what kind of message are we going to send?\" Pete was growing tired of playing along with his mother, \"What could we possibly say to a god? Aren't they by definition above us in every way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Peter I have no idea, OK.\" Jane crossed her arms, \"I never done this before, so take it easy on me. I'm not even sure if we say anything. The necklace might just send out a signal to let them now it has a new owner. Who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh god, mom.\" Pete complained, as he sat down on his mother's bed, \"Just do whatever you gotta do to get the message across then. I would like to do other things tonight besides talking to my mother about deities and necklaces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Didn't you just saying you would do this for me?\" Jane asked her son, who just shrugged at her, \"You are ridiculous. Fine, just sit there while I figure it out, OK?\". Pete complied, sitting and watching his mother fiddle with her necklace. As she poked and prodded the necklace, she grunted in frustration as nothing happened. Than an idea struck Jane, as she took her hands off the necklace and got on her knees. She placed both of her hands together and tilted her head towards the ground. <i>Oh, she's praying,</i> Peter scratched his head as he looked at his mother kneeling on the floor, <i>I guess that makes sense. That is what people usually do when they want to talk to a god.</i> Suddenly, Jane necklace began to glow blue again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh no,\" Pete uttered as the blue light got brighter. He could no longer see his mother, the bright expanding light completely saturating the view in front of him. Pete tried to crawl away to the other side of the bed, but it was pointless. The whole room was blue. He was surrounding by a bright sapphire glow that he couldn't escape. It all became too much for Peter as he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that's strange,\" An unfamiliar voice rouse Pete out sleep, \"I guess I can manage though. Not every day you get a oracle.\" Pete pushed himself up off what he thought was his mother's comfortable bed. After Pete's eyes adjusted to the light, he realized that instead of resting on a comfortable mattress, he was surrounding by large mounds of something white and fluffy. Sitting up and looking around, all Pete could see was this white fluff covering the floor, the walls, and even the ceiling. <i>What is this stuff?</i> Pete curiously pressed down some of the fluff as hard as he could, only for it to return to it's original shape after removing his hand, <i>They look like...clouds. Where the hell am I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, you're awake,\" The mysterious voice spoke once more, \"Welcome to Mt. Olympus, Peter Connors,\" Pete turned around to see a solid gold throne and a beautiful brunette women dressed in robes and not much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://110.imagebam.com/download/fBCjlh1pJzxXk2_GMZ4SyA/34922/349210648/01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://110.imagebam.com/download/fBCjlh1...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woah,\" Peter mumbled, blown away at the beautiful women before him. The woman being one of the most stunning people Peter had ever seen before. She embodied almost every single thing Peter wanted in a women. It wasn't just her physical appearance, either. There was some kind of presence she had, like a sexual aura around her that was almost visible. Although Pete was enamored by the mysterious woman, he reminded himself of his current situation and cleared his mind of all sexy thoughts. \"Hey!\" Pete tried his best sound intimidating, \"Who the hell are you and where the hell am I?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, my, that's new!\" The woman smiled, sounding as excited as she was surprised by Pete's outburst, \"Well human, if you were paying attention earlier, you would know that you are currently in Mt. Olympus, home of the gods. My name is Aphrodite, Goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and sex. You can call me Allie, if you want though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh,\" Pete lamely said, not sure what he was expecting to hear, \"OK, um, Allie. Why am I here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because you activated the jewelry, silly human\" Allie giggled, \"The jewelry is used by devoted believers to send their best smiths, soldiers, or scholars to us gods. We then decide if those believers are worth becoming oracles. If accepted, the oracles return to earth and spread the word of majesty and power. It's usually a great honor to be chosen, so it's odd that you don't know why you are here. I'm guessing you used the jewelry without knowing what it was meant for, right?\" Pete nodded in response, which only made Allie giggle again, \"That is so funny! Humans always get themselves into these problems. That kind of stuff never happens to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It never really happens to me either,\" Pete rubbed the back of his head, unsure of how to approach a god \"So, clearly there was some kind of misunderstanding, so could you, um, take me back to my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, no can do. Sorry Peter,\" Allie shrugged, \"Normally I wouldn't mind helping you out. Despite what some other gods do, I actually don't mind helping out humans. But I can't, just not this time, because you're special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" Pete asked, \"How am I special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well you were the first human I ever met who wasn't seduced by me,\" Allie smiled at the confused Pete, \"You see Peter, being the goddess of sex has it's benefits. One of them being that any man or woman within 200 yards of me become aroused and are drawn towards me. I also naturally morph into what that person's perfect lover would look like. Both of my godly powers were affecting you, and you resisted. I'm impressed, frankly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, thanks?\" Pete wasn't thrilled where this conversation was going, \"To be honest, I did think about it,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But you didn't act upon those thoughts.\" Allie pointed out, \"You stay focused and alert, despite me being directly in front of you. No, you are perfect, you'll be the best oracle I've ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"\"But I don't want to be an oracle!\" Pete pleaded to the goddess, \"I don't know anything about being an oracle, I'd be terrible at it. I just want to go back home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry Peter, I've made up my mind. This is happening,\" Allie told a distraught Peter, \"But don't worry, You're not going to be an oracle on Mt. Olympus, everyone here already knows about me. You'll be sent back to your realm. It'll just be a little bit different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Different how?\" Pete nervously asked, \"What\u2019s going to change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, you'll see\" Allie playfully said, as the bright blue glow reappeared. Pete was going to question Allie further, but was once again overtaken by the glow. As he drifted into unconsciousness, he heard Allie whisper \"We\u2019ll talk real, soon Peter Connors, oracle of Aphrodite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Pete awoke , having returned to his mother's bedroom. He noticed immediately the change Allie had mentioned. Pete realized...</span></div></div>",

Pete laughed at Jack's persistence. Jack sent a text back, \"God, you want to hang this badly? I've been to your house every day this week, dude. Shit get's old real quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on, Pete, my grandpa sent me some new stuff from the homeland. Could be a full Mech in one of these packages. Maybe a tentacle monster. Who knows?\", Jack replied. Pete stopped in his tracks after reading Grandpa. Jack's Grandpa still lived in Japan and was amazing. Jack's Grandfather used to be a fisherman in the fifties and would only go out to sea during bad weather. His understanding was that if there were less fisherman around him, he would have a better chance at the fish. And one day, like some kind of Japanese Forest Gump, his bounty was so large that he had enough profit to buy all the other ships in his local dock. Next thing he knew, he was a millionaire with own fish company. He would send Jack weird presents every once a while. Sometimes they were amazing and sometimes they were just strange. For example, one time Jack got a 18 inch scale model of Godzilla. And another time, Jack's grandfather sent him 15 bags of shrimp flavored chips. Either way it was fun to see what Jack might get. \"Alright,\" Jack replied, \"I'm coming over,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yo, Jack,\" Pete announced, as he entered Jack's house, \"I'm here. Show me what your grandpa sent\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hold your horses, Pete,\" Jack said peeking his head out of the corner, \"Is that all you came over for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh yeah, no other reason to come to this dump,\" Pete replied sarcastically, referencing the gigantic television to his left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gasp,\" Jack actually said gasp, \"My feelings have never been so hurt,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cut the shit, dude. Show me the stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, they're in the kitchen\" Jack beckoned Pete to follow him. Around the corner, Pete's eyes found their way to the kitchen counter, which had three identical cardboard boxes placed on top of it. Getting a closer look, Pete could see they were all still unopened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why haven't you opened these yet,\" Pete looked quizzically at Jack. If this was another one of Jack's pranks, Pete was just going to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I thought I would give you the honor,\" Jack innocently replied, \"Besides, sometimes Grandpa's gifts don't always make the trip. Remember the squid ink incident?\" Pete remembered a week ago, Jack's grandpa sent him 20 packets of squid ink. The box cutter Jack used went right through the thin cardboard and sliced opened some of the packets drenching him in black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm going to get covered in ink instead of you, is that?\" Pete raised an eyebrow at Jack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, damn it.  You saw through my brilliant plan.\" Jack shrugged, \"OK, how about I open the first and the last one, and you open the middle one. Boom, compromise,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine,\" Pete sighed, pushing the middle box forward, \"Go ahead, open away,\" Jack carefully picked up the box, brought it up to his face, and rattled it. Satisfied with that, he carefully picked back the tape with his fingernails. As he opened the box, he picked up what looked to Pete like sheets of dark green paper bound in plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's that?\" Pete asked, \"Construction paper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, Pete,\" Jack sighed, \"This is 50 sheets of dried seaweed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh. Jackpot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not quite,\" Jack placed the empty box in the trash, \"I hate this stuff. My dad might like this though. You're turn,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Pete said, as we handed the second box. Pete used Jack's ineffective method of finger nail against tape. Pete looked into the box and his mouth went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dude,\" Jack asked, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're not going to believe this,\" Pete looked back at Jack in shock, \"It's 50 more sheets of seaweed,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" Jack grunted as he grabbed the box from Pete, \"Grandpa, what the hell am I going to doing to do with 100 sheets of seaweed?\" Jack got only more frustrated when he saw Pete laughing right at his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well go on then,\" Pete chuckled, \"Open the last one,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whatever,\" Jack grumbled and picked up the last box. Waiting through yet another long period of time of Jack struggling to rip off the tape with his nails. When opened, Jack became perplexed what was inside. Out of sight, Pete peeked his head into view and was also confused with what he saw. Inside was what looked like a human shaped toy encased in plastic, in the same fashon as a G.I. Joe doll. Upon closer inspection, it was actually some kind of candy. With some sort of fleshy light brown color, it was a small person shaped gummy. The Japanese text around, although unreadable to Pete, was bubbly and in bright colors. Pete was disturbed by the realistic like face the gummy had, but Jack only grew more fascinated in the candy as he stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh,\" Jack said as he picked the candy out and looked around the packaging. He pried open the plastic and held the gummy in his hand. \"Do you want to eat it?\" Jack asked Pete, holding the gummy in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No man,\" Pete replied in disgust, \"That thing is freaky, Jack. Are you even sure it's edible?\" Jack gave Pete a sly grin, clearly making fun of his apprehension, \"I just don't think it's a good idea, is all,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, Pete,\" Jack laughed, \"Don't be such a pussy. Here, I'll show you.\" Jack then put the little guy in his mouth and began to chew. \"See,\" Jack said, mouth full of strange candy, \"Perfectly fine. Why would my grandpa send me something dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why would your grandpa send you 100 sheets of seaweed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's...\" Jack thought for a moment, \"Actually a very good point. I don't feel so great.\" Jack then gripped his stomach and reached for the candy's packing. Jack investigated the back of the package, \"What is this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is why you don't just eat whatever fits in your mouth, dumbass,\" Pete said, putting his hand on Jack's shoulder, \"Do you need to go the hospital?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm fine, Pete,\" Jack brushed Pete's hand of as he continued to read, \"It says here the candy is magic,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let's not start putting our faith into strange Japanese candy. Probably just a marketing thing, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It says after you ingest the gummy guy, you are granted power,\" Jack read on, ignoring Pete, \"It says that right here. Each gummy has a different power associated with it. This one gives me the power of... \"</span></div></div>",

Pete, this is crazy, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, it's crazy, you sound like a fucking lunatic,\" Pete said, frustrated with his friend\u2019s lack of focus. \"That candy is clearly messing with your head, I would really appreciate if you sat down and just relaxed for a minute.

All that remained were Jack's empty clothes. Pete frantically searched through Jack's crumpled outfit to find any kind of sign of his friend. <i>Nothing</i> Pete\u2019s thoughts turned hysterical, <i>There's nothing left. He completely disappeared. Did he really become like a ghost or something? I need to do something. Call somebody. Maybe Mom knows something about ghosts,</i> Just as Pete fished his phone out of his pocket, it vibrated in his hand. He had received a text from an unknown number. <i>Mysterious stranger?</i> Pete thought, as he opened the new text. It read \"Guess who Pete?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jack?\" Pete texted back, trying to ignore how ridiculous this was.

Mrs. Packard was one of Jack's next door neighbors. Pete didn't know much about her, besides the fact that she was a mother, a wife, and decently attractive. Pete knew a little bit about her husband, though. Mr. Packard worked with Pete's mother at the local law firm. Pete had met him a couple times and he seemed nice enough, but his mother didn't have many good things to say about him. \"He's such a perv,\" Pete overheard his mother speaking to one of her friends, \"He's never touched me or anything, but he just never stops staring down at me. I hate working around that creep!\" Pete wondered what kind of wife would put up with a husband like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, Mrs. Packard!\" Jack's text replied, \"This is so wild, dude. You gotta come over and see!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This isn't some, elaborate prank, right?\" Pete still couldn't really believe what was happening, \"You're not just upstairs, waiting for me to go get kicked out of some stranger's house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pete, I fucking disappeared,\" Read Jack's rather blunt text, \"How could I do that? Come on, dude, I swear this is real. Just come over and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Pete sighed, annoyed with how easy it was for Jack to convince him that he could actually possess somebody, \"Gimme a sec, I'll heading over now,\" Pete couldn't believe himself as he exited Jack's house. <i>Jack''s manipulating me</i> Pete thought as he walked down Jack's driveway, <i>He does this shit all the time,</i> As Pete got closer to Mrs. Packard's house, he recalled the last time Jack had tricked him into doing something stupid. Pete and Jack were at the farmers market, picking something up for Jack's mom, and they stumbled upon some ghost peppers. Jack had convinced Pete into eating one, telling him that they \"Weren't that spicy, Everyone overacts about that stuff,\" Pete, always being the gullible one, ate the whole thing and suffered the consequences. And while Pete's mouth was on fire, all Jack could do was laugh at him. \"How is this any different?\" Pete grumbled to himself, now standing on Mrs. Packard's doorstep. Pete knocked the door, hoping there would be no response and he could just go back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's unlocked,\" shouted a voice from inside the house. <i>Shit!</i> Pete thought as he opened the door, <i>What am I going to tell this lady? Just say \"Hey, is my friend's soul inside you? No? Pardon me, then,\" She's going to think I'm nuts!</i> Pete walked forward into the Packard home and heard humming coming from the hallway to his left. Pete decided that he might as well see if Pete was here, and decided that following the humming was his best solution. The hallway lead to a lavishly decorated kitchen, with complex wooden cupboards and beautiful plants lined across the counters. Sitting on one of the stools by the wine rack, sat Mrs. Packard, reading  what seemed to be a romantic novel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Rings1/4972950/1487369997/man002002009722003.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Rings...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can I help you, young man?\" Mrs. Packard ask Pete, without even looking up from her book, \"Would there happen to be a reason why you're in my home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I, um....\" Pete struggled to find the right words. <i>This isn't Jack. What the hell is wrong with me</i> Pete frantically thought, <i>Jack is back at his house laughing his ass off and I'm bothering some poor woman in her own own home. I've got to come up with some excuse for being here and get out fast.</i> \"I was looking for my friend,\" Pete tried his best to sound convincing, \"I thought he might be in here. Doesn't look like so, I'll be on my way. Sorry to bother you, ma'am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A friend?\" Mrs. Packard raised an eye from her her book, \"If you're looking for someone, I would be willing to help. Who is your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, his name is Jack,\" Pete nervously scratched the back of his head, feeling like he was going to be in the house much longer than anticipated. \"He's actually your next door neighbor. He's about my age\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm, neighbor, huh?\" Mrs. Packard looked up, like she was trying to remember him, \"Oh! Do you mean the asian boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, he's Japanese,\" Pete specified, knowing Jack's pet peeve of being grouped with every Asian country, being very proud of his Japanese heritage, \"Have you seen him anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can't say that I have,\" Mrs. Packard closed her book and placed it on the counter, now giving all her attention toward Pete. \"My god, you look so worried! He must be really important to you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Pete sighed at how long he had to keep up this lie, \"He is my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sure he'll show up, no need to get so stressed,\" Mrs. Packard put her hand  on Pete's shoulder, \"Do you always get so worked up about these type of things that you barge into strangers houses? You should learn to relax, kid<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, your probably right,\" Pete nodded at the woman, \"I'm probably just freaking out over nothing,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, I have an idea,\" Mrs Packard snapped her fingers, \"How about I give you something worth freaking out about?\" Before Pete could ask what she meant, Mrs. Packard ripped open her hoodie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Rings1/4972950/1932038979/man002002009722030.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Rings...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ta Da!\" She exclaimed triumphantly to awe stricken Pete, \"See anything you like, little boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god,\" Pete muttered, feeling crazy for what he was about to ask, \"Jack, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You betcha, Pete!\" Jack laughed at his friends surprised face, \"Although, I guess I can't really blame you for not believing in me before.

He shook his head wildly, causing hair to fly into his face. His hair wasn't that long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack opened his eyes, looked down and gasped at what he saw. Boobs! And he could feel them hanging from his chest. They were <i>his</i>. The thought triggered a brief sensory overload as he realised his body was, in fact, entirely female all of a sudden. \"Whoa,\" he breathed, dumbstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye of little faith!\" Jack whooped. \"This is awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete continued staring downward.

He'd gotten this crap before, but from his best friend? \"Are you accusing me of something?\" he asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, are you sure you're not...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing I'm not sure of is why I'm having this stupid conversation instead of making you change me back!\" Pete snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause, Jack snickered. \"You're cute when you're angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh!\" Pete suddenly punched Jack in the face, sending him straight to the floor. Feeling a tinge of regret, Pete considered apologising, but a glance at his slender fist sustained his frustration. He laid eyes on the pack of candy and moved to make a grab for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh,\" Jack slammed a hand down on the candy before pulling himself up. \"Mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well my dick was mine and you still took it!\" Pete shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack backed away, clutching the pack of candy and shaking his head. \"Alright, look.

I can always change you back later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that all sounds so grand to you, why don't you do it?\" Pete grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like being a guy,\" Jack shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I!\" Pete objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you?\" Jack asked. \"Why's it important to you?

Pete understood that his sister's sense of humor was a little random but this was just confusing. She would sometimes send him crazy messages just to see his reaction. She loved to watch him freak out over these things. One time Emily told Pete that she was pregnant and ran away. In reality, though, she was just visiting a friends house for the weekend, but that didn't stop Pete from worrying for 3 days straight. After many more of these instances, Pete has learned the best way to cope with his teasing sister is to play along with her dumb games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I always knew it.

Get home as soon as you can,\" She texted back.<i>I guess she's sticking with the whole witch thing,</i> Pete rolled his eyes and continued to walk the same pace towards his house, seeing no real rush to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm in the dining room!\" Pete heard Emily yell as he walked inside his house.

Let's get that straight. Secondly, I can't just do whatever I want with magic, there are certain spells for every situation and I barely know any of them. And lastly, even if I did know a teleportation spell, why the hell would I use it on a dork like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wouldn't know, I'm not a witch,\" Pete shrugged, getting tired of his sister's little game but decided to play along a little bit longer. He wondered how much thought she actually put into this whole charade. \"So...\" Pete thought, trying to come up with a hard question that would make her break character, \"How long have you been a witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that's a tricky question,\" Emily said, almost in a patronizing way, \"Since every woman on the planet has the possibility of being a witch, but only an extremely small amount of them know about it. Do you remember when I got that letter accepting me to veterinary school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah?\" Pete raised an eyebrow, wondering where she was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well veterinary school was just a lie I came up with to tell you and mom,\" Emily said, proud of her deceit, \"It was actually a letter from Morgan's School for Witchcraft. The letter had told me I had been watched for a long time and they were impressed by my natural energy. They said that even without training, I already had more power than most of the teachers there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Emily, that like two years ago,\" Pete said, thinking that he found a hole her story, \"Why are you telling me this know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well doofus, it's still a college,\" Emily expalined, \"Even though the school teaches girls the deadly art of magic, I still had to do prerequisites. While all my new friends were learning spells and curses, I was still proving that I can write an essay or do simple calculus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Calculus?\" Pete asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's a type of math, Pete,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know what calculus is!\" Pete said, getting frustrated at his sister's persistence on this prank , \"Why the hell would witches need to know calculus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't think turning men into frogs takes a little bit of math?\" Emily laughed, \"You got to put more thought into this kind of stuff Pete. Anyways, I'm telling you this now because I just learned how to do basic spells!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Congrats,\" Pete said apathetically, \"I'm gonna go to my room now,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There's a reason why I'm telling you all this, Pete\" Emily said, grabbing Pete's shoulder stopping him in his tracks, \"Could you please help me practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Practice your magic?\" Pete asked, wondering why he sister hasn't given up on this already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well you see,\" Emily explained, \"Everyone other student in my school has something we like to call dolls. Dolls are someone close to witches that they can test new spells, curses, or enchantments on. I want you to be my doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds like I wouldn't get much out of that deal,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not really, no. But you would be helping me out a lot and I would really appreciate it,\" A sly grin appeared on Emily's face, \"Besides, do you really want to be on my bad side when I'm one of the most powerful witches in the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dude,\" Pete said, fed up with his sister's bull, \"If I agree to do this, will you leave me alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Until I need to practice a different spell, yes,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then fine,\" Pete gave up, and sat down in one the dining room chairs, \"Work your magic, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yay!\" Emily cheered, as she hugged her little brother in excitement, \"Thank you so much. I'll make it up to you, I promise. Now lets see what spell I should practice.\" And with that, Emily pulled out a very large purple book that had been out of Pete's eyesight. <i>Jeez, she really went all out for the props on this one</i> Pete thought, as he noticed the gigantic book had complicated black symbols and drawings on the cover. Any words on the book were unlike any written language that Pete had ever seen. Pete looked up to see his sister running her finger down page after page, searching for the perfect spell to test on him. Pete had never seen his sister put this much effort into pranking him before. It was almost as admirable as it was ridiculous. \"Aha!\" Emily triumphantly yelled, \"This one is perfect, it's called the...</span></div></div>",

Pretty crazy, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Crazy is the exact word I would use,\" Pete stared blankly at his sister, \"Why in the hell would you want your little brother to be a copy of you? Wouldn't that be, I dunno, weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pete, you really need to listen to people when they talk you,\" Emily said over her shoulder, as she searched through her backpack, \"If you were listening, you would know that I don't want to turn you into anything. I want to practice my spells. You changing is really more of a byproduct of the whole thing. And besides, another perk of being my doll is that you'll be able to do as you please once I transform you.

Whatever you want,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Emily, I don't want to fool around with your body,\" Pete squinted his eyes in disgust, \"That's so gross, dude. Why would you even say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm just saying, Pete. Besides...\" Emily smiled, as she pulled a hand mirror out of her bag, \"You might change your mind when it happens. I've seen dolls go wild with their new bodies, no matter who they have turned into,\" Upon closer inspection, Pete noticed that something was off about the mirror. Instead of the usual non-reflective side of a mirror, there was an exact copy of the mirror from the other side. Looking almost as if someone welded two mirrors together for some bizarre reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell is that?\" Pete candidly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This, my simple minded friend, is a Gemina,\" Emily said, as she looked closely at the mirror, inspecting for any cracks or scratches, \"You see, not all spells can just be performed by a witch herself. Sometimes we need special tools, and this, is one of them. Now, stand up Pete,\" Pete begrudgingly did as he was told, currently standing a couple feet away from his sister. \"Now,\" Emily said, trying to relax, \"In order for this spell to work, you need to stare directly into the mirror,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure whatever,\" Pete shrugged, \"Does it say something about you that you're fine with turning your brother into a copy of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not really,\" Emily ignored her brother and closed her eyes. After what seemed like a full minute, Emily opened her eyes. And if Pete hadn't be staring directly at the mirror, he would have noticed his big sister's eye growing bright green. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Nostram Finire!</span>\" Emily yelled, Almost making Pete lose his focus on his reflection. A small crack then appeared on Pete's side of the mirror. As Pete tried to get a closer look at the crack, it grew bigger. It began to branch out, cracks spreading their way randomly across the reflective surface.  The cracks grew more and more, until Pete's face was unrecognizable in a segmented mess. The cracks turned to shards, as bits of glass came pouring out of the mirror. But instead of empty space, behind the broken glass was another mirror. And with the new mirror came a new reflection for Pete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://teengirl-pics.com/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXN0eWRpZ2VzdC5jb20vZ2Fscy9jYXNzYW5kcmEvdGlnaHRqZWFuczAxMDgwOC8wMDQuanBn.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://teengirl-pics.com/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god,\" Pete was bewildered, he couldn't believe what he was seeing. Nothing of the original Pete was anywhere to be found. He was just another Emily now. Every slight movement brought waves of alien sensation. Pete tried to remain still, not ready to feel anymore strange jiggling until he had figured out what was really going on. Pete looked up at his sister in desperation, hoping to get some kind of calm reassurance, but she was almost as speechless as him. After what seemed like an impossibly long, awkward silence, Emily finally said...</span></div></div>",

Ew, no.\" Emily grimaced at the thought, \"The lust spell has no effect on the witch who casts it. In fact, the spell doesn't do much to the person it's cast on either, not directly anyways. Once the spell has been cast on someone, the next person they make eye contact with will fall madly in love with them. It's would kinda be like a love at first sight sort of thing, except it's magical and they have no choice in the matter,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Geez,\" Pete scratched his head as he thought about the possibilities, \"That sounds pretty powerful. And also pretty creepy,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not as creepy as you think,\" Emily explained, \"Sure the person who gets affected certainly didn't sign up for it, but they do genuinely fall in love. they'll still be themselves, just completely infatuated by whoever the spell was cast on. The only thing that will change with them is that they will want to please this person, in any way they can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright alright,\" Pete said, \"Why are you using this spell?

Now stop stalling and let's get this over with\" Emily said, as she closed her spell book, \"Now all we need for this spell to work is for you to look me in the eyes. Seem easy enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess so,\" Pete shrugged, as he made direct eye contact with his sister, \"Am I doing it right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sure are, now stand still and try not to blink,\" Emily commanded, as she took a deep breath and recited the spell, \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Celeri Excitatio!</span>\" With the magical words spoken, Emily\u2019s eyes glowed a bright green. Although unsettled by the freaky light show his sister's eyes were giving, Pete couldn't feel anything. He just stood there awkwardly, staring into his sister\u2019s green lit eyes. After what had been at least half a minute, Emily eyes stopped glowing and she appeared to be rather excited. \"Oh, good,\" She said with a smile \"It worked,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you talking about,\" Pete gave his sister the appropriate look you give someone who believes they just performed magic, \"Besides your eyes lighting up, nothing happened. I don't feel any different,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well of course you don't feel different, you big doofus. The spell doesn't change you, it changes the first person to make eye contact with you. That's where this comes along,\" Emily said, while taking out a blindfold she had hidden until now, \"I'm going to put this on you, take you somewhere with a lot of people, and see who falls in love with you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know about this, Emily,\" Pete said, as his sister approached with the blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Too bad you don't have much say in the matter,\" Emily told her little brother, as she tied the blindfold around his head, \"Now this is happening, try to enjoy it. Now come on, I'm going to drive us there,\" And with that, Emily pulled her blinded brother by the hand towards the her car. Pete sighed heavily, regretting ever agreeing to his sister's seemly crazy delusions.

You see, although the mall is located directly in the center of town, there are tons of people from out of town who come here as well. So not only will we have our selection of locals to observe, but also people who we've never seen before. Giving you a much larger selection of people to choose from.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Choose from?' Pete asked his sister, \"I actually get a say in the matter?

I'll be waiting here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Pete said, ready to get this over with. Pete still had no faith in any of the magic his sister proclaimed of having, but he knew she wouldn't leave him alone until he did her bidding. Letting out a large sigh, Pete searched through the crowds for someone who he wouldn't mind falling in love with him. Eventually, he was drawn to a mysterious and alluring woman, and decided to approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0:Trudy Chac\u00f3n: 20 year old Puerto Rican immigrant. Trudy had recently moved to America to support her father's new restaurant, which had recently opened in the mall. Trudy wanted to be a famous singer, and she had thought that moving to America would help improve her odds. This hadn't been the case though, as she struggled to stand out in auditions and performances. Eventually she gave up and now spends her days waiting tables. Trudy likes trance music, flowing dresses, and gardening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Linda Barrett: 34 year old sex shop owner: Linda had grown up in a very religious household, and throughout her life she was forbidden to do whatever was deemed sinful. Drinking, smoking, and even dancing were off the table. But worst of all, she was barely allowed to talk to boys, let alone date them. This lasted until her senior year in high school, where in her first ever act of defiance, she kissed a boy in her class. In that moment, a spark lit, and Linda wanted more. She took it further and further, until she had sex with the boy. She came to a conclusion that day, that sex was not something to be shunned over or to be ashamed of, but something beautiful. She then dedicated her life to this message, having written numerous books about sexual freedom and even doing her own podcast on the subject. She recently opened her own sex toy shop inside the mall. The business is doing fine, but she's terribly understaffed. Linda likes costumes, fantasy novels, and jogging.</span></div></div>",

Not seeing any approaching customers, she let out a loud sigh, and went back into the store. Pete couldn't tell if it was pity or simply the site of an attractive older woman, but he felt compelled to enter Linda's sex shop. Of course, he wasn't thinking about putting the woman under a spell, but he knew he was being watched by his sister and he had to look someone in the eyes. might as well  be someone who might need some cheering up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Pete entered the sex shop, he remembered hearing rumors about the place. The reaction from town was mixed, to say the least. Pete's town was pretty evenly divided, political wise, and the more open minded townsfolk weren't entirely excited about the idea of a dildo store right next to the Pretzel shop, but they didn't mind it too much. The more strict half, on the other hand, were absolutely appalled that any kind of operation like this could be run in their \"Pure\" town. The store's opening week had protesters lined up in front of windows, almost completely blocking entrance. Eventually they gave up though, seeing that store wasn't going to go anywhere. The protesters would just have to be content talking about how their town is being filled with sin and spreading ridiculous rumors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And as stupid as those rumors were, they did seem to stick in Pete's mind. Pete was half expecting to see blatant images of hardcore sex plastered on the walls, or people walking around in gimp costumes. Pete found that the store, somewhat to his disappointment, looking more or less like a Halloween store. Just instead of costumes and props decorating the aisle ways, their were lingerie sets and sex toys. Not even enough to make you blush, at least by Pete's desensitized standards. In the center of it all, Pete could see Linda bending over, haphazardly organizing boxes. He was going to say something, but struggled to find the words as he stared at Linda jean short covered ass. While he was distracted, Linda turned as the noticed the teenager within her store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike187/5743869/746459198/Av_Add43_ma9294018.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh hey, a customer!\" Linda exclaimed, not noticing that Pete was clearly perving, \"Oh wait a second, how old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh,\" Pete stuttered, suddenly nervous in front of that alluring woman, \"Eighteen, ma'am,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ma'am! Excuse me young man, but I'm not even 35, don't call me ma'am,\" Linda said frustrated, like she heard that before, but calmed herself down, \"Anyways, my name is Linda and you're just barely old enough to shop here, so feel free to browse my stuff. and if you got any questions, don't feel afraid to ask, got it kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Got it,\" Pete nervously said, \"But I didn't really bring any money,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No money?

Look, if this were any other kind of situation, I would send you packing. But since i'm doing unexpectedly terribly, business wise, I don't have any other option but to hire you on the spot. You got the job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, good,\" Pete apathetically said, realizing he just accidentally made an agreement with someone for the second time today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good, you know you're really helping me out by doing this,\" Linda sounded relieved, \"Let me just some of this stuff away, and I'll get some paperwork for you to sign. By the way, I never caught your name,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's Pete,\" Pete told Linda, but got distracted by the huge, still packaged pink vibrator Linda was now holding. Wanting to seem professional in front of his new boss, Pete tried to look anywhere but at the humongous pink monstrosity. In his vain attempts to ignore the large toy, Pete ended up making eye contact with Linda for the first time since entering the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike187/5743869/1718696794/Av_Add43_ma9294008.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pete...\" Linda mumbled as she stared into Pete's eyes.

Pete and Emily had met Debra many times, usually when their mother invited them to work occasions. Pete liked her because she was the only person who worked with his mother who didn't treat him like a child. She always treated Pete and his sister like they were equals and a mutual respect was almost immediately established when they met. Debra and Jane also got along very well, so much in fact, that Jane would say Debra is one of her closest friends. Despite their age difference, they had no trouble talking with each other or spending time with each other after work. Although, despite their friendship, Pete would sometimes hear his mother clearly referring to Debra as \"Skinny brat,\" showing a unsubtle amount of jealous she had for the younger secretary. Debra likes Disney movies, cheesecake, and yoga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Karen Smith: A 21 year old popular girl from Emily's high school days. Pete only knew Karen from pictures and through the many times his sister complained about her, the two of them clearly not getting along. While Emily was more of a drama kid and fell under the \"Alternative\" crowd, Karen was a typical popular girl. Cheerleader, ditsy, lots of jock boyfriends, etc. Although Emily had no problems with other girls like Karen, for unknown reasons, Karen had taken upon herself to humiliate and make fun of Emily as much as she could. Emily claimed she ignored it, but Pete could tell that what Karen did to his sister cut deep and would stick with her for a very long time. Karen likes shopping, musclebound men, and terrible sitcoms.</span></div></div>",

Even though he still highly doubted his sister had any kind of magical powers, he still didn't want to look an old family friend in the eyes on the off chance that she might fall in love with him. His sister seemed to share his sentiments exactly, trying in her best efforts to move on from the conversation and keep walking forward. Emily's intention was for the spell to be cast on a complete stranger, not someone with a direct connection to the two of them. This clearly would cause some problems that Emily had not put any thought into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, really,\" Debra said, oblivious to the nervousness of the brother and sister, \"Sure you guys don't want to hang out?

Her mouth hang agape, staring deeply into his eyes. A loving smile appeared on her face, as her eyes flashed a bright shade of green, much like Emily's when she cast the spell. A panicked Pete looked to his sister, only to reaffirm what he already knew. She was resting her forehead in her palm, like she had just gotten a migraine and gave her brother a look that said \"Way to go, dipshit\".

He just blurted out the first thing that came to his mind, \"My name Is Pete and I'm Emily's brother,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fascinating,\" Emily said sarcastically, \"I'm kind of busy here, so if you could fuck off, I'd really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't look very busy,\" Pete responded, trying to match her mean spirit, \"Looks more like you're on a bench  by yourself. What happened? Maybe you're just not that popular anymore, is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This seemed to get her attention, as she snapped her touch up mirror shut. Just as she was about to lay into Pete with a barrage of insults, their eyes made direct contact with each other. Karen angry face turned expressionless, as she stared deeply into Pete's eyes. Worried he did something wrong, He looked back athis sister, who was incredibly excited. His sister's big smile being more than enough proof that the spell had actually been activated. Pete couldn't believe it, as he looked back at Karen, seeing her eyes flash a bright shade of green, like his sister before her. Karen then seemed to come out of her trance, looking like she had just woken up. Karen looks up at Pete and...  </span></div></div>",

The spell just rearranges your age and DNA. Essentially you would be like an identical twin to whoever I turn you into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh that seems more simple, yeah,\" Pete rolled his eyes, \"If this is the easy stuff, then what are the hard spells like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, those are way out of my league,\" Emily sighed as she flipped her book towards the last pages in her book, \"Those spells are like world changers. Those kind of spells would let me move stuff with my mind, stop time, or summon demons. And even that stuff is in the first of like, 5 books of known spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OK, I get it, very magical stuff.\" Pete groaned, tired of his sister's nonsense. Pete wondered if Emily was ever going to reveal that she has just been messing with him this whole time. \"So, how do you do this spell,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I just need a hair from the person who you are going to turn into, and I think this will do just fine,\" Emily grinned as she leaned forward and picked of a long hair from Pete's shirt. \"Hm, I guess you'll be turning into a girl. I'm sure it will a good learning experience for you. Any idea who this might belong to? Perhaps a girlfriend I don't know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Emily, you know I'm single,\" Pete said, not appreciating her teasing, \"I have no idea who that belongs to. I've been around people all day, that could be anybody's for all I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Emily said, as she looked closer at the hair, \"It'll be a fun surprise then. Now stand up and stay still, please.\" Pete did as he was commanded, knowing his sister would just pester him all day if he didn't. Emily then carefully wrapped the hair around her right index finger. Delicately, she tied the hair into a neat bow. She then pointed her finger directly at Pete and said \"Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure,\" Pete shrugged, \"You know I think this is bullshit, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know. But you won't after this,\" Emily closed her eyes and took a long deep breath. When she opened her eyes again, they were glowing bright green. Before Pete could react, Emily yelled \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Mutare Aliam Personam!</span>\". With the spell cast, the hair tied around Emily's finger burst into flames and a green ray of light shot out of her fingertip. Too frightened to move, the ray of light covered Pete's still body. Pete's skin began to feel hot, like there was sunburn across his entire body. The sensation then turned cold, like he was inside a walk in freezer. Then it felt like he was being pulled from every angle and then he felt like he was being squashed like a grape. All of these random sensations were too much for Pete as he passed out, the changes in his body only progressing faster without his conscious fighting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nailed it,\" The sound of his sister congratulating herself stirred Pete out of his sleep.It felt like going the worst hangover in his life. Pete reached  a hand towards his aching forehead, but instead feeling his short, rough hair, his hand met some very long, smooth hair that had no earthly reason to be there. Shocked. Pete stood up, causing his new body to shake everywhere. He looked down, and found he now had dainty hands, child bearing hips, and large breasts where all his manly parts used to be. Pete looked up at his sisters, in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the fuck happened, Emily!?!\" Pete screamed, gripped his throat, not expecting to hear a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I transformed you, stupid.\" Emily smiled at her handy work, \"Don't know what you're so upset about. You signed up for this, Pete. I told you what was gonna happen. Here,\" Emily gave the distraught Pete a hand mirror, \"The spell was a total success.\" Pete was blown away by his sisters thrilled reaction to his apparent transformation as he tentatively brought the mirror up to his new face. Pete recoiled in horror at the reality of the situation when faced with the proof in his reflection. He couldn't believed he now looked identical to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The last he saw this face, it was nagging him about unfinished homework assignments. Ms. Hoover had always been on Pete's case the moment he walked into her classroom. No matter what he did, whether it be looking out a window for a moment or having to sharpen his pencil more than once, Ms. Hoover would talk to him about it. Pete had lost track how many detentions she had given him this semester alone. A month ago, Pete's mother had talked to the principal, Mr. Pound, about what she interpreted Ms. Hoover's behavior towards her son as unnecessary and borderline harassment. Since then, Ms. Hoover had backed off punishing Pete, but would often give him dirty look during class. Pete had no idea what her problem was, not remembering doing anything to deserve her wrath. But none of that seemed to matter to Pete at the moment, as he was now trapped inside her body. <i>This is a nightmare!</i> Pete stared at in horror at the mirror, <i>I'm trapped as this bitch forever?</i> Emily loudly cleared her throat, bringing Pete's attention back up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike187/5444925/135879341/Kendra_L32_0014.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I feel like I should remind you that you aren't actually Ms. Hoover, Pete.\" Emily simply stated to her dumbfounded brother, \"You're just a exact copy of her. You did turn into Ms. Hoover, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, yeah,\" Pete said, trying his best to calm down from the crazy situation, \"I, mean, This is what she looks like. This is even what she was wearing today,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, the spell will also transform your clothing into what the hair touched last,\" Emily rubbed her chin, as she looked Pete up and down, \"Wow, I remember Ms. Hoover. She was my calculus teacher. She's probably yours too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, unfortunately,\" Pete whined in Ms. Hoover's voice, \"Lucky me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you bitching about, Pete?\" Emily asked, annoyed at her little brother's negativity, \"What's so wrong with Ms. Hoover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you mean besides the fact that I look like her now?\" Pete asked sarcastically, but Emily nodded anyways, \"She's the worst! Always yelling at me for the stupidest shit. She hates my guts for no reason and now I'm stuck looking like her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa, calm down Pete,\" Emily could see how distressed his brother was, \"You're not stuck like this forever. The spell isn't permanent. You think I would turn my only brother into some random woman forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wasn't really thinking about it,\" A wave of relief rushed over Pete, \"So you can turn  me back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course!\" Emily patted Pete on the back, \"I'm a very powerful witch after all. But it's gonna have to wait, I need to observe you for a while. Just to make sure the spell worked correctly,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As long as it's not forever,\" Pete sighed, happy to know this wasn't permanent, but still not thrilled about being transformed into a middle aged woman in the first place, \"Just kind of wished I wasn't Ms. Hoover. I think I would be happier with looking like literally anyone else,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"God, are you going to complain all night,\" Emily crossed her arms in frustration, \"How many people do you think get to experience transformation? Not many, Pete. This is will be an illuminating experience for you. Besides, even if Ms. Hoover is a little bit older than the high school girls you're used to, at least your not ugly. In fact, I think Ms. Hoover has a pretty killer body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you talking about?\" Pete didn't even register his sister's comment. He looked back at the mirror to reexamine his new face. Before the transformation, the only time Pete saw this face was in the form of death glares or shouting. Without the usual expression of hatred and disgust, the face wasn't half bad. In fact, Pete noticed how hot Ms. Hoover would be if she stopped being so miserable all the time. <i>I can't believe I haven't noticed this before,</i> Pete brought a hand up to his new face, <i>Ms. Hoover would be a total cougar if she wasn't so awful.</i> The more Pete stared, the more attractive Ms. Hoover became. <i>She's a total babe!</i> Pete thought for a moment, and chuckled slightly, <i>I guess that makes me a babe too!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pete's eyes then found themselves drifting south towards his new chest. Pete had never even glanced at Ms. Hoover's chest before, either from disinterest or actual fear of what she might do if she spotted him taking a peep. <i>She would bury me alive if she saw me looking at her tits like this</i> Pete thought, then a devious smile appeared on his new face, <i>Not like she can stop me now.</i> Pete's curiosity brought his two new manicured hands up to Ms. Hoover's breasts and cupped each one. <i>Whoa</i> Pete giggled to himself at the new sensation his body was giving him as well as the ridiculousness of the situation, <i>Oh, to see Ms. Hoover's face as she saw me playing with her tits! That would be priceless!</i> Emily interrupted her brother's fun with another loud throat clearing, bringing his attention back towards her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike187/5444925/1061817483/Kendra_L32_0023.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pete, you'll have plenty of time to violate your teacher's body later,\" Emily reached for notebook and a pen, ready to jot down notes, \"Don't forget I turned you into Ms. Hoover for a reason.

You are my doll now. That means that not only will I practice spells on you, but you also have to do what I say. Now, I'm not going to force you to do anything, but I know a few spells that can make this a whole situation a lot more unpleasant for you, Pete. I could lower your intelligence or change your sexual preference, or something even worse if you don't follow orders. I don't want to do any of those things, but I will if I have to. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes,\" Pete said, clearly understanding the position he was in now, \"Um, where do you want me to start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm...\" Emily considered her options, \"Well since you were so interested in your new boobs, why not get a better look? Take the top off, Pete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\"  Pete wasn't going to fight back this time. Pete hadn't really thought that his own sister would threaten him into doing what she wanted. He really was at her mercy. Trying to ignore the feeling helplessness, Pete tried to focus on the opportunity seeing his most hated teacher in her underwear. <i>How many people can say they've done that?</i> Pete thought as he unbuttoned the top button of his blouse, <i>Not a lot of people, I bet. Ms. Hoover's body is mine now, and I deserve to enjoy it. I deserve this after the hell she has put me through. This is almost like justice. Sweet, sweet justice</i>. With the top button gone, Pete caught a small glimmer of Ms. Hoover's cleavage, along with a red bra. Only more motivated by the sight, Pete quickly unbuttoned the shirt to reveal his new breasts in all of their glory. Pete stared at them in silence for a moment, then look back to his sister with mouth agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike187/5444925/1427726401/Kendra_L32_0031.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" Emily asked her dumbfounded brother, \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Emily,\" Pete took a deep gulp, \"I have tits. I have an old woman's tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, yeah Pete. That's kind of the point,\" Emily laughed at her brother's delayed reaction, \"Well they look just like regular boobs, if not a little perfect. Maybe I enhanced them a little by accident.\" Emily approached Pete and brought her face close to his new breasts. Pete looked up toward the ceiling, trying to ignore the awkward situation below his chin. After what felt like five minutes of Pete doing his best to ignore his sisters thorough inspection, Pete felt a completely alien sensation coming from his chest. Pete looked down to see his sister squeezing one of his new boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Emily!\" Pete swatted away his sister's groping hands, \"Could you give me  a little warning before you do something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry,\" Emily unapologetically said, as she stepped back \"Just wanted to make sure of something. I had a hunch and I was right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A hunch?\" Pete's eyes narrowed, \"A hunch about what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well it seems that you don't just have tits, little bro,\" Emily smiled, \"You have fake tits. Those are clearly enhanced. I guess Ms. Hoover felt like she needed a upgrade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" Pete was flabbergasted, \"Ms. Hoover, the women with a permanent stick up her ass, has fake boobs? This doesn't make any sense, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, maybe you don't know Ms. Hoover as well as you think,\" Emily told Pete, as he thought over how much he actually did know about his teacher. The only interactions between Ms. Hoover and Pete were confrontational. They never had a conversation before, not even a regular one a student and teacher might have. But now that Pete thought about it, Ms Hoover didn't really talk to anyone. She didn't talk to either student or faculty member, she just kept to herself. <i>Well  clearly she has some some things she wants to keep secret,</i> Pete thought as he looked down at Ms. Hoover's fake rack, <i>But it must be hard keep everything to yourself. Ms. Hoover is probably really lonely.</i> Pete was about to feel bad for his teacher, until he remembered the multiple detentions he got in her class. <i>Oh yeah,</i> Pete lost all temporary empathy he had for his nemesis, <i>Doesn't matter if you're lonely, that's no excuse to be a bitch.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, earth to Pete! Are you forgetting something?\" Emily said, interrupting Pete's thoughts, \"We're kind of doing something here. Keep stripping. Takeoff the skirt, show me that teacher ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry, I got distracted,\" Pete excused himself, as he moved his attention to his skirt. He reached for the it's bottom and pulled without results. Pete heard his sister giggle and saw her point at the zipper that ran vertically on the side of the skirt. Pete, ignoring the giggles, pulled down the zipper. With the zipper out of the way, the skirt came off with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woah,\" Emily muttered behind Pete's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What now?\" Pete asked, with the skirt  around his knees<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're ass is amazing, Pete!\" Emily laughed as she stared at her brother's large, pantie clad behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike187/5444925/59243645/Kendra_L32_0057.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh really?\" Pete asked, as he didn't have a great view of it at the moment, \"I can't really tell from here. Are you gonna squeeze my that too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh no, that's looks like the real deal,\" Emily said, amused at the question, \"I didn't just grab your boob for no reason, I'm doing an experiment here. Speaking of which, get the skirt off and stand straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok, Emily,\" Pete said, as followed his sister's orders. He kicked off the skirt and turned to face her again. Now with all off his new clothes off, Pete felt pretty vulnerable. In his old body, he had no problem taking off his shirt in front of people. He was pretty confident in his body and wasn't ashamed to show it to anybody. Now that he was an exact copy of an older woman, that confidence has all but left Pete. Emily studiously staring at his new body didn't help either. Pete tried his best to hide his nervousness, but just ended up doing an awkward pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike187/5444925/993728875/Kendra_L32_0076.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh god, will you relax!\" Emily said, annoyed at her awkward brother, \"I was just making sure I didn't accidentally give you a belly button ring, but it turns out that's just another one of Ms. Hoover's secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Belly button ring?\" Pete asked, as looked down at his new slim stomach. To his surprise, he saw a glimmering stone attached to his bellybutton. <i>Fake tits and a bellybutton ring</i> Pete wondered as he fixated on the dangling gem, <i>Who the hell are you, Ms. Hoover?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well anyways, it seems like I did pretty good job.\" Emily announced, proud of her accomplishment, \"I'm absolutely positive that no one could tell you apart from the real Ms. Hoover. As long as you keep your mouth shut, anyways. Now I think it's time to test another spell,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Another spell!?\" Pete gasped, nervous what strange thing was going to happen to him next, \"What are you going to do to me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not sure yet, but it won't be as drastic as the transformation\" Emily said, as she flipped through her spell book again, \"Yes, something simple would be best.

Not nearly as difficult as changing a person's entire appearance, that's for sure. Plus it will give you something other than just underwear to wear,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You told me to take off my clothes,\" Pete reminded his sister,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's beside the point, Pete,\" Emily shrugged, as she clapped the book close, \"Now the only thing that spell requires is that whoever I cast it upon must already be wearing something. I guess you're slutty bra and panties count for something, so we should be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey!\" Pete blushed, \"You're the one who put them on me in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hush, Pete,\" Emily smiled, as she raised her finger and her eyes began to glow bright green, \"Let\u2019s get you in something decent. <span class=\"cgreen\">Inuolutum nouo amictu!</span>\" The familiar green glow shot of Emily fingers and once again enveloped Pete's body. But the sensations weren't even close to the ones he had felt before. Pete had no trouble staying conscious while the spell took it's course. If had to describe what he felt at the moment, he would say it was something like being inside a warm blanket. It was practically pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"See?\" Emily asked her brother as the light from finger stopped, \"Much better now, I would say. Hell, I think you look kind of pretty, Pete.\" As Pete readjusted his eyes to the regular light, he looked down at his new attire,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike187/5483102/274695502/Kendra_L34_004.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Spike...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It is kind of pretty....\" Pete got lost in thought as he felt the loose material around his breasts, \"But a dress, Emily? Really? you couldn't give me like a shirt and jeans or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Again Pete, I'm not trying to make you comfortable. I just wanted to make you look presentable,\" Emily said, \"Besides, a dress has got to be more comfortable that just wearing lingerie all day,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess so,\" Pete sighed, as he adjusted one of the dress straps, \"It's just that, my chest feels kind of weird,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You mean your boobs?\" Emily nonchalantly asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\" Pete shuddered, still not entirely ready to call them his boobs yet, \"They feel, I don't know, less restrained than they were before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh yeah,\" Emily said, like she had just remember something, \"Well, most bras wouldn't really work with that dress, so I just didn't give you one. It should be fine, your fake titties shouldn't need that much support anyway,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh,\" Pete said, as he looked back down at his chest. <i>The only thing between me and my first look at boobs in person is this dress</i> Pete deviously smiled as he pinched the top of his dress, <i>Let's see what Ms. Hoover is hiding,</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pete, focus!\" Emily slapped Pete's hand away from his dress, \"I already told you, you'll have plenty of time for that later. Now, if I'm going to leave you like this for long periods of time, I'm not always going to be able to use the clothing spell. So I'm going to use the wardrobe spell, to give you some more options. It's very similar to the clothing spell, all I have to do is sacrifice one piece of clothing and it can create you up to one hundred different outfits. Now follow me, we are going to your room,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine,\" Pete said, annoyed at his sister's interruption. He would just have to ogle his teacher's body later. As he followed his sister to the the stairs, he heard a strange click clack sound throughout the house. Pete stopped to investigate but the sound disappeared. Ignoring this, Pete continued walking only for the sound to return. Pete looked down to realize the sound was actually his high heels against the hardwood floor. <i>Have I been wearing high heels this whole time and not even realizing it,</i> Pete thought back to when he first transformed and how he was too transfixed on his new boobs, that he didn't even bother to look past them. <i>Jesus, I didn't even notice I was being lifted off the ground this whole time</i> Pete thought, as he raised one of his feet, closely examining his new shoes, <i>I've been walking in these things with no problem. Must be another effect of the spell. Creepy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, Pete, I'm waiting for you in your room,\" Emily's voice shouted from upstairs, bringing Pete back to reality. Not wanting to keep his magical sister waiting, Pete rushed up the stairs. His new breasts, despite being pretty fake, still had a lot of bounce left in them and Pete could definitely feel that on his way up the stairs. He nearly popped out of his new dress in the process. Ignoring it for now, Pete made his to his bedroom. Inside was his sister holding a pair of one of his signature destroyed jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Took your time,\" Emily said, \"I think your ratty jeans will be perfect. No one is going to miss this thing,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, I will,\" Pete said, putting his hands on his hips, \"I like those jeans. It's part of my look, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, well, your look is garbage Pete,\" Emily simply stated, \"Besides your actual look right now is a middle aged woman. So in order to keep that look, I'm going to have to sacrifice one piece of your shitty clothing. Sorry pal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't sound very sorry,\" Pete grumbled, as he watched his sister put the pair of jeans on a clothing hanger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"\"Oh boo hoo, it's not like you don't have more pants,\" Emily said, as she opened Pete's closet door. Pete's closet had two parallel clothing racks bolted near shoulder height. Pete had them arranged so that all of his casual clothes were on the right and all of his \"nice\" clothes were on the left, things like dress shirts, suit jackets, etc. Emily examined the closet for a minute and hung up the pants on the left rack. She then pushed everything on the right rack towards the back of the closet. She then took everything except the worn out jeans from the left and fit them on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That should work out nicely,\" Emily smiled, as she pointed her finger once more, \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Novum vestium!</span>\" The green glow shot from out her finger and enveloped the jeans. Pete was interested in seeing how Emily's magic worked, having only been the subject of her spells up until this point. And while the spell wasn't being cast on him, the green glow was still too bright. Pete couldn't see much of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Another success, naturally,\" Emily boasted at her handiwork, while Pete's eyes readjusted. When his vision cleared, Pete could see that in place of torn up jeans was an entire collection of female clothes. Multiple dresses and skirts, even some feminine hats now occupied half of Pete's closet. Even bras and panties were lined up with the rest of the clothes. Pete was again amazed at his sister's magic, never seeing so many clothes in one spot before. <i>I probably have more clothes than mom now,</i> Pete scratched his head, <i>What does Emily think i'm going to do with all of this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That oughta help us out later, save me some time at least,\" Emily said, \"I also put some risque stuff in there, for whenever you feel like dressing up and having some fun,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, thanks Emily,\" Pete's said, thinking of manipulating his math teacher's body while she wore lingerie. Although enjoying the image he had in his head, Pete knew he would have time for that later and tried to remain focused on the present, \"So, what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh yeah!\" Emily said, like she had just remembered something, \"We have to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Professor Nimue gave all of her students a spell in which to make any possible door they cast it upon to be an entryway into her very own home. I don't think the other girls use it very it often, and to be honest, neither have I. But seeing as this is the first time I've performed a difficult spell, I just want to see her input. So we're gonna go see her, now follow me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After seeing how powerful his sister was, Pete saw himself in no place to argue and followed his sister out of his bedroom. Going down the stairs and exiting the house, Pete was now out in public with his new body for the first time. Suddenly feeling very self conscience, Pete walked closer to his sister, as if she could protect him. Something about being in Ms. Hoover's body made him feel vulnerable. He could only describe the feeling like he was thrown outside with no clothes on. Despite his awkward feeling, he couldn't help but think of a problem of him being outside looking like his math teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, Emily,\" Pete pulled on sister's arm, getting her attention, \"Wouldn't it look weird to see you walking with your old math teacher? I mean, why would Ms. Hoover be hanging out with you? And a lot of people have had her as a teacher, she's pretty recognizable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh, I guess I didn't think about that,\" Emily realized, then grabbing Pete's slim wrist, \"Then we gotta hurry before anyone sees us!\" And with that, Emily pulled Pete's wrist and ran towards their neighbors house. Pete barely kept up with his sister, due to the fact he was now wearing high heels. The click clacking of his shows on the sidewalk pavement becoming faster as his sister pulled him towards the home. Arriving at their neighbor\u2019s door, Emily quickly performed the spell, Pointing her finger in the same manner as before. \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Accipe Me Domi Nimue</span>\" Emily exclaimed, as he eyes lit bright green again. Before any observational changes even occurred, Emily opened the door, pulled her brother in, and closed the door behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello?\" A voice came from the other room, \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Professor Nimue, it's me Emily,\" Emily excitedly said, \"I thought I could come by and show you my progress. If that's alright,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, of course it is, dear,\" Professor Nimue walked out to greet the two, \"One of my favorite students is always welcome here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/ironwingedhawk/5244604/933982226/0001.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/ironw...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, I'm not so great,\" Emily brushed off the compliment, \"I just wanted to show you how my new spell was doing,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see, so that's why you brought this,\" Nimue said, turning her attention towards Pete, \"Who's the boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Boy? How could you tell?\" Emily said, crestfallen, \"I thought I did a really good job transforming him,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"After you've been around as long as I have, you kind of just pick up on these things,\" Nimue told her disappointed student, \"Doesn't mean you didn't do a good job. I doubt there are many in this world who actually look at this person and see a teenage boy. Actually you did a remarkable job. The hair in particular is amazing. In my opinion, I'd say you already mastered the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woah, really!\" Emily asked, amazed with herself, \"This is the first time I've ever used it before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I wouldn't spread that around,\" Nimue smirked, \"You may have a natural gift for these things, but they're a lot of witches out there who have had to work tooth and nail to be as powerful as they are. They may not appreciate you boasting over your immediate skill. As much as I like our community, I know better than anyone that our people aren't the most forgiving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, really?\" Emily said, sounding self conscience, \"I'm sorry if I offended you, Professor,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Offend me?\" Nimue laughed, \"It'll take a fire and noose to offend me, child. No, you have nothing to worry about from me. But you still haven't answered my question. Who's the boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, yeah,\" Emily remembered, \"This is just my brother, he was more that willing to agree to be my doll,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your own brother?\" Nimue was amused by this, \"I mean, I guess that's one way to get a doll. Sort of prevents you from having some fun with your doll, but maybe you're not that kind of witch. But the boy should feel lucky. Not many men get to see the world of magic,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\" Pete spoke up for the first time, \"Lucky isn't the exact way I would phrase it. I didn't really know what I was signing up for and next thing I know, she transforms into an identical copy of my teacher,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pete,\" Emily looked at her brother wide eyed, \"Shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No no, it's quite fine, Emily,\" Nimue waved off her student, \"Pete, is it? I like your spunk, kid. But you don't need to get sarcastic with me, I genuinely meant you were lucky. Not just to see the magic world, but to live afterwards. You see, most people who become dolls don't have such a talented sister to be their witch. More likely than not, witches end up exploding their dolls, or making them melt, or much worse. A lot of witches don't get the knack of charms and witchcraft until their fifth doll. Even someone as old and powerful as myself have gone through dozens of dolls. So you are lucky, remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I...I will,\" Pete stuttered at the intimidating woman, trying to save face with a compliment, \"And you don't look old, um, miss,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you, boy, and I would certainly hope not!\" The witch cackled, \"If I looked like a 1,400 year old woman, I might have more worries than my students spell-work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're 1,400 years old?!?\" Pete asked, to which Nimue nodded, \"Wow, you don't look older than 45!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"45 years old?\" Nimue tone became very dark, \"You think I look like a 45 year old?\" Pete's eyes widened, knowing that he just made the mistake of a lifetime. If he was afraid of his sister's power, he couldn't imagine how powerful her teacher could be. And he just told her she looked like a woman in her forties, which was clearly not what she wanted to hear. Pete braced himself for the worst as Professor Nimue...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Invisibility is probably the simplest spell that I can cast, so there's no way I could mess it up. Let's look at this as a warm up before any difficult spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whatever,\" Pete sighed, losing interest in his sister's little game, \"So how are you gonna make me disappear Emily? Sprinkle fairy dust on my head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well seeing as this spell is pretty rudimentary, I don't need to do much at all,\" Emily simply said, \"All I need is a sample of your skin,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I don't think...\" Pete was about say more, but was interrupted as his sister quickly scratched his arm, \"Emily! What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I said I needed a skin sample,\" Emily innocently shrugged, and looked closely as the finger she used to scratch her brother, \"This seems good enough. Alright, stay still as I cast the spell,\" Pete begrudgingly did as he was told as his sister took a deep breath. She then placed her scratching finger in front of her mouth, like she was shushing someone. With an unexpected burst of sound, Emily bellowed out \"<span class=\"cgreen\">Sedem per appellationem!</span>\". Pete looked at his sister wide eyed, as her eyes turned a shade of bright green once her magical words were spoken. Pete was going to mention his concerns on the matter, but as soon as his sister's eyes had begun to shine, they returned to their normal state. It happened so fast, that Pete was unsure he had even seen it in the first place. But besides his sister's freaky eye situation, the only thing Pete could tell had happened was his sister shouting like a maniac. To his knowledge, no magic had occurred and his time had been wasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Way to go Emily,\" Pete sarcastically said, \"Nothing happened, magic lady. Can I go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you sure nothing happened?\" Emily smirked, as she picked up a mirror, \"Maybe you should take a closer look,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, if this will satisfy you...\" Pete's witty response was cut short, as he looked into the mirror and saw nothing. Well not nothing, to be exact. He did see a T-shirt, a pair of jeans, and a pair of socks. Only thing was that they were floating in midair. It looked like a ghost had decided to put on the clothes Pete was wearing that day and got caught walking around the house. But Pete knew that wasn't the case. His sister had somehow managed to make him invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jesus, Emily!\" Pete was blown away and he looked down at his hands, only to see nothing, \"How did you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"With magic, you doofus, \"Emily laughed at her befuddled brother, \"You know, the thing I've been talking about this whole time.

Get with the program, Pete,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well can you un-magic this?\" Pete asked, \"This is freaking me out,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Emily looked at the set of teenage boys clothes, \"I would love to but...</span></div></div>",

Pete would usually be concerned if he had got this random gibberish from someone else, but since it was his Grandma, he just laughed it off. It was sort of a running joke in Pete's house how his Grandma couldn't quite grasp technology. Whether it be a simple text or posting a photo onto Facebook, she somehow stumbled her way through it. No one really saw it as an actual problem though, just Grandma being adorably helpless. <i>When will you be home,</i> Pete translated his Grandmother's text, this being some what of a necessary skill in order to communicate with her. \"I'll be home in a minute, Nana.\" Pete replied, as he continued his walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few minutes, Pete had reached his house. After he hung up his backpack and took off his sneakers, he found his Grandmother in the living room. This is where Ellen spent most of her time since she moved in. It where the most comfortable chairs were and also had the computer with the largest monitor. The large monitor was easier for Ellen, as her sight began to fade. Ellen's face brightened as she saw Pete enter the room, \"Peter!\" She exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Nana,\" Pete said, noting his Grandmother's unusual excitement. \"What's got you all worked up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll tell you in minute,\" Ellen answered suspiciously, but Pete chose to ignore. Probably just his Grandmother being her weird self. \"Come and sit by me, dear,\" Ellen told Pete, beckoning to the other half of the small couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, alright\" Pete said, as he tried to squeeze himself onto the couch. Once he maneuvered his body into the tight position, he was making more physical contact with his grandmother than he would of have wanted. Everything on right side, below his waist, was pressed firmly against Ellen. and although Pete was clearly uncomfortable, Ellen didn't seem to mind at all. \"So what is it, Nana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where did these come from?\" Ellen gasped as she gripped Pete's bicep, \"Have you been working out, Peter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No more than usual,\" Peter chuckled nervously, his grandmother never being this touchy before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why, I bet the girls at your school are all over you with muscles like these,\" She said, while she continued to squeeze and prod Pete's bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well you might be surprised about that Nana,\" Pete sighed, who couldn't get a date since his sophomore year. Pete would either be too shy or the girls he was interested in just didn't feel the same way. \"I haven't had a real relationship for a while now,\" Pete said, as he tried to slowing pull his arm out his grandmother's clutches, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Actually, it's funny you brought up relationships,\" Ellen said, as she gripped Pete's bicep tighter, \"You know how I've been trying out these dating sites?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh hu?\" Pete said, confused why she even asked. Everyone in the house knew, Grandma spent half her day on the computer. Most of the time, it was Ellen just figuring out how the site worked. Once she eventually figured that out, she would spend hours at a time flirting with local, single old men. Ellen had even set up a couple meetups, but she has mentioned that the men she met online were always less charming in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well all the men I have met on those sites are scum, Peter,\" Ellen said frankly, \"I swear Peter I haven't met a decent man in fifty years. Back in my day, men were gentleman. Now they're all perverted, selfish pricks. And now that I'm older, I feel like the window for finding a good man is closing. I was thinking, if only I had more time. If only I was a younger, even by a little bit, I could find someone special who would love me just as much I love them. That's when I found this,\" Pete watched his grandmother pull a golden watch of her right pocket, while she kept gripping his arm with her free hand. The watch was almost completely ordinary, except for a small detailed picture behind the ticking arms. The symbol looked like a pair of of dark red puckering lips. Before Pete could get a closer look, Ellen started to put watch around her wrist, finally letting go of her nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And what's that?\" Pete asked, as grandmother grabbed his bicep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This...\" Ellen looked for the right words, \"...is something that will give me time. But only if you help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you want me to wind that up for you?\" A confused Pete asked, \"Because that wouldn't be so hard. You could asked anyone to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't need that and only you can help me,\" Ellen, said, sounding almost desperate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OK OK, I'll help.\" Pete said, just wanting this conversation to end. Spending the whole afternoon talking to his grandma wasn't exactly his plans today. \"How can I help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"By kissing me,\" Ellen abruptly said, as she lunged forward onto Pete's lips. As he was about to object, Pete found himself involuntarily frenching his own grandmother. Feeling her old tongue wriggle inside his mouth was too much as he pushed Ellen off of him and stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell, Nana!?!\" Pete said, as spit his Grandmother's saliva out of his mouth. Pete almost hurled at the taste of prunes mixed with cough drops that she left on his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry Peter,\" Ellen said, pretty insincerely, \"But I needed to kiss a good man for the watch to activate. And you're the closest thing to a good man I know of. Don't worry though, I'll make it up to you. Oh god, I can already feel the power activating!\" And just as Ellen was done rambling, what looked like a small thunderbolt shot out of her watch towards Pete. The thunderbolt hit him directly in the chest and right before Pete's eyes...</span></div></div>",

Transitioning from her natural grey tone, to a much darker brown. It even grew out a couple inches, changing from her reserved elderly style to a modern, wavy, shoulder length look. Pete noticed all of the wrinkles on Ellen's face were disappearing as well. Like her very skin was being tightened and smoothed, leaving behind a much more youthful face. Even Ellen's make up changed, morphing from her simple cover up and eye shadow into bright lip gloss and smokey eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pete couldn't help but notice his grandmother's body change as well. The wrinkles on her arms reverting much like the ones on her face, but her livers spots and even her scars were disappearing as well. It seems like all of the excess weight she  had gained over the years was evaporating in midair. But some off her leftover weight was shifted into what used to be larger parts of her body, like Ellen's breasts and ass. Ellen's chest looked like it was being inflated as the changes reverted years of breastfeeding and abuse. Any sag in Ellen\u2019s boobs were removed, as all  of perkiness returned. Likewise, Ellen's flat grandma butt expanded quickly, looking much more like a yoga instructor\u2019s ass rather than an old woman's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lastly, Ellen's clothes themselves changed. Her sensible flats darkened and stretched into a pair of black stiletto heels. The rest of her clothes, socks, pants, blouses, etc. all turned black as well and fused together towards Ellen's center. Like some kind of Sailor moon-like transformation, the fused clothed turned into a tight black halter dress. The dress had a white lightning-like design all the way down the middle, much like the one's shooting out of the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/C17/5640014/469224613/Darcie_Dolce_009.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/C17/5...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Guess that about does it,\" The new Ellen smiled as she examined her body, \"I can't believe it worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha....\" Pete was so blown away at what he just saw, he couldn't manage to find the words, \"Wha. What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, Peter, it's just wonderful!\" Ellen exclaimed, as she picked up the watch, \"This is called a passion clock. It's a very rare artifacts from medieval times. Probably only 10 left in the entire world. I was incredibly fortunate to get my hands on one. The passion clocks were created by a master craftsman, renowned for his work across the globe. The craftsman spent decades perfecting the art of clockwork, becoming the best the entire world. But while perfecting his art, the craftsman never socialized and thus, never met a woman to share his success with. Fearing he was now too old to find a lover, the craftsmen designed a clock that could change a person's age with the activation of a passionate kiss between two pure souls. And it worked, The craftsman became a young man and spent the rest of his life building passion clocks with his new wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, OK that sounds crazy,\" Pete said, but quickly understood that what he had just saw had proven him otherwise, \"So, why did you use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What kind of question is that?\" Ellen gave her grandson a strange look, \"Because I didn't want to be an old woman. Did you know I married your grandfather right out of high school? He was the only man I've ever been with for nearly 50 years and he's a shithead! I wasted my whole life with that bastard and I wanted another chance to do it right. And I think I'm off to a good start. Is this what kids wear these days? I feel practically naked in this dress!\" Ellen said, as she stood up from the couch and spun around. Smiling and bending over slightly, she added, \"But at least I wear it well, don't you think so, Peter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/C17/5640014/747247759/Darcie_Dolce_005.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/C17/5...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Grandma!\" Peter blurted, as he avoided the sight of grandma's shapely behind, \"Why me!?!

It was like being hit by a truck--he was catapulted backward as his vision was filled with stars.  Down was up and up was down as Pete seemed to be tumbling through a strange tunnel, a sort of wormhole in which the brief glimpses Pete could manage were filled with strange, swirling colors and shapes in which time and light themselves seemed to bend and shift around Pete.  He stayed awake for a few moments, but vertigo quickly overcame him as he flew through the wormhole at breakneck speed and passed out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pete opened his eyes, he saw the rays of a shinning sun and a bright blue sky.  He blinked a few times before he got a sense of where he was.  \"What the hel--\" Pete began as he realized he was lying flat upon his back.  He sat up and looked around in confusion.  He seemed to be in an open area, seemingly in fairly ordinary suburb.  The place was filled with one- and two-story homes of average size with a kid playing out in the front yard here and there.  One thing stuck Pete though (aside from the thunderbolt)--the cars.  They were strange, like strange as in old.  They were practically tanks--big metal beauties with chrome wheels and shiny chrome bumpers--all of them.  Jack looked closer . . . the cars were clean, and in fact they looked new.  Sure, some people had cars from the 1950s and 1960s that they kept clean and nice, but they did that by keeping them under tarps and cleaning them obsessively.  These cars were just sitting the the driveway of house after house exposed to the elements.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erie huh?\" came a female voice.  Pete looked around to see the source of the sound.  To his right he saw his grandmother Ellen.  She was dressed as she had been--a red sweater with \"Cool Grandma\" written in glittery letters across the front, and a set of jeans that had been let out around the waist to make room for grandma's expanding mid-section.  She also had a couple rings on her aging, wrinkled hands, and she wore a thick set of glasses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nana?\" Pete said in amazement as he stood up, \"how did you get here?\" he asked.  He had not seen her come through the wormhole or whatever the hell it was.  \"Same way you did I suspect,\" she answered, \"though that isn't the most specific, informative answer I guess,\" she admitted.  \"What is this place?\" Pete asked.  Ellen smiled as she looked around.  \"This is my neighborhood from when I was just about your age,\" she said as memories of days gone by filled her mind, \"and you can thank the magic of the watch for that,\" she said.  \"Well . . . the magic of the watch and the fact that you kissed me so passionately,\" she said.  Pete blushed, filled with both shame and anger.  \"You kissed me , Nana,\" he said sternly.  Ellen just chuckled.  \"Details . . . details,\" she said dismissively, \" . . . important thing is it got the job done.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was the job exactly?\" Pete asked.  Ellen looked back and answered, \"I wanted a second chance at love, my boy,\" she asked, \"and a chance to be young again,\" she said.  Pete was confused.  \"Well you're same age as you were before, and I love you, but not the way you're looking for, so where exactly does that leave us?\" Pete asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen was irked.  \"It leaves us in store for an adventure, young man,\" she said, \"something your generation doesn't get enough of, so follow me,\" she commanded.  Suddenly, Pete found he was following his grandmother as she headed toward a house some distance away.  It was the strangest thing--he hadn't intended to move, but his legs just started walking. That was a source of worry for him; in fact, the whole thing was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them approached a nice home with a well-trimmed yard, one of innumerable cookie-cutter houses constructed as the Baby Boom got into full swing in the immediate aftermath of World War 2.  The two stood under a roof upon a concrete platform just outside somebody's front door when Ellen stopped Pete.  \"Pete,\" she began, \"I was your age in 1964, which I'm thinking is about where we are.  It was a different time, so do mind your manners.  I'll never be able to figure out what is going on, and I won't get what I want if you get us tossed out of places because you've brought your 2016 sensibilities to this era,\" she cautioned.  Pete simply nodded silently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen raised her hand to knock sternly upon the door.  Instead, the strangest thing happened--her hand went right through it.  Ellen's eyes went wide, as did Pete's.  \"Oh my goodness,\" Ellen began as she saw what happened.  \"Nana, your hand,\" Pete said, amazed.  He gingerly reached his own hand out and set it upon the door, and then he pushed it right through the door.  He left it there half inside the house for a few seconds before the sheer weirdness got to him and he pulled his arm out quickly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked at each other.  \"Nana, I don't think--I don't think we have bodies,\" Pete said, stricken by the strangeness of what he had just admitted.  \"I guess we just go through then?\" Ellen said.  Gingerly, she stepped through the door, and Pete watched as she simply phased through it effortlessly, though not without some trepidation.  Pete quickly followed suit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two found themselves in a spacious home and glanced about at the entryway.  All the furniture was from the 1960s or older.  \"Where are we?\" Pete asked.  Ellen looked about a bit.  \"I think I remember this place . . . Watermans lived here, I think,\" she said quietly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, noise could be heard approaching the two time travelers.  \"Mom, did you see my Gary US Bonds record?\" came the voice of a young girl as she stepped into the foyer of the house.  Pete and Ellen froze, terrified at what was about to befall them.  They'd barged into the house of these unsuspecting people.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman who walked in seemed to be about 17 or 18 years old.  She had straight black hair and a somewhat pudgy body.  A thick sweater adorned her top, and the sweater was a bit strained because a full belly jiggled a bit as she walked, as did the bouncy mounds that hung from her chest but were covered by the sweater.  She had a full set of thighs and wide hips, all encased in a tight-fitting black skirt that came nearly down to her knees, as was the more proper and modest trend of that day.  Still, this young woman's ass stuck out from behind her, and there was no hiding that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amazing thing was that the woman simply walked right through the entry area of the house and into the room that was on the other side of it.  She didn't stop or seem at all to care about the strangers in her midst.  \"Becky Waterman,\" Ellen observed after the young woman had gone, \"and she didn't see us.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete and Ellen walked quietly into the kitchen where Becky had headed.  She stood by the island in the middle of the kitchen as she spoke to a woman busy over a stove.  The woman over the stove turned around. She was a bigger, bustier, more beautiful version of Becky.  \"That would be Margret,\" Ellen said, \"just as I remember her.\"  \"I don't know where that dreadful record is dearie.  Did you look in your closet?\"  Becky nodded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret was a woman of about 44 with long, curly dark hair.  She was not fat, but she certainly had a full body that had jiggles and curves in the right places.  She had a couple lines around her eyes, as fit a woman her age, and two wondrous mounds dangled from her chest.  They jiggled and bounced as she walked, and the plain white blouse and apron she had on struggled to contain their girth.  Farther down, the full-bodied Margret carried a small pouch of extra weight in her belly--not big, but noticeable.  She had wide hips and a big, beautiful ass, though her modest dress bottom obscured it a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Pete's eyes hung open at the sight of the curvy, busty housewife, Ellen's mind ran wild with a couple ideas.  \"Let me try something,\" she said as she walked around and stood behind the unknowing Becky.  \"We're ghosts, basically, right?\" she asked Pete.  \"Seems so,\" Pete said.  \"Let's act the part,\" Ellen said as she stepped up and forced her way inside Becky's body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump, dark-haired Becky began to shake and convulse a bit, causing a delightful bounce in her chest.  The young woman's eyes rolled back into her head as the invading spirit filled every crevice of her consciousness.  She choked and gagged a little bit as Ellen took over, and then suddenly all that stopped.  The girl stood still, and a small smile crossed her face.  Her hands came up and felt around her belly and her chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, Becky,\" what's that noise you're making back there?\" asked Margret, engrossed still in cooking.  Becky did not answer.  \"Nana, is that you in there!?\" Pete demanded.  Becky nodded with a devious smile, saying nothing.  \"Sorry, Mother, I don't know what got into me,\" Becky said, flashing a knowing glance in the direction of Pete, to whom Margret remained oblivious.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With that, Ellen began to walk out of the kitchen, a devious smile planted on the face her her new body.  \"Nana!  What the hell are you doing?!\" Pete demanded as the two stepped into Becky's room and Ellen closed the door.  She smiled at him as the walked over to the mirror in Becky's room and began examining herself.  \"Why, I'm enjoying my new body, Pete,\" she said as she ran her hands  all over herself.  She seemed to have particular fun groping Becky's boobs, smashing them together and letting them rise and fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nana, would you stop that!  It's weird . . . \" Pete said, finding the very idea of such a sight disconcerting.  \"Pete, this body is not classically beautiful.  She's got a pretty face, but she could stand to miss a meal or two,\" Ellen explained as she disappeared into a closet, \"and that's just the way I remember her.\"  A couple minutes passed as Pete stood in the room while Ellen's possessed vessel fiddled about in the closet.  Pete could hear elastic bands snapping into place, as well as the occasional grunt from Ellen's new body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of grunting and snapping and tossing clothes about, the possessed Becky emerged from the closet.  The young woman who emerged wore a very tight-fitting skirt that made it only about half way down her thigh--quite high in those days.  Farther up, her shirt revealed a small pouch of extra skin in her belly--the bit of extra pudginess Ellen had referred to.  The most striking feature, though, was the all-important girls.  This is to say that Ellen had picked a very tight-fitting, button-down blouse that struggled to contain her bouncing, jiggle-prone boobs--boobs struggling against the fabric of the shirt as they were shoved up just under her chin and struggling mightily to stay out of her top.  \"So I have to accentuate the assets I do have,\" Ellen concluded as she motioned to her mighty cleavage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete's jaw dropped as he saw what Ellen had done to Becky's body.  \"Like what you see, Pete?\" she said.  \"Ah--the--well . . . the . . . um--\" he said, pointing awkwardly in the direction of his grandmother's vessel.  \"Boobs?\" Ellen said, blurting out the word Pete had been reaching for.  \"Yes,\" he nodded, relieved someone had stopped his stuttering, \"they're impressive.\"  Ellen smiled somewhat quizzically.  She sat herself upon the bed, perpetuating a delightful jiggle in her chest.  \"So grandson,\" she began, \"we've never really talked about this before I don't think, but I'm curious--what turns you on?  What do you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete blushed.  It was strange to discuss this with one's grandmother under any circumstances.  It was all the more weird to do so when said grandmother was inhabiting the body of a busty, scantily clad young woman from her own past.  \"And be honest now,\" Ellen commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete took a deep breath.  \"To be honest, lots of women can be beautiful, but I'm partial to redheads.  I don't know why it is . . . black hair is pretty too.  And really, I know the sort of classically beautiful woman, at least in a lot of people's minds, is a toned body attached to a big set of boobs, and I am a boob man--don't get me wrong--but I think a body that's too toned is a problem, really.  I mean, I'm not saying women should be slobs, but I don't want to fuck a woman who looks so muscular that she could kick my ass . . . it's a turn-off.  No, I like a woman with a bit of extra weight--just a bit.  Not enough to be fat, but enough to be curvy.  When I slap her on the ass, there should be a little jiggle and when she walks, there should be some bounce in her tits.  If what it takes is a full, voluptuous body to give me those things, then I'll fuck that body indeed.  And the thing is that the bodies I'm talking about tend to belong to women who are either in or nearing middle age . . I suppose their bodies change in their thirties and forties to provide a bit of extra bounce and make the curves a bit more pronounced, and an older woman with those things can be really hot.  At least that's how I feel about it,\" Pete concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell?  Had Pete just said all that?  Really?  Pete loved his grandma, but he would never be that graphic in answering that question.  Talking about what turned him on physically with his grandma would never cross his mind.  Why had he said all that?  It was as though he could not stop himself.  She he needed to be honest, and out came all that!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete gulped and blushed as much as any man ever could.  He looked up at Ellen, or at least at the body Ellen now occupied.  She was surprised too--her eyes wide with surprise and her face bearing a smile she sought to hold back but couldn't.  She blushed too.  \"Well, um, thank you, Pete,\" she began, not sure what to say to all that.  \"I didn't mean to answer that way,\" Pete said, suddenly very self-conscious.  Ellen tilted her head.  \"Then why did you answer so . . . \" she began.  \"I don't know,\" he said, cutting her off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might know,\" Ellen said, a devious smile crossing her face.  \"Pete, jump up and down,\" she said plainly.  \"Why would I--\" Pete began, and then he suddenly found himself jumping into the air and coming back down.  He did this three times before Ellen ended it.  \"Stop,\" she said, and he did.  Pete was getting scared now.  \"What's happening, Nana?\" he asked, fear in his voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know how the spell worked--the magic,\" she said, her mind seeming to turn over with possibilities.  She crossed her arms over her host's magnificent boobs and took a deep breath to explain.  \"The kiss from you activated the magic that sent us here.  I did it so that I could be young again and could find love . . . and I think I know why you're here,\" she said.  \"Why?\" Pete asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You help me find what I want,\" she said.  \"I'll bet you can posses people too.  If you can, you can be my wing-man.  If it comes to that, I can even order you into a body and just tell you to fuck me . . . I seem to be able to make you do whatever I tell you to do,\" Ellen pondered.  Pete shuttered at the thought.  This could be terrible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nana, we've got to find a way to get home.  I need to get back to my body, and you need to get back to yours.  We all love you just the way you are,\" Pete pleaded.  Ellen just shook her head.  \"I need to find a good man,\" she declared, \"and you will help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's possessed body began to strut sexily out of the bedroom toward the kitchen.  She motioned with her finger for Pete to follow her, and he found himself doing so without intending to.  The two walked into the kitchen where Becky's buxom mother Margret labored over a stove brimming with food.  \"Becky, I could have sworn I heard you talking to someone in your room . . . are you having friends over or something?\" Margret asked.  Ellen just smiled.  \"Yeah,\" she began, \"but that's not something you need to know about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret turned around, confusion and anger on her face.  \"Excuse me, young lady, but his is my house, and I'm fine letting you have friends over, but you will pay me the respect I deserve and--\" she began angrily.  \"No,\" Ellen replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret widened her eyes as a look of increasing anger crossed her face.  She slammed the spoon down into the bowl on the stove and began to walk toward her daughter, or at least toward the person inside her daughter's body.  \"What?!\" the woman demanded as she quickly approached Becky, her own boobs bouncing about inside her tight-fitting blouse.  \"You heard me,\" Ellen said, \"I won't respect you, and you won't be doing anything about it,\" she said, a defiant smile crossing her face.  Margret was really boiling now.  \"Becky Marie, I will not allow you to talk to me that way!\" she yelled.  \"It's not going to be up to you,\" Ellen declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen stuck out her host's hand in Pete's direction.  Suddenly, Pete felt a strange sensation sneak through his body.  Becky brought her hand up a little bit, and Pete's jaw dropped as his ghost-like body levitated off the ground.  \"Nana, what are you doing?!\" he screamed, fearful of what would come next.  \"Night night mommy,\" Ellen declared as she quickly threw her arm in the direction of her oblivious mother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete suddenly felt his astral-like form sailing through the air toward Margret as she bubbled over with rage at her disrespectful daughter.  As he neared the buxom, middle-aged woman, his body did not crash into hers.  Instead, it merged with her.  Pete felt his body fly into hers as his form seemed to force its way into her mouth.  Pete felt himself travel down her throat and into her belly as his essence filled out every crevice of her luscious body.  Margret gagged, shook, and spasmed as she felt herself losing control, but she could not fight much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret toppled roughly and ungracefully to the floor, her jiggle-prone boobs bouncing mightily with the impact, and she passed out, and Pete too was overcome by darkness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete's eyes fluttered open as he awakened.  He moaned a little bit at the pain in his head, and his voice sounded strange.  \"Wha--\" he began, and that voice definitely sounded off.  Pete quickly brought his hand to his mouth in amazement, only to find that it too was different--dainty, and a bit older.  What Pete saw next was really amazing.  Pete beheld two gigantic mounds of flesh protruding from his chest.  They were huge from this angle--Pete had boobs!  \"Oh my God,\" he said as he reached up and poked at the mounds, sending waves of pleasure through his new body.  He could see a few strands of long, dark hair out of the corners of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like those, do you--Mom?\" came the voice of Ellen's host as she stood over him.  \"What did you do--\" Pete started.  \"I put you in Margret's body.  I'm going to go out and find a man to bring home.  You cook dinner and wear something sexy for when I come back,\" she said.  With that, Ellen turned and left Pete lying on the floor in the kitchen--inside the body of a curvy, middle-aged woman named Margret.    <br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some more people who could have texted Pete:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick Snickles: A 17 year old Senior in Pete's school. Pete heard rumors about this science prodigy for years. He heard that Rick was going to some special school where the smartest kids in America went to, but he was kicked out for some unknown reason. According to the stories, Pete's school was the only one to accept Rick after whatever happened. Pete ignored all those stories and just decided to be friendly towards the guy. Pete would try to talk to Rick every once in a while but the conversations never lead to anywhere. Pete shrugged it off, assuming that Rick just liked to keep to himself. Rick likes Star Trek: The Next Generation, Doritos, and swedish techno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia Connors: Pete's 35 year old Aunt. Sophia is Pete's father's sister. She used to run a rental truck company with her brother until his untimely death. She took his death pretty hard, and spent almost all of her time on the company. In a strange twist of events, Sophia's focus on the job had expanded the company tenfold. She had a full staff under her, essentially running the company without her. After nine years of silence, she finally had the courage to talk to the family again. Unluckily for her, Pete's mom, sister, and Grandmother were still frustrated with Sophia's absence in their lives and not yet willing to forgive her. Only Pete had given her a chance and had been spending every other weekend at her place, watching old movies, swimming in her pool, or just talking about life. Pete has grown close to Sophia and considers her a personal hero. Sophia likes spaghetti, the west coast, and spaghetti westerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory Pound: Pete's 55 year old Principal. \"That guy belongs in the circus\" Jack once said, describing to Pete what their principal was like. Pete heard many stories about Mr. Pound, some revolving around him losing his mind during his campaign in Vietnam, others regarding him being an actual werewolf. What Pete really learned from all of this, is that he might live in one of stupidest towns in the world. Mr. Pound wasn't that weird, he was just happy 24/7. It was slightly unsettling to see his big smile every day but that might just be in contrast to the hundreds of frowning teenagers roaming the halls. Also, Mr. pound would often stop Pete and talk to him in between classes. He would ask about what Pete did to exercise or what Pete would usually eat. Pete once asked Jack if Mr. Pound ever asked him those kind of questions, and he responded with, \"Um no, that would be bizarre. Who asks that kind of shit? Fucking weirdos, that's what.\" Pete shrugged it off, as he usually did with these sort of things, probably just a weirdo being weird. Mr. Pound likes Pez Dispensers, Tofu, and Looney Toons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNigel Bonnet: A 28 year old Comic Book Store Owner. Pete and Jack would often frequent the local Comic book store \"The Power Within\", which was run by the not-so lovable Nigel. Nigel got along just fine with Jack and Pete, saying that \"I feel as though we are long lost brothers separated by war,\u201d Other people, especially people his own age or people unfamiliar with Batman or Lord of the Rings, were treated pretty harshly. Pete once asked Nigel if he thought that was a wise business strategy, to which Nigel responded with \"Don't meddle in the matters of Kings and their enemies. Besides, those guys are dicks.\" Nigel was fun to hang around but whenever Pete and Jack had to be on their way, Nigel would turn passive aggressive and imply that he needed to reorganize the back catalog. Pete often wondered if Nigel had any other friends besides two dorky teenagers. Nigel enjoys Smoothies, Game of Thrones, and Women who Cosplay.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pete was puzzled, he had never gotten a text from Rick before. He had given Rick his phone number months ago out of politeness but Rick never used it. Pete thought that Rick just wasn't a texting type of guy, either way the message was strange. Pete was too tired to work on some project with a guy he didn't actually care that much about. Pete sent a text back \"Maybe some other time, man. I'm pretty tired\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wasn't asking you, I was telling you,\" read Rick's reply. Pete probably would have taken this as a threat, if not for the fact that Rick was one of the wimpiest guys in school. Rick was barely five feet tall and was skinny as a rail. Pete ignored Rick's strange messages as put his phone back into his pocket. Suddenly, Pete felt a towel around his mouth. Someone had snuck up behind and was trying to drug him. Pete smelled some strong, unfamiliar chemical that the towel was dosed in. <i>Chloroform</i> Pete went into survival mode, as he quickly turned and punched his assailant in the face. Pete would have continued attacking, if hadn't started to lose feeling in all of his limbs. Pete fell flaccidly onto the pavement as he stared up at the person who drugged him. <i>Rick?</i> Pete could make out a short, skinny man, holding his face in pain. Pete was going to scream for help, but the chloroform had taken it's toll. As Pete eyes forced themselves shut, the last thing he could feel was someone pathetically trying to drag his body somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wake up, Pete!\" Rick snorted at Pete, waking him from his drug induced sleep. Pete found himself tied to a chair with knotted wires. Pete recognized the room he was trapped in as one of the chemistry labs in his school, All around him were diagrams of atoms and pictures of the elemental table. Directly in front of him, was a rather chipper Rick, busy working with a large active chemistry set. Test tubes and vials across the table were bubbling and changing bright colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rick,\" Pete tried to remain clam, clearly not being in the right position to be threatening, \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Did you ever hear why I was kicked out of my old school, Pete?\" Rick ignored Pete question, as he continued to fiddle with the many vials in front of him, \"Surely, you've heard the rumors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I heard rumors,\" Pete grunted, as he wiggle his left arm. The wires started to loosen, and Pete was sure he if could maneuver his arms correctly, that he would be free. All he had to do was distract Rick until then, \"I heard that you turned into a monster and went on a murdering rampage. I heard that you gave a dog super intelligence and it took over your neighborhood. I also heard that you used school supplies to build yourself a sex robot. I think that one is the most believable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"People can be ridiculous, can't they?\" Rick chuckled as he looked over his shoulder at Pete, \"I never took you for somebody to believe in that kind of stuff. You've always been very nice to me, and I honestly appreciate it, Pete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is this how you repay kindness, Rick?\" Pete asked, as he freed his left arm. <i>Yes, one down!</i> Pete tried to hide his smile and kept talking to his captor, \"Maybe I should have left you alone. I wouldn't be strapped to this chair right now if I wasn't so nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ha! I guess you're right!\" Rick laughed, as he turned from his mad scientist kit, holding a test tube in his hand. Inside the tube was a bright pink liquid. It looked like someone melted bubblegum and poured it inside a test tube. \"See this,\" Rick pointed to the pink liquid, \"This is what got me banned from my old school. For such an elite school, I thought they would have rejoiced at my scientific advancements. Instead they called me a madman. They were very upset that I tested it on a fellow student, but what's one life cost when I could makes millions of lives better? Either way, they told me I would be in jail for life after what I did to that girl, but luckily for me, they couldn't categorize what I did as a crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You got off on a technicality?\" Pete reminded himself to never trust a lawyer. His right arm was almost free at this point, <i>Almost there, distract this manic just a little bit longer</i>. \"So,\" Pete tried to sound interested, \"What does it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't want to ruin the surprise, Pete!\" Rick held up his pink concoction , admiring his creation, \"You should really feel honored. You're doing a great service to science, Pete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well science will have to wait,\" Pete was now free from the tangled wires, \"I'm gonna beat the shit out of you, you fucking lunatic!\" Pete yelled and he lunged forward with a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not so fast,\" Rick calmly said, as he jerked the test tube forward, sending the liquid onto Pete's face. Pete recoiled in pain as the liquid starting to activate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What did you do to me!\" Pete screamed as the pain from his face traveled throughout his whole body. He felt like he was on fire, never feeling such intense pain in his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Relax, Pete. Pain is normal,\" Rick jotted down on a clipboard how his experiment was going, \"It's a small price to pay for you to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pete, can you come over to my place? Something freaky happened,\" Read the troubling message from his aunt. Going straight into protective nephew mode, Pete sent a quick worried text back, \"Is everything OK? Are you hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nothing like that. I just need someone to talk to. Someone who will understand,\" Sophia texted back, putting Pete's concerns to rest. Pete, although relieved to hear about his aunt's safety, nevertheless rushed to her house. <i>Something big must have happened</i> Pete thought as he jogged towards his aunts house, <i>Sophia is the most relaxed person I've ever met, she's never said anything like that before.</i> Pete remembered his aunt accidentally cutting her arm on a shard of broken glass. While Pete freaked out, running around Sophia's house trying to find bandages and disinfectant, she just remained calm. \"It's just a little gash, Pete,\" She said, trying to calm her nephew, \"Jesus, don't have a heart attack. It'll take a lot more than that to hurt me,\" Sophia always seemed so cool and collected in Pete's eyes, he wondered what could make her so distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sophia?\" Pete asked out loud, as he entered his aunt's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm in here Pete,\" His aunt's voice answered, coming from her living room. Pete quickly made his way towards her and was greeted with an unexpectedly happy Sophia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://27.imagebam.com/download/H7YktytvWO6jAMOTEXJZyg/15237/152365440/mic014mm002.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://27.imagebam.com/download/H7Yktytv...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what happened?\" Pete asked, wondering if he should have gotten so worked up over his seemingly fine aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh jeez,\" Sophia laughed at her paranoid nephew, \"I didn't mean to make you worry. This is something to be excited about, not stress out over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What am I supposed to be excited about?\" Pete might have been annoyed by his aunt laughing at him, if she didn't do it constantly. He was always the butt of all her jokes. But Pete couldn't complain, since he treated her the same way. His relationship with Sophia was less like aunt and nephew, and more like old friends. Just the way they talked to each other might seem bizarre to strangers. No subject was taboo when they talked, saying whatever came to their minds. Whether it be how many men Sophia has slept with or what kind of porn Pete liked to watch, everything was out in the open. So when Pete asked her a question, he knew he would get a honest answer, just as he always had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pete, I was abducted by Aliens!\" Sophia happily exclaimed. <i>Not the honest answer I was hoping for</i> Pete thought as he gave his aunt the appropriate look when somebody tells you they were attacked by aliens. \"Now don't look at me like that,\" Sophia reprimanded her nephew, \"At least listen to me before you get all judgy on me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dude,\" Pete looked at his aunt, seeing clearly in her face that she was telling the truth. Or at least what she believed what was the truth. Putting all logic aside, Pete put his respect for his aunt before his better judgement and decided to hear her out. \"Alright,\" Pete sighed, \"Tell me about the Aliens, Sophia\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OK, so it happened last night\" Sophia tried to paint Pete a picture, \"I was out drinking on my patio, just counting the stars, minding my own business. When out of nowhere, a shining white light came down from the sky and rose me out of my chair! Next thing I know, I'm standing in a room full of Aliens, Pete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dJust standing in a room full of Aliens? You weren\u2019t constrained at all?\" Pete interrupted, trying to find in the whole of what seemed like an alcohol induced nightmare, \"I thought aliens strapped their abducted humans to tables and anal probed them. That didn't happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, I asked them about that,\" Sophia looked up at ceiling trying to remember more of what happened, \"They seem insulted by the question. They said that humans had a very negative attitude towards other sentient species, but that was mostly due to our inferior intellect. I told them it was my turn to be insulted, but they assured me that they consider all life precious and that humans could be great allies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" Pete thought of another question to get his aunt out of her fantasy, \"What did they look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They looked like floating jellyfish,\" Sophia snapped, remembering more and more with each question, \"But they were thicker than regular jellyfish. And less translucent. And their tentacles had to be 7 feet long. And they kept changing colors. Like randomly, sometimes they would be blue and other times they would be orange. It was pretty trippy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, Sophia\" Pete thought of one more question, \"Why did they abduct you in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's the most interesting part, Pete!\" Sophia practically yelled, \"I asked them what they were doing and they told me they were going to test some new drug of theirs on me. See, on their home planet, they outlawed animal testing and they refuse to test it on their own species. But if they test with a species that doesn't live on their planet, then their government doesn't seem to care too much. They told me that out of the entire planet, I was only human compatible with their new drug.  I was hesitant at first, but they told me I could help billions of their kind if they just shot me up with some goo. I eventually gave in and they put this weird stuff into my bloodstream. Then I passed out and woke up in my backyard. Guess how the drug is supposed to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Does it make you you tell very long lies to you nephews?\" Pete was amazed, hearing his reasonable aunt say such ridiculous nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, you little brat,\" Sophia smirked, \"The drug lets me...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I hadn't been inside a hovering spacecraft, surrounded by aliens, I might not have believed them, but I'm pretty sure it's legit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But why?\" Pete further questioned his aunt, \"Why in the world would a drug do that? How could that be useful in any way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well think about it, Pete,\" Sophia explained, \"This drug is the most perfect form of espionage. All you would have to do is seduce an enemy and you could become them. You could then easily sneak behind enemy territory, learn their secrets, or even assassinate unsuspecting commanding officers. It's the perfect tool for the perfect spy, Pete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess so,\" Pete scratched his head, \"But why did they test it on you? Wouldn't it be better to test it on an actual spy then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I think they just thought I wouldn't abuse it,\" Sophia shrugged, \"Plus I guess they know I never really have any trouble getting laid,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh, Sophia,\" Pete grimaced, fully aware of his aunts of promiscuity, \"So lets say I believe all this crazy alien stuff, why would you tell me? Why didn't you tell a friend or the government or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The government? Yeah, that would end well Pete.\" Sophia scoffed, \"I told you because you are my friend. I'm more open with you than anyone else I know. You're probably the best friend I have, plus the closest family member I have by far. I trust you and I know you trust me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's a little harder to trust you after telling me you can swap bodies, Sophia,\" Pete said, \"But you sound very certain about this, so I guess I'll play along. Now what was your plan after telling me this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well you see Pete, this puts me in kind of a difficult spot,\" Sophia looked down, trying to avoid her nephew's eyesight, \"You see, going back to the whole trust thing, I don't really trust anyone being in my body. Some people might just parade my body naked throughout the town, or accidentally break one of my legs. So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what?\" Pete stuttered, really hoping his aunt wasn't implying what he thought she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pete,\" Sophia's tone turned serious, as she placed a hand on Pete's shoulder, \"I need you. You're the only one I know who can help me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I....um..I,\" Pete stammered, his face flushed red. He couldn't believe what his own aunt was asking him to do. <i>Did Sophia just ask me to sleep with her?</i> Pete's thoughts became flustered, <i>And why am I thinking about anything but saying no?.</i> Facing a moral dilemma, Pete unconvincingly came up with an excuse to leave the room, \"I gotta go to the bathroom!\" Pete unintentionally yelled, \"I'll be right back,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, Pete,\" Sophia said calmly, \"Take some time to think about it. I'll be right here,\" And with that, Pete rushed towards the bathroom. He closed the door and splashed some cold water on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell was that!?\" Pete frantically whispered to his reflection, \"Did Sophia actually just ask me to have sex with her? What in the world is she thinking?\" Pete was struggling to understand his aunt's reasoning. He understood that by this point, Sophia really did believe she had been abducted by aliens. Whether it was actually true or not, she truly believes that put some weird body swapping sex medicine inside her. Sophia had also made it clear to Pete that he was the only one she could trust with this information. So much to Pete's dismay, he couldn't find any other way to look at this other than his own aunt inviting him to have sex with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How could she even suggest that? I mean...We're related,\" Pete was finding it hard to look himself in the mirror, \"I why didn't I just say no?\" As much as Pete hated himself for it, he was kind of turned on by his aunt's advances. Ever since Pete starting hanging out with Sophia again, he had started seeing her in a new light. It would be impossible to deny that the woman wasn't a bombshell. Sophia was the curviest woman Pete has ever seen, and Pete could tell she didn't mind showing it off. It seemed like her default choice of clothes wear either tight or revealing. And despite Pete's best efforts to ignore it, he only grew more and more attracted to his aunt's voluptuous body with each visit. He found himself involuntarily asking his aunt to use her pool nearly every time he came over, just on the off chance she would join him. Pete would try to hide his excitement as Sophia would exit her home, wearing one of her many titillating swimsuits. Pete just hoped Sophia didn't notice him practically drooling over her as they swam and splashed around. \"Well, maybe....\" Pete murmured, remembering the small bikini his aunt wore the last time they used the pool, \"Maybe this wouldn't be so bad....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, What? No!\" Pete angrily whispered to himself, \"What the hell is wrong with you, Pete! It doesn't matter what she looks like, this is your family! No, I am marching straight back into that room and telling her no.\" With that, Pete shook off any inappropriate thoughts, and became resolute. He opened the bathroom and made his way back to the living room. <i>What's she's asking for is ridiculous</i> Pete mentally prepared himself, <i>What the hell did she think I was gonna say?</i> \"Alright Sophia, listen up. I am not going to.....\" Pete's mouth flew wide open at sight of aunt in nothing but her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://51.imagebam.com/download/e8Mg9QB9Fk5kU4yfH9l8Pw/15237/152365772/mic014mm041.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://51.imagebam.com/download/e8Mg9QB9...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, hello Peter,\" Sophia said with feigned innocence, \"I thought a change of clothes, or rather, no clothes would help convince you to help.

Pete, not about to take orders from strangers, sent a quick text back, \"Um no. Who is this and How did you get my number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is your Principal. I got your phone number through an internet search. I'm texting you because there's a situation at the high school and I need the help of a good student. And I think you are the perfect student to help out. Please come to my office when you get here. See you, Peter,\" Pete scratched his head at the very strange message. Mr. Pound was always pretty friendly towards him but he never expected to get texts from the man. Feeling uneasy about any more interactions with his weird Principal, Pete kept walking home but quickly stopped. <i>What kind of damage could this guy do to my future?</i>, Pete wondered, <i>Maybe I should stay on this guys good side. At least for the time being.</i> And with that, Pete let out a heavy sigh and started walking back towards his High school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pete was unnerved by the emptiness of the school halls. The big open pathways were barely lit by low wattage fluorescent bulbs used after school hours. Instead of the usual sounds of feet trampling the floors and teenagers yelling at each other, there was silence except a far away janitor whistling old rock songs. Pete shook his head quickly, trying to shake off these tense feelings he was giving himself. Pete made a turn in the halls and saw his principals office across the hall. Pete squinted his eyes, he could have sworn that he saw a purple flash through the blurred glass in the Principal's door. <i>Probably a lava lamp or something</i> Pete shrugged as he reached his hand towards the door and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come in, Peter!\" Mr. Pound exclaimed. Pete did as he was told and was greeted to Mr. Pound, happy as ever, sitting like the most relaxed person in the world. It almost looked like Pete had woken up his principal with his knock, but Mr. Pound didn't seem to mind. He was happy no matter the day, always smiling. Many students found it creepy, but Pete never cared too much, except for now. <i>It is pretty creepy. Stop smiling, weirdo.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, you wanted to see me?\" Pete asked the cheerful old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I sure did! Come on Peter, take a seat,\" Mr. Pound beckoned Pete to one of the chairs in front of his desk. Pete obliged, but looked at cushion before sitting. Once Mr. Pound put a whoopee cushion under his seat after calling him into his office. Mr. Pound thought it was the funniest thing ever and laughed about it for three days in a row. Pete was satisfied that his seat was whoopee-less and sat. \"You know what I like about you, Peter?\" Mr. Pound paused for Pete to ask why, but he didn't pick it up, \"You have so much potential. You are clever, concerned, and respectful. Have you decided on what you want to do after graduation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, not really,\" Pete looked at the clock in the office. It was getting pretty late. \"Is this the situation you needed me for? This couldn't have waited until Monday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think you would make an amazing teacher!\" Mr. Pound claimed, ignoring Pete's questions, \"Think about it, Peter. Whenever you and I talk, I sometimes forget I'm speaking with a teenager. You're so mature. And your grades aren't too shabby either. I've seen you around school, looking after the little guys. The underdogs! You don't look down on the runts or outcasts but rather you treat them just like everybody else. With qualities like yours, I don't really see you being anything but a teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, Thanks,\" Pete had no idea where this was coming from, but wanted to leave, \"I really need to get home, my mom's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa whoa, wait a minute Peter!\" Mr. Pound interrupted Pete, \"I'm not done over here. Do you know Ms. Millie?\" Pete vaguely remembers seeing a very tall women walking through the halls. Some of the meaner kids would whisper Millipede behind her back. \"Good,\" Mr . Pound continued, \"Well, she has gone away,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh,\" Pete wasn't really that upset, but feigned concern to be polite. \"What happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, nothing,\" Mr. Pound waved his hand in the air like he was trying to swat a fly, \"Nothing you need to worry about anyways. The real trouble here is that I have an empty space in my staff that needs to be filled immediately. And that's where you come in, Peter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pardon?\" Pete wasn't entirely sure he heard the man correctly, \"What am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well it's not about what you're supposed to do,\" Mr. Pound sat upright and began searching for something in his desk. \"It's what you're going to do, Peter.\" Mr. Pound had pulled out what looked like an old notary hand stamp. It had some bright purple letters lined vertically on the handle. Pete tilted his head and read the mysterious words \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Those Who Can't Do</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's that, Mr. Pound?\" Pete nervously backed into his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well this, Peter, keeps this school running,\" Mr. Pound kept his creepy smile on, \"Now, some Principals like to read resume after resume, looking diligently for the best candidate to teach their students. But all of those resumes are complete stranger! I wasn't anywhere near comfortable letting random people near my students. That's when I thought, what if I could find a way to get to know someone over a long period time, then hire them? How bout my luck when I find this little stamp! If I use this stamp on someone, it will turn them into a perfect role model, parental figure, and educator. The results can be pretty random but it has worked pretty well in the past. So what I\u2019ve done is interview freshman when they start, and slowly whittle down the options throughout those students high school careers. It\u2019s a lot of hard work, but worth it! I I've been turning seniors into teachers for 25 years now and have had the best teachers a principal could ever ask for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mr. Pound,\" Pete had stood up, wide eyed at the crazy man in front of him, \"I'm leaving now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, Peter,\" Mr. Pound's smile disappeared and was replaced with a sly grin, \"You're not going anywhere,\" Before Pete could react, Mr. Pound lunged forward with the stamp. He slammed the stamp directly into the middle of Pete's forehead. Recoiling in pain, Pete was forced back into the chair. Light began to fade away, as Pete fell unconscious. He tried to desperately to punch Mr. Pound or to runaway, but his body wasn't reacting at all. All he could do was slowly pass out, as he felt purple ink dripping from his forehead. The last thing he heard was his Principal's maniacal laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Another Success!\" Pete heard Mr. Pound snort what seemed like 50 yards away. Once Pete had gotten into a fight with a bully in fifth grade. The musclebound 11 year old had punched Pete as hard as he could in the head. Pete was completely knocked out and woke up with the very similar feeling that he was experiencing now. He slowly opened his eyes, only to see Mr. Pound standing over his body lying on the floor. Before Pete had gathered himself enough to run away or beat the hell out of his Principal, Mr. Pound proudly stated, \"Congratulations, Peter. You've turned into my favorite teacher so far. You are now....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Could be a new comic, a new figurine, or maybe another one of those gory Japanese movies Nigel loved. Either way it\u2019s probably much more interesting than whatever Pete was doing that night and sent a quick text back, \"Sure, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Too much to explain over the phone, come to The Power Within as fast as you can.\" Nigel texted back, and Pete didn't need to hear anymore. Nigel only acted like this when he gets the best loot. And being close friends with the owner of the only comic book store owner in town meant knowing about it first. Nigel was always giving Pete and Jack special deals on his many products. On one similar occasion, Pete had scored a tiny replica of a Songbird statue from Bioshock Infinite for just fifty bucks. Pete didn't want to miss any possible deals, as he began to rush towards the comic book store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Greetings friend!\" Nigel welcomed Pete as he walked in The Power Within. No matter how many times Pete had seen it before, he was always blown away at Nigel's selections. From obscure manga, to expensive superhero comics from the fifties, Nigel had it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait a minute,\" Pete took a quick glance around the store, \"Where's Jack? Did you forget to text him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pft,\" Nigel scoffed, \"That ingrate has lost his early notice privileges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nigel, is this about the translation thing?\" Pete remembered that around a week ago, Nigel had come to Jack asking him to translate some unsubbed anime. Jack had initially agreed, but later backed out when Nigel revealed that he wanted him to translate a full series. Nigel considered this to be an act of betrayal but Pete assumed he would eventually get over it. Nigel had a tendency to be melodramatic when disappointed by something but he always turned out reasonable towards the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's about a lot of things,\" Nigel shook his head, \"Never mind that now, for I brought you down here for more important things. This isn't just another one of my amazing deals, this is something spectacular. Something to make life really worth living. No more hiding in the shadows reading comics or playing video games anymore. Now it's our time, Pete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you talking about, Nigel?\" Pete raised an eyebrow at his nerdy friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm talking about this, Pete!\" Nigel pulled out a strange machine from under his counter. At least it looked kind of like a machine, Pete not knowing what else to call it. It looked like a child's rendition of a science fiction device. It was just a simple metal box, with one purple button and a small satellite dish on the center of the top. In the middle of the dish, was a dark purple diamond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dude, did you make that?\" Pete chuckled at the device. Pete had thought if Nigel was going to make something life changing, he would have at least put a little bit more effort into how it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course I didn't make this,\" Nigel ignored Pete's laughter, \"I don't have the know-how to create such an awesome contraption.

It came with a note that said I could use it best,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What this awesome contraption called?\" Pete asked, wondering if Nigel actually believed this thing could do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's called...\" Nigel closed his eyes and whispered, \"The Rad Ray,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The Rad Ray?\" Pete laughed, \"Nigel, quit fucking around. did you really call me down here to mess around with this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shut up!\" Nigel grew serious, tired out Pete not taking this seriously, \"I'm sick of everyone laughing at me!

When I press this button, the machine will scan my thoughts. The machine will then construct my wants and desires to create an ideal world.

Although, I cannot promise you'll be entirely the same when I activate the machine,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait,\" Pete squinted his eyes, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well in my perfect world, I'm probably not going to look like this,\" Nigel pointed at his chubby nerd body, \"I'll probably turn into a musclebound hero.

But upon closer inspection, it was a transparent glow emitting from the diamond itself. The glow began to rapidly expand, now covering the entire machine. Pete looked up at Nigel in fear only to see his smiling face. <i>This is real, everything's gonna change</i> Pete's thoughts went frantic as he tried to run away, but soon was enveloped by purple glow. The entire store was now shaded purple, like someone put an Instagram filter on the entire building. Pete looked out the window, looking for someone he might be able to signal for help, but all he say was the glow exponentially growing covering everything outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa,\" Pete put a hand to his hand to his forehead, he was beginning to feel nauseous. Not only was the entire glow scenario too much for him to handle, he now felt more dizzy than he had in his entire life. It only got worse, getting more and more dizzy as time went on. Pete tried his best to focus, but eventually all he could see was a blurry purple mess. But even that was gone, as Pete closed his eyes, passing out from intensity of the whole experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is awesome!\" Nigel triumphant yell woke Pete up.

Unlike some television or movie interpretations of bullies, Gene is not misunderstood. He doesn't have a hard home life, he doesn't struggle with grades. and he has tons of friends. Gene is just an asshole, always has been. His parents, who were the two richest people in Pete's town, never paid too much attention to Gene's attitude. They ignored what school teachers and counselors would say about their son, and paid off whoever they needed to whenever Gene did something wrong. Gene just got away with everything, and one of his favorite people to harass and beat up was Pete. Gene like gory movies, caviar, and pushing down the homeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Toffee: Pete's 38 year old new neighbor. Pete didn't know much about Ms. Toffee, and no one else really did either. It almost seemed like she came out of nowhere, and occupied a then empty house. The only time anyone ever saw Ms. Toffee was when she went out to get her mail. Pete heard all kinds of rumors about her, like she was hiding from the government or that she meth addict. Pete disregarded those rumors, just like he did whenever he heard the new juicy gossip spreading in his town. Ms. Toffee likes the smell of old books, eating pears, and star gazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacelessFred23: Pete's online friend. FacelessFred23 or \"Fred\" as Pete likes to shorten, has been Pete's online friend for 2 years. Meeting on a forum discussing the ethical treatment of the original Star Wars films, Pete and Fred hit it off. Pete found himself agreeing with whatever Fred had to say, and not just about Star Wars. Whether it be music, cartoons, or even video games, Fred and Pete were basically identical with their likes and dislikes. Jack, Pete's best friend, had warned Pete that Fred may not be all that he seems. Although Pete was very aware of the dangers of the internet, he just wrote Jack off for being jealous. Fred likes heavy metal, retro video games, and awful movies.</span></div></div>",

Pete was never thrilled when Gene's fname came up on his phone. This usually lead to another beating or public humiliation at his bully\u2019s hands. Initially, Gene left Pete alone, not particularly having anything against him. Who Gene really didn't like was Jack, Pete's best friend. Gene didn't have anything personal with Jack either, he was just a racist. One day, freshman year, Gene spray painted \"GO HOME JAP\" all over Jack's locker. Before Jack could even do anything about it, Pete leaped on Gene from behind and punched him repeatedly in the face. Pete then subsequently got suspended for month, while Gene not so mysteriously got off with a single detention. Ever since then, Gene has left Jack alone, but has tormented Pete whenever he got the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pete knew that the text was almost definitely a trap, but he also knew that if he didn't oblige Gene, something worse might happen. Letting out a deep sigh, Pete turned and headed towards the old Rockford Bridge. The bridge wasn't too far away, and without even 5 minutes of walking, it was already in view. The Rockford bridge was blocked off ever since a boy had fallen off and drowned there nine years ago. It had become local superstition that the boy's ghost roamed the bridge at night, searching for his parents. In reality, if anyone went ghosthunting, the only spooky thing they would find would be the odd hobo taking some shelter under the bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Petey!\" Gene yelled from under the bridge, using his unflattering nickname for Pete, \"Come down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm coming Gene,\" Pete grunted, as he stumbled down the hill leading to the small creek flowing under the bridge. As expected, Gene was leaning against the foundation of the bridge, with one hand holding a lit cigarette, while the other was held behind his back. <i>What's he hiding?</i> Pete tilted his head to see, <i>Nothing good, probably. Let's just get this over with.</i> \"What do you want Gene?\" Pete asked, trying not to sound too annoyed, \"I gotta be home soon, man,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do I want?\" Gene repeated the question, like he was pondering life's deepest mysteries, \"Why Petey, my boy, I just want us to be friends. Don't you want to be my friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not really,\" Pete said honestly, too tired to play Gene's games today, \"I'd rather be friends with literally anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ouch, Petey.\" Gene made fake sad face and took a puff from his cigarette, \"You hurt my feelings, Petey.

When people see the name Graham Bell, they know to respect it. They know we can make them lose their jobs if we want. They know we can buy their houses. They know we rig elections and they know we can buy police officers. So I never really understood why you can't figure it out.

He held the lamp steady with his left hand, and rubbed it with his right. His hands glided up and down the smooth metal, but nothing happened. Pete look back at Gene, who just said, \"Try doing it faster,\" Pete, with annoyed grunt, rubbed the lamp as vigorously as he could, but again, there was no reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you happy dickhead? You found a piece of junk under a bridge and made me rub it. Can I go home...\" Pete was cut off when the lamp released a large plume of pink gas. Before either of the teenagers could react, the pink cloud had completely surrounded Pete's body. Pete vision was almost completely blurred by the pink fumes, the only thing visible was a vague image of Gene, smiling with excitement. And as soon as the gas had finished coming out, it started to pull itself back in, bringing Pete along with it. Pete was helpless as the gas forced him into the opening of the bottle. He could feel his body shrink and stretch in order to be shoved in there. As he was being crammed inside, Pete closed his eyes and hoped this was all a terrible dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Pete opened his eyes, he found himself inside a large round room. Although there were no windows or light fixtures, the entire room was brightly lit. The walls were lined with pictures of what seemed like random locations, from the Great Pyramid Of Giza, to the Big Ben in London. Pete tried to stand up, but found it hard to balance himself. Pete looked to the floor and saw it was completely covered in decorative pillows. Pete, unable to find his footing, tripped and fell into the large pile of cushions. Pushing himself back up, Pete could hear a woman giggle at him coming from the center of the room. Pete's mouth went agape when he noticed a voluptuous women, wearing only what Pete could described as a half finished princess Jasmine costume, lounging in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ist1-3.filesor.com/pimpandhost.com/1/_/_/_/1/p/B/U/l/pBUl/48360_06b_m.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://ist1-3.filesor.com/pimpandhost.co...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't feel embarrassed, master,\" The woman said reassuringly, \"This room isn't really meant for standing,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god, you're a genie!,\" Pete said, having a small revelation, \"You're an actual genie! I can't believe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well believe it, master,\" She shrugged, clearly not as amazed as Pete was, \"My name is Nihad and I'm the genie of this lamp. I will grant you three wishes, follow any order you command, and be your personal consort. That's my job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woah woah, wait,\" Pete said, having trouble not staring at the woman's breasts, \"Grant my wishes? Aren't you supposed to be granting Gene's wishes? He's the one who found the lamp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course not, master,\" Nihad shook her head, \"The one who rubs the lamp is the master. It doesn\u2019t matter who found it. If you would like, you could ask what your friend would like, and then you can wish for him,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh,\" Pete grumbled, taking a brief break from staring at the busty woman, \"Gene is not my friend,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's not?\" Nihad looked confused, \"But he gave you the genie lamp as a present. A long time ago, this was considered as a royal gesture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This wasn't one of those,\" Pete brought his attention back to the partially clothed genie, \"He didn't even know if your lamp was genuine or not. In order to save himself from looking foolish, he forced me to rub it. The guy is an ass,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How rude!\" Nihad was deeply offended, \"I can tell from your tone that this young man has bothered you before. Listen master, I've been a genie for 1,200 years and in that time I've become an excellent judge of character. After meeting so many different people, I can immediately tell who is decent and who is corrupt. And you, master, are a good man. You don't deserve to be treated this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, that's nice of you to say,\" Pete tried his best to look Nihad in the face, \"But it's not like I can do anything about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think you can, master,\" Nihad deviously grinned, \"You have me now. I can help you bend this world into any shape you want. Any desire, any need, and any pain you may want, I can give you immediately. There are no rules and I won\u2019t judge you. And if you wanted to take justice into your own hands, I would be more than willing to oblige you, master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh,\" Nihad gave Pete the idea of a lifetime. This had been the first moment since Pete had met Gene that he had felt like he was in control. Anything Pete could imagine would come true, and it didn't matter how much money Gene's family had, Pete was more powerful than anyone now. Pete could makes himself a movie star, or become a king, literally anything could happen. Pete began to tremble at the possibilities, but tried to his best to relax. <i>The world's at my fingertips</i> Pete looked down at his hands and clenched them tightly, <i>Time for Gene to get what's coming to him</i></span></div></div>",

Most masters just want to get straight to wishing. You're very thoughtful,\" She smiled, \"Well, like I said, I've been a genie for 1,200 years. Before then I was just a simple village girl, who spent most of her days tending to goats and cleaning the house. Life was dull but simple, and then I stumbled across the lamp. When the genie presented herself to me, I thought she was my ticket to glory. I wished for  my own kingdom and I wished for thousands of devoted followers who would do anything to please me. It was more than I could ever wanted, it was amazing!,\" Nahid paused for moment, and her smile disappeared, \"But you see, master, most genies aren't very trustworthy. My genie, through her charm and false good nature, had convinced me to use my last wish to free her. She had chosen not to tell me, however, that there must always be a genie in the bottle. When I had made my wish, I had become the genie and she took my place in the kingdom. This is how I became the genie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god, Nihad,\" Pete said, blown away away by the genie's story, \"That's terrible. I'm so sorry that happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, master, you didn't do anything. There's no need to apologize.\" Nihad waved Pete off, \"But it's nice to hear. I haven't been apologized to in more than a millennium. If I may ask, master, Why did you ask in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I was just wondering,\" Pete rubbed his chin in thought, \"Don't you think it's unfair for a good person like yourself to be trapped in this bottle for so long? Don't you think this kind of treatment is more deserving of someone evil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess so, master,\" Niahd looked confused, \"Not that my opinion really matters,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think your opinion does matter, Nihad,\" Pete said, \"Now I have an idea that can fix both of our problems. A way where I can get rid of Gene and you can out of this bottle. You follow me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, my master is not just thoughtful, but wise as well,\" Nihad smiled once more, \"You wish for Gene to take my place and I take his?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Exactly,\" Pete said happily, glad they were on the same page, \"Hopefully you can manage that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I will gladly,\" Nihad pinched her earlobes, making her large breasts more pronounced, \"Thank you master,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgbox.com/unUA3bpB.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgbox.com/unUA3bpB.jpg</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that, Niahd closed her eyes and concentrated. At the same time, a miasma of pink gas began to flood the lamp room.  Just as before, Pete's vision was almost immediately blurred again by the pink cloud. Although this time, he wasn't being pulled anywhere. He wasn't feeling anything at all, actually. It was just like being in a room that was filling with pink smoke. Eventually, the gas retreated to wherever it came from, and the same image of Nihad pinching her ears came back into view. When she opened her eyes, Pete noticed something was off. She looked confused and scared, searching what seemed to be a unfamiliar room to her. She became even more flustered when she looked down at her body. Yelling and frantically groping her body to make sure it was real. Pete could deduce that Gene was now in Nihad's body. When he started laughing audibly at his predicament, Gene finally made his attention towards Pete. A furious look now on his face, Gene tried to his best to sound intimidating in his new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgbox.com/y5MzZp1v.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgbox.com/y5MzZp1v.jpg</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'You..,\" Gene was so angry and confused, it was hard for him to find the right words, \"What the hell did you do to me!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He didn't do anything,\" A voice from behind Peter said. Out from behind Pete walked forward Gene, or rather, Niahd inhabiting Gene's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha-what?\" Gene had completely lost it at the sight of his own body talking to him, \"Who are you? What the fuck did you do to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well my name is Nihad, and I'm the former genie of this lamp,\" Nihad smiled one Gene's signature shit eating grins, \"And with a lovely suggestion from our mutual friend Pete over here, I have decided that you are the perfect person to take my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can't do this to me!\" Gene yelled, \"Do you have any idea who I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, actually I do, Gene,\" Nihad said, \"You're spoiled little punk, who picks of decent people like Pete and get away with it. Your wealth has made you ignorant of the common people's struggles and even without your riches, you would be too vain to recognize anyone else problems but your own. You are a disgusting little maggot and I hope you live in this bottle for the rest existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn Nihad,\" Pete chuckled, \"You have a lovely way with words,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you, Pete,\" Nihad humbly accepted Pete's compliment, \"Now let me give you a rundown of what I did to this monster for you, in returns for your kind deed. He will now follow any command you give him, and I mean any command. He will be unable to do anything to harm you, whether it be physical or mental. He may only refer to you as master, unless you order him otherwise. And, most importantly, none of the wishes he grants for you will have any unexpected or ironic consequences. No genie trickery will happen at all, you will will just get what you wished for. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds amazing,\" Pete looked back over to Gene, who was still struggling to process all of this, \"Speaking of wishes, how many of those bad boys do I get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, the usual standard is three wishes,\" Nihad explained, \"But in your case, you will have..</span></div></div>",

This is one of many changes that you are just going have to get used to. This is your reality now, you creep. No more pushing around minorities, no more getting away with crime, and no more bullying me. You are now my buxom, wish granting servant and you will do as I say. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, Master...\" Gene shuddered at the word, but kept going, \"Once I get out of this ridiculous body, I'm going to fucking kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But that's not going to happen, Gene,\" Pete reassured his former bully, \"This is one of those forever things. And I don't think your body is ridiculous at all. I'd say you look rather beautiful, Gene. And over time, I think you'll appreciate it. I know I certainly do, but I think I would appreciate it more if it wasn't wearing all of those pesky clothes. I wish you were completely naked,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Entering into a daze, Gene's new face went completely blank. Involuntarily, his arms raised and his fingers pinched his earlobes, much like Nihad had done before. Within the blink of an eye, Gene's skimpy harem outfit had completely disappeared, leaving his new form completely exposed. Coming out of the daze, Gene was startled at his new nude situation. Gene desperately looked at Pete, now beginning to truly understand how he had absolutely no control anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/alderion/5790781/1481109193/hare35.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/alder...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look on the bright side,\" Pete said, ogling the busty woman before him, \"At least you're hot. You could have been a lot of things for the rest of time, but at least you were turned into a total babe. How's that for a wish, Nihad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Meh,\" Nihad said, unimpressed, \"Honestly Pete, you could have have just told her to take off her clothes and she would have done so. You're first wish was so creative, I'm a little disappointed that your second one was just to see my old body naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Did you just say her!?!\" Gene directed his anger towards Nihad, \"I'm a man, goddammit!

In fact, I wish you're terrible father gets arrested. He will spend the rest of his life rotting in jail, where scum like him belongs.\" Pete saw the look of shock on Gene's face, as he involuntarily granted his wish. Finding this incredible satisfying, Pete kept going, \" And I wish that all of your family's money will be automatically put into my personal bank account. I wish all of your family's possessions, property, you name it, belong to me. And most importantly, I wish that when anyone who thinks of your family name will think of hot garbage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I....\" Gene stuttered in disbelief, as he granted all of Pete's wishes, \"I can't believe this is happening,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh but it is Gene,\" Pete deviously smiled at his former tormentor, \"By the way, I don't think Gene fit's you anymore.

Pete, did as he was told and looked over to a house on his right. Waiting in the house's doorway was Ms. Toffee, the local recluse, beckoning Pete. Pete was slightly surprised, seeing as Ms. Toffee never really talked to anyone. People across town came up with these wild rumors why Ms. Toffee never showed her face, some say she was a vampire and was avoiding sunlight, while others said she was deformed and avoided public ridicule. Pete could debunk both of those rumors, as he once saw Ms. Toffee take out her trash during the day. He could clearly see that nothing was wrong with her, at least physically. The only strange thing he noticed about her was the long awkward eye contact they had made while he walked passed her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cautiously, Pete made his way up Ms. Toffee's driveway and headed towards the front door. Ms. Toffee held the door open for him to enter, but Pete was going to ask some questions first. \"Did you just text me?\" Pete asked, to which Ms. Toffee nodded quickly, \"How did you get my number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, I got from your mother,\" Ms. Toffee quickly responded, her eyes darting back and forth, like she was scanning the neighborhood, \"I met her at the grocery store the other day. Nice women, very funny. I told her I've been having some trouble with manual labor around the house and she gave me your number. She said you would be happy to help out,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh,\" Pete's said, wondering why his mother would just presume that he would love to help a strange woman, \"Well it looks like she signed me up for it. Do you need any help right now, Ms. Toffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that's why I called you over here, Pete,\" She said, \"Now follow me. And please close the door behind you.\" Pete did as he was commanded and went into the strange woman's home. At first glance, it looked like Ms. Toffee had moved into the house that day. Unopened boxes and bags were laid all across the entrance and following hallway. <i>That's strange,</i> Pete thought the obvious, as he looked over the unopened luggage, <i>I thought Ms. Toffee moved in a month ago...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, hello?\" Ms. Toffee interrupted Pete's thoughts, \"I'm in the kitchen, Pete.\" Pete followed the sound of thervoice to find Ms. Toffee waiting patiently by her kitchen counter. \"Do you see that up that there?\" She pointed towards a cookie jar  placed precariously on a high shelf, \"Could you get that for me? It's just out of my reach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Pete, being considerably taller than Ms. Toffee, had no trouble getting the jar, \"Got it. How'd you even get it up there in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know what? I actually have no idea,\" Ms. Toffee said, putting the jar on the counter, then grabbing two glasses of lemonade, \"Did you want some lemonade, Pete? Made it myself.\" Pete happily accepted and took big sip of the refreshing drink. A odd smile appeared on Ms. Toffee's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i9.imgchili.net/46285/46285262_vio022sfp_294563006.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i9.imgchili.net/46285/46285262_vi...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know what you are, Pete?\" Ms. Toffee said rather enthusiastically, \"You are perfect,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Perfect?\" Pete chuckled, \"Ms. Toffee, all I did was get a jar for you.

I couldn't really make any friends and was usually the butt of everyone's jokes. My parents assured me that was just how high school was and afterwards it would be much easier for me. But it wasn't. I've lived in 20 towns now and I still haven't found my place. Do you have any idea what that's like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, I guess so. I don't really have that many friends either,\" Pete said apprehensively, starting to realize coming into Ms. Toffee's house was a mistake. Pete was going to bring up an excuse to leave, but suddenly felt very dizzy, \"Hey...\" Pete said drowsily, \"I'm not feeling so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I knew it!\" Ms. Toffee ignored Pete and continued to ramble on, \"I knew from the moment I saw you that you would understand. I could feel this connection, this universal bond connecting the two of us! That's why you're are going to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Help you with what...\" Pete quickly caught himself on the kitchen counter before he fell to the ground, the dizziness making it hard to stand, \"What are you gonna do, Ms. Toffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm going to blend in, Pete,\" Ms. Toffee said, as she put her on Pete's cheek, \"I figured, if you can't beat them, join them, right? In order for everyone to treat me normally, I need to act like them. And I have been, I really have. But it doesn't seem to be enough. I need something more, something that will make me look like another regular middle class citizen. That's why I need you Pete. I need you to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But If I become you, I won't be a stranger anymore.\" Ms. Toffee explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete struggled to hold himself up on the kitchen counter as his vision blurred. \"What did you do to me you crazy bitch?\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fight it. It will all be over very soon.\" Ms. Toffee reassured Pete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete's arms gave out and he fell onto the kitchen floor. Everything was spinning and the last thing he remembered was seeing Ms. Toffee's face in double vision smiling over him before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete slowly woke up on the kitchen floor. Something felt wrong to him and he couldn't quite place what it was. He had no idea how long he had been out but he quickly remembered how he wound up on the floor Ms. Toffee's kitchen. Pete quickly sat up and experienced the biggest shock of his life! He was in Ms. Toffee's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and saw large breasts hanging off his chest that shouldn't be there. He used his hands to feel them. They felt soft, yet firm at the same time. It felt strange and alien to Pete to have breasts hanging off his chest. He noticed how different his hands now were too. They were smaller, slender and feminine looking but also looked older than his hands normally were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're awake\" Pete heard a familiar voice from behind him. He stood up on his new legs, he felt all sorts of parts of his new body jiggle that he wasn't used to. Pete had a bad feeling that he knew who it was, so he turned around to confront them. When he saw \"himself\" standing there with a smug look on his face, Pete felt his heart skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete's doppelganger seemed quite pleased with himself as he used one hand to feel up his chest while his other hand was inside his jeans groping his penis. \"It's been a while since I had one of these between my legs.\" the doppelganger told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me back my body Ms. Toffee!\" Pete demanded in his new mature feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis doppelganger chuckled. \"I'm not Ms. Toffee...\" He said as he pulled his penis out so Pete could see it. \"I can't be a Ms. anything if I have one of these.\" he said proudly. His penis hardened as he began stoking it. \"This is a nice one... definitely one of the top 3 penises I've ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Pete asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your neighbor, Pete Connors.\" he laughed as he continued to jerk himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be. I'm Pete Connors!\" Pete angrily yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doppelganger pumped his penis until he ejaculated and sprayed semen onto the counter and nearby cabinets next to where Pete was. The expression on his face looked as if he was pleased with himself before saying \"I've missed being able to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete glanced over towards the sticky jizz that was dripping off the edge of the counter onto the floor then back at his impostor. \"Who are you!?!\" he asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you. I'm Pete Connors. I used to be Melinda Toffee before I took your life.\" he calmly explained as he stuffed his flaccid penis back into his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why did you steal my life?\" Pete asked as he still wasn't used to hearing a woman's voice come out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apparent Pete zipped up his fly and buttoned up the front of his jeans. He paused for a moment like he was trying to think of what to say before explaining \"I needed to fit in here and I couldn't do it as Melinda Toffee. I always become a local whenever I move to a new town. It makes it easier to blend in and enjoy myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never get away with this! My family and friends will know you're not me!\" Pete threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis doppelganger laughed. \"Please... I've heard that line countless times. I'm the new and 'improved' Pete Connors and nobody will be the wiser!\" he explained as he pointed at himself with his thumb. \"Let me give you some free advice. The sooner you accept that you are now Melinda Toffee, the easier it will be for you. It's not a bad life. Trust me, I spent almost 10 years in it. You're a former trophy wife that got screwed out of your husband's will when he expired. Heck, I would have stayed in it a bit longer if I got more than a few crumbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete began to cry as the realization of what happened hit him. He covered his eyes with his new feminine hands as he wept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there. There is nothing to cry about Ms. Toffee. You're in great shape for a woman your age and you still have a lot going for you unlike the original Ms. Toffee. I left her as a poor black woman that had 3 children from men I didn't even remember sleeping with.\" His doppelganger said in an effort to console him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new \"Pete\" briefly watched the new \"Ms. Toffee\" cry and realized that this was probably his cue to leave. He couldn't wait to live the life of a young man. It had been years since he had a life where he lived under a mother and a sister. Jane seemed like she would be easy to deal with but he didn't know much about his new sister. Without a care in the world, the new \"Pete\" walked out the front door and his previous life behind as he wondered if he now had a girlfriend. If he didn't, he would have one soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fred almost exclusively used an anonymous message board to talk with Pete. Pete thought it was pretty strange, but Fred insisted that was the way they only way he could talk to him. He only had Pete's phone number in case of emergencies. Although these emergencies were usually nothing more than Fred getting bored and wanting someone to talk to. Pete was planning on messaging him when he got home anyways, so he paid no mind to the text and walked home leisurely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah...\" Pete let out of sigh of relief, as he slumped into the comfortable of his desk chair. After a long day of school, Pete found solace in his computer and the wonderful world of the internet. These moments of zen usually included Pete blasting heavy metal through his headphones, watching Netflix for hours on end, or the occasional gaming session. Before Pete instinctively clicked the play icon on his spottily playlist, he remembered Fred's urgent text. Opening a new tab, Pete went to their private message board and sent him message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Pete: Hey man, what's up?</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">FacelessFred23: Pete, what took you so long! I've been waiting for like an hour!</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">P: Hey, whoa there buster brown. Why are you so upset?</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">F: I thought we agreed that if I texted you, it meant it was an emergency. Emergency means right away, man.</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">P: Well shit, dude. I'm sorry. I'm here now, tell me your troubles.</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">F: I got more than troubles. I'm in some serious shit and I need your help</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pete paused his music and reread Fred's last message. Fred has never said anything like that before. Every conversation Pete had with Fred was calm and chill. He had never been this worked up before. <i>Maybe he's in actual trouble,</i> Pete thought what he should type back, <i>If he needs a friend right now, I got to step up and be there for him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">P: Fred, If you need help, I'll do everything I can. I got your back, dude.</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">F: I knew I could count on you. But before I tell you what's going down, I need to be upfront with you. I'm not really who I say I am.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This wasn't really that big of a bombshell to drop on Pete. He had suspected the entire time that Fred probably wasn't another 18 year old boy. Why else would he be so weird about keeping everything secret. But in all honesty, Pete didn't mind all that much. Pete didn't really care how old Fred was or what Fred looked like, he was his friend. They talked to each other for 2 entire years, and within that time have gotten pretty close. Even so, Pete had always paid attention to see if Fred ever made any weird, creepy comments, just in case this was some kind of \"Catfish\" like scenario. But so far that hasn't happened, so Fred was cool in Pete's book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">P: Yeah, I kind of figured. I mean it's a little obvious, Fred</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">F: And you don't mind?</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">P: Not really. I think I know the real you by now, personality wise anyways.

Please Stand By Until The Update Is Complete,\" read the message that had popped up on Pete's phone. Pete, who had been expecting a text, looked disappointingly at the small screen. He hated these updates, they always took forever and until they were complete, Pete had no way to use his phone. Not that Pete used his phone that often, usually only for texting three different people, but he didn't appreciate that being taken away from him. Just as he was about to see if he could avoid the update in any way, Pete absentmindedly collided with someone else walking on the sidewalk. The stranger and Pete clumsily collapsed onto the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh man,\" Pete said, as he rubbed his bruised elbow, and offered his hand to the stranger, \"I am so sorry! That was definitely my fault. I should've been paying attention,\" The stranger took Pete's hand and pulled themselves back up. Now in full view, Pete became incredibly embarrassed to realized he had knocked over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLayla Doomspring: Pete's 22 year old former crush. When Pete first entered high school, Layla caught his eye almost immediately. She was the busty, goth /alternative girl of his dreams. But there was something else about her that he couldn't just put his finger on, something special. Every other guy in the school must have felt the same way, because Pete always saw her surrounded by hopeful suitors. Pete never mustered up the courage to actually approach her, not that would have mattered anyways, since she dropped out in only two months. Her father and mother were on a yacht party sponsored by the company they worked for and it sank due to poor maintenance. Layla received millions of dollars due to a resulting lawsuit for the loss of her parents. The question of whether she had dropped out due to the grief over her parents deaths or simply because she was set for life would most likely be left unanswered. Layla hasn't spoken to anyone since the incident and has spent all of her time isolated inside her house. Layla hates happy music, romantic comedies, and fruit flavored candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe Eve: A 30 year old pregnant artist. Pete knew Chloe through the art supplies store she owned, \"The Magic Brush\". He had been seeing her for art lessons for the last month. Pete appreciated her patience with him, as he struggled to grasp even the basic concepts of art. While he struggled, Pete had created a small friendship with Chloe. Chloe would even extend some of Pete's lessons for free, just so they could continue talking. Pete liked Chloe, feeling incredible comfortable with Chloe, even if they were completely different people. Pete did have to make sure he didn't bring up her pregnancy though, since the father of the child had recently walked out on her. The subject usually almost brought Chloe to tears, and it broke Pete's heart to see that. Chloe likes storytelling, puppies, and cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrese Duke: The 48 year old mayor of Pete's town. Pete only really knew Tyrese through his campaign speeches whenever there was an election. His slogan was \"A community is no miracle and it won't take a miracle to fix one,\" Tyrese won by a landslide, most voters in the town were won over by his charm and honesty. During his first run as mayor local employments rates went up, schools got new books and equipment, and pollution had hit an all time low. He had done such a phenomenal job, that he was re elected two more times. Tyrese likes old comedians, jellybeans, and jogging.</span></div></div>",

The man in question being one of the most important people in town. Tyrese was the mayor, and the best mayor the community had ever seen. He singlehandedly saved the town from countless emergencies. The townsfolk not only respected Tyrese, they adored him. He was like a shining savior, here to fix everyone's problems, and Pete just knocked him down. \"Holy crap, I am so sorry Mr. Duke,\" Pete profusely apologized, \"I didn't mean to do that, sir.

Not usually a big deal, but I find myself a little lost without her today. I tried to get myself coffee, but I ended up 20 minutes in the wrong direction! Just goes to show that even I need help every once in awhile. With that in mind, I was wondering, if a young and capable man like yourself, would be willing to help me out with some stuff in the office. How about it, Pete?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, I don't know.\" Pete sheepishly said, \"I don't know anything about office work, Mr. Duke\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can call me Tyrese, Pete\" He said, with his signature grin, \"And it wouldn't be any computer work or anything like that. I would just need you to move around some stuff while I make some calls. Sound easy enough? You would really be helping me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I...\" Pete started to come up with another excuse, but decided to do what he thought was the morally correct thing to do, \"I would be happy to help, Tyrese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fantastic!\", Tyrese, clapped his hands together, \"Now follow me back to the town hall. We've got business to do, Pete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0About thirty minutes later, Pete had just finished unloading 20 crates full of folders. Tyrese wanted him to organize them all by color, which was pretty simple since there were only three different kinds colors. Pete smiled with satisfaction as he saw all the folders  neatly put together. Pete headed back towards Tyrese's office to tell him the work was all done, but once he was in earshot, he could hear Tyrese having a loud conversation with someone on the phone. Reminding  himself that the whole purpose of being here was so that Tyrese could make some phonecalls, Pete waited patiently on the other side of the door until the phone call was over. While he was waiting, Pete couldn't help but overhear the conversation Tyrese was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...I know that, I'm just started to think you don't!\" Tyrese angrily said, \"Of course we need money! But not for another election, you ridiculous buffoon! This town needs it! If you and I don't do something immediately, everyone could lose their homes!\" There was a short pause, \"Of course you don't understand, Henderson! All you think about is what new car to buy! Someone's gotta give a fuck about these people and it sure as hell ain't gonna be you!\" Tyrese slammed his phone down and loudly slouched in his office chair. Peter was certain he wasn't supposed to hear any of that. <i>Everyone could lose their homes?</i> Pete recalled what he overhead, <i>What could he mean by that? How could that even happen?</i> Pete, deciding that he must find out more, knocked on the door, \"Oh, Pete,\" A somewhat surprised Tyrese responded, \"Come on in,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\" Pete said sheepishly, as he slowly entered the office, \"I finished up organizing the folders for you, Tyrese\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, that was faster than I thought,\" Tyrese said, as he opened one of desk drawers and pulled out a cigar. Just as he was about to light it, he looked back up to Pete and asked, \"You don't mind, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go right ahead,\" Pete shrugged as the mayor lit his cigar and took an eager puff. Pete figured that now was a good of time as any to bring up the phone call he heard. \"Um, Tyrese,\" Pete tried to sound as nonchalant as possible, \"Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It sure is, Pete,\" Tyrese smiled at his cigar, but turned melancholy, \"Actually, no. It's not alright, Pete. Just a lot of bureaucratic nonsense that stops me from doing what's best for this town. Nothing for you to worry about, though,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, maybe I could help,\" Pete suggested, worried about the state of his town, \"Even if it's something small, I wouldn't mind lending a hand out for my town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your town?\" Tyrese acted offended, but then laughed, \"You're alright, Pete. Some people in this godforsaken office forget what makes communities great. It has nothing to do with taxes, laws, or how big your office is. It's about the people. Good people, like yourself, are what makes small towns like these amazing. It's that heart and decency that's so hard to find. That's why I love this place, Pete. I would never let anything bad happen to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, geez,\" Pete rubbed the back of his head, \"I don't think anyone has ever said something so nice to me before,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I might have gone a little overboard,\" Tyrese laughed again, and opened a different desk drawer. Tyrese then pulled out a green folder, \"You know,\" Tyrese put his hand on the folder, \"There is something you could do, Pete,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, great!\" Pete happily said, \"Anything to do my part, Tyrese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's good to hear,\" Tyrese opened the folder and began to read, \"Now this job might seem strange, and that's why no one else will take it. But don't mind that, those people are just lousy pencil pushers. They don't really care if the town goes down the toilet. But you would basically be hero for doing it. Everything you would do would practically be saving the town. But first off, I need you sign here,\" Tyrese pushed forward a piece of paper with a line underneath paragraphs of with tiny words, \"This will let me know that you are fully willing to do whatever is necessary on you part. Is that a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not at all!\" Pete eagerly signed, not even glancing at the words on the paper, \"So what am I doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well Pete,\" Tyrese took back the paper,and grinned at Pete, \"I need you..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, what?\" Pete asked, thinking this was some kind of silly mayor joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I would like you to spend the night in an empty house,\" Tyrese simply said, \"Although it may sound odd, this would actually help the town immensely. You see, the house I would like you to stay in hasn't had an occupant in over 30 years. And it's not because we haven't been able to sell it either. The house is in perfect condition, it's all up to code and is even fully furnished. The real problem is that new owners of this particular building don't seem to last longer then a couple hours inside before they want to leave. These people can never really explain why, but the building gives them some sort of uneasiness, like something truly terrible will happen to them if they stay. This problem has happened so often that the building has become a bit of a local legend. Surely you've heard of what I'm talking about, Pete,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh yeah!\" Pete said, having just remembered, \"You must be talking about The Refinery. I remember hearing stories about that old place when I was in elementary school. The older kids would tell us these crazy stories about it, about how everyone went inside that haunted place would never be the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, those are the exact kind of rumors I would gladly be rid of, Pete,\" Tyrese grumbled, \"Honestly, the rumors of The Refinery being haunted had gotten so out of hand, that even all the neighboring houses became vacant, as all the people were just spooked to be near the place. Soon the entire street became vacant. But, if I had someone who would be willing to prove the house is harmless, not only would we be able to to sell it, but we could probably sell every house on that street. And more homeowners, mean more taxes, which means more money, and THAT means less problems. You follow me, Pete?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think so,\" Pete scratched his head, \"So you want me to sleep in a haunted house to save the town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Exactly!\" Tyrese clapped his hands together, \"Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess so,\" Pete shrugged, \"Just a little strange, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well sometimes the right thing to do isn't always the normal thing, \"Tyrese attempted to justify, \"Either way, the important thing is you said yes. Now are you free Saturday night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Basically,\" Pete was just planning on gaming all Saturday anyways, \"I mean, yeah I can do that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Great! Saturday is it then,\" Tyrese then vigorously shook Pete's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>24 Hours Later</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And here we are,\" Tyrese exclaimed as he drove up to curb. After Pete had told his mother he would be spending all night helping the mayor to save the town, Tyrese had picked him up and drove him directly towards The Refinery. Pete looked out the passenger window at the old building. Although Pete was sort of expecting a decrepit mansion, with maybe a graveyard in the backyard, he was instead greeted with just of a retro looking building. Probably like a house you might see on shows like The Brady Bunch. Instead of being relieved by the rather normal looking building, Pete was instead filled with unease at the sight of such a mundane home. He couldn't put his finger on it, but something was off with that house. Pete shrugged these thoughts off and tried to play off his nervousness off with a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So how many spooky ghosts should I expect in there?\" Pete asked Tyrese, wobbling his voice when he said spooky, \"I can handle four spooky ghosts, but five is too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well why don't you tell me,\" Tyrese responded, \"You're the one who heard all of the rumors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I heard, like, a hundred different rumors,\" Pete said, \"And none of them really lined up with each other,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well according to the actual people who lived here, they didn't see any ghosts,\" Tyrese said as he looked over all the nearby empty houses, \"The previous owners reported feeling like they were being influenced to do things. Things they normally wouldn't do. One of the owners commented that he felt as if his inhibitions were somehow removed from his conscious and he was willing to do things he's always wanted to. He felt like the house itself was urging him to do so. Pretty crazy, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\" Pete nervously said, as he looked back out to house, \"Pretty crazy,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, anyways,\" Tyrese said, \"As we have discussed, you just need to spend the night here. I spared no expense in making this as comfortable for you as possible. There's a TV inside, hooked up with cable and one of those Xbox things. There's a lot of movies you could watch, as well as some video games I picked up. And if you're feeling hungry, the fridge and pantry are fully stocked. You can pig out as much as you like. That all maybe sounds like overkill, but doing this is incredibly important for the town. And if you wanted to back out, now would be the time. Can I count on you for this, Pete?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I...\" Pete paused for a moment, but decided to keep his word, \"I can handle this no problem, Tyrese. It'll be a walk in the park,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's what I wanted to hear!\" Tyrese smiled and handed Pete a key, \"Now go on then. I'll pick you up at 10:30 am. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Pete said, as he stepped out of the mayor's car. Pete faced the notorious building and walked up towards the door. He suddenly felt very silly for feeling any kind of dread over this place. <i>What's there to be scared of?</i> Pete thought as grew more and more unimpressed, <i>Just a stupid old house that people talk about because they have nothing else to say,</i> Once Pete made it to the front door, he noticed a small bronze plaque with words engraved into it. The plaque read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">The Refinery<br>\r\nReject Pride And Shame, Accept Who You Are</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's weird,\" Pete said, looking back to see if Tyrese had any explanation, only to see that his car had already left. <i>Probably just some silly thing someone in sixties put up,</i> Pete shrugged, as he put the put into the lock, <i>Probably thought they were really deep or something. Silly hippies and their plaques.</i> Opening the front door, Pete was again surprised by the infamous house. Expecting an old school interior, to match the exterior, he found himself in a very modern looking home. It didn't look too different from Pete's own home, actually. Pete made the logical leap that the realtors must have refurbished the house, in hopes to sell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well it's gonna take more than that to sell a haunted house,\" Pete said, as he kicked off his shoes, \"Actually, it only takes me, apparently. Now what the hell am I gonna do all night?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Pete said, \"Might as well set up my bed,\" Pete, deciding that was the most practical way to start the night, made his way up the stairs towards the bedrooms. Once reaching the upper floor, Pete saw a hallway with 6 adjacent doors. Trying the first door to his right, Pete turned the knob. It wouldn't budge though, the door was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's strange,\" Pete shrugged, as he tried the door to his left, which was also locked, \"What the hell? How are they going to sell a house if people can't go into the rooms?\" Pete found the next two doors to also be locked. Growing frustrated, Pete found the last door on the right was unlocked. Opening with ease, it revealed to be a quaint little bathroom, with an old fashioned tub, porcelain toilet, and a similar porcelain sink. There were even shampoo and conditioner bottles by the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Was Tyrese planning on me showering here?\" Pete was puzzled by the hair products, \"Whatever, it's probably nothing,\" Pete decided that the bathroom wouldn't be the most comfortable place to spend the night and turned his attention back the remaining door he hadn't tried yet. Turning the knob, easily opening like the bathroom door, Pete entered what appeared to be a master bedroom. Light from the sunset, flowing through the large window on the opposite wal,l was cascading over the king sized bed's comforter, giving the room a kind of heavenly glow. With classy pictures of female models scattered across the walls and a full length standing mirror near the bed, Pete could deduce this room was most likely intended for a woman, but it didn't seem like he had many other choices. It was either sleep in the extravagant woman's bedroom or sleep on a couch somewhere downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think I'll pick the bed,\" Pete decided, as he noticed something blue poking out from underneath the bed, \"What's that?\" Getting on his knees, Pete fished out whatever was under the bed. Pulling it out, Pete found what looked like a woman's tank top. The top was white, with a blue flower pattern all over it. Holding it up, something fell from inside it. Pete looked down to see that whatever dropped had the same flower pattern. Putting down the top, he picked the dropped item. Stretching it out, Pete realized he was holding a matching pair of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell?\" Pete said as he dropped the panties he was holding, \"Why is there a pair of woman's underwear under the bed?\" Pete scratched his head and tried to make sense of the situation. \"Probably...\" Pete said, convincing himself, \"Probably left by a previous owner. Yeah, she probably left in such a hurry that she forgot these. That\u2019s it.\" Satisfied with the story he had created, Pete brushed the underwear off to a corner of the room with his feet. With that out of the way, Pete decided to see how comfortable his temporary bed was. With a leap, Pete belly flopped onto the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh wow!\" Pete exclaimed as he cozied up within the blankets, \"This is the most comfortable bed I've ever been on! I feel like I'm lying down on a cloud on top of another cloud. I feel like I'm being hugged by a hundred teddy bears! I feel like...\" Pete dozed off, overwhelmed by the incredibly comfortable bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh,\" Pete mumbled, as he stirred from his sleep. Sitting up from the bed, Pete looked out the window to see a starlit sky. Confused, Pete checked his phone for the time. \"Midnight? Aw, man I slept through the whole afternoon, \" Pete rubbed his head and chuckled, \"I probably slept through all the spooky stuff that happens to everyone else who comes in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I might as well go back to bed\" Pete kept talking to himself, as he stood up from the bed, \"But first, to the bathroom,\" Pete made his way over the the bathroom he opened before falling asleep. After making his way to the porcelain throne and lifting the seat, Pete drained the lizard. After the deed was done, Pete gave his little guy a few shakes and  turned his attention towards the sink. Always one to use proper hygiene, Pete turned a handle to wash his hands. The sink had other plans, however, as the faucet head violently shook and bursted off. Pete was too surprised to react quick enough, and was quickly drenched from water gushing out of the broken sink<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The shit is this!?!\" Pete angrily asked the sink, which was was currently soaking him. Trying his best to regain some composure, Pete fought the pressure of the water coming out. Forcing his hand through the steady stream was difficult, but he eventually reached the handle and turned it off. The bursting water quickly turned into a small dribble before stopping completely. The triumphant of defeating the sink as short lived, when Pete noticed how soaked his clothes were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shit!\" Pete simply said, uncomfortably shifting in his wet clothes, \"I can't go to sleep like this. And I didn't pack any extra clothes! This is the worst!\" Pete sat down on the ledge of the bathtub and tried to relax. There had to be an easy solution to this and he was sure if he just calmed down he would find it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" Pete sighed, \"I could....</span></div></div>",

He slowly waddled back to the bedroom, uncomfortably moving in his soaked jeans. Pete quickly searched the room and  spotted the clothes he found under the bed, crumpled up in one of the corners of the room. Awkwardly shuffling to them, he bent over and picked them up. Pete grimaced at the thought of wearing these clothes, completely dismayed by the situation he was in. He tossed the tank top and pair of panties on the bed, deciding on focusing on getting undressed first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pulling off his wet t-shirt, Pete's bare torso met the cool breeze of the house. Shivering, Pete hurriedly kicked off his pair of jeans and pulling off his socks. Shimming out of his boxer briefs, Pete was now completely nude. Picking up his clothes, Pete took them back to the bathroom. He strung them across the shower rack, hoping they would dry by morning. Satisfied, Pete made his way back to the bedroom, and stopped dead in his track. His eyes darted toward the uncurtained window in the bedroom, fully exposing his naked body for anyone peeking in. Pete quickly jumped back into the hallway, out of sight from the window's view into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Face red, Pete cursed himself for not remembering to close the curtain before getting undressed. Pete, knowing the likelihood of anyone seeing him being slim to none, tried to relax. <i>Yeah, what am I worrying about?</i> He thought as he drew in a deep breath. <i>No one even lives near here. This is the edge of town and this house made everyone move away. Probably not another soul for at least a mile near me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pete just realized something: This is the first time in his life he was truly isolated. Not only would anyone be seeing him naked on accident, but no one would see him, period. No one would barge in on him, no one would pass him by, and now one would hear him. <i>Most of all,</i> Pete looked back at the clothes on the bed, <i>No one would judge me,</i> No longer having any hang ups on the subject, Pete went back to the bed and picked up the tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" Pete thought it over one more time, \"Well, I need to wear something. Just can't go sleeping nude in a bed that's not mine. Besides, it's just clothes. No big deal,\" And with that, Pete stuck his head into the tank top and pulled it on. Sticking his arms through the straps, he had completed the first half of his new ensemble. Although the shirt was expectantly tight on his chest, he couldn't remember wearing a softer piece of clothing in his entire life The material felt smoother and comfier than every shirt he had ever worn. Pete looked back at the panties on the bed, which was clearly made of the same fabric as the tank top. <i>For some reason,</i> Pete thought as he rubbed the top with hand, <i>I have a feeling that's not going to be as comfortable as this,</i> Despite these thoughts, Pete picked up the pair of panties and placed both of his feet in their respective holes. He slid the panties up and let them snap onto his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh,\" Pete mutter, somewhat surprised how he felt. Much like the tank, the panties were definitely snug, especially in the crotch department, but they were also just as soft. Similar to what was before it, they were by far the most comfortable piece of underwear he had ever worn. And it wasn't just the comfortable fabric either, something about the panties just struck something with Pete. He was struggling to find words for it, but it felt right. Like this was supposed to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This better not awaken something in me,\" Pete mumbled out of uncertainty, as he looked down at how ridiculous he looked, \"Welp, enough weird stuff, time for bed.\" Pete shut out any implications of wearing women's underwear meant about himself and focused on sleep. He would have much more time tomorrow to contemplate his lifestyle. Snuggling himself under the covers, Pete almost immediately fell asleep. His new clothes seemly doing the trick, making him more cozy than he had ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pete was walking along a rocky beach. It felt like had been walking down the shoreline for hours now. He was originally searching for something on the beach, but he had looked for so long now, that he had forgotten what he was looking for.<i>What am I doing out here?</i> Pete asked himself as he soldiered on, <i>What am I looking for? There's nothing out here! I'm wasting my time,</i> Just as he was about the give up, a beautiful blonde woman came from behind one the rocks near Pete. she climbed on top of it and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img257.imagevenue.com/aAfkjfp01fo1i-2330/loc428/397012282_gf_hayley_18_08_122_428lo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img257.imagevenue.com/aAfkjfp01fo...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You found me!\" She smiled at Pete. He was speechless, not knowing how to respond. He felt like he had known this woman his whole life, but he was certain this was the first time he had ever seen her before. Being near her felt relaxing, like walking back into your home after a long trip. Looking at her face, every stress and annoyance left Pete\u2019s mind and he was at peace. He reached out to the mysterious woman, but before get in touch with her, a huge wave crashed into the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whatsit?\" Pete groggily mumbled as he woke up. He tried closing his eyes and going back to the vivid dream he was having, but it didn't work. Frustrated, Pete gave up and opened his eyes to the bedroom he was now occupying,  but something was obscuring his view. Pete rubbed his eyes, but ended up brushing his hair out of the way. <i>Wait a minute</i> Pete slowly put the pieces together, <i>I don't have long hair,</i> Pete touched his head to reaffirm his assumptions, and bolted upright on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img129.imagevenue.com/aAfkjfp01fo1i-8836/loc821/395954901__DSC4832_122_821lo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img129.imagevenue.com/aAfkjfp01fo...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell!?!\" Pete exclaimed, as he glanced over to the mirror near the bed to see his new appearance, \"Oh my god, I'm a...I look like...like a girl!\" Pete couldn't believe his eyes, because everything he was seeing was impossible. There was no way a person can turn into a different person over night. It just doesn't make sense. Pete couldn't take his eyes of the mirrors though, moving his hands and face, making sure they matched up. There was no getting around it though, Pete was now this strange woman. Pete, although very scared and confused, understood that staring into the mirror wasn\u2019t going to do anything. He took a deep breath, trying not to hyperventilate over his new reflection. If he was going to figure this out, he needed a clear head. After trying his best to relax, Pete decided to...</span></div></div>",

Pete looked up from his phone and scanned the horizon for whoever beckoned him. Pete could make out a figure in the distance, but the sunlight was directly behind them. Pete looked both ways down the street(safety first, folks), and made his way across the road. Now practically right next to them, Pete could clearly see the person who called him over was none other than:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wyatt Connors: Pete's 20 year old cousin. Wyatt was a scrawny, red headed geek. Clearly the black sheep of the family, Wyatt spent most of the Connors family gatherings in the corner, keeping to himself.  It wasn't until recently that Pete had made an effort to go out of his way and talk to Wyatt, trying his very best to have him socialize a little bit. And although they got along just fine, Wyatt was still very shy and these communications were kept at a minimum. Despite his social anxiety, Wyatt was probably doing better than any other person in Pete's family, money wise anyways. Wyatt had just designed a very addictive app, one that matches the likes of Clash Of Clans, or any other of those pay to play games. What he was doing with all that money was something everyone in the Connors family was curious about. Wyatt loves banana pudding, Firefly, and playing the saxophone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gary Wallace: Pete's 18 year old friend. Pete would say that right after Jack, Gary would be his closest friend. Not exactly saying much, considering Pete's limited friends list, but they were still relatively close. Pete would spend more time with Gary if they weren't in such completely different friend circles. Where Pete was more of a nerdy loner, Gary was a popular athletic guy. Captain of the swim team, honor roll student, and even Class President, Gary found himself in the company of much different people than Pete did. Despite the difference in social standing, Gary still preferred to spend time with Pete, who treated him like just a regular guy. Something Gary deeply appreciated. Gary likes the ocean, marine biology, and surfing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andy Wainright: local police officer. Pete didn't know much about this man, but he was somewhat grateful to him. Once, Pete and Jack were drinking beer in a parking lot and officer Wainwright stumbled across them. While Pete tried his best to cover the empty bottles lying around inside his car, Jack had drank at least four more beers and was far more noticeably drunk than Pete was. Wainwright just chuckled at the two inebriated teenagers and told them to stay off the roads. Peter just assumed he was a cool cop, but over time he couldn't help  but feel like the officer had implied that he owed him. Andy hates loud music, sweet food, and facial piercings.</span></div></div>",

But most of that stuff is out of the way, so I was hoping I can get a little Pete time in my life. That's why I'm out here in the first place, I was hoping I'd run into you on your walk home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Geez, you must be desperate,\" Pete laughed, \"What, those cool guys on the student council aren't enough for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"God, don't get me started with guys,\" Gary sighed, \"All they care about is appearances and shit. Come on, man, I spend all my times with boring people, please hang out with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gary, chill,\" Pete put his hand on Gary's shoulder, \"You know I'm down for whatever. We can hang any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well it's cool you said that, because I have proposition for you,\" Gary explained, intriguing Pete, \"So do you remember that essay contest a month ago?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh yeah,\" Pete remembered, \"It was like some national thing. I wasn't really interested in it, though. But I bet you were. So what, did you win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I sure did,\" Gary proudly announced to the unimpressed Pete, \"Wasn't that hard. Just wrote the usual sad story about a family member dying. People love that stuff. Anyways, a month happens and I get a letter in the mail. In it was the usual congratulatory stuff, but tucked inside the envelope was also the prize for winning the contest. The contest was very vague, and they never fully disclosed what the prize was, so you can imagine how surprised I was when I got a free trip across the world,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woah,\" Pete said, \"Not too shabby. Did you come to brag about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, Pete,\" Gary shook his head, \"It came with with two tickets, saying that I'm more than welcome to bring a friend. And it's either you, or the guy who spends his days kissing the principals ass. You wanna come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, Hell yeah! Nothing wrong with free vacation!\" Pete happily exclaimed, \"Where we going to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's a surprise,\" Gary chuckled, as he walked away, \"Meet me at the airport tomorrow at noon and will be off,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>...</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow,\" Pete exclaimed as he watched the clouds pass by his passenger window, \"It's so beautiful out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh, what?\" Gary was dozing off before his friend woke him up, \"What's beautiful? The clouds?\" Gary leaned towards the plane's window, \"I guess so. Kind of get used to it after as many planes I've been on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot I was flying with the famous Gary Wallace,\" Pete said sarcastically, \"Of course such drab and boring things as clouds could entertain a man of such stature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, shut it,\" Gary chuckled, \"Don't forget who brought you on this trip in the first place. If it wasn't for me, you'd be stuck back in town, playing video games, like you always do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Probably true,\" Pete smiled at his good luck, \"I do appreciate this, Gary. Thanks, man,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't mention it,\" Gary said, snacking on some complimentary peanuts, \"This is gonna be our time, dude. No school, no sports, no parents, just you, me, and any babes who cross our paths!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, babes,\" Pete rolled his eyes. Pete never quite having the same luck with women as Gary did. Well actually luck had nothing to do with, Gary just had much more confidence in himself and had no problem approaching any member of the opposite sex. Being one of the smartest and most athletic kids in school didn't hurt either. Pete, on the other hand, tend to keep to himself and was shy around girls. Having barely ever kissed a girl, he could barely compare to Gary seemly endless list of girlfriends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I'm serious,\" Gary insisted, \"It's babe time. Been way too long for you not have any action. Now is the time, my friend. And it's the perfect time to do so,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What makes you say that?\" Pete asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, because I think I know what your problem with girls is,\" Gary explained, \"The problem is you spend all your time pining over girls in highschool, and that's nice and all, but those girls have none you your entire life. They know all about you already, like your personality, or how smart you are, or like that time you shit yourself in fifth grade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dude! There are people around us,\" Pete said, trying to hush his friend, \"So what's your point, other than bringing up my painful childhood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What I'm saying is that it's better to start with someone new,\" Gary said, \"A new face, someone who has no idea who you are. That way you can be more prepared what their first impression is going to be. Plus, we're hundreds of miles away from the old hometown, so there's a pretty good chance you'll never seem them again. That means if you blow it with any girl, at least you don't have to see her the next day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That...\" Pete thought over what his friend just said to him, \"That makes a lot of sense, actually. But still, I don't know about all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm telling you, Pete. You need this.\" Gary became adamant, \"You don't know what it's like to look over the classroom and see one of your best buds brooding in the corner. I see someone I care about get depressed and stressed out over the dumbest things. Let yourself relax for once. Let me do this one thing for you, it'll make you feel better in more wyas than you think,.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look, Gary,\" Pete sighed, \"I really do appreciate the offer, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No buts!\" Gary interrupted, \"I hereby swear that I will do everything in my power to get you laid on this trip. It's a promise. I can't take that back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, if you insist,\" Pete laughed as he gave up, \"It's a promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A promise.\" Gary smiled, \"I can't go back on those. Not my style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well I guess it's happening then,\" Pete rolled his eyes once more, \"Anyways, You still haven't told me where we're going. Where the hell is this plane landing, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well it was going to be a surprise, but I might as well tell you now,\" Gary shrugged, \"We are going to a....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Follow Pete in different stories as he tries to cope with different people getting different powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter (Pete) Connors: An 18 year old senior in high school. Although not exactly shy, Pete tends to keep to himself. He's not unpopular by any means, but he would only say about three people in his school are his genuine friends. Ever since his fathers death when Pete was eight, he's had trouble connecting with new people. With his father gone, he now lives with his mother, his older sister, and his grandmother. Pete will often leave his crowded house to hang out with his best friend Jack. Pete enjoys heavy metal, retro video games, and awful movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jane Connors: Pete's 45 year old mom. Ever since her husbands death, she has had trouble connecting with Pete. They used to be very close but for the last ten years Pete has wanted more and more space. Jane's friends assure her it's just how teenagers act, but that hasn't stopped Jane so far. She would do anything to bring them close together again. She works as a secretary at a local law firm, but Pete has started to wonder how she supports two children and his grandmother on just one salary. He suspects she has a second, secret job she doesn't want the rest of the family to know. Jane enjoys going to the beach, romantic comedies, and reruns of sitcoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Emily Connors: Pete's 21 year old sister. Pete loves his sister, they've always gotten along with each other. Ever since he was born, Emily looked after him, feeling some sisterly instinct of protection. And as Pete got older, he felt the same way towards her. They always had each others back no matter what. Emily has currently moved back at home because she caught her roommate sleeping with her now ex-boyfriend. She's been at the house for the last couple months trying to find a new place to stay. She's currently studying to become veterinarian. Emily enjoys horror movies, bird watching, and surfing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ellen (Nana) Connors: Pete's 70 grandmother. Ellen moved into the house after she divorced Pete's grandfather. No one in the family was really surprised at an old woman like Ellen getting divorced, they were more surprised how long she stayed with Pete's awful Grandfather. Ellen has always been more a free spirit, while her husband was a close minded fool his whole life. She only stayed with him because she assumed that was her only option. When she learned otherwise, she left him immediately. Now she's living with her daughter, going on dating sites, and playing cards with her Grand kids. Pete doesn't spend much time with Ellen, but he thinks she's the coolest elderly woman in the world. Ellen likes jazz, flowing gowns, and poker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jack Wakahisa: Pete's 18 year old friend. Jack is a Japanese immigrant and came to America when he was 4. His parents both work full time at the local hospital, so a majority of his childhood was spent at the Connors household being babysat by either Jane or Emily. Now that Pete and Jack are older, it's the complete opposite. Ever since Jack's parents have decided he's old enough to be by himself in the house, Jack has invited Pete to come over nearly every day. They play video games together, watch anime together, and lately drink together. Jack's parents see no problem in letting him drink and Jack has been sharing alcohol with Pete for the last couple months. Jack likes cartoons, difficult videogames, and girls who wear knee high socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0IMPORTANT NOTICE, SORT OF: I feel the need to make it known that each story branch is completely independent of each other. So basically, if one person gets powers, then no other person Pete knows gets powers. For example: If Jack eats a magical Japanese candy, then Pete's Mother doesn't get magical jewelry. Now this only applies to people Pete is friendly with. Other people in Pete's world can have powers, like Pete's mom's friend Cassandra, or other witches at Emily's school, just as long as they are mentioned in those arcs. I hope that makes sense, just didn't want any readers to get confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I will write down descriptions for more characters as they are added. Now read, add, and enjoy.</td>",
