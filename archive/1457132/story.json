You see Aiden the main actor, Carlos the foriegn exchange student he is playing the part of Alladin, Conner part of the running crew, and Matt also one of the leads and very good at music, and last Cory who plays the chinese man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After you are dressed you go to put on your fake facial hair which really turns out to be just some plain black makeup. You don't notice until you are half way started that you put on the wrong make up but before you can clean it up you black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You wake up with everything shaking and you head banging against the ground. You look up and see everything is huge and no has noticed that you shrunk. Before you could do anything the booming gets louder and you see ______ coming towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Email me for discriptions of people)</span></div></div>",

His foot comes down on you and you expect to be dead. You lay there for a minute and start to smell something absolutely horrible. You look up and see Aiden's giant toes around you. You must have slipped through one of the holes in his sock. Before you have time to do anything else he starts to lift up his foot and you are smushed in the crevice between his big and second two. It isn't very pleasant. He has fungus between his toes and once he raised his foot his toes came together and squeezed you so tight you could barely breathe. But through the fabric of the sock you could see it was about to get a whole lot worse...   </span></div></div>",

From behind, a loud laugh rips through the silence of the wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha !, thats why you use gloves Jonny boy\" Conner smiles as he ties the knot for you. After he is done, he stands in front of you in his tight black t-shirt and jeans. \"Can you help me get some of the stage skirting down from the top shelf in a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you see his beaming smile behind his rough stubble. \"Sure, I just gotta wash my hands. I'll be back in a second.\" As you head to the green room bathroom, you pass more of the stage crew. There is David, the disgusting Gay guy with minimal sense of hygiene, he is standing there having a cigarette with Derek, the jerk bully from your high school, who is having to do community service helping out backstage. As you look for a sink in the green room, you see all the actors getting ready. There is Cory, the fit young asian actor, Matt is tuning his guitar. Carlos, the exchange student, is wandering around in nothing but a pair of tight white boxers, looking for his costume.  Finally there is Aiden who glares at you \"Oi runner, get out of here, this is for actors only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry guys, i just need to wash my hands\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt puts his guitar down and stands up \"wash them in your own space, we catch you here again, you're in for a world of trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurry off back to the backstage area where you see the crew helping Conner move some boxes off the shelf. \"sorry I'm late, the cast held me up.\" Conner is ontop of the ladder, his ass half hanging out of his pants, right in your face. \"Don't worry about it, here, help dave and derek move these skirts for the stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the box and continue to set up. The first session is completely booked out by the local private boy's high school. From behind the curtain, you watch as all sorts of guys file into the theatre, nerds, jocks, musicians, druggies.  All of a sudden, You realise you forgot to hang up on extra piece of scenery. You run backstage, searching for a sand bag, you find an old, worn one behind a disused piano, as you grab it, a puff of black soot blows over your face. Coughing, you begin to feel strange. The world spins around you as the stage lights burst on, blinding you, before long you feel yourself falling. You realise you arent falling, but shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour transformation stops and you see with horror that you are </span></div></div>",
