At the age of 17, she was at a height of 5 foot 7 and she didn't like it. She did not gain any attention from any boys she liked but she was still fairly popular. Probably because of her big breasts. For a while now, she wished to be taller but she has always been this height for the past 4 years. When she compared to her family, her sisters and mother were like giants. She had no explanation for her shortness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday Alannah was not happy, today was gym class. She hated gym because even though they only joke around, her classmates always make fun of her height. Basketball was today's subject which wasn't Alannah's favorite subject either. \"Today is going to be a long day\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the game was about to start, Alannah knew that people were making fun of her. It was not a sport for short people, especially when the object of the game was to shoot a ball into an incredibly high net. She felt like an ant compared to everyone. When she finally grabbed hold of the ball, she heard the laughs of some of the popular boys on the bench. She turned around to find it was aimed at her. Every time she grabbed the ball during the game, she heard the same laughs from the same boys. One boy even shouted \"What is your point playing, you cannot throw the ball that high\". She couldn't take it anymore and ran off without talking to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlannah decided to go home instead of face her classmates again today. It was a bad day for her indeed. Walking down the street, Alannah notices her reflection in a puddle. She had a beautiful body but it her legs were the problem.If she was taller, she would feel happier. She again wished to be taller and made her way home.</span></div></div>",

Her dream of being perfectly proportioned would almost consume her at times, though she always tried her best to keep it to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that her 13 year old sister, Julie, is swiftly catching up on her height also didn't help.  Julie is blonde, 5'6, slim, and still has the \"early teens\" shape, where her legs seem extra long compared to the rest of her body.  Claire never had that as a younger girl, and envied that of Julie.  Despite all of this, they were close to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Claire was about to retire for the night, something caught her eye up above.  It looked like a shooting star.  Seeing this as a sign, she made a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could have longer legs.\", she thought to herself.  She felt silly, a wish is childish.  But what harm would it do?  She wouldn't lose anything by trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she realized that the shooting star was getting bigger.  It was travelling towards Earth.  The meteor burning in the atmosphere was creating a green-ish light, but not very bright.  Then she got excited, she saw that it was going to land in the park close by.  It had burned most of its size away, and looked like a burning green basketball from her perspective, before she lost sight of it behind the trees.  There were no other houses between hers and the park, just a street and a set of trees.  She heard a slight thump.  It wasn't loud, and if you weren't focused on the meteor, you wouldn't have been aware of the thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be it.  It has landed.\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I go check it out?\"</span></div></div>",

Since she lived in a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood, there was nothing holding her back but herself.  And it took very little convincing in her mind to go check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she got dressed, and went to the park.  To her surprize, the park was still largely undisturbed.  No huge impact crater, to be found anywhere.  She nearly thought that she had imagined the thump, or even the meteor itself.  But then she saw a round rock-like, softball sized object in a sand pit where the little children play.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire walked up to it.  As she approached it, it started glowing a faint green colour.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has to be it.  It is so beautiful\", she thought.  Hovering her hand over it, she was surprized that it didn't seem warm.  Then Claire touched it, and it glowed bright green for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked it up, and went home.  Sneaking in, and quietly placing it on her nightstand, Claire felt so proud of herself.  For once, she had done something special, and she felt happy knowing that she has a one-of-a-kind item in her possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new sense of fulfillment, Claire decided to go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

As her feet touched the floor, she thought it felt weird.  Like her bed was lower than normal.  She quickly wrote that off to her imagination.  Getting dressed for her morning run, she found that her capri leggings ended a little closer to her knees than she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn, these must've shrunk in the wash.  They were my favorites.  Oh well, I'll just get some new ones later today.\" she thought.</span></div></div>",

At first, she thought Claire was in heels, but she saw that she was wearing her running flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Claire asked without looking up from her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, you've grown taller!\"  Julie exclaimed.

That's a 4 inch gain.  Please measure my inseam.\" Claire said, full of excitement.  Sure enough, her new inseam measured 33 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fantastic!\" Claire's excitement could almost not be contained.  Not only did she get a bit taller, but all of the extra height seemed to be in her legs, which she always wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what this means, though?  I have to go shopping for new clothes.  Do you want to join me?\" Claire asked.</span></div></div>",

Since they only recently moved to the area, she didn't know many people, and thus no-one really suspected anything weird about her increased stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was trying out a few new dresses and outfits, her phone made the distinct 'boodle-ling' iPhone message sound.

Would you mind if I lay there and read my book?\"  Julie asked.  Since they were close, Claire didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, go ahead.

At first Claire thought that Julie was wearing some gigantic heels, but Julie is standing in front of her barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  How?\" was all Claire could muster.  Suddenly, her own growth spurt seemed less special.  At the age of 13, Julie just grew 6 inches in the space of a few hours.  To Claire's horror, she saw that all of the extra height was added to Julie's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was confirmed when they measured Julie.  She stands 6 feet tall, with 34\" of legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, not that I'm complaining, but this isn't normal.  People don't just grow 4 or 6 inches like that.  Something must be causing this...\"  Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Claire think.  The meteorite.  It must be doing this.  It had to be, it's the only thing that changed recently.  First her, sleeping next to it, and then Julie, reading in bed next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made sense to Claire, but she was very jealous at that moment.

A daunting task, since her sister is 5 feet taller than she originally was, but still had the same size body above her long legs.  Her inseam, which measured 7'6\", was longer than Julie was tall.  Even though Julie gained another inch, which left her at 6'5\", due to unavoidable exposure to the meteorite, she could comfortably walk underneath her sister's legs if she spread them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, listen to yourself.

I can reach anything, and boys can't take their eyes off of my legs.\"  Claire sounded almost giddy with exstacy.  Then, for effect, Claire put her right leg forward.

She couldn't let Claire keep going on like this.  But how could she stop her?  Take the meteorite away?  Claire would notice, and with her new size, Julie felt intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\"  Julie thought.  She remembered how Claire looked when she saw that Julie grew much faster than Claire.  Maybe she could threaten her with that.  With the thought of Julie growing taller than her almost instantly, Claire would yield, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like a plan to Julie.  But there was one problem...  Would she follow through?

She opened her eyes to see a seemingly endless thigh that ended at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ceiling?!  That has to be 15' high.  And that's just my knee?!  Just how tall am I now?!\"  Julie almost panicked.  She knew she would grow a lot during the night, but she never imagined this.  Even crawling on hands and knees, she was taller than the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefuly made her way downstairs, and crawled outside where she could stand up straight for the first time.  Using the house as a measure, she figured that she was about 36' tall.  As tall as the house, she could just barely see over the roof.  Her upper body also grew to 6' long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire opened her curtains, and saw two tremendous legs walking past.  She nearly fainted.  Rushing outside, as much as a 15' tall girl could rush in a normal house, she stood in awe in front of Julie.  She thought she was tall at 15' (with 11' legs), but Julie's size was just unbelievable.  Claire was looking at her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey 'big' sis.  I borrowed your rock last night.  What do you think?\"  Julie playfully said.  Then it hit Julie, she actually liked this.  Being bigger than her sister, especially so much bigger, gave her a rush.  Walking past her house, she realized just how big she was.  She was taller than most houses, and could easily look into the 3rd floor windows of normal buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Julie realized why Claire was acting like this.  It felt great.  To be so tall that no-one is your equal made her feel great.  The second tallest person in the world only comes up to her knee, and the average person doesn't even come close to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to go for a walk.  You can join me, if you can keep up...\"  Julie taunted.</span></div></div>",

She found some string and made a sort of string-cradle for the meteorite and then hung in on a loop which would go round her neck.  \"Julie will never get this back now!\" said confidently.  She had been so engrosed in her work that she only noticed that she'd put on another two feet of leg whilst doing this when she stood up again and hit her head hard on the ceiling.  \"Ow!  I'd better get outside quick!\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully made her way through the rest of the house and out in to the back yard.  All that running after Julie had made her a bit tired so she sat down and lent up against the back of the house in the sun, stretching her (now) 13foot long legs out in front of her.  Pretty soon she fell fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two hours later she woke up and her jaw dropped!  She could not see her feet because...</span></div></div>",

Just how long are they I wonder\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her body, she figured that her torso had also grown and was now about 10 feet long, but sticking out from, there was an incredibly long pair of legs.  She looked in front of her and could see that her legs reached all the way down her yard and disappeared in to the woods beyond, a distance, Claire knew, of over 200 yards.  \"200 yards!  That's 600 feet.  At least!\" she thought.  Slowly she moved first one, then the other leg.  She was expecting them to be really heavy but instead they felt the same weight they always did.  Somewhere down the yard where her knees and Claire gingerly started to raise them, and draw her feet under her so she could stand upright.  Eventually getting to her feet she look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The world is different from up here\" she thought, feeling the wind on her face.  Comparing herself to the house she realised she was 750feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, lets go find Julie again and show her who's the biggest, and best\" Claire said</span></div></div>",
