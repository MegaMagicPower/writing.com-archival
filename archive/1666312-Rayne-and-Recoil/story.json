            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several days had passed since Raven set off on her latest expedition. From a plane flying above the deep jungles of South America, Raven parachuted into the heart of the jungle. She landed safely in the jungle. After regaining her composure she removed her helmet and slipped a phone from her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey,\" Raven said on the phone, \"I've made it. I've landed safely at the drop-off point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA masculine voice was heard on the other end of the phone line. \"That's great, Raven, that's great. Now listen, you shouldn't be far from the your target. Head to the East until you find some old temple ruins. Oh, and be careful, it is said that the fountain of youth is protected by an ancient tribe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Joey, don't worry about me, I'll be fine. Raven out.\" With that said, Raven disconnected her phone and placed it back in her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer journey had begun. She trekked through the heart of the jungle, seemingly for hours, until she reached the remnants of an old ancient temple, just as Joey explained. Fortunately for Raven however, there was not a tribesman to be found. Believing that she was in the clear, she swiftly approached the temple grounds. Upon the entrance Raven found a tablet with a Mayan emblem upon it. She shoved the tablet into her backpack and entered the temple ruins. It was dark within the interior of the temple. Realizing this, Raven put on her night vision goggles and continued investigating the ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the temple there was absolute silence. Every movement that Raven made was echoed throughout the temple ruins. All that could be found was stone, dust and bones. Soon however she discovered a hidden trap door in a destroyed room in the far corner of the temple. She leaped through the trap door and continued her search until she reached a stone door which required some sort of tablet to open. Raven reached into her backpack and took out the tablet that she picked up earlier. She fitted it into the door and watched in amazement as the door opened itself. She stepped into the newly discovered room, which lit up from a crack in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was. A truly remarkable sight to behold. With her eyes glued to her discovery, she reached for her phone once more. \"Joey,\" she said over the phone, \"I found it. I've found the legendary Fountain of Youth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey laughed over the phone as Raven slowly approached the fountain. \"I can't believe it! This must be what Ponce De Leon found! I guess through false translations it was thought to be in Florida, and yet there you are, just a few feet away from it! This could be the find of the century!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine the wonders that we could achieve with this,\" Raven giggled excitedly as she gazed into the clear, flowing water of the fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Joey continued, \"Just be careful with what you're doing. We have no idea of the capabilities of this fountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Joey. I wouldn't mind getting rid of a few wrinkles myself if I'm honest,\" Raven laughs jokingly, \"Raven out.\" Raven placed her phone back into her backpack and bent down to gain a closer look at the clear, sparkling water. She was mesmerized, as if she was staring into something that she expected in some sort of dream. The fountain itself must not have been touched for centuries, and yet it looks as if it was brand new. At that moment, Raven noticed something in the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another stone tablet, once again with a Mayan inscription. She translated the inscription for herself, which read \"Water from the fountain of youth can restore one's youth, but thee be warned, it also carries a curse to those who would take it from these grounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious,\" Raven thought to herself as she places the tablet aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

She then returned to her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, I'm going to bring a few samples back to the plane,\" Raven said over the phone, \"We need to analyze this substance or else how can we be sure that this is the legendary Fountain of the Youth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey replied to Raven's call. \"As much as I would love to agree with you, I've just been looking through a few notes on the fountain. Has there been any warning about taking some of the water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Raven admitted, \"I just found this Mayan inscription warning that a curse would be brought upon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Joey interrupted Raven. \"If that's the case, it would be for the best to just leave it. I can't have you risking your life for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Joey, nothing's going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I'd rather not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, listen, there is no such thing as a curse. I'm bringing back a few samples and that's the end of it. I'll meet you back at the plane. Raven out.\" With that said, Raven slipped the phone back into her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully she lowered one of the containers into the clear water and filled it up. She continued this routine until she filled six containers of the water, fortunately without getting a drop on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a backpack of containers full of water from the fountain, she found her way out of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the temple however, what happened next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in her hometown of Ruby City, Raven Skye was offered an invitation to stop by at the local elementary school to give an inspirational speech to the students. Unwilling to refuse such an offer to return to the school where she grew up, she accepted the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived upon the school grounds, wearing a white tank-top and denim shorts. With her motorcycle parked outside, she entered the school, where she was greeted by her old fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Tabitha Burns, who had apparently dropped to teaching first grade. It gave Raven a sense of nostalgia to return to her old stomping grounds and reunite with her favorite teacher, who appeared to have aged well since Raven graduated to middle school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the morning Raven told the students of Tabitha's first grade class her terrifying and exciting adventures throughout her career as the children listened anxiously. Each story that she told was better than the last, and just before the lunch break, Raven went into the details of her latest expedition, which took her one of the greatest discoveries in the world, the legendary Fountain of Youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told the class of the chilling curse that was supposed to have been brought upon her. \"A terrible curse,\" she explained, \"To those who would dare take the water from the fountain. From what I've learned from my partner, it is said that whoever takes the water from the fountain will instantly lose twenty years of their age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the speech was over, several students raised their hands, all wanting to ask the young adventurer a question. Raven picked out a young black-haired boy with his hand held high. \"If you was cursed, how old would you be now?\" He asked curiously, making Raven slightly blush and chuckle. \"That's a personal question,\" she stated, \"But if you want to know, if the curse was real, I'd be about six years old by now! I'd be starting first grade again!\" The children were astonished by this, and began to talk amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss,\" a young blonde-haired girl asked, \"What if the curse hasn't happened yet? What if it was yet to happen?\" This made Raven slightly worried, and made her think about her answer. \"Don't worry sweetie,\" she replied, \"Nothing is going to happen to me.\" And with that said, the school bell rang, alerting the students that their lunch break had begun. With Tabitha's permission, they all rushed out of the classroom, leaving behind a room of empty chairs and desks. Now all alone, Raven Skye was free to address her old teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two talked more about Raven's adventures, until Tabitha asked her a question. \"Raven, aren't you worried about this curse of yours?\" Puzzled by this, Raven answers back. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" Tabitha continued, \"It's not too late. You could wake up one morning to find that you were twenty years younger! What would you do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Mrs. Burns,\" Raven laughed boldly, \"I'll be fine.\" Suddenly however, just five minutes later, the tingling sensation that Raven had suffered since her expedition grew rapidly until the room was flooded by a blinding bright light. Blinded by the shining light, Raven felt her entire body begin to change. She felt as if she was shrinking and her body was bloating. Her breasts shrank as her hair reshaped from a ponytail into braids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds the light faded away. Raven regained her sight, only to be terrified by the result. She looked down in horror to see that her entire body had transformed. The tall, fit and attractive brunette was now a short, fat and stubby little girl. Her denim shorts had slipped down to her ankles and she wore her tank-top as if it was a dress. It was as if she was reliving a memory of her childhood, when she was a chubby little girl who was always picked on by her peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in shock of her transformation, she then looked up, following the suddenly massive length of Tabitha's legs. She continued to tilt her head back until finally she looked up to her old teacher's face. A shiver ran up Raven's spine at the mere size of Tabitha, as if Tabitha had somehow become the size of a goddess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha was in shock. Quickly she leaped out of her chair and descended to her knee. The size of her face was tremendous in comparison to Raven's face. \"Raven!?\" Tabitha panicked, \"Raven, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Raven began to panic. \"What just happened!? What just happened to me!?\" She was clearly in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven,\" Tabitha whimpered, \"I hate to say it, but you was wrong. That curse was all too true. You look like a young child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Raven screamed, \"No! It can't be! What am I going to do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

I have an idea.\" Raven wiped a tear from her eye, trying her best not to fall into causing a tantrum, and anticipated her old teacher's idea. She watched as Tabitha reached into her desk and pulled out a small school uniform. \"I'm sorry Raven,\" Tabitha continued, handing the tiny outfit to you, \"But you'll just have to try your best to blend in for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the uniform in her flabby arms, Raven gulped, shuddering at the thought of revisiting her nightmarish childhood, but from her new point of view, it would be the best not to get onto the bad side of her teacher, who now stood intimidatingly over her. And so with little other option, Raven ripped herself out of her old clothes, while Tabitha looked away, granting Raven some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tabitha looked out of the window, Raven reluctantly tried to put her new uniform on, but struggled in doing so because of her new, chubby posterior. She was unable to squeeze into the white, tight shirt, and could not breathe in hard enough to slide the black skirt above her thick thighs. She stood feeble in the nude, failing miserably at putting on the uniform. So as her entire face blushed red, she tugged on the long skirt of her old teacher, her turned to face her with a clear expression of pity. She knew what poor little Raven asked for, so without hesitation, Tabitha quickly helped her to put her new uniform on. Tabitha tugged ferociously, squeezing Raven's chunky frame into her new shirt, pulled up the tight skirt and helped her slip her feet into her small shoes. After several minutes, there Raven stood, reliving her harsh memories as a fat little girl in school uniform, dreading what she was about to face in her first day back in elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the second school bell rung, Raven suddenly hid behind the tall frame of her old teacher, who allowed her students to enter the classroom and take their respectful seats. Tabitha then addressed the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Children,\" Tabitha explained to the class, \"I must inform you all that there is a new student in your class. We don't know how long she's going to stay here, but hopefully it won't be for long. Please give a warm welcome to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tabitha could give the name of the temporary student, she immediately realized that revealing Raven's real name would blow her attempt to blend in with the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last minute, she thought of her own daughter and continued. \"Please welcome Catherine Skye!\" With that said, Tabitha steps away from her desk, revealing the chubby six-year old to the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven, who was unhappy with her new name choice, stood pathetically and nervously in front of the class, who gazed at her in a variety of expressions. Raven stared back at all the students, who suddenly looked tremendously larger than her previous encounter with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Catherine,\" Tabitha said to the six-year old, \"Please take a seat.\" Obeying her teacher's command, Raven, now going by the name Catherine, approached her new desk, which sat in the very front and middle of the classroom, where she could not avoid the glancing eyes of her new peers. She squeezed into her desk and let out a huge sigh of disbelief. Never in a million years would she ever find herself sitting at a desk at elementary school again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class seemed to drag on forever. It felt like Catherine was in her equivalent of hell, revisiting her nightmarish past all over again. However, as Catherine would soon find out, this would only be the beginning of an adventure like she had never embarked on in her life.</span></div></div>",

It was an unwelcome day for poor Catherine Skye, who struggled to breathe in her new tight uniform throughout the entire day. It was a relief for her to hear the final bell, signaling the end of the school day, but as all the students fled the school grounds, Catherine was left with a new problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the corridors emptied, Catherine, who had still not come to terms with her transformation, stumbled to Tabitha's classroom, where she found her old teacher preparing to leave. Tabitha looked at her with sympathy. She knew that Catherine had gone through a rough day, and so taking pity on the chubby six-year old girl, Tabitha offered her to stay with her for the night, just as long as she shared a bed with her fifteen-year old daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine had no other option. While her partner, Joey Phillips, was out at an excavation in Egypt, she was left alone to suffer the consequences of stealing from the legendary Fountain of Youth. After brief consideration, Catherine nodded her head pathetically and embraced her old teacher, squeezing tightly to her long, thick calves. Tabitha then lowered herself to Catherine's level to embrace her herself, despite Catherine's fear of her huge, long arms wrapped around her chunky frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Tabitha suddenly said, releasing her hold from the little girl, \"I forgot to mention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mention what?\" Catherine asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be stuck like this for a while,\" Tabitha continued, \"And if we can't make any better arrangements, I'm afraid that you'd have to join some of us on our camping trip over the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What camping trip?\" Catherine yelped in slight fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've arranged for some of our students to stay at the Jade River Campsite from Friday to Monday,\" Catherine's old teacher explained, without any consideration of Catherine's horrified expression, \"And since I'll be supervising, and if we can't find anywhere for you to stay by Friday, then I'm afraid that you'll have to join us. I hope that'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine's expression could easily be read. She was horrified by the mere thought of camping with the same classmates that mocked her harshly throughout the day. And if that wasn't bad enough, she feared the worst about returning to Jade River, where she lived one of the most dramatic points of her cruel childhood. But with so little choice, she had to accept and face her greatest fears to relive her nightmarish past and return to where those nightmares turned for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Catherine agreed that she would join her old teacher and return to the Jade River Campsite. And shortly after her agreement, Catherine immediately made a statement. \"Can we just get out of this place now please?\" With that said, Tabitha grabbed Catherine by the hand and took her to her new, temporary home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the reader, where would you like to go from here?</span></div></div>",

She watched, awestruck by the size of the cozy-looking house, as Tabitha unlocked the front door and swung it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, as the door swung open, a huge Great Dane stormed out of the house and charged towards the new arrival. Raven may have had a history of battling ferocious beasts in her career, but the astonished size of the dog, who stood tall and proudly over the chubby girl, was more than enough for her to let out a fearful yelp. She simply froze in horror as the huge dog skulked around her, sniffing and searching her person. Realizing Raven's uncomfortable stance was a cry of fear, Tabitha pulled on the collar of the dog, yelling at it while doing so, and pulled it back into the house, where it rushed presumably into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shaking from this experience, Raven unwillingly followed the much older Tabitha into the home. The rays of the sun that seemingly beamed down upon her was overcome by the cool breeze produced by air conditioning. As Tabitha closed the door behind her, Raven, for the first time since her transformation, felt a sense of comfort upon her soft, chunky body. She was treated with an average-looking house, suitable for a family of four or more, with white walls and patterned carpets. For the first time in possibly years, Raven truly felt like she was home. The only fact that dampened her warm spirit was the age that she stood at during that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catherine!\" The sudden screech from Tabitha caught the chubby little girl off guard. \"Come down here for a minute, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the six-year old could hear footsteps booming from above. Gazing up to the top of the staircase, her sense of comfort was destroyed as she saw a young, tall and attractive teenager storm down the steps with an aggravated expression upon her face. As the teenager loomed over the little girl like a giant, the teenager glanced at the chubby girl, seemingly agitated by her presence. \"Hi Mom,\" she suddenly said, \"Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Raven gulped in fright, too afraid to wipe the sweat from her brows, Tabitha introduced her. \"Catherine, my sweet, this is Raven. She is going to stay with us for a little while. Would you mind if she shared a bed with you?\" In her mind, Raven started to panic. All she wanted was to have someone to look after her until she found a way to return to her rightful age, let alone another place to stay. The last thing that she wanted was to have the nerve to ask an aggravated teenager if she could share a bed with her! She knew that she would end up agreeing to stay with her old teacher, and the look upon the teenager's face following this question clearly showed that this was evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Catherine blurted, clearly ticked off by such an offer, \"Why would I share my bed with a thing like her!? I'm not sharing a bed with some pig in a dress!\" The teenager's words were hurtful, but there was nothing that Raven could do but stay quiet. As much as Raven wanted to take matters into her own hands, and teach Catherine a lesson that she won't ever forget, she knew that this was wishful thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catherine!\" Tabitha suddenly snapped at her fifteen-year old daughter. \"Don't speak to our guest like that! If you don't treat her like your little sister, I will ground you for a month!\" With that said, Catherine stormed back upstairs and into her bedroom in a tantrum. From what she's now seen from Tabitha's daughter, Raven knew that she was in for an awkward night, or at least more of an awkward night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to comfort her, Tabitha bent to her knees, dropping herself down to Raven's level, and spoke to her. \"Don't worry about Catherine,\" she explained, \"She does get a bit moody at times. I think that she's been having boyfriend problems lately, but don't worry, you'll soon get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Raven blankly said, clearly unhappy with her current situation, but as much as she pouted, the more she looked like a grumpy, pathetic fat little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Raven,\" Tabitha said once again, \"Since you're only six years old now, that means that you'll have to go to bed early. So why not make something out of what little time you have for the rest of the night, and we can sort out this mess in the morning!\" Unfortunately Raven was not as enthusiastic about these plans as her old teacher was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the reader, where would you like to go from here?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The days went by slowly for poor Raven, who was forced to live with the name Catherine, but this was the least of her concerns. Her fellow students stopped at nothing to humiliate her. All the girls disliked her and all the boys poked fun at her, and all because of her humongous, shapely frame. She was forced to relive her nightmarish childhood once again, but all along she knew that the worst was yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weekend finally arrived, and after a grueling long bus journey, Raven finally arrived at the Jade River Campsite. From the moment she stepped off the bus and gazed at the old wooden shelters, her horrific memories quickly emerged in her mind. Raven had faced many fearful obstacles in her career as an explorer, but they were nothing compared to what she was about to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a tight girl scout uniform, which would look cuter on any other skinnier girl of her age, Raven stumbled amongst the crowd of elementary school students towards their destination. The pushing and shoving of the crowd forced her into the campsite. As the crowd stopped, they were silenced by the presence of their superior, Tabitha Burns, who was in charge of the entire trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello students,\" she announced proudly, \"Welcome to Jade River! After I give you the grant tour, feel free to explore the environment. Who knows what you could find out in these woods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour of the campsite had become a routine in Raven's mind because she had lived it before, and this experience was no different to her previous experience. It was like she was mirroring her past actions, leading up to one of the most dramatic points of her cruel childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour ended quickly, and everyone was freed from her attention. After a brief comfort chat to Tabitha, in an attempt to calm her nerves, Raven unwillingly traveled through the woods. At least trekking through the woods brought back some memories as an explorer, where she would trek through dark forests in search of lost and ancient artifacts, but unfortunately it seemed like those days were over, since the mysterious disappearance of her former partners. It was also noticeably much more difficult to trek through the woods, as she found it much more challenging and exhausting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs sweat immediately broke from her forehead, and as fatigue quickly set in, Raven soon arrived besides the river. She sat besides the river and watched the flowing water, pondering on her current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she realize was that she was in fact being watched by sinister eyes. She may not have known it, but soon Raven was going to have an encounter that she wouldn't soon forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happened next?</span></div></div>",

You just stay in this class and wait until I get back. Is that okay?\" Raven wiped a tear from her eye and nodded her head, trying her best to avoid balling with tears. Raven watched on with a hint of concern upon her face as Tabitha ascended back to her feet. Raven was intimidated by the mere height of her old teacher. Tabitha rushed out of the classroom and closed the door behind her. Raven quietly stood still, too afraid to do anything, until she heard some sort of van pull up outside of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly afterward Raven's heart stopped when she heard a loud gunshot from outside. She quickly rushed toward the window and tried looking outside, only to fail by her short stature. She even tried standing on her toes, but her heavy frame prevented her from keeping her balance. Raven became frustrated until she heard people screaming outside of the classroom. So after struggling to open the door, she crept outside to take a peek, only to be overwhelmed by the children and teachers screaming and retreating down the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven crept further down the hallway until she saw five figures entering the building. There were four men, in black outfits, each wearing a ski mask and carrying an AK-47, while they were led by a woman in a tight black jumpsuit with long, blonde hair and carrying a silenced M9 handgun in each hand. Raven recognized the woman, leading the men into the building, from her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's name was Sofia Valda, better known as 'Solitaire'. She was a mercenary who used to work for an organization called 'Fem-Zo', a company that focused entirely on genetic engineering and the alteration of the human female. However after years of service, Sofia was released from her contract with the company after failing to kill Raven Skye during one of her expeditions. Seeing her arch nemesis march down the hallway, with the expression upon her face, made Raven fearful for her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia then addressed her men. Raven was able to hear what she wanted. \"Alright boys,\" Sofia calmly told her minions, \"Raven Skye is the only woman who knows how to get to the Fountain of Youth. She is around here somewhere. I want you to find her and bring her to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that Sofia was not one to mess around with, and without any form of communication with any of her allies at this point, Raven immediately rushed out of sight, fearing for her life. She ran as fast as she could with her short and overweight frame, finding it difficult to breathe and harder for her to move. She could not recall another time when she was so tired after so little movement, remembering how much hard work it took for her to lose all the weight and become as slim and fit as she was in her twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Raven tried her best to hide from her enemies, she began to hear the men in black calling her name, calling for her as if she was a pet. Raven knew that she could not allow her rival to find her this way, so no matter how much it hurt her, she knew that she had to keep moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven Skye was very slow in her movement. Her enemies drew ever closer to finding her, killing everyone who tried to stop them. It seemed as if the more Raven ran, the closer she got to getting caught. Her only option was to hide from the attackers. She managed to squeeze into one of the student's lockers further down the hall. She held her heavy breath and watched silently as the attackers marched past her until they turned around the corner. Thinking that she was in the clear, Raven popped out of the locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was she in the clear?</span></div></div>",

Before she could make a move, someone grabbed her by the shoulder with a tight grip. Raven froze in horror. She looked up to her captor, who looked down at her with a wicked smile on her face. She was caught by her old enemy. She was caught by Sofia Valda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven did not resist capture, realizing if it would be a feeble attempt with her new stature. She was extremely intimidated by the huge size of her arch nemesis, who laughed to herself upon seeing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven?\" Sofia asked in delight, \"Raven Skye? Is that really you?\" She burst out with laughter as her nails dug into Raven's shoulder. \"Had a little too much water from the fountain did we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling humiliated, Raven looked down to the ground in shame. \"Shut up,\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Raven,\" Sofia sarcastically chuckled, \"I mean, look at you! You look like a little porker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven began to sulk. \"Shut up,\" she moaned once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what they used to call you? Porker? Is that right, porker? Pork chops?\" Sofia bursts out with laughter once more, making Raven remember the horrors that she had growing up. \"This is great. This is too good! You look so pathetic like that! Don't you, porker? A baby porker, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone,\" Raven grumbled under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on porky,\" Sofia continued, \"Don't sulk like a baby! It's not my fault that you've been packing on the pounds! It's not my fault that you were cursed by the Fountain of Youth. It's not my fault that you have to live like that again! Like a little porker! Huh? Right porky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven didn't say a word, which made Sofia smile even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay porky,\" Sofia said, tightening her grip on Raven's shoulder, \"It's time for you to show me where you found the Fountain of Youth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, \"Or what?\" Raven blurted out rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now,\" Sofia said mockingly, \"That's no way for a girl your age to act. Especially not a little porker like you. You're in no position to fight back. Either you help me find the Fountain of Youth, or else I'll make sure that you'll stay like this forever. I'll make you regret finding that fountain in the first place. We will never help you lift this curse. I will make sure that you stay as the little porker that you are, and I will make you're life a living hell. Am I making myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sofia could receive an answer, Raven bit her hand, forcing her to release her grip, and broke free. While Sofia was distracted Raven seized the opportunity and tried to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did Raven manage to escape?</span></div></div>",

Still in pain, she slowly followed the fat little six year old while cursing her under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust for one moment, it looked as if Raven Skye was about to escape from the clutches of her huge arch nemesis, at least for the time being, but the strain of running for her now was far too overwhelming. She could no longer keep up with the pace that she had as an adult. Her steps became slower and slower as she struggled to keep her breath and avoid passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could move around the corner, before she could temporarily remove herself from Sofia's line of vision, two of her minions emerged and pointed their rifles at the chunky six year old. Realizing that she could not avoid them, she immediately broke to a halt and froze in fear. She took a few steps back, hinting to the men that she intended to run the opposite direction, only to be grabbed on both shoulders by Sofia, who lowered herself onto her knees to stare at her face to face. Her face blocked almost everything in Raven's vision, giving her a realization of what she had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Raven tried to catch her breath, Sofia glared into her eyes furiously. \"Now Missy,\" Sofia said with a building rage within her, \"That's no way for you to behave to your superiors, now is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again fearful for her life, Raven gulped and simply shook her head, just like a young child being told off by her parents. This brought back several unwanted memories for the six year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me,\" Sofia continued, \"Unless you want to spend the rest of your life as the little porker as you are, I suggest that you lead us to where we want to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still a small glimmer of courage left in Raven for her to talk back to her nemesis. \"What's in it for me?\" However she was surprised by the answer that she received. \"Well,\" Sofia answered, \"I promise you that once you lead us to the Fountain of Youth, even though I really prefer you like this, we'll help as much as we can to lift this curse. So are we on agreeing terms now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven had to consider the offer. There was no determining whether or not this curse could be lifted. But what was more concerning was whether or not she could trust her arch enemy. They had been enemies for several years and Raven had known Sofia long enough to know whenever she was lying through her teeth or not. Sofia was not to be trusted, but then again, there was no point in arguing with her at this point, considering the huge size, age and experience that she had over me, even though it was unbearable to be mocked and called a porker once again, as if reliving her horrific childhood wasn't bad enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia anticipated a reply, but what did Raven do at this point?</span></div></div>",

Sofia felt no pity for the six year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Raven,\" Sofia boasted, \"I remember the last time that you wore the tank-top that you're wearing. It looks so much better as a little dress for a little porker like yourself, don't you think? But as cute as it looks, I'm afraid that we can't have a little porker like you roaming through the jungles of South America dressed like that now can't we?\" Raven said nothing, only staring at the floor in shame. \"That's why I've come prepared,\" Sofia added, \"I've packed some of my old clothes from when I was about twelve years old. Maybe they'd be able to fit you, at least just barely. Why don't you go into the little girl's room and put them on? Just be sure not to stretch them for me, okay? Off you pop!\" Sofia handed the clothes to her former rival, who slowly made her way to the bathroom, where she indeed changed. It was horrible enough that Raven had to wear the clothes of her rival from when she was only twelve years old, but her chubby cheeks grew bright red when she realized that she was still too fat to fit into them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven left the bathroom, now wearing a pair of Sofia's old shorts which constricted around her thick legs, and a sleeveless top, ironically with an image of a pig on it, which pressed against her skin. After Raven presented herself to her enemy in her old clothes, Sofia broke out in laughter. \" Oh my,\" Sofia cried in laughter, \"I think I should have given you some clothes from when I was a little older!\" The sound of Sofia's laughter made Raven feel even worse, this was just what she feared after making the deal with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calming herself down, Sofia sits back down as the jet flew over the ocean. She offered Raven a seat next to her, which she had no choice but to accept. So Raven squeezed onto the chair as Sofia chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know porky,\" Sofia said to the chubby six year old, who simply stared at her feet, \"When we inspected you before boarding this jet, I was surprised. From looking at you, I'd say that you were one of the fattest little girls in the country. But after weighing you on our scales, I've learned that, even with your overweight stature, I'm still twice as heavy as you. And from measuring you, we found that you were even shorter than my own leg? I'd have to drop to my knees just so you can stretch your arm and touch my nose! Doesn't that frighten you? Doesn't it frighten you to know that your bitter rival, the woman that you feuded with for so many years, has total dominance over you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven simply ignored her as Sofia continued rambling on. \"You know what else porky? After years of bickering, I'm actually enjoying being alongside you. Isn't it wonderful being on the same side as each other?\" From the tone of Sofia's voice, it was obviously a rhetorical question, as Sofia continued rambling to her prisoner. \"Don't take this the wrong way, but back then, I really despised you. But now, you've become like a little sister to me. I've always wanted a little sister, especially one that would make me feel better about myself. Hasn't it always been your dream to have a sister of your own? Of course it has. It's wonderful to have someone to look up to. In fact, you're lucky to even be joining us on this journey, because if I had my way, I'd actually take you under my wing and raise you as my own. But business is business, and I've got a job to do, and I intend to stick to it. Speaking of which, how was your first day back at school? None of the other kids called you a porker, did they? It's such a shame how people can be so cruel, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours of listening to Sofia ramble about how superior she is to her rival, the jet finally arrived at the drop-off point where Raven first arrived on her last journey. The jet landed softly in the middle of the jungle. Raven was shoved off the plane by Sofia, who immediately demanded the correct direction to the Fountain of Youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Raven pointed out the direction of their destination. The fat little six year old girl was then tightly grabbed around the arm by the tight grip of Sofia, and dragged along with her as she and her crew began trekking through the heart of the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trekking through the jungle, Raven began to underestimate the physique that she used to possess as an adult the last time she made this journey. The obstacles of which she would have easily cleared in no time now required help from her rival, who would shockingly lift her from her feet, with ease, and carry her across these obstacles. Just trying to keep up with Sofia through the damp jungle proved to be exhausting for the six year old, but rather than comforting her, Sofia simply laughed at the humiliation that her enemy was forced to endure. It seemed as if Raven was not going the same route as she did the last time she ventured here, but indeed it was. Against her will, as well as her physical endurance, Raven slowly led her arch nemesis, and her minions, to the temple ruins where she first found the legendary Fountain of Youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happened next?</span></div></div>",

I mean you've never been able to keep up with me before but this time, it's like I'm taking care of a little child. Well, that's really no surprise, because you are a little child. A little porker to be exact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down upon her rival, who momentarily looked up to the face of her adversary. \"You know it,\" Sofia continued as Raven looked away from her, \"You know that I'm right. I know how much you hate it, but that's what I love about it. You're hating every minute of this, aren't you? I can tell because of the look on your face. You're trying to hide it but you can't. I can read you like a book, and you look so pathetic. I am really going to miss having you as a little sister, but then again, you're going to make me a very wealthy woman. I might even sprinkle a drop of the water on me. I could do being a little bit youthful, not that I need it really, but a girl has to maintain her looks. Too bad no one ever told you that, isn't that right porky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours of trekking through the damp jungle and putting up with Sofia's boastful ramblings, the group finally entered the temple ruins of which the legendary Fountain of Youth resided. Raven continued to reluctantly lead the way, with the help of the superior Sofia to bring her underground, until they finally arrived at the very fountain. The group were mesmerized by the tranquility of the site. The clear, crystal water flowed. The crack in the wall lit up what was a beautiful sight to behold. With her little prisoner's end of the bargain fulfilled, Sofia released her grip of Raven's bicep, shoving her to the ground slightly, and ordered her men to bring in the rest of their equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing the bruise on her arm from where Sofia had her tight vice-like grip on her, Raven slowly stumbled back to her feet, with grazes upon her knees, realizing that she had indeed fulfilled her part of the arrangement. She was once again standing in the presence of the Fountain of Youth, which looked far more larger from her new perspective. Raven extended her arms out, anticipating a change. She thought to herself that if she were to return to the fountain, then the curse would then be lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was the curse lifted or not?</span></div></div>",

Raven indeed fulfilled her part of the bargain, and yet as Raven stood there, she was irritated by the arrogance demonstrated by her long time arch nemesis, who had seemingly forgot all about her captor. To Raven's annoyance, Sofia simply turned her back on her and took charge of her men, who struggled to bring in the rest of the equipment necessary to profit from this discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to regain the attention of her rival, Raven approached her from behind and tugged on her tight jumpsuit. Sofia noticed this and giggled. \"How pathetic\", she boasted as she turns herself back around and drops onto her knees, clouding Raven's sight with her huge face. \"What does my little porker want?\" She asked, talking to the six year old as if she was a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to be treated like a child any further, Raven slammed her foot to the ground in anger. \"I've had enough,\" she yelled, \"Stop talking to me like that! I've had enough!\" No matter how hard she tried to assert herself, she could not avoid looking like a pathetic little child throwing a tantrum, to the amusement of her superior. \"We've made a deal. You said that if I brought you here, you'd help me get back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Raven anticipated a reply from her arch rival.

There's nothing wrong with you. You've been normal all along.\" Raven looked on in confusion. \"Don't you believe in fate?\" Asked Sofia, \"This is you normally. The only thing that was wrong with you was when you lost all of that weight in the first place, when you became an explorer, all the times that we tried to kill each other.

She could not take anymore pain, abuse and humiliation in the hands of the evil woman that stood dominant over her since this whole predicament began. No more could she allow herself to be pushed around by the big bully. Realizing that there was hardly any hope left for her to return to her normal age, she had to make a stand. She had to take action, and she had to do it now, before her enemy could have her way with her any further. Raven Skye mustered all of her strength, or at least what's left of it after such a tiresome trek, she mustered all of her courage, and decided to finally take action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia, ignoring her prisoner, continued ordering her men around, arranging and organizing them as their plot unfolded. Hiding out of sight, Raven investigated the environment, scanning the area for a way to get back at her enemies. Unfortunately for her, there was hardly any. She could not find a suitable way for her to exact her revenge upon her arch nemesis, who constantly humiliated her since her capture. No doubt there were many possibilities to fight back, however there were none of which Raven was capable of as the obese six year old girl that she was forced to live as for the rest of her life. And so she hid behind a stone the same size as her, struggling to calculate a plan, until Raven noticed an opportunity that unfolded before her very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven anxiously watched on as Sofia approached the Fountain of Youth. She stood in front of it, merely inches away from touching the water, just glaring into the water, as her men continued their work. It was as if Sofia was caught in a trance, staring into the crystal clear water. It was too good to be true for the six year old. This was her opportunity. She realized that if she did not strike now, she may never get another chance at retribution for a very, very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so without further delay, Raven sprung her attack. The chunky little six year old rushed away from the stone and back into clear view of Sofia's minions. Raven sprinted as fast as she could, which wasn't as fast as she had hoped, and raised her palms forward with the intention to push Sofia into the fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men hardly took notice as Raven pressed toward her rival, who stood just on the edge of the fountain. To Raven's delight, Sofia began to bend down slightly, hanging her buttocks high in the air, leaving a big target that the six year old could use to aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this dramatic point in the story, what happened next?</span></div></div>",

She was completely soaked, her skin-tight jumpsuit clinched to her skin, however this was the least of her current worries. Everything to her seemed slightly bigger to her. Although Sofia felt normal with her every movement, she noticed a few major differences in her body. Her once tremendously large breasts had shrunk several bra sizes, her round curves had been reduced, her hair had shrunk noticeably shorter and she was over five inches shorter in height. She slowly climbed back to her feet, with her entire body dripping with the ancient water. She wiped the damp hair from her eyes and was infuriated by her transformation. Ignoring the glaring eyes of the others within her presence, Sofia quickly turned herself around to look at her reflection in the water, however she was shocked by the result. It was her, only several years younger. To be precise, Sofia was now sixteen years of age!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she felt weak and feeble as she stumbled away from the legendary fountain, as her minions simply glared at her in amazement, until she looked down to see the one responsible for this transformation, the one who's plan of retribution did not go according to plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnerved by her every movement, Sofia slowly approached the chubby six year old girl, who stood pathetically within the teenager's shadow whimpering. Raven's resistance was in vain as she quivered under the intimidating presence of her sixteen year old rival, who looked to have flames roaring in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven,\" Sofia addressed the little girl, trying to keep her temper under control, \"There was no need for that, my little porker. You're little plan to teach me a lesson didn't go the way you wanted now did it? You wanted me to be a little girl just like you, but that didn't work did it? I'm still standing tall over you, and I am still your superior.\" At this point, Sofia was now within an arm's reach away from the six year old, who felt humiliated by the failure of her rebellious act. Sofia clutches Raven by the shoulder, slightly pinching the flab as she does so. \"Now we'll have to do something about this now don't we?\" Sofia may be too young to drive legally anymore, but this did not cause her to stop talking down to Raven like the child that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But since you want to be a naughty little porker,\" Sofia continued, clutching at Raven's chunky shoulder, \"I'll have to treat you like a naughty little porker, and naughty little porkers that behave badly have to be punished.\" With that said, a huge lump developed in Raven's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happened next?</span></div></div>",

She was completely soaked, but this was the least of her current worries. Her jumpsuit, of which she used to wear skin-tightly, was too big, too baggy, too heavy and too wet for someone of her stature. She also noticed that she no longer had breasts, instead she had a flat chest. With the jumpsuit dangling from her body, she slowly climbed back to her feet. She was slightly caught off balance upon her first glance of the area since falling into the water. She wiped the damp hair out of her eyes and froze in horror to see that she had indeed shrunk. To her horror, whereas she used to drop to her knees in order to go face to face with her captor, while standing straight, Sofia was just a mere few inches taller than her adversary. Her body frame had also completely changed. She no longer had the breasts, the buttocks, the strength and the fitness that she once possessed. She felt weak and feeble as she slightly stumbled forward. She approached Raven Skye, who was suddenly much more wider than she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sofia looked down at the chubby little six year old, Raven broke out giggling. At that point, Sofia realized that Raven was no longer the only little girl in the group. Sofia looked around in shock to see her minions, all staring down at her in awe. As Raven laughed out loud, snorting occasionally, Sofia looked back down at her in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" The far more skinnier Sofia screamed in anger, \"Look what you did to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Raven giggled obnoxiously, \"I guess it isn't so funny when you're not the only six year old here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven Skye, I will kill you for this!\" The fury in Sofia's eyes were evident. Raven took notice of this and swiftly shifted into a defensive stance. \"What?\" she asked, \"You don't like being on equal terms with me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men!\" Sofia screamed, addressing her minions who crowded around her curiously, \"Kill her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia's order was far too extreme, as she quickly found out, when they refused to take her order.

Debris fell from above as everyone in the area tried to recover. Suddenly a man came rushing into the area screaming. \"This place is gonna blow! Everyone get the hell out of here!\" With that said, everyone broke into a crazed frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the temple began to crumble, Sofia broke into a panic. As all of her former minions rushed toward the exit, they ignored Sofia's plead for help. Raven was already on her way out until she overheard Sofia's cries for attention. The fat girl, struggling to breathe from exhaustion after attempting to escape, turned back around to see the skinny girl, who was sat on the ground in tears. She was a pitiful sight, and Raven could not allow the reign of her greatest nemesis to end this way. And so, in an attempt to save her, Raven headed back, which only made her far more exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Raven returned to help out the skinny six year old, she already almost collapsed from exhaustion. All of this excitement was far too much for a chubby girl like her to handle. It seemed as if Raven's attempt to save her arch rival would have been futile, until they spotted a familiar figure arrive just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Joey Phillips, Raven's old business partner, who came to the rescue of the chubby six year old girl. \"Joey!\" Raven cried out, grabbing his attention. He approached the two little girls upon hearing Raven's call for help. \"Raven,\" Joey said, \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been better,\" Raven replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the girl?\" Joey asked, noticing Raven's six year old peer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Sofia Valda,\" Raven answered, \"She needs our help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Joey picked the two girls up in his arms with ease. \"Let's get out of here!\" With that said, the trio managed to quickly make their way out of the temple ruins, which shortly crumbled to dust. They made it to Joey's private jet and took off. What would hopefully be the last visit that they'd each have to the Fountain of Youth had finally come to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the jet ride home, Raven and Sofia both recovered, but were still in dismay about still being six years of age. Raven left Sofia to get used to being a six year old as she joined Joey for a drink and a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Raven,\" Joey chuckled, \"But you're too young to be drinking Whiskey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Joey,\" Raven replied, \"That's not funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey continued to have a laugh at Raven's expense. \"I must say, Raven. You are one chubby little girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Cut it out! I guess that I ought to thank you though for saving us. But how did you find us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that you'd be too stubborn to take that curse for-granted. I had to keep an eye on you just to make sure that you were safe. When I found out that you were kidnapped by Solitaire, I knew exactly where you were headed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know quite a bit about this curse, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've had a thorough look into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me, Joey,\" asked Raven, \"Is there a way how to restore both Sofia and I to our respectful ages?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey had to think for an answer at that moment, but what was his answer?</span></div></div>",

Intimidated by the adult's presence, the two girls closed their mouths and stepped back, allowing Joey to speak. \"Don't you girls worry,\" Joey added, trying to comfort the girls, \"Everything will be okay.

Since starting in first grade, Raven found it much harder to make friends than Sofia did. Sofia quickly became one of the most popular girls in the school, while Raven would be constantly teased and bullied by her classmates for the years to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being enrolled at the same school however, the girls were both placed into foster families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia was adopted by the Martin family, where her father, Victor Martin, was a successful car dealer and her mother, Bella Martin, was a successful estate agent. Sofia became the younger sister of the twelve year old Georgina Martin while becoming the older sister of the one year old baby Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sofia enjoyed becoming a member of the Martin family, Raven's family was not as glamorous. Ironically Raven became a member of the Phat family. Her father, Michael Phat, worked at the local candy store, while her mother, Barbara Phat, was unemployed. Barbara was heavily obese, but stated that the only reason why she gained all of her weight was to please her husband, who had an unusual fetish of fat women. Raven also had an eight year old sister, named Diane, who was skinny and constantly teased her new sister since her arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey Phillips, after rescuing the two girls from peril in the crumbling temple of the legendary fountain, retired from his career and settled with his wife, Karen, in San Diego, but every so often, he would visit Ruby City to check on his former partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up in school together, as they approached the end of middle school, Sofia Martin, who was one of the girls who would have teased Raven the most, slowly settled her differences with the chunky girl, and would eventually become close friends with her, at least until their high school prom night, where Sofia was crowned as the prom queen along with Raven's long time crush, Simon Daniels, ending their friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter graduating from college, Sofia regained her past occupation as a mercenary, while professionally modeling swimwear as a secondary career. But after receiving an offer to return to the Fountain of Youth, Sofia immediately declined the offer and officially retired from mercenary work and focused on her modeling career, quickly becoming one of the most popular celebrities in the city. Later she would marry her long time boyfriend, Simon Daniels, and would give birth to a healthy baby girl that she named Natasha. While Sofia pursued fame and fortune however, Raven Phat's life did not go as she had hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon graduation, Raven was unable to lose her weight and regain a fit and sexy physique, unlike what she achieved in her previous life. Instead, Raven gained even more weight, and by the age of twenty four, she was officially dubbed by the press as the official fattest woman in all of Ruby City, even surpassing the size of her mother, who quickly began losing her weight. Raven was unable to get any jobs and was unsuccessful in obtaining any boyfriends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sofia was on the cover of every local magazine, and became one of the sexiest and hottest supermodels in the city, Raven gained celebrity status by being the fattest woman in the entire city. She couldn't even walk through the streets without being laughed at, although even a two minute walk was enough to make her exhausted and sweat like a pig. Eventually as time progressed, visits from Joey Phillips became rarer and rarer until by the time Raven turned twenty six she had lost all contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven Phat, believing that her life could not get any worse, could not stand her life anymore. But soon she remembered something in her past. She remembered back to how this catastrophe began, and she realized that everyone was able to start their lives again. Everyone is able to get a fresh new start in life. Raven wanted a fresh new start, and the only way to get it was to return to South America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven's only hope for a new life was the legendary Fountain of Youth...</span></div></div>",

He called the six year old girls to the entrance and the trio made their way through the darkness until they safely managed to return to the glimmering presence of the Fountain of Youth. The beautiful sight, however, had been damaged by the debris of the temple ruins that collapsed from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Raven,\" Joey retrieved the containers from his backpack and handed them to the chubby little girl, \"All you have to do is pour these containers back into the fountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I'll return to normal?\" Raven asked, and Joey reluctantly nodded his head. She could tell by looking into his eyes that he was unsure of the following outcome. But with nothing to lose, Raven did exactly what she was told to do and poured the water from each container back into the fountain, trying her best not to get any water on herself again. The last thing that she needed was to become even younger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joey and Sofia watched on, Raven successfully poured the finally container into the fountain, and immediately she felt a transformation. As a bright, blinding flash flooded the area, Raven could feel her legs growing longer, her clothes growing tighter and her flab beginning to fade. As she felt herself grow more and more, while becoming less fat, she could feel her shorts tightening around her thighs and she felt her shirt rip apart, exposing a pair of big, curvy breasts that gently tingled in the breeze. Once the light faded, Raven held her arms out wide and opened her eyes, delightfully realizing that she was no longer the same height as her partner. She could no longer feel her chunky stature carrying her down. She realized that she no longer was a six year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Raven however, she was still unable to avoid humiliation, as she looked down to see that she had no top on. Although it was a relief to once again feel the weight of her breasts upon her chest, she quickly wrapped her arms around herself, realizing that her breasts were exposed to both her greatest ally and her greatest enemy. As Sofia covered her eyes in disgust, Joey's face grew bright red as he handed a blanket to his naked partner. She wrapped the blanket around herself and smiled in delight. \"It worked!\" She exclaimed in joy. At that moment she embraced the bashful Joey Phillips and passionately kissed him. Upon realizing what she had just done, she quickly released him and shook his hand. \"Thank you, Joey. How can I ever repay you?\" She asked, as Joey looked away bashfully. \"You just did,\" He replied, sharing a smile with the fully restored Raven Skye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching this event unfold however, Sofia Valda, who was still trapped in her six year old body, felt left out and betrayed. Wondering when she would return to normal herself, she caught the attention of the much larger Joey Phillips and asked why she hadn't returned to normal yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Sofia,\" Joey patronized, trying to sound sympathetic for the six year old girl, \"But Raven was cursed, and we just lifted it. She didn't fall into the fountain, unlike you. I'm afraid that you're stuck like this.\" With that said, Joey turned around and started heading back to their jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to accept this turn of events however, Sofia threw a tantrum. \"You liar!\" She screamed as tears flowed from her eyes, \"You just don't want to help me! I hate you! I don't want to stay like this! This is not fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wicked smile upon her lips, Raven turned to the pathetic little girl screaming for attention. She looked into the tear-soaked eyes of her former adversary. \"Grow up shorty,\" Raven yelled at her, \"You'll get over it!\"</span></div></div>",

However this day would not be for a very long time, because first she had to regain the physical abilities that she possessed in her previous life.

I know how much you hate it, but that's what I love about it. You're hating every minute of this, aren't you? I can tell because of the look on your face. You're trying to hide it but you can't.

Noticing Raven behind her, Sofia slightly giggled. \"If all you're going to do is cry like a little baby,\" Sofia yelled at her six year old prisoner, \"Then do it behind that rock!\" Sofia pointed towards a large rock behind the little girl.

She returned to her feet as Joey prepared to set off. The duo managed to escape the clutches of Sofia Valda for the moment, but from the urgency demonstrated by the nemesis, it was evident that they had not seen the last of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they flew high in the sky, inside the small helicopter, Raven, who was overwhelmed to be freed from her tormentor, noticed the irregular direction pointed out on the compass. \"Joey,\" she asked the pilot, \"Why aren't we heading back north?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot smirked. \"We're on our way to Costa Rica. An entrepreneur named Alfonso Lagos is in possession of one of those bottles of water from the fountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so important about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it, don't you? There's a reason why you became six years old again. You were cursed by the fountain itself! Don't you see? Because you stole from the fountain, you lost twenty years of your age. The only way that we can set things straight, and make you your regular age again, is by returning these bottles of water back to the fountain from whence it came!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you knew about this? Then why did you sell them!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I've only sold three bottles. The others are safe in my possession. You have to understand that I had so many offers, I was reluctant at first, but because it took so long for the curse to kick in, I started to think that there was no curse after all, but after I my first three purchases, someone from your school alerted me that you did regress, and that you were captured by Solitaire. We now have to get back those three bottles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the first bottle is in Costa Rica with this Alfonso Lagos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I just hope that he hasn't already used it up yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't surprise me.\" Raven remained silent for the rest of the trip, unwilling to put up with the constant teasing of the pilot, until finally they arrived at their destination. As the sun began to part, they parked the helicopter outside the grounds of a small town. As night fell, the duo made their way to the mansion of Alfonso Lagos, with Raven moaning about Joey's antics along the way. They arrived outside the mansion, and from the bright lights and loud noises booming from the interior, they came to the conclusion that there was a huge party going on at that very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drew closer to the rampage that occurred from within the mansion grounds. As they approached the main entrance, they were immediately stopped by two bouncers, both looking remotely aggressive. \"Alto ah\u00ed,\" one of the blurted as they backed the duo away from the door, \"Que son los invitados?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey replied in the same language. \"Los dos somos buenos amigos de Alfonso Lagos. Podemos entrar?\" Raven felt helpless as she listened to the conversation of the three adults, she was highly distracted by the drunken screams and loud music echoing throughout the huge building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the bouncers then replied to Joey's offer in English. \"I'm sorry friend,\" he said sympathetically, \"But I'm afraid that children are strictly forbidden from attending this party.\" Raven was offended by being called a child, let alone being turned away from a party due to her age, but there was very little that she could do about it. After all, a girl of her current age wouldn't even be allowed out of bed that late at night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little options, Joey and Raven simply turned away, disappointed about their failure, but fortunately they were both unwilling to accept defeat. They were both determined to get into the mansion and take back what they came for. Out of the vision of the bouncers, they both formulated a plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was the next course of action?</span></div></div>",

You're young enough to be my daughter! And since children are restricted from this party, we have hardly any other choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But clearly this is not my actual age! You know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, but you just can't come in because this is your age now! They're not going to believe that this fat little girl is actually a world renowned adventurer in the middle of her twenties, aren't they!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we also want to keep a low profile, correct? In case you've forgotten, you've got a gang of ruthless criminals led by your arch nemesis after you, not to mention the fact that you know the location of the Fountain of Youth. If word of that got out, you'd become one of the most wanted girls in the entire world! You've already seen that people would kill to obtain such knowledge! That is the last thing that we need right now. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven simply stood there, clearly upset by her huge partner's aggression. She pathetically nodded her head, just like any other child who was disciplined in a similar fashion. Realizing that she was upset, Joey immediately apologized and hugged her to make up for yelling at her. \"Alright,\" he continued, \"Are you sure that you're okay with staying out here by yourself?\" Raven nodded again. \"Just don't take too long,\" she replied as Joey made his way back to the presence of the two bouncers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven watched on, helplessly, as her partner managed to get past the guards and enter the mansion. With nothing much else to do but wait, Raven tumbled off her feet and sat on the cold ground. All that could be heard was the loud noises echoing from the huge building. Raven could hardly imagine what was going on inside the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current situation continued to repeat itself through the mind of the fat little girl. All she could think about was how she could succumb to such a low and humiliating predicament. She knew that she would be haunted by the nightmares of her arch nemesis constantly tormenting her for months to come. Her only hope was that her partner could help her out as soon as possible. She couldn't bare to endure the abuse that she suffered in the hands of Sofia Valda for a second time. She just hoped that this mess would be cleared up as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours passed by slowly, and still there was no sign of Joey Phillips or the bottle of water.

Wearing a white mini-dress with fishnet stockings, high-heels and a variety of golden bracelets, with her blonde hair tied over her head, she emerged from the vehicle, surrounded by a pair of bodyguards, intentionally making her way to the present party at the mansion. With a quick glance of her gorgeous face, Raven immediately recognized the pampered woman from her nightmarish childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Stacey Briggs, one of the girls from your old elementary school, who would have abused her at every turn. Raven had the unfortunate luck to share a class with this prima donna, and clearly remembered the things that she had did to her. Raven hadn't seen or heard from her old classmate since they both graduated to separate middle schools, but she was aware that Stacey had become one of America's top models and actresses on the independent scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the now massive actress made her way to the mansion gates, Raven tried to ignore her in an attempt not to be noticed, but with a slight glance, this was to no prevail, as Stacey immediately stopped and looked down on the pathetic chubby little girl. Raven overheard one of the bodyguards address the actress, followed by the elegant voice of her former tormentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait one moment Julian,\" Stacey told her bodyguard, \"I seem to recognize this little girl from somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madame,\" the bodyguard answered, \"With all due respect, I'm not too sure that you would recognize anyone from the streets of this village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense,\" she suddenly exclaimed, her voice echoed in the ears of the little girl, \"I'm certain that I've seen her before. Let me take a closer look.\" With that said, Raven nervously looked up to see the pampered princess looking down at her, investigating her closely. In a voice of disbelief, Stacey jumped to her conclusion. \"My word,\" she blurted, \"My dear, you look very familiar to a girl that I used to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down to the ground in discomfort, trying her best not to make eye contact, Raven struggled to reply to the overwhelming presence of her old classmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what did Raven do? Did she own up and reveal her identity, or did she simply pose as the little girl that she had become?</span></div></div>",

As a false tear trickled down the cheek of the little girl, she nodded her head, agreeing with Stacey's radical opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfuriated, Stacey embraced Raven and raised her to her feet.

With little other choice, Raven had to follow the ridiculously tall actress into the abysmal location that is the mansion. The bouncer immediately recognized the actress without question, but with the chubby little girl holding her hand, she was put to a halt. He questioned Stacey about what you were already familiar with, but with Stacey's charming and flirtatious ways, she managed to slip past the bouncer with a handful of dollars and a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last Raven was in the mansion, but not in the way that she would have liked. Upon entering the mansion, her vision was immediately shrouded with gigantic figures, consisting of various shapes and sizes of both genders, amidst the dark flashing lights and bouncing around the area, like lunatics, to the loud booming music that slightly hurt her fragile ears. Raven started to regret joining the actress on her quest in finding the missing Joey Phillips, but it was too late for her to reconsider. Stacey had already made a promise, and she intended to keep it, no matter what. This was one, if not the only characteristic that Raven had always admired of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that the further she stepped through the sea of drunken lunatics, the more hopeless her quest became. But as Raven started to lose hope, her hand was finally relinquished. Raven tilted her head up to see Stacey already looking down on her. \"Wait here,\" she simply said as she left you alone in the corner of the large crowd. Before she knew it, Stacey had disappeared into the sea of people, leaving Raven all alone once again. Raven cowered in the corner, hoping for a familiar face to arrive and take her away from such a dark and terrifying scene, until a thought came into her head. In a sudden burst of courage, Raven snapped out of her cowardly state and boldly made her way through the crowd with only one intention, and that was to find Joey Phillips and get out of that hellish place once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately Raven found herself lost in the sea of life, finding herself fighting for her life amidst the crowd of drunken weirdos, dancing like lunatics, spilling their drinks and vomiting all over the floor.

The thought of being punished in this way horrified the six year old, but she was even more horrified by the person who would be delivering the punishment. Raven knew that allowing herself to endure such a punishment would be satisfactory to her rival in every way. She knew Sofia long enough to know that she would enjoy every moment of it.

The only thing this fountain of youth was good for was a drowning Raven thought.After what seemed to be the longest ten seconds in her life, the mercs allowed Raven to come up for air.

She knew that within the wreckage hid the legendary Stone of Zeno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously she approached the wreckage. Her presence scared some of the small fish away. As she investigated the exterior of the shipwreck, she noticed an entrance into the interior. Surprisingly most of the interior was still intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as Raven searched the wreckage, something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happened next?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, her line of vision was disrupted by the presence of a fish that was the same length of her shin. However, unlike the other creatures along her path, this one did not seem to budge and clear a path for her to swim. She was clearly annoyed by this, and tried to get by, but to no prevail, as the fish continued to prevent her from getting past, as if it was guarding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven was about to take matters into her own hands, but before she could attempt to do so, she noticed something irregular about the fish. As the fish simply glared at the human, she noticed that the fish was slowly growing. As she looked around, confused by what was happening, she noticed that it was not only the fish that was growing. It is then that she came to a realization. It was not the fish that was growing, it was her who was shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the fish was now begin enough to swallow her whole leg, and Raven was still shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to what extent does this shrinking finish?</span></div></div>",

She could also feel her underwear coming loose until every article of clothing grew too large to be withheld. Before she could be swallowed by her own clothing, Raven managed to wriggle free, exposing a fine, smooth naked body with a perfect pair of breasts and and hourglass figure, and she was astonished that she no longer needed the suit to maintain her breath. She found it particularly interesting that she was able to breathe in such a low depth in the middle of the sea, but at this moment, this was the least of her concerns. As her open breasts bubbled all over the place, she was highly intimidated by the sight that now obstructed her entire view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large fish, the same of which was merely the size of her shin moments ago, was now the size of whale compared to her. She had indeed shrunk so small that she was only a mere three inches big in size, big enough to be swallowed whole by this now gigantic fish. She immediately regretted ever considering any offensive action against the fish, that revealed its huge, sharp teeth, as if it was grinning at perhaps its next victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately, Raven Skye swung around and swam for her life, as the giant fish followed her slowly, seemingly toying with its prey. The wreckage was now at an overwhelming size for Raven to comprehend. She was unable to regain her composure, as long as that giant fish continued to track her down, but there was hardly anywhere safe for her to escape to.

Soon she found herself deep in the heart of a jungle on a small, forgotten and forbidden island in the middle of the western Pacific Ocean. There, Raven fought many a wild animal, dodged many an obstacle and tackled many a puzzle, until finally she was amazed by a tremendous spectacle that stole her attention. Convinced about her latest discovery, she quickly reached into her backpack and slipped out a phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey,\" Raven said on the phone, \"I think I've found it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA masculine voice was heard on the other end of the phone line. \"You've found it? You've found the legendary Temple of Transformation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really have to call it that?\" Raven asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Raven,\" Joey apologized, \"Have you found the Temple of the Totikum Tribe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Raven answered, \"This looks like it. Want me to find a way in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven's suggestion made the masculine voice sound hesitant. \"Don't rush into this, Raven. We don't know what this temple is capable of. The last thing that we need right now is you turning into some sort of wild animal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven chuckled at Joey's remark. \"Thanks for the support, Joey. I feel so much better about being here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Raven, you know I'm only kidding,\" Joey says, trying to encourage the female explorer, \"Just be careful, that's all. I've heard a lot about this temple, including the curse that haunts it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Joey, you really know how to impress a woman,\" Raven said sarcastically, the tone of her voice was that of a relaxed and unconvinced manner, \"And don't worry about me, I'll be fine. It's not like I'm actually going to turn into a monkey or anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Joey says reluctantly, \"Just be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Joey, I won't let you down.\" With that said, Raven disconnected her phone and placed it back into her bag. She then pressed forwards, entering the ancient temple surprisingly unharmed. To her surprise, the front gate was light and easy to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside the temple, with the stone gate closed behind her, Raven's view was completely blinded by the darkness. To overcome the darkness, Raven took out a flashlight from her backpack and lit it up, giving her a brief and short-ranged view of her surroundings. As she slowly crept across the stone floor, her every movement echoed throughout the temple. The dead silence was enough to unnerve even the strongest of minds, but Raven continued to creep forward, moving further and deeper into the dark temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then encountered an obstacle in her path. Presented to her was a choice of three stone doors, each with a symbol engraved upon them. She examined them all carefully. The door to her left held a symbol that resembled some sort of monkey's head while the door in the right held a symbol that resembled a stick figure with something happening to it. Curiously Raven tried to contact her partner, but was unable to receive a signal on her phone from inside the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing under her own accord, what did Raven do next?</span></div></div>",

It transformed into a sword to fit the mortal's needs and was able to fight the enemy forces with confidence and power. From the war, the mortal felt satisfied with their goals, yet worked towards improving the land for some time.

Always stepping into my business with your annoying stupidity!\" Sofia turns to face Raven, ready to take on her hated foe. This time, she hopes to settle things there and now. With her artifact, she crafts a fully-functional rocket launcher and aims at the rock, firing at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit shocked at this display, Raven dodges the blast and rock debris with quick thinking. Pieces of the rock scatter around her as she regains composure and tries to get close to Sofia the best she can. Things may get messy should she become reckless. Quickly, Raven hides behind another rock, only for Sofia to send another rocket at her location. A large blast emerges from the spot she aimed at, spewing rocks around the area. Still, to Sofia's surprise, Raven still lives without much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven knows how dangerous that power can be with Sofia taking charge.

Her rocket launcher disappears, which Sofia uses the power to then creates dual blades. Using them, Sofia rushes at and swipes at Raven, who dodges the attack successfully. Raven continues to be on the defensive as Sofia swipes at her, wishing to cut her to pieces. Having trained most of her life in becoming the best, Sofia continues to prove to be a competent foe for Raven. Although, despite Sofia's skill in sword-fighting, Raven proves to be too agile against her. She continues to evade her death as always. \"Why won't you die, woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not on my to-do list!\" Raven shouts. She quickly grabs one of Sofia's arm and struggles to grab the necklace from her neck. \"Besides, I'm like the hero and Mary Sue to your evil story, so you know what happens next!\" Raven says while grinning through the tension.</span></div></div>",

However before she could make her way inside however, she noticed something strange in the white snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven looked down to see footsteps heading into the dark cavern. Clearly someone has already arrived before her in the search for the legendary ring. This was incredibly bad. Raven knew that she had to be the first to retrieve the ring, or else reality would be altered and she wouldn't even know anything about it! She needed to make sure that such power, if it existed, would have to be kept an eye on. No one is to be trusted in this quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ventured deep into the cavern, with her only source of light being her trusted flashlight, she suddenly heard voices from a distance. Tracking the footsteps deeper into the cave, she noticed that the blinding darkness began to fade. There was no further need for the flashlight as she entered what seemed to be an ancient hall. From the carvings and inscriptions upon the walls, she suspected that she was currently inside some sort of Viking outpost. As she continued to venture forward into the hall, her long trek would come to a halt upon a heart-breaking sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly ducking behind a large stone, Raven's path has been blocked by seeing a group of mercenaries crowding around an altar which possibly held the legendary ring. She glanced over the stone as much as she could, without being seen, only to see that the leader of the group was none other than Sofia Valda, her long time arch nemesis who, over the years, had developed a strange and twisted fetish of humiliating her enemies.

Peering out across the snow covered landscape, she could see the figure of Sofia in the distance, heading away from the cave and into the surrounding wilderness. Fortunately, with all the footprints of Sofia and her men in the snow, Raven\u2019s own tracks had gone unnoticed. It looked like Raven was safe, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was no longer in immediate danger, Raven began to think about what had just transpired. It didn\u2019t seem to make sense. Sofia had just acquired a ring that could warp reality itself\u2026 and she was about to hand it off to someone for a fee?  Moreover, it was easily a three day hike through the wilderness to get back to civilization.

The origin of this piece of history has remained shrouded for centuries, but it was said that this forgotten relic was enclosed in a stone tablet deep in a dark cave on this forbidden island, or so it was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mystery however came close to its discovery. Already Joey Phillips has entered this secret cave in search of this rare item, and with a formidable enemy immediately on his trail. It was a long trip for Joey, who struggled to juggle fighting off the dangerous allies of his adversary with uncovering the clues to the whereabouts of this ancient relic, but finally, after months of fighting and searching, the mysterious Silver Stone of Size was within reach. He would soon realize what it meant to be famous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could attain his dream however, he knew that he had to beat his rival in the race for the stone. Not far behind him in this cave was the mercenary named Scarlett Beauregard, better known by her allies as Ruby. Wearing her usual black skin-tight leather jumpsuit, the red-haired woman was in hot pursuit of Joey Phillips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey knew that Scarlett intended to use the Silver Stone of Size for her own personal gain, but as long as Joey had possession of the tiny emerald gem, the only key to opening the tablet that held the legendary stone, he knew that it couldn't fall into her hands. At the same time, Scarlett knew that she needed to take the tiny gem for herself, but previously she had promised herself not to kill her opponent in the process, as she preferred to see him in a much more desirable state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase was rough and treacherous, but finally, after overcoming several deadly obstacles, both Joey and Scarlett found themselves in the presence of the tablet, perched upon a stone altar, under the beam of daylight that crept into the otherwise dark and gloomy area. Ceasing their combat, they both approached the mesmerizing site. The moment of peace however quickly disappeared as Scarlett attacked her opponent and ripped out the tiny gem from his person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly weakened by the wicked lash that he had just received, Joey Phillips raised back to a vertical stance, only to see his opponent, of whom he had battled with for so many months up to this point, place in gem in the indicated point of the tablet, thus unlocking it. Out of the tablet slipped the legendary stone itself, the mysterious Silver Stone of Size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon the first glance of the artifact, they both flung themselves at the stone, each hoping to become the better of their adversary. One sought to recover the stone and release it to his local museum, while the other sought to use the stone for her own personal gain. The fate of their futures rested upon who would come out of this battle with the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happened amidst this moment of tension?</span></div></div>",

Her foe managed to beat her, even when she tried hard to search for the precious stone. She deserves it, not him, but right now she knows that he will use it for 'good' and 'make sure it's protected from people like her'. That side of him annoys her greatly. \"Darn you, Recoil!

After all, there are more adventures, dangers, and places to see.

From her expertise in being a mercenary, Scarlett has proven to be a great fighter after training hard and mastering different fighting styles to keep her enemies on edge. Often undefeated, Scarlett has chosen to take the fallen enemies under her wing to become strong people to support her, or kill them for their acts against her. To her, it did not matter if her skills aren't recognized that much by many who fear her, for she will prove to be worth being intimidated by when she comes for you or anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout her years, that has been her resolve, her determination to set a goal and see it through. Yet Joey miraculously finds a way to make her lose her cool. Eventually, that item will be hers, as well as any treasure she sets out for. As he makes his way out, Scarlett takes out her transmitter watch. With seriousness, she says out loud, \"Boys, be on the lookout for that wretched Recoil. Take him out, if necessary.\" Hanging up, Scarlett does her best to get back off the ground. Hopefully she can reach Joey in time and snatch the artifact from his hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This time however, the effects of the light started to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a stunning blast from the stone, Joey Phillips was knocked off his feet and momentarily lost consciousness, but as he came back to, he noticed that everything was not as they seemed. He ascended to his feet, realizing that his surroundings were much more distant than he recalled, until he turned back to his opponent, who stood surprisingly tall with a sinister smile upon her face, even though he could barely tell, considering his distance from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joey struggled to regain his composure, Scarlett stepped towards her. The closer she came, the more Joey felt insignificant and pathetic to her superior adversary. It was at this spine-chilling moment that Joey came to a shocking conclusion to this incredible turn of events. Now within an arm's reach in front of his giant enemy, Joey knew that all of the rumors about the legendary stone were true, and unfortunately for him, he had to find out first hand. His head was now level with his opponent's crotch. His clothes may have shrunk along with him, but his equipment was now noticeably too large for him to use. He was now merely the size of Scarlett Beauregard's leg!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this noticeable size difference, Joey struggled to look up into the face of his adversary, with his vision blocked off by the large breasts that hung high above his head. Joey knew that at this size he would not be physical strong enough to overcome his female opponent. In a desperate attempt to escape the wrath of his adversary, he put all of his remaining strength into a single kick against her thick shin. Unfortunately his attempt was in vain, as Scarlett felt nothing but a tiny scratch on her shin, an insignificant sensation that a woman as strong and endurable as herself would not even groan about. Scarlett merely laughed at the feeble attack by her shrunken victim before swiftly lifting her leg and driving her knee straight into Joey's tiny face. The attack was delivered with enough force to knock Joey a few inches away and crash onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey was slightly dazed by the swiftness of the attack, but before he could crawl back to a vertical base, or at least attempt to escape from the scene, Scarlett quickly leaped towards her stunned adversary. She buried her heels on both of her shrunken opponent's wrists, trapping him beneath her ankles, and dropped her buttocks onto his torso, thus rendering him unable to do anything but squirm. All of her weight was pressing down against her tiny adversary, trapping him in a very humiliating positive beneath the buttocks of a woman now over half the size of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joey squirmed under his captor's butt cheeks, Scarlett looked down on her pathetic victim and laughed. \"I'm absolutely enjoying every single moment of this,\" she cackled sinisterly, \"This is child's play! I absolutely adore this stone! Imagine all of the fun things that I could do with it, and think about all the things that I could do to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling as pathetic and insignificant as ever, Joey simply screamed back in retaliation. \"You fat cow,\" he cried, clearly feeling the strain of being crushed underneath the huge, chunky buttocks that his adversary possessed, \"You won't get away with this! Change me back this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarcastically Scarlett took a moment to ponder on his demand, ultimately resulting with a denial. \"You're intimidation is futile,\" she laughed back at him, \"If there's anyone in this cave that should be feared right now, it's me! You're in no position to threaten me now aren't you?\" As much as he hated it, Joey knew that she was correct. As she admired the stone that rested in her hand, Scarlett continued to mock her fallen opponent as she embarrassingly sat on his torso. \"This is just too good, but there is just one thing left to do. Now, what should we do with you? I can't just let you go, even though it would be pretty hilarious to see you in the wild at this size, what would be the satisfaction in that? No, I have to think of something much more satisfying to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelpless, Joey could only wait in horror for his captor's decision.

The forbidden island housed a temple that contained the legendary Mirror of Opposites, which was currently Joey's object of desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery soon he found himself just one stone wall away from reaching his destination, finding one of the most valuable items in the entire world. In anticipation of what he was about to do, Joey reached into his backpack and took out a phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven,\" Joey said on the phone, \"I'm almost there. I've almost found the Mirror of Opposites!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great,\" the feminine voice replied on the other end of the phone line, \"Just be careful. We have no idea what this mirror is capable of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine,\" Joey answered to Raven's concern, \"I'll contact you when I retrieve it. Joey out.\" With that said, Joey placed his phone aside and continued his quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a struggle to open the final stone door, the one door left that was blocking Joey's path to the legendary mirror, but eventually he managed to overcome this obstacle and found himself in a surprisingly light hall. There, in a distance, he spotted a mirror that was the length of his arm, resting upon the crumbling wall in the corner. It was not a tremendous sight to behold, as Joey expected much more from this legendary artifact, but then again, he was not going to complain anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumping his equipment on the ground behind him, he approached the mirror, seemingly mesmerized by the glistening light that bounced off it. Without thinking, he grabbed the mirror and lifted it from the ground, staring at his own reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he glared at his reflection in the mirror, he noticed some minor changes in his appearance. This change suddenly began to alarmingly increase. It appeared that the Mirror of Opposites was living up to its reputation, as Joey began to change in ways that he did not expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what did Joey turn into?</span></div></div>",

She was a cute thing asleep as he was but the hangover coming upon the man was overwhelming he needed an aspirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd some water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we're here for in the first place.\"  Joey said to himself as he walked around the private boat they rented. Their journey had taken the adventuring couple to small uninhabited island in the Caribbean Sea. It didn't show on most maps for some reason but Raven had found a map storied away in some archive that supposedly belonged to Ponce de Le\u00f3n himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDowning an aspirin with some bottled water he heard Raven rouse herself from sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning babe.\" Joey said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night was fun.\" Raven said, \"I felt like some sorority girl a frat party again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fun but we have work to do.\" Joey informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah Recoil.\" Raven hummed from her covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy mid day, Joey's hangover was in full effect and the couple's journey into the forests of the islands was made all the more uncomfortable by it. The promise of the Foundation of Youth would be unreal to him. Fresh water was becoming a new commodity in the world today and if he could get one that was rejuvenating as the myths said, well that would make him a wealthy man indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could buy out Scarlett Beauregard's mercenary company so easily. The look on Ruby's face would be worth this struggle through the jungle alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see that temple ahead right?\" Raven asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" Joey replied, \"You think its that simple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out.\" Raven smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon found themselves inside a temple and indeed they found themselves facing a simple looking water fountain. Large enough for any man to submerge himself in but small enough to fit at the center of the temple's rear end.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joey Philips was sitting on his chair flickering with his lighter, on and out, on and out. Joey liked to do that when he was bored. And how bored he could get up here, sitting in an old rusty warplane with nothing else to do than just watching out of the window looking at the swam covered tranches which looked all the same to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you please stop that?\" Raven said annoyed as she watched over the briefs towards Joey. She knew she should not bring him with her, after all this was the typical kind of behavior he would normally do. But as chance would have it, Joey was the only one who knew where the artifact was to be found. And the one thing in return for the information was to bring him with her. As if that wasn't bothering her, the airplane was. This old rusty bucket was near it's end as it was shaking all even from the slightest of winds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Rayne, you don't need to read through any of those things. This is a mission like any other, we just get inside, grab the doll and then hike out of there.\" Joey said as he then began to throw the lighter up and catching it when it falls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, if it was that simple the doll would be stolen already.\" Raven countered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is, the locals are too afraid to come near it. Afraid it's cursed, we're the first ones to get there in some time. Unless you are afraid too?\" Joey grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are no things like curses, <i>Recoil</i>. It's just the fear attributed to the unknown.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't count on that Rayne, my informant was pretty scared himself and he was a former wrestling champion.\" Joey countered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...\" Raven wanted to say when she heard the speaker in the back turning on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to intrude like that folks, but we're near the landing zone. Best to put on your parachutes.\" The pilot said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey put up his thumb as a sign he heard it and also towards Raven knowing she would have to lay her discussion about curses off for a while. They both grabbed a parachute and put them on. They then waited silently for the red light to flicker and when they did Joey opened the door. Raven looked a little scared about it, but that was probably because of the ground they were to land on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, a little mud won't do you no harm. In fact, it might do wonders for your skin.\" Joey said with his usual grin. Raven frowned at that and quickly shoved Joey out of the plane. While Joey was still laughing she jumped after him. Raven looked at the underground, a little mud he said. Well, they were about to land in one smelly looking swamp. Luckily for Raven though she landed on one of the wooden poles that were still standing around. Joey however was caught in the branches of a tree. Raven had to smile at the sight of Joey in his peril. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Managing so far?\" She said as she casually jumped over to the wooden bridge next to the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, ending up in trees is one of the things I like to do the most.\" Joey said as he was squirming about to grab his knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I don't need to help you? Because I really want to get inside now and the only thing keeping me from it is the sight of you hanging like a fool.\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I could use a tiny bit of help. Provided you can of course.\" Joey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just hold on to something.\" Raven said as she grabbed her pistol and aimed it at the branch. A loud bang happened and the next thing Joey knew he was splashing in the swamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Raven helped him up, he was soaking wet throughout his shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't look like such a sourpuss in fact it might do wonders for your skin.\" Raven said grinning at the sight of Joey liked that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so. When you're so handsome like I am, it won't help as much.\" Joey said as he walked next to Raven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven wanted to say something, but considering they were near their goal she decided to put it off after they acquired the doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is.\" Joey suddenly pointed forward. In the distance Raven could see...a shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? Are you sure you brought us to the right place? That doesn't look like any temple I have ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because it ain't. Voodoo doll belonged to a voodoo priestess, they don't live in big stone temples you know. Especially in areas like this.\" Joey explained. Raven gave him a small punch and then headed faster towards the shack. In front of the shack Raven was looking around to make sure there weren't any booby traps. But Joey simple pushed her away lightly and went straight inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what could happen like that? You could have been killed!\" She asked him angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax if that happened you wouldn't be yammering to me.\" Joey said as he looked around the shack. The place was very musty, it must have not been used in years. A thick layer of dust was covering everything. Joey noticed the table in the middle of the room with a few chairs and a small black box on top of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven and Joey both neared the black box and as agreed they both opened the box. Inside it they found a doll made of straw covered in a black dress. Curious someone grabbed it, but who was it?</span></div></div>",
