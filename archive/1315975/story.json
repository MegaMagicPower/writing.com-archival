            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of explosions could be heard for miles, dust would be seen at great distances and the killer intent was so big that you could actually cut it with a knife. This killer intent has been present for the last couple of hours, no one knew from where it came or from who, no one except a few people in Konoha, one of which was the 5th Hokage, Tsunade. She knew the killer intent could only come from someone filled with a hunger for power and a desire for revenge. The only person that would fill the air with so much killer intent could only be Uchiha Sasuke. The boy had ran from Konoha to join Orochimaru for power, power to defeat his older brother which killed his entire clan except for him. Tsunade feared the outcome of the fight, she knew that Naruto might have reached Sasuke and was trying to bring him back. She also feared how the villagers would react when Naruto would return with Sasuke, she knew the kid had the power to actually bring down Sasuke, she only hoped no one would harm him when he would return to Konoha.<br>\r\nUzumaki Naruto and Uchiha Sasuke where standing on the water in the Valley of the End. The entire terrain was damaged, nothing was where it was before. The two statues that where facing each other where missing parts of their legs. In the missing parts stood Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto was in his first stage of fox form, he had only one tail but he was strong nonetheless, Sasuke was in his second stage of the curse mark. His wings seemed like a pair of hands and his hair had grown a lot. Sasuke glared at Naruto.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is it that you wish me so bad to return home dope?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSasuke-teme, you don\u2019t understand what you are throwing away, you have everyone that loves you back in Konoha\u2026\u201d stated Naruto growling with anger at the cursed Uchiha<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d spat Sasuke<br>\r\n\u201cI mean that you have someone that loves you, people that acknowledge you and most of all you would have a family, anyone in the village would happily become the parents of the last Uchiha\u201d responded Naruto growling at the end. He hated the fact that everyone liked the traitor and seen him as a great person. He was nothing more than a coward and a power addicted maniac.<br>\r\nThe Uchiha let out more killing intent. \u201cYou mean that pink haired bitch?\u201d Sasuke literary spat on the ground. \u201cShe is weak and a fool, and I don\u2019t need weaklings as my family, my only goal is to kill Itachi and revive my clan.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think that anyone would want to be with you after becoming a missing nin?\u201d yelled Naruto<br>\r\n\u201cYou shut up dope, you don\u2019t know how losing family is.\u201d yelled back Sasuke with full rage<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know? You are more stupid then me, you idiot. I can\u2019t believe I promised Sakura-chan that I would bring you back, you are not worth anyone\u2019s attention, but if that would make her happy then I will bring you back even if I die trying.\u201d yelled Naruto with tears in his eyes.<br>\r\nSasuke just laughed at the comment. \u201cVery well then, this shall decide everything.\u201d He started making the all so familiar hand signs and in just a second the Chidori appeared in his hand. Naruto stretched his hand to his left and the Rasengan formed. They both jumped in the air at the same time charging in front. They trusted the two attacks towards each other, the only difference was that Naruto was not aiming for the killing blow, but Sasuke was. Time stopped for a second.<br>\r\n\u201cBaka, go for the killing blow, or else you will die!\u201d yelled Kyuubi in Naruto\u2019s mind. At that the boy smiled sadly inside himself. The fox was right, he trusted his attack for the killing blow. The two attacks met in air, both powerful, neither wishing to stop, a purple sphere formed around them incasing them inside. Sasuke tried to punch Naruto but the punch was parried and Naruto planted his fist in Sasuke\u2019s stomach as hard as he could. The sphere exploded throwing the boys away from each other. They both landed back from where they jumped with a loud \u2018thud\u2019. It was silent then, everything stopped, nothing moving. Then foot steps, a splash, foot steps again and then a voice.<br>\r\n\u201cI said I will bring you back, and so I will, I would have killed you if it wasn\u2019t Sakura-chan that wanted you back.\u201d<br>\r\n(Naruto\u2019s POV \u2013 Approaching Konoha)<br>\r\nI fought with all my powers, I fought using Kyuubi\u2019s help even though I did not wish for it, but I had no choice, I must respect my nindo. I promised Sakura-chan that I will bring back Sasuke. Now that Sasuke is unconscious and I am carrying him home I think that things will change for the better. I can\u2019t wait to see the look on everyone\u2019s faces when they see me walking with the traitor. Mission accomplished, I can almost hear Kakashi and Iruka-sensei calling for me to treat me to ramen, I can almost hear Sakura-chan calling for me and thanking me, I can almost hear the villagers apology for what they did to me all this years, I can almost see baa-chan smiling at me and hugging me, I don\u2019t know why but I always loved to be hugged, it made me feel comfortable inside. But putting that aside, I cannot wait to see the look on my friends faces when they see me carrying the traitor. I can\u2019t wait to hear what the others did in their fight. I know I should be worried for them but I am very sure they are alright and are now recovering. I think I am the last one that came.<br>\r\nKyuubi was right when he told me that I need to go for the killing blow, because of that I managed to stop the Chidori and retaliate. I think I am very happy now, I will finally receive acknowledgment for what I do, I will no longer be called a demon. I will be known as Naruto Uzumaki. But wait\u2026what if they think something else, what if they cherish this bastard that much that they will not acknowledge me and will yell at me. What will it be then? What will I do then? I only hope that everyone sees what I see and that is that Sasuke is to covered in his mind and his revenge shit is crawled in his mind too much for him to ever respect the village. Anyway, I don\u2019t care what people will think as long as Sakura-chan will be there, I know for sure that she will not yell at me, she will be happy and she will thank me, that\u2019s all I need. Yes\u2026that\u2019s all I need.<br>\r\nAs I approached the village gates I saw Sakura, some villagers and a few shinobi at the gates. I was carrying Sasuke on my back and smiling of course, why wouldn\u2019t I? I finished my mission and I brought back the traitor. I was walking faster and was waiting for Sakura to cheer on me but what happened next I was afraid of it.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done to Sasuke-kun?\u201d yelled none other that Sakura-chan. \u201cYou almost killed Sasuke-kun you monster! I can\u2019t believe you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAno, Sakura-chan\u2026I kept my promise.\u201d I tried to say but she just punched me in the face and grabbed that traitor in her arms looking with a worried face at him and throwing daggers at me.<br>\r\n\u201cPromise? This is how you keep your promises?\u201d she yelled and then I saw the villagers approaching.<br>\r\n\u201cLook what he has done to the Uchiha boy!\u201d exclaimed a woman<br>\r\n\u201cHe looks dead. That demon killed the last survivor!\u201d yelled a man and throwing rocks at me. Then everyone started throwing rocks at me. Then, it happened. Sakura got up and started beating me.<br>\r\n\u201cYou monster! Demon! Look at what you did.\u201d she yelled kicking me, at the same time ignoring my injuries including the Chidori one that Kyuubi was barely able to heal it.<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026.Sakura-chan\u2026\u201d I tried to talk to her with tears in my eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you call me Sakura-chan you monster!\u201d she yelled again and continued hitting me. Then realization hit me, I had nothing to do in this place, no one would ever acknowledge me, my friends all hate me, everyone despites me. The only ones that really care are Tsunade, Jiraiya, Kakashi-sensei, Iruka-sensei, old man Ichiraku and his daughter, and Konohamaru corps. Except for that no one else, I was all alone, they all hated me. And then, the most painful thing happened.<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of our village demon!\u201d yelled a man<br>\r\n\u201cGet lost! We don\u2019t need you!\u201d yelled someone else.<br>\r\nThen I saw it, and everything snapped in me. I grabbed Sakura\u2019s leg and made her fall, I got up and my rage took over.<br>\r\n\u201cFine you peaces of worthless shit! I will go! You do not deserve someone like me, for years I strived to protect you and to help you and this is all the thank you I get? The so be it, I will leave and never return. I should have known that you where a waste of my time. Goodbye forever!\u201d I yelled and turned to leave but not before I looked down. \u201cAnd you Sakura.\u201d I said with as much venom in my voice as I could muster. \u201cI hope you will be happy with that traitor, you never deserved all my protection.\u201d and I spat on the ground in front of her, with all the blood that was in my mouth and I turned away and started leaving. Not interested anymore in what the villagers would say, or anyone else.<br>\r\n(Normal POV)<br>\r\nIn the hokage\u2019s office Tsunade was looking out the window, she heard cheers and a party started not too soon after that, she wondered why there was a party. Just a few minutes ago Gaara left after he and his siblings helped the rescue party. Gaara had to leave, for unknown reasons even for Temari and Kankuro, but they let him. Just as things where going good everything turned to bad, Shizune ran in the room.<br>\r\n\u201cTsunade-sama!!\u201d she yelled desperate.<br>\r\nTsunade turned around and looked at Shizune and motioned for her to calm down. Shizune took a deep breath and then said. \u201cThe villagers kicked Naruto out of the village.\u201d<br>\r\nTo say that Tsunade was shocked was too little, now everything worked, why there was a party, why everyone was cheering, they kicked the poor boy out, and they didn\u2019t even have the freaking authority. Multiple veins appeared on her head. \u201cWHAT?\u201d she yelled so powerful that the party actually stopped and everyone now feared. \u201cWhat do you mean they kicked him out?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto brought Sasuke back and Sakura I don\u2019t know what she did but from what I heard for a chunnin that was there she started beating Naruto for hurting Sasuke and then someone yelled for him to leave the village and he left.\u201d<br>\r\nThen Tsunade exploded. \u201cSAKURA!!!\u201d she yelled and stormed out of the office towards the hospital to get all the answers she wanted. Tsunade was dashing through the halls of the hospital fuming, her face was completely red of rage, someone tried to get in her way to calm her down and she punched him so hard he flew through a wall. When she arrived in Sasuke\u2019s room she saw Sakura there taking care of the boy.<br>\r\n\u201cSAKURA!!!\u201d yelled Tsunade from the door.<br>\r\nThe pink kuniochi turned around and greeted Tsunade. The hokage then exploded when she saw that the girl was happy. She grabbed her from the collar and threw her towards the wall.<br>\r\n\u201cHokage-sama.\u201d started Sakura \u201cwhat was that for? What did I do?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d asked Tsunade and veins appeared on her head. \u201cWhat did you do to my little brother? What did you do to Naruto??\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut Tsunade-sama look at what he did to Sasuke-kun.\u201d she said pointing at the boy on the bed.<br>\r\nTsunade looked at the traitor and raised her fist to try and hit him but calmed down and threw her anger towards Sakura. \u201cWhat did he do to him?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe is injured bad and is unconscious.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOnly that?...ONLY THAT?\u201d yelled Tsunade fuming. \u201cDid you at least look to see what injuries Naruto had? Did YOU? I will tell you he had a freaking Chidori hole in his left shoulder and was injured three times more than this piece of shit.\u201d she said pointing towards Sasuke. \u201cAnd you dare hit him like that? You dare do something like that after all he has done for you and this shit hole of village?\u201d yelled Tsunade<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t think. GUARDS!\u201d and three ANBU appeared. \u201cYou are to take this traitor to the prison wing of the hospital to recover, and you Sakura are to think of what you did.\u201d and Tsunade stormed out of the door, she slammed the door with so much force that the wall cracked and the door fell down and broke. The ANBU took Sasuke and disappeared. Sakura just stood there nothing passing threw her head and then she heard a puff, she turned to see Kakashi looking angry.<br>\r\n\u201cI am really upset on you Sakura for the way you treated your comrade, you should be happy he kept his promise and brought back that traitor.\u201d Sakura tried to say something but Kakashi continued ignoring her. \u201cDo you know what the boy always wanted? Do you? He wanted recognition, acknowledgement, and support. That\u2019s all and you treated him like trash, you know what else? You remember your birthday 1 year ago? Well do you?\u201d asked Kakashi this time yelling and she could have sworn that she saw tears forming in his free eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes.\u201d she stuttered<br>\r\n\u201cWell you don\u2019t that\u2019s what I will tell you.\u201d he said surprising Sakura. \u201cI will tell you what happened to Naruto. He came and treated you to lunch, he said he will pay lunch for both you Sasuke and all your friends, ALL your friends. And how do you treat him? You punch him and yell at him, because you thought he wanted to date you. And you are really wrong, I was in a tree at that day looking what you did, you know what happened after you left? WELL DO YOU?\u201d he yelled and this time even harder. Sakura shook her head \u2018no\u2019. \u201cAfter you left Naruto started crying, that\u2019s right he started crying and he opened his jacket and what I saw shocked me, the preset he bought for you, all destroyed. And might I tell you what it was, something made out of glass, really expensive, and you know how much it was? DO YOU?\u201d and again Sakura shook her head. \u201cI will tell you, it cost three years of saving, THREE years!!! But that\u2019s not what gave me nightmares for the next month, no not at all.\u201d Sakura raised her head and looked at Kakashi that was actually crying now for what he was about to say. \u201cThe glass went in his chest, he was picking the pieces of glass one by one out of his chest and bleeding, there were serious wounds and you know what he did? Instead of throwing your present away and going to be healed he stood in the same spot for five hours trying to repair your gift, and was bleeding and he didn\u2019t care, he tried to rebuild your gift and give it to you, when he saw he can\u2019t do it he made a shadow clone which took the gift to bury it.\u201d Sakura just stood there not knowing what to say, she never knew and now everything was being said. \u201cAnd what is worse was the next morning!\u201d yelled Kakashi. \u201cWe had a meeting and I didn\u2019t come, and you know why? DO YOU?\u201d he yelled so powerful that scared everyone that was listening, all the nurses where listening, some didn\u2019t care what happened to the boy but some where feeling remorse and tears where forming in their eyes. \u201cI will tell you.\u201d started Kakashi again. \u201cI stood by Naruto\u2019s side the next day, taking care of him because the whole day he had been unconscious because of blood lost. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t even bother to tell you happy birthday then! You have lost all my respect out of this moment, you should feel outmost ashamed.\u201d and then Kakashi disappeared leaving the girl alone in her world.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I\u2019m not sure how it started. Hell I\u2019m not even sure when it started. But it happened. I\u2019m not exactly pleased. But then again, I\u2019m not displeased either. Lee, as fond of the little green bundle of sunshine that he is, he\u2019s not my type. Don\u2019t you dare say it\u2019s because I believe him to look strange. That\u2019s not it. I deeply admire his hard working attitude, his strength, but believe it or not..He\u2019s dull. Okay I know that sounds really stupid and ignorant since my other teammate is Neji, but he really is dull. All he ever talks about is training, Sakura, beating a genius, and did I already mention training?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t even get me started on Neji. If you think Neji is a silent calm collected warrior, you\u2019re as wrong as seeing your grandparents go at it in your own bed. Don\u2019t ask. I already burned the sheets\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Neji. He\u2019s not as quiet as you think. He\u2019s got one hell of a mouth. He has nothing against putting down others harshly. His sarcastic tongue has even made Gai-sensei bow his head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019ll pick you apart. Shredding you piece by piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of his battles he won through his mouth. That Byakugan of his even makes it easier for him to tear his opponent\u2019s ego to ribbons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll admit it though. I did have a crush on him. Can you blame me? Top of the class, hansom, fiercely strong\u2026 In the beginning I went so far as deluding myself saying every harsh word from Neji to Lee was to spur Lee to work harder. I was such a fool. But he\u2019s mellowed out some. Ever since his fight with\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUzumaki Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts so odd how his name just slides out of my mouth like I\u2019ve known him for so long. Even though I have, but nothing more than a \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cHow you are you\u201d every few months. That does not really equal to knowing someone. Meh.<br>\r\nI think I first heard of his name nearing the end of my first year of a being a Genin. My team and Gai-sensei just came back from the forest after looking for a pendant some old fool dropped. Took a long, long time.<br>\r\n---------------------------------FLASHBACK---------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n\u201cGai-Sensei!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Lee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook!\u201d He pointed to the Hokage Monument. \u201cSomebody painted graffiti all over the Lord Hokage\u2019s faces? Who could be so irresponsible, who could be so reckless who cold be so-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE DOING, YOU IDIOT? GET DOWN FROM THERE AND GET BACK TO CLASS!\u201d Some Chuunin we didn\u2019t know yelled. Sounded really motherly though<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoever he is, he certainly has odd taste in clothes.\u201d Neji said sounding slightly amused, Byakugan activated staring in that general direction. \u201cOrange jump suit, if I didn\u2019t know any better I\u2019d say he was trying to get Gai-sensei\u2019s attention. Someone should tell him he\u2019s got the wrong color.\u201d He finished in a sneer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppressed a giggled. But not at what Neji said, but at what this stranger had done. It made the Monument so less boring looking. It wasn\u2019t that funny but when your old academy class didn\u2019t even have one comedian, and then teamed up with those three, looking at a blank piece of paper was fairly amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giggle turned into a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laugh multiplied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough I was rolling around on the ground with tears coming out of my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGai-sensei had the nerve to look at me funny. I quickly recomposed myself and said, \u201cI think I know who did that. Only one person could have done that\u2026I think his name was Uzumaki Naruto.\u201d Gai-sensei visibly stiffened. \u201cA few months ago somebody had poured water on almost every singly toilet paper in the public restrooms. Even the spares. Everybody was fuming and the name Uzumaki Naruto was whispered all over the place.\u201d I neglected to mention how everyone seem to really detest him for doing something so trivial, and even went as far as calling him a demon. I just thought he did stuff like that all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh Uzumaki Naruto..\u201d Gai-sensei started, \u201cIf you see him say hi to him every now and then. He\u2019s a good kid. Just a tad lonely.\u201d<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------END FLASHBACK-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us never did heed his words. Lee, Neji, and I were walking to our team\u2019s meeting spot and passed by the academy. It was already after 6 pm for crying out loud, but Gai-sensei said it was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t expect anyone to be there but when I first looked to the swing I saw someone, in orange on the swings all by himself. I felt like I knew the person but the name just couldn\u2019t pop up. From what I could see, he had blonde spikes and was wearing a jumpsuit that was a mixture of orange, blue, and white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you say something Lee-kun?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, never mind..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys do you recognize that person by the swings?\u201d As I turned to look by the swings the person vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTenten, what are you talking about? You must be seeing things.\u201d Neji, clearly annoyed. I met him again at the Chuunin Exams. I didn\u2019t notice him. I couldn\u2019t help it. Sasuke-baka was looking so damn hot, who the hell would notice him? He did eventually get my attention. When we first walked right into the first exam room, Neji and Lee decided that going deep into the room with other foreign ninjas was a grand idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose bastards nearly made me wet myself. Like hell I was going to show that though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up you bastards! I\u2019m Uzumaki Naruto and I won\u2019t loose to ANY of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh, I felt weird being the only one laughing but relief washed over when I noticed a few other girls laughing as well. They must have been nervous being around other foreign shinobis as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got my attention again during the written test. When I saw a large number of other people about to raise their hand and quit, he yelled again. His little speech gave those little spineless cowards a confidence boost and ended up having that \u2026woman.. Complaining about how many students were still left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember once believing Sasuke-baka to be cute. In the Forest of Death, that got shot down to hell. Lee, as usual was an idiot and nearly got himself killed fighting those Sound-nin. Before Neji had a chance to step in, Sasuke-baka was glowing purple and had black tattoos all over his body. At first, I thought it was kinda fruity, until he went nuts. The way he attacked and disabled that loud mouthed Sound-nin was horrifying. He even enjoyed it. If there\u2019s one thing I hate more, it\u2019s anyone enjoying hurting other people. Its one thing to do your job, but you know you\u2019re going a bit overboard when you enjoy doing things like that. I then spotted Naruto on the ground unconscious. I had this weird squirmy jerk deep down, but I shook it off and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Neji was fighting in the preliminaries.. Naruto\u2026He stood out again defending someone be didn\u2019t even knew that well. Never remembered anyone, let alone Naruto defend Hinata. I thought it was sweet. Gai-sensei was over there crying muttering something about why couldn\u2019t Naruto have been on his team instead of Neji. Men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I was actually agreeing with him for once. Neji was so cruel in that fight\u2026 Poor Hinata..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were the finals. I felt so sorry for him. Someone so spirited to get pitted up against Neji of all people. I felt guilty for helping Neji develop the Kaiten, but since I didn\u2019t know Naruto all that well I helped him anyway. Besides, I was still fairly infatuated with Neji at the time. But that gradually disappeared. I didn\u2019t even get a thank you for my help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little hard watching the fight. Naruto couldn\u2019t even lay a finger on him. I\u2019m pretty sure everyone gasped when they figured out Naruto\u2019s clones weren\u2019t normal ones. They were solid. Hell, I was so jealous. That\u2019s supposed to be a kinjutsu! How could he have learned it? Anyway, I guessed Neji was getting bored with just pummeling him so he used his blood limit\u2019s specialty. After I saw him get into that stance I didn\u2019t pay much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when I thought it was all over..So what I doubted? That wasn\u2019t the first time Neji did that. Everyone he did that to, they couldn\u2019t even stand, let alone fight. Naruto had done the impossible. He summoned chakra, bizarre chakra at that, even though Neji closed up his Tenkutsu points. I was baffled. I couldn\u2019t even ask Gai-sensei, the weird old coot wasn\u2019t ever around when I wanted him to be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock and frustration was so much, I didn\u2019t even realize Naruto managed to heal all of his cuts and bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he got fast. Real fast. I didn\u2019t even see a blur when he moved. I then spotted Naruto rushing Neji head on. I was thinking it was all over, getting knocked with one of his Kaitens that close was a one-hit knockout. After the huge explosion, it looked like Neji won. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground seemed to just spit up something orange and you could barely make out Naruto knocking Neji in the chin. And won. With one hit! How unbelievable is that! After staring at them with my mouth hanging out for God knows how long, I was expecting Naruto to start rubbing it in. But..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn\u2019t gloat. He didn\u2019t look at Neji with disgust, or trashed talk him while he was down. He just pranced around like a little kid, like he just got invited to a party or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fell for him right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think. Emotions are difficult things to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was because of his strength? His dorky personality? He is rather funny. You don\u2019t see too many shinobi with a sense of humor now days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tend to get perverted. Or just plain twisted. Meh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as time grew on I grew subtly more obsessed with him. Okay maybe not obsessed, but definitely more attracted to the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy greatest hero, Tsunade-sama, was brought back to Konoha to become Godaime. Rumor was it that Naruto had been traveling with Tsunade-sama\u2019s old teammate Jiraiya just to go look for her. I didn\u2019t believe it until I saw Naruto walking with him and Tsunade-sama. She even looked fond of him, it was brief and disappeared as fast as it appeared, but I saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that did was make me yearn for him more. All those \u201cDead-last\u201d remarks seem so stupid now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould a \u201cdead-last\u201d looser be traveling around with two sannin? Jiraiya was probably training him too. He was already strong.. Just how strong would he get with Jiraiya training him? Jiraiya was the one who taught Yondaime after all\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next couple of days was a blur. Well, not really, I managed to befriend Shizune. That\u2019s a plus. Big plus. Still, it was really confusing that week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last Uchiha defected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon\u2019s fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust who the hell was the demon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUzumaki Naruto?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLies\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s not a demon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetrieval mission?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT BUM MADE CHUUNIN?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHE\u2019S LEADING THE SQUAD?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMission was a failed sucess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI learned all that in one day. It gave me a damn headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was loitering around the gates when it was suddenly opened to admit Kakashi with something orange and red on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart skipped a beat when I saw him. He looked dead to the world. The red I saw was blood all over him. With a feeble squeak, and berating myself for my Hinata-like behavior, I bolted to the hospital. I remembered Neji being brought here earlier so I thought I\u2019d visit him, at least that was the reason I told myself I was going there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the hospital, I spotted Shizune-san. She looked extremely tired. Slumped on the couch like that, you\u2019d think someone told her that her mother died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTired?\u201d I asked softly. She wasn\u2019t exactly sleeping, but I think I could have gotten away with giving her the finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo a certain extent, yes.\u201d She retorted, a bit snippy I might add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured her hand towards the empty seat besides her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit.\u201d She droned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t have the heart to say no, so I complied. I didn\u2019t know what to say, having not knowing her for long, but the silence was comfortable. Shizune turned towards me and was about to speak when Kakashi busted through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune immediately stood up and ran over to Kakashi, who was talking to some nurse. I didn\u2019t want to seem rude so I stayed put. Kakashi must have said something rude since the nurse looked really annoyed. Shizune was eavesdropping on the conversation and looked like she was about to hit the nurse..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat sort of nurse are you!\u201d With that, she took Naruto from Kakashi and stormed off to the upper floor rooms. I tried to follow but that damn receptionist wouldn\u2019t allow it. But me being me, I simply placed a Genjutsu on myself to look like a doctor and walked passed her. She didn\u2019t even give me a second glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. Just great. I don\u2019t know what room he\u2019s in. I nodded to a few nurses and doctors until I spotted Shizune walking out of one of the rooms. I was just about to walk in when Tsunade and Sakura rounded a corner. I hadn\u2019t spoken to her yet, so you can\u2019t blame me since I was staring at her slack jawed. She noticed me staring but ignored me and went in. I\u2019m pretty sure she saw through my genjutsu, but I guess she was too busy to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI checked Naruto\u2019s clipboard on his door read he was fine. I breathed a sigh of relief. Right when I dropped the disguise I bumped into Gai-sensei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Tenten. Visiting your teammates? If only those too fireballs could be as supportive as you.\u201d He sighed and walked off before I could even respond. I glanced at a clock and grimaced. It was well over 9:00pm. I found Neji\u2019s room simply enough, but the guy was asleep. With a yawn I decided to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegretted like hell the next day. It\u2019s the day..He..Left..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning I vowed to at least speak to him. On second thought, I better visit my own teammates first since I didn\u2019t even talked to either of them yesterday. I remembered what room Neji was in so I just asked a nurse nearby to make sure he was in. I let myself in the door and stifled a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji never looks content, yet there he was, lying in the bed without a care in the world. He hasn\u2019t even noticed me yet! Or at least, it seemed like it..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d I ventured, afraid I might take him out of one of his \u201crare\u201d moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy left part of my body is numb. They said it is an after effect of the healing seals they used.\u201d He still was looking rather content, and he still hasn\u2019t looked at me yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Seen Lee around? Is he alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe went somewhere with Gai-sensei. He\u2019s doing fine as well.\u201d He finally looks at me, with a hint of a smile there as well. About bloody time, if you ask me. Rude to not look at someone when they\u2019re talking to you. I guess I can forgive that though, I have no idea what sort of fight he went through\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long are you gonna stay in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiashi-sama is supposed to pick me up soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned. \u201cMister Top Rookie needs to be taken home by his uncle?\u201d Neji flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Tenten,\u201d He hesitated, not exactly sure what to say next, \u201d\u2026 I won\u2019t be with the team often this year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? Why, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing is wrong. Hiashi-sama is just taking me under his wing for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. You\u2019re still going to do lame old missions with us, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe changed positions so that he was sitting up and staring blankly at the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make it seem so depressing. It\u2019s not as if you\u2019re going to leave the village or something.\u201d If he was, I vowed to kill him on spot. Leaving me alone with Gai-sensei and Lee. Grr..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may not be leaving, but someone I know is.\u201d He turns to look at me, with an annoying smirk stretched across his face. \u201cUzumaki, Naruto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s WHAT!\u201d I nearly fell over. Byakugan or no Byakugan I\u2019m so going to squeeze the life out of him if he\u2019s just jerkin\u2019 around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowns. \u201cI thought you knew? You still might be able to catch him.. before he leaves. He could still be at the gates..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might have said something else, but I was already out the door. Now that I think about it, it was in a small tiny way, funny. It took me three weeks later to realize that he knew I got over him and knew who was currently running in my brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile running, my traitorous mind kept telling me I was stupid. Chasing some guy who most likely doesn\u2019t even remember my name. Neji seemed like a new person. You should still be all over him. Stupid brain. There is no point in pining after someone with little to no feelings towards you anyway. It\u2019s just a waist of time. Besides, guys like Naruto were one in a million. By the time I got there I was too late. He\u2019s gone and for who knows how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the rest of the day moping around with Lee and Gai-sensei. I didn\u2019t really show it, we\u2019re supposed to do that anyway, but it felt so weird giving a fake smile to everyone.. Working with Gai and Lee was cruel. Overly cruel. I had to drag myself home. I appreciated Neji\u2019s company hell of a lot more after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents left an official looking letter addressed to me on my table. I scanned it and there was supposed to be a meeting with Godaime next week. The letter didn\u2019t say what it was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\nI arrived at the meeting early. There were a large number of people here. Most of the Genins, about half of the Chuunins, and about a third of Jounins, and higher ups. I even saw some normal civilians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spotted Lee in the crowd and walked over to him. Who could miss him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh Tenten-chan! Glorious morning, is it not?\u201d Loud as usual. Its good to know some things never change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure thing Lee-kun..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t see Tsunade-sama around so I got bored rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTenten, wake up! Hokage-sama is about to speak.\u201d Lee whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was instantly awake. When did I dose off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning everyone. Lets get straight to the point, shall we? I know of the rumors spreading like wild fire, and quite honestly, it\u2019s irritating to hear them. As you all know, last week there was a retrieval mission for a defected nin. With experienced shinobi low, I was forced into sending a team consisting of a newly selected Chuunin and four Genins. Though they were all handpicked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allowed the crowd to murmur a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the last moment, Sand\u2019s peace offering arrived in the form of three of their top Genins. I sent them to aid them as well. Without their help, there is no doubt that we would have lost some of the village\u2019s most promising shinobis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore murmuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleared her throat. \u201cThe defected nin was none other than Uchiha Sasuke. He left with four sound nin escorts. Not Uzumaki, Naruto. Uzumaki was part of the team sent to retrieve him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ludicrous! This Uchiha is nothing like his brother! This one even saved us from Shukaku the Sand Demon during the Sand and Sound attack! Its that..that..Uzumaki! He must have done something to delude the Uchiha!\u201d Yelled a Chuunin, a large number of other people agreed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to smack him. So rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a muffled scream. All eyes was on the disrespectful as the Chuunin was choked to death by ..sand? I gasped, Gaara?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANBU looked ready to attack but Tsunade-sama waved them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara was nonchalantly staring at the offending Chuunin. Still as intimidating as ever. How the hell did I not notice him before? Looking at him, he was dressed pretty normal. White long sleeved shirt and black pants tucked at the ankles. His siblings held a look of disgust on their face. It wasn\u2019t directed at Gaara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaara, put him down.\u201d To be honest, Tsunade-sama didn\u2019t look mad at him. It\u2019s as if she forced herself to say that to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUchiha Sasuke cannot and did not defeat me.\u201d With that he calmly walked out, siblings in route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee raised his hand. Tsunade-sama nodded towards him. \u201cHokage-sama, if Uchiha did not defeat Gaara, who did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee for yourself. Complimentary of Jiraiya of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a scroll, unraveled it, did a few hand seals, and suddenly a picture showed from the scroll. Almost like a projector. You could tell you were looking through a scope of some sort from the way the boundaries was set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched in silent horror as Gaara transformed into some sort of brown ugly thing. Everyone gasped when Sasuke, with those freakish black tattoos struck Gaara in his right shoulder with the Chidori and shake it off like it was a fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when it looked like Sasuke was done for, Sakura appeared which made Gaara distracted enough to get a fist slammed into him by Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara swiped Naruto away and slammed Sakura into a tree. This seemed to really piss Naruto off. They were talking, but we couldn\u2019t hear. It was a tad frustrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear I saw the council, Kakashi-san, and Tsunade-sama smile when Naruto poked Gaara in the ass with a kunai and literally blew his ass up when the explosive note went off. Neji smirked. What a second, when did Neji get here? Must have been when I dozed off..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t take anyone hostage when I fought him.\u201d He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone who heard gave a nervous but genuine laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee kept staring with his mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kicked him in the shins. \u201cLee-kun that\u2019s rude!\u201d I pointed at his mouth. He complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else visibly cringed. Hell, I did too, that had to have hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara must have said something to piss Naruto off again. The Kage Bunshin was already an amazing feat already, but to have made THAT many was astonishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the pounding those clones did, Gaara did the unthinkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view changed and we were now all staring at someone\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit. I better go help.\u201d That someone said. Must have been Jiraiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh..Maybe not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perspective shifted again and we were all staring at a huge cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a lot of gasps in the crowd. Wasn\u2019t all that surprising really. There aren\u2019t too many in the world that can call themselves a summoner. I was more than impressed to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji stiffened. \u201cHe was holding back..\u201d He whispered. He took a deep breath. It must have been a major blow to his ego to go all at it at someone to not only get the shit beat out of you, but to know they weren\u2019t even using their full potential? Ouchies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Kakashi-san\u2019s eyes widened a bit. Why would his own sensei be surprised of his own pupil?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya said something again. \u201cSheesh. Gamabunta two times in a row.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were startled gasps again. Wasn\u2019t it Gamabunta the toad boss that helped Yodaime defeat the Nine-Tails?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing to see the summoned toad battle it out with Gaara. What happened next I doubt anyone saw it coming. The toad transformed into the Nine-Tails. I thought it was just a regular fox at first, but its hard to miss nine swaying tails. No one knew why until they saw it bite and dig into Gaara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto leapt off the transformed toad and gave Gaara a savage blow to the head that should have put him back into unconsciousness after waking him up, seeing what it did to Neji after all..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA head butt later, the scrolled sealed it self-back up and the lights were turned back on. Didn\u2019t even notice it was turned off in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we got that cleared up, leave, I know the villagers took it upon themselves to exile Naruto.\u201d Tsunade-sama stated, then turning to glare at those idiots from before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!\" I couldn't stop myself, Who could blamb me? The village tossed Naruto out for getting in Orochimaru's way! Once everyone was gone, I stayed behind.  I was pissed.  Naruto was gone\u2026. I was even more flustered when after seeing how powerful he actually is, some people resented him even more. I hate people with ego trips like that. Tsunade-sama  put a hand on my shoulder, and I knew this was important<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TenTen...I know how you feel about Naruto. so I'm geving the job of getting him back to you.\" Tsunade-sama said, two minutes later, I was walking out of the village gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"  someone asked, I turned to see a weird-looking guy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is TenTen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Raiden.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Who are you?\" Naruto asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are the Elder Gods.\" one said to him \"We require your aid, we have been observing you for quite some time now, Our enemy is called \"The One Being\", a single councousness that aims to unmake all life to insure it lives up to its name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll help you.\" Naruto said, knowing that if this One Being and those that fallowed it succeded, all existance would ceacse to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Naruto. Before you begin your quest, you should know that there are more than one realm. In order they are: Earth-realm, Neather-realm, Outworld, Chaos-realm, Order-realm and Edeinea, Take care.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the elder gods sent Naruto to Seido, the Order-realm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he got there, Naruto heard something that sent chills running down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darrius, our Master Plan is compleate, all we need do is inact it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Darrius said \"Soon Seido's laws will spell its undoing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of Hotaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He cannot stop what he dose not understand, our plan cannot be stopped without seeing and understanding our Master plan.\" Darrius said coldy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto fallowed Darrius and the others with him and, as soon as he had a clance, snatched the plans. Darrius gave a cry of alarm and outrage at the unfimilare theif and chased him. Naruto spotted some of  the guards of Seido and ran up to them, out of breath and despratly trying to tell them of the plan to overthrow Seido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's....Hotaru? I...Have...something important...to tell him about...what Darrius is up to.\"  The guards nodded and soon Hotaru stood befor Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Hotaru, Sir, I found out that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in obstruction of the laws of Seido, Toss him into the Neatherrealm!\" Hotaru said and his guards obeayed him and Naruto, kicking and screamin that he could explaine, was tossed into a red portal. As soon as he landed he saw some gastly creatures, they looked human but had ugly faces, spikey jaws, and blades protruding from they'er wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well. Lokk what we have here. You look like you have never seen Tarkata before, so allow us to teach you of our kind.\" one said. A while later, Naruto was hanging from a giant skull by ropes made of flames and the Tarkata stabbing at him with they're blades, trying to get him to scream, but he just grit his teeth and bared the agony, it wasn't all that diffrent from how he was treated back in the Leaf villagewhen he was five, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes became hours and the Tarkata were starting to get bord. Suddenly a figure in yellow lept seamingly out of nowhere and begain to fight the Tarkata, breaking lims and crushing skulls in they're wake, Naruto caught a glimps of whoever it was and his heart lept, the one who was fighting his tormentors looked like a...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy mere chance, The Shirai-Ryu warrior, Scorpion had seen what the Tarkata were doing, as he reconized the figure they were \"amusing\" themselves with, his rage flaired to life. it was only a young boy! He jumped in among the Tarkata's rank and proceaded to slaughter the vile creatures, if they enjoyed death and torture so much, they deserved this. Scorpion caught the eye of the boy and in that instant, felt like they knew the other was an ally, Scorpion finished off the last Tarkata and took the boy down. He had passed out due to blood loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get you out of here.\" Scorpion said and took a way out of the Neatherrealm only the Shirai-Ryu knew of. He emerged in the territories of the Shirai-Ryu clan. For days, Scorpion nursed the boy back to heath, he was aided in this by an unknown power, a red energy that seemed to come from the boy's body, but didn't belong to a human. Scorpion then looked into the boy's memory, and her gasped in shock. This boy was a ninja-in-training?! He learned of Naruto's, as the boy was named, training habbits; that he worked until he passed out and got right back to what he was doing when his streanth returned, his past, that he drew upon the streanth of those that protected what the cared for frequently, the promise he made to Sakura, the battle at The Vally of the End, how the villagers took it upon themselves to banish him. Scorpion was surprised to learn of the Nine-Tailed Fox sealed inside of the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto would make a fine member of the Shirai-Ryu.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he didn't-know-how-long, Naruto awoke to see the ninja who saved him looking down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Do you want to continue the path you've chosen?\" he asked, Naruto didn't need to know what this man ment and nodded, he new teacher first taught him the  <br>\r\nHistory of the group he was going to be part of. The Shirai Ryu was formed many years ago by a Lin Kuei warrior named Takeda. He eventually grew tired of the Lin Kuei and left the clan. However, leaving the clan is punishable by death, and Takeda was sought after by Lin Kuei assassins. He left China and returned to his homeland in Japan, where he offered his services to the lords and generals. His art gradually spread throughout Japan and developed into the art of ninjutsu. In addition to teaching his new art form, he also taught modified versions of Lin Kuei tactics, as well as revealing many of their secrets. This only further infuriated the Lin Kuei when Takeda's teachings became well-known with many followers throughout Japan. His followers became known as the Shirai-Ryu. The Shirai-Ryu and Lin Kuei became tremendous rivals. Takeda's clan mocked the Lin Kuei by dressing in similar outfits of yellow color and teaching modified versions of their own secrets. He managed to avoid many assassination attempts well into his later years. He was eventually killed by poison in his tea. It was never known if Lin Kuei was responsible for his death. The animosity between Lin Kuei and Shirai-Ryu continued after his death, as the Shirai-Ryu became more prominent. Naruto traned under Scorpion for months, and the later was stunned at the boy's growth in the was of the Shirai-Ryu, he fought well with his jutsus from the village hidden in the leaves and the Nine-tailed fox's power, both added to his training under Scorpion making him a force to fear. Soon, Naruto was a full member-in-training and wore the Shirai-Ryu uniform with pride in his progress.  He still had to compleate his training, but after receving his teacher's premission, took time off his training to find new member of the clan and test his skills out in the real world.                   </span></div></div>",

I have someone who has need of a favor from you.\" Raiden called,   Bo' Rai Cho came out and greeted Raiden and TenTen warmly.

Then she remembered Naruto and grinned, he was the same as Bo' Rai Cho in the respect that if you thought they couldn't beat you because you though they were weak, you would wind up eatting turkey through a straw. TenTen caught a wiff of  Bo' Rai Cho and her grin vanished.<br>\n<br>\n\"And judging from the smell of you, you use the  Drunken Fist a lot.\" TenTen said, scrunching her nose up and pinching her nostrails shut. <br>\n<br>\n\"I do.

Bet I can hit it with my eyes closed.\" TenTen said. She closed her eyes, pulled her Leaf-Village headband over them, and turned around as she pulled out a senbone.  Bo' Rai Cho   and Raiden watched as TenTen threw the needle and the fly she was talking about was killed, but the wings and legs were  compleatly unharmed. Bo' Rai Cho was impressed.<br>\n<br>\n\"Girl...what is your name?\" <br>\n<br>\n\"TenTen.\" she answred ans she turned around, lifted her headband, and opened her eyes.<br>\n<br>\n\"Well, TenTen, The Wrath Noob Sibot has been causing trouble for this village, if you can defeat him and his ally Smoke, I will help train you so you can find Naruto.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Deal.\" TenTen said and went off the beat Noob Saibot to a pulp.
