While the crew runs around in a shock, you quickly notice a few things, like all the studio technology seems old, also there are no computers in the studio, and this crews fashion seems way out of date too. It was almost like you were trapped in it the late 1970\u2019s or something. You are still dressed in your normal, early 21st century style clothes, a t-shirt, and dark blue jeans, as you watch the TV screen, wondering what is going on. On those old analog screens located all around the studio, you see various news reports from around the city, stories of looting, martial law, and murder. You also see on the bottom of the TV screens, a list of places, called rescue stations. As a confused, and tired seventeen year old female intern hands you a cup of coffee, you realize that you must be dreaming, or somebody spiked your lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In a state of shock, you finally realize that you are in the studio, the opening scene of the movie dawn of the dead. You nearly drop your coffee, as you watch the bearded government official, and the black talk show host arguing over how to deal with this problem. The problem of the dead returning to life, and eating their victims. Curious at first, you naturally look around the set in aw, as it is announced that the emergency stations are coming on line. You also watch the armed Security Officer picking up his jacket, and leaving the studio, along with several of the crewmen. Then it suddenly dawns on you, you are in a large, strange city, with no place to live during a zombie outbreak, not a very good scenario to be in, you think to yourself. You decide too\u2026   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you drive up to a joint military, police checkpoint, Jill hands the military guard her papers, and he waves you both on threw. The guard never asks you for your papers. As she drives you threw the city, towards her shelter, you wonder where all the zombies are? You haven\u2019t seen a thing sense you\u2019ve been here. Just then, out of nowhere, a zombie banker and a zombie security officer come crashing into the car next to you.

It was late at night...or early in the morning since it was nearing 4:00 A.M. I was merely sitting in my reclining lounge chair, watching a movie, when I began to doze off. But when I finally came to, I was no longer in my living room! Instead of in my reclining chair, I was in a coach air-plane seat. I was sitting in the isle-side. I was very confused! I finally saw the Stewardess passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss,\" I asked her politely. When she turned toward me, I asked, \"Where is this flight headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For Tokyo, Japan, sir,\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tokyo?!\" I was in complete shock. How is it that from the time I fell asleep to the time I woke up, that I could be taken from my home and put on a flight to Tokyo, Japan? \"There must be some mistake, I'm not supposed to be here. I don't even have a ticket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be silly sir,\" she said. \"I remember seeing you enter the plane, you put the ticket in your coat-pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit shocked by what she said. But I was wearing a coat; a long trench coat. It only added to the confusion as I didn't go to sleep with one on. And she told me that I had willingly stepped onto the plane with a ticket? Was I sleepwalking? But regardless, I checked the breast-pocket on the inside of my coat and sure enough, there was a ticket. It was for Tokyo, Japan alright. It was getting creepier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go,\" she said with a smile as she patted my arm. \"Are you feeling alright, do you need some help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I do...I have no memory of being here,\" I said. I didn't even have enough money to buy a ticket for Tokyo. I didn't have a car to get to the air-port with. \"I think maybe I need to see a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're over the Pacific Ocean now,\" she said. \"We'll be landing in Tokyo shortly,\" she then laid a hand on my shoulder and said, \"Try to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid back in my seat as she walked away. I was trying to remain calm, so I took slow and steady breaths. The plane was so quiet that I could hear the engines outside. It was so eerie...just how did I get here?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you have no idea what you're doing here,\" the man to my left said. \"Is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over to him; he was sitting in the middle seat and the window-seat was vacant. I didn't seen his face, he was reading a newspaper. I was a bit curious as to why a complete stranger would ask anything of me. And exactly, who was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for eavesdropping, but I couldn't help but overhear the statement of your bout of amnesia,\" he said. \"It's strange, I saw you board the plane yourself and you've been sitting in that seat the whole time, until you fell asleep. So, you've no idea how you got here?\" He suddenly folded the newspaper and said, \"That's too bad, but it'd make an interesting story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally got my good look at him. To my surprise, he looked just like the actor Raymond Burr. But he died back in 1993, so I didn't think he really was him. Besides, he looked way too young, almost like Burr did when he played the role of Perry Mason. I began to think that there was another role that Burr was famous for, but I couldn't remember what it was. But now wasn't really the time for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve Martin,\" he said extending his hand toward me. \"Reporter for United World News.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took his hand and shook it. The name Steve Martin was familiar. Oh, I suddenly remembered it; Steve Martin, the comedian and actor. But the Reporter for United World News-part sounded familiar as well...I felt like I knew a reporter named Steve Martin. I chuckled lightly - this man definitely did NOT look like Steve Martin. I suddenly realized that I was silently shaking his hand while he waited for my name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Sean...Sean,\" and that's when I realized that I couldn't remember my own last name! \"I guess I don't remember my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, it's all just slipping away isn't it?\" he said. \"What's the last thing you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was sitting in my home in my chair, watching a movie, and I woke up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were watching a movie in your home?\" he asked. \"What - do you live in a Theater?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought he was joking, so I chuckled before saying, \"I wish.\" I had no idea that he was definitely serious, and expected an answer. I was about to continue my explanation, when suddenly my eyes started hurting. I saw the color around me and Martin disappear and everything went black and white! It happened for a moment or two before everything went back to normal. I held my hand over my eyes and said, \"Gah, I think I'm going color-blind. Everything went black-and-white there for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Color Blind? Amnesia? Those can be considered symptoms of severe head-trauma. Do you think you could've been hit over the head?\" Martin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my head doesn't really hurt. And I don't feel any bumps or bruises,\" I said as I passed my hand through my hair. \"But man, I'd rather not think about this, it's just gonna worry me.\" I tried changing the subject. \"So, where are you headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cairo, Egypt,\" he said sitting back in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was silent for a moment. \"Um, Mr. Martin,\" I began. \"You do know that we're on a plane headed for Tokyo, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it was the only flight that I could get. I'm making a quick stop-over in Tokyo and then I'll be on another plane to Cairo.\" He began unfolding his paper again to read something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat back in my seat for a moment and thought. Everything he said shocked me; a trip to Cairo with a Stop-Over in Tokyo, Japan, sounded so familiar to me. Perhaps I'd read a book about a similar incident, I thought. Aha! I remembered, 'Cairo via Tokyo.' I couldn't remember who wrote the book, or even what it was about - I guess my memory was worse than I thought. all I could remember was that it involved some kind of disaster in the Japanese city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boss is sending me to Cairo to do a report on a story,\" he continued as he read the paper. It pulled me out of my thought and I looked over to him. I suddenly saw the date on his newspaper. It made my eyes go wide with terror. October 31st, 1954!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what was going on here?! First you wake on a plane for Tokyo, with a ticket that you quote-unquote \"bought\", with no memory of how you got here, riding next to a guy who looks like Perry Mason, with a Comedian Actor's name, and he was reading a paper from the 50s?! - Wait a minute - as I said that statement in my head, I thought about it, and it made sense. The paper was probably FROM the 1950s. Martin was probably using it as a reference, or for research, or other reporter stuff. I was a bit relieved - if I was in the 50s, how was I gonna get Back to the Future? Haha! I was about to ask Martin what he was doing with it...when he spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided on the flight so I could have a social-call on an old College Friend of mine. He's a famous scientist in the Far-East, perhaps you've heard of his research; Dr. Serizawa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in my mind snapped, and my focus stood at attention after he said that name. I was trapped in completely unbreakable focus. Dr. Serizawa - I remembered where that name came from; only one place. With an American Reporter named Steve Martin on his way to Cairo with a Lay-Over in Tokyo, acquainted with a Dr. Serizawa, in 1954, the details were too perfect to be coincidence. But it was impossible! I couldn't be HERE!!! But it strangely made sense, Martin looked just like Raymond Burr did in the 1950's!!! I pinched myself; perhaps it was all a dream. But the pinching didn't work...so I tried harder, and harder until my fingernail had cut my arm. I was bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarin was wondering what I was doing. He asked me if I was alright...I didn't answer. I was too focused on where I was. I only said this as a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I move to the Window-Seat for a moment? I'd like to...look out the window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin stared at me like I had asked him if his tie tasted like mustard. But eventually he stood up and allowed me to move to the window seat. I peered through the window and saw the Pacific Ocean down below us. I didn't why I thought I would find what I was looking for; we were 10,000 feet above it. And plus, it was probably happening in the South Pacific. But something in my gut told me that it was happening. Something bad was going on down there. And if I really was were I thought I was...I was gonna get caught right in the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be an interesting trip,\" I said quietly to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Pilot's voice came on over the PA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your Captain Speaking; take notice of the Fasten Seat-belt light, we are now beginning our descent into Tokyo, Japan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Here we go...\" I said to myself.</span></div></div>",

Not only did I not have anywhere to go in Tokyo, Japan, but if I was right I was in a lot more danger. I had no other choice - like a frightened child, I could do nothing else than to cling to the only familiar face I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Martin,\" I began. \"I know this is probably a huge imposition. But I have no where else to go and no friends here at all. Do you think I might shadow you for a while - at least until I can make arrangements for a trip back to the states?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't see it as too much of a problem,\" Martin answered. \"It'll give us a chance to discuss your amnesia story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we waited for Steve to pick up his luggage, he was approached by Japanese man, who took Martin's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve Martin?\" he asked. \"I'm Shigeru Miyamoto - assitant to Dr. Serizawa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how do you do?\" Martin asked taking the man's hand. \"How is Dr. Serizawa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His health is fine, but he regrets not being here to meet you,\" Shigeru answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Martin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had to go Inland for some experiments. He wished to delay them until after your visit, but they are much too important. He hopes that you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Martin smiled as he answered. \"When is he planning to return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps before you depart for Cairo. In the meantime, if there's anything I can do, please feel free to call me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly will,\" Martin answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was scary - I anticipated what they were saying - word for word. It was like they were reading from a script or teleprompter that I had memorized myself. It confirmed the truth of where I was. I was inside the movie that I had been watching! I silently cursed myself for falling asleep while watching this particular film.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wha...you're my...you're my...who are you?\" Lorraine looks back at him and says \"Lorraine Baines, my dad hit you with his car and you've been out for almost 9 hours.

I thought you said everyone had to come to the table fully dressed. It's not fair.\" Lorraine's mom replies \"Milton, he's our guest. Besides your feet stink up the house!\" Milton sulks, then slips off his shoes with each foot and uses his toes to pull off his socks unnoticed by anyone. He uses his right bare foot to reach across and tap on Marty's right bare foot.

Marty stretches them and splays his toes. As he begins to put his socks on, Mr Strickland surprises them. <br>\r\nMr. Strickland says \"Hey Slacker, what are you doing outside barefoot? Don't you know you can injure those nice feet of yours by stepping on something sharp or on some glass? Lorraine tries to explain, but Marty cuts her off.<br>\r\nMarty replies \"Uh Mr. Strickland, I forgot my own shoes at her house last night and to borrow some of Doc's old shoes. They were too small and hurt my feet. Lorraine brought my own shoes and socks with her for me to put back on.\" Mr. Strickland looks down at Marty's bare feet and notices his toes are red along with his heels. <br>\r\nMr. Strickland replies \"Ok Slacker, but don't let me catch you barefoot again except in the locker room. You remind me of George McFly, he is a slacker too.\" He leaves and walks inside.<br>\r\nMarty sits down and slides on one sock onto his left foot, then puts on his left shoe and ties it. Lorraine takes his right sock from Marty's hand and before putting it on his foot, gives his bare right foot a little massage and kisses his big toe. She then puts on Marty's shoe and ties it. <br>\r\nLorraine says \"It's the least I can do Calvin since my dad hit your with his car.

I forgot I'm in 1955.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Biff and his gang come by and begin to tease Lorraine. Marty tries to intervene, but Biff's gang hold on to him as Biff tries to kiss her. Meanwhile, Marty is dragged over to a big tree and the three hoodlums begin to strip off Marty's jacket, shirt, t-shirt, shoes, pants and even his socks, then gag him with his own socks and tie him to the tree trunk with some rope. Marty is only clad in his purple Calvin Klein underwear. One of the hoodlums tickle Marty's bare soles and toes making him flinch and jerk and making his toes splay. Lorraine kicks Biff and runs away. Biff comes over to Marty and begins to tickle his bare chest. He stoops down and rubs his hand over Marty's package on the way down to his bare feet. <br>\r\nBiff says \"Hey butt head, I like the purple underwear you have on. I have a thing for feet, so I hope you don't mind me sucking on your toes.\" Biff takes Marty's right bare foot and sticks his big toe into his mouth. Marty tries to take it out, but Biff holds onto his foot, tickling his sole. Biff's buddies laugh and tease Marty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I would go to Never Land and kick with Peter Pan and the Lost Boys.  That would be the life.  No adult issues or worries.  When I first got there, I would look for Peter Pan.  When I found him I would say to him, \"I have been living in the adult world for most of my life and I want to be a kid again.  I want to live here with you forever and never grow old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First we must challenge you to see if you are worthy to live here with us.  You better get plenty of sleep because you are going to need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing I know, someone was shaking my arm to wake me up.  \"T, wake up!\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some strange reason, I thought that I was dreaming that someone was trying to wake me.  So, I continued to lay there.  The shaking became harder and faster.  Then, I realized someone was beating me on my leg which finally woke me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up!\" I said as I quickly sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter Pan hit me on my legs a couple more times as he said, \"Just want to make sure you are woke.\"  The Lost Boys were all gathered around me some of which were taking turns hitting me and shaking me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up, I'm up,\" I said as I began the lengthy process of dragging myself out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on then.  Let the challenge begin,\" Peter Pan said as he turned and headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got outside, I saw that it was pitch black.  \"What time is it?\" I asked grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Lost Boys whispered, \"It is time for you to forget about time.  It doesn't exist here on Never Land. We eat when we want to eat and sleep when we want to sleep.  What else do we need time for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about that for a second and responded, \"When you put it that way, I guess we don't need time for anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued on in silence.  When we arrived at Captain Hook's boat, everyone stopped.  The Lost Boys fanned out to set up a perimeter and Peter Pan came over to me.  \"Your challenge is to sneak on board that ship and bring me Captain Hook's hook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Hook's hook?  Are you serious?  of all the things you could ask me to take, that is what you come up with?  That is impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is impossible to a kid.  If you can't do it then you can go back where you came from,\" he said as he began to signal the Lost Boys that it was time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, I was still half sleep.  Impossible is not in my vocabulary.  Just give me a second.  This I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ok, then.  Go on, we will keep watch to see if you need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-o-ok.  I-i-i'll be right back,\" I stuttered as I took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I climbed onto the ship, I saw some poor soul passed out on the deck cuddling with an empty bottle of whiskey.  I tiptoed over to the steps and went down.  I peeked through several of the doors that were open none of which were the captain's.    None of the crew actually looked like they were sleep.  Each room I looked in, there seemed to be bodies passed out just laying wherever their poor body fell.  A few did manage to make it to the bed but were not quite in a comfortable enough position to actually have laid down on purpose.  I finally made it to the captain's quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the only person on the ship who actually looked like he laid down on purpose, although he was in a deep, deep sleep.  When I walked in, his parrot was even laying in a crazy looking position.  I searched the room for his hook, but could not find one.  I looked in his closet and all of his drawers.  I finally decided to walk over to his nightstand.  Bingo!  In the bottom drawer, he had all kinds of gadgets to screw on in place of his hand besides the normal hook that he wore.  I grabbed a hook because that is specifically what Peter Pan asked for.  Then, i grabbed one that was a beautifully decorated ball.  As I was passing by his dresser, I saw several different wigs that he had on display.  I also decided to grab one of them.  as I took it down I accidentally hit something that loudly fell to the floor which alerted Captain Hook and his loud-talking parrot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Hook asked out loud, \"Who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parrot began to screech loudly, \"Intruder, intruder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raced over to the bedside.  Captain Hook had jumped out of bed by that time.  He was still discombobulated.  So, I socked him in the job and stomped on his toe.  Then I said to him, \"Old and alone!\" and ran out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time, Captain Hook had begun to yell for Sneed who was just coming out of his room as I was whizzing by.  That was a good thing because just as he came out of the room, I was passing by and knocked him smooth out with the decorated ball and stepped on his body to get passed.  I made it to the steps before any of his other crew members could catch me.  Then, I was off the ship and running along.  I quickly looked to see if Peter Pan and the Lost Boys were there.  Of course, they were nowhere to be found.  So, I inched my way back to their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got there, they were all sitting around the table eating.  I walked in and put the wig on my hand and slammed the hook and ball on the table directly in front of Peter Pan and demanded, \"Why did you guys take off?  You were supposed to stand guard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were, but in the meantime, we got hungry.  So, we decided to take a break and come back to eat something really quick.  Then, we were going back to help, if needed.  But since you are back, I guess you don't need us anymore.  Are you going to eat with us?\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are watching a movie and are sucked inside of it. Why is this rated 18+? You can do whatever you want once inside the movie. You can kill the main character, become a hero and help the protaganist achive victory, steal the object of power and become an evil overlord, save the world, find that hot character you've always loved and marry them, I don't care what you do, just be yourself and do what you always wanted to do in this movie. If I really like your chapter I might give you some GPs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                      Rules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. If you exit the movie the story ends unless you enter another movie.<br>\r\n2. If you would die you are instead ejected from the movie.<br>\r\n3. I'll add a lot of chapters myself, but if you come to the end of a storyline please add your own chapter even if its only a few sentances long. Its no fun if I decide everything that happens.<br>\r\n4. Keep all chapters as gender-neutral as possible, I want anyone and everyone to feel like this could really be them exploring these worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, thats about all. Enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpdate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry I haven't added any new chapters for awhile, but I've grown disatisfied with how the \"In The Movies\" sequel was turning out and lost most of my interest in this interactive. However, since going over it and re-reading it I've had a change of heart. I'll try to add more often and cut down on the lame forced puns I\"ve overused before. I'll still probably end up deleting \"In The Movies 2\" as the story I had planned for it isn't really needed, but I'll listen to whatever you, the reader, has to say about the subject before making my descision. If you think I should keep the sequel or not, or even add a third \"In The Movies\" interactive email me and tell me your opinion. Thank you all for reading, adding, and helping this interactive to grow.</td>",
