            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Sunday 18th of February the last day of February half term Danielle and Isabelle were invited to a party at a friend's house. Her other friends Skye and Janet were too busy to come so it was just them two. At this party there were 10 other people coming from her year. To Isabelle this was more of a get together with friends, Isabelle didn't really want to go but Danielle insisted that she came. Isabelle wasn't really a a friendly person she only came because Danielle asked her and she could never truly say no to her best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock turned 7pm and Isabelle knocked on Danielle's door wearing black skinny jeans and a black top, black leather jacket and black converse high tops. Danielle could help but stare In aww as her best friend looked really sexy in her attire. Danielle and Isabelle walked to the party that was two streets away from her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes later they arrived at the house and entered the party. 2 hours later into the party most of the boys were already very mortal, they started playing a game called truth, dare or drink. A young girl called Mary started of the game by asking Isabelle truth or dare. \"Truth\", said Isabelle. \"who would you have sex with out of every one here\", said Mary. Isabelle paused and took a drink before smiling towards Danielle. Isabelle asked Danielle \"Truth or Dare\" asked Isabelle. \"Truth\" Danielle said. \"What's your biggest phobia\", asked Isabelle. \"I have a fear of death\", she worriedly said. After several rounds of Truth, Dare or Drink. Everyone was almost mortal and ready to go home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 6am In the morning and Isabelle had just woken up in what seemed to be Danielle's bedroom, she turned over to find Danielle sleeping next to her. Danielle woke up and turned over facing Danielle smiling towards her. \"Mmm, Morning Isabelle\", mumbles Danielle. Isabelle looked under the quilt and looked to the left to see her clothes on a chair in the corner. Isabelle climbed out of bed and grabbed her clothes of the chair. She put her Black Jeans and her Black top and shoes, trying to get out quickly. Rushing out of the door, Danielle climbed out of bed following behind her \"Wait Isabelle!\", she shouted. Isabelle stops outisde of Danielle's house at the front door. Isabelle goes quiet and again you catch her staring at her intently at Danielle, Isabelle starts to blush heavily as she stares at the ground searchingly. Her body stiffens, as Danielle looks into Isabelle's ocean blue eyes vigorously exploring her body as they both leaned in to kiss each other. Her lips tasted of sweet cherry lipstick as they deepened the kiss the taste of each other sending tingly feelings downs one another's spine.They intertwine with each others hands as the kiss finally ended they quickly parted. Isabelle rubs her arm as she looks at Danielle. Danielle opens her mouth to speak but she couldn't find the words to say as Isabelle said softly, \" I'm sorry Danielle I... I... I can't do this, I'm sorry\". \" Isabelle wait I love you\" she said softly to herself. But Isabelle didn't hear her.</span></div></div>",

Danielle looks down at her feet trying not to blush heavily after the compliment from Isabelle.  \"Thank you. Isabelle I understand how you feel but... Isabelle I've had a huge crush on you since I first met you\", She expressed. \" Wow!\", Isabelle said looking very surprised.  \"I know this may be a lot to take in but, you must have felt something that kiss didn't just happen by accident you must've wanted it\", Danielle said. \" I want to be honest with you Danielle, that kiss, your lips, the taste of your cherry lipstick, I remember it all, it has been on my mind ever since it happened\" Isabelle exclaimed.  A tear rolled down Isabelle's face then another, Danielle looked at Isabelle and hugged her tightly as Isabelle wept silently onto Danielle's shoulder. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danielle do you remember my Mother?\" \"Yeah I think I do\" <br>\r\n\"My dad was talking to me about my Mother and about how she left me to go to Spain which I never knew. My dad ever since mum has left has never dated since and told me that he never will again because he's afraid of getting his heart broken again and he also said that me and my older sister is the only people in his life he ever needs and will always care for. But I don't want the same to happen to me and that's why I don't want a relationship\", said Isabelle trying to hold in her tears to not show weakness. \"Aww Isabelle, I would never do that to you I care about you too much to break your heart\", said Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle I... I.. would... would you like to go on a date with me maybe we could get food or go to the cinema and we can see what happens on from there, I mean I'm not promising anything or saying that I'm ready but It would be nice to spend time with you alone\", said Isabelle. \"That would be lovely, Isabelle I totally get it, you don't want to rush things\", she says trying to hold in her excitement.</span></div></div>",

''So what film are we going to watch'', said Danielle with excitement. <br>\r\n''I was thinking we could watch the new Bond film Spectre, because I know how you love the film franchise and the books by the author Ian Fleming, so I thought we'd watch it'', says Isabelle.<br>\r\n''That sounds Amazing, I'll buy us popcorn and drinks'', say Danielle.<br>\r\nThe 79 bus to Media City Salford comes and you both pay for your tickets and sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n40 minutes later the bus arrives outside of the Lowry outlet mall and you both go to the cinema and purchase two tickets to the Bond film. Danielle buys some popcorn and two diets cokes with Ice. ''My dad always says when you order fizzy drinks like coke and lemonade tell them can I have it with no Ice'', says Isabelle.<br>\r\n''Why's that'', says Danielle.<br>\r\n''Because having a lot of Ice in the drink means that they can add less Juice, Coke or Lemonade in your drink'', says Isabelle.<br>\r\n''Wow I never knew that I'll make sure for next time'', she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later the film starts showing James Bond jumping from a collapsed building in Mexico after trying to shoot the guy in the window. Danielle rest her head on Isabelle's shoulder. ''this is nice'', says Danielle smiling happily. Danielle looks around seeing noticing the cinema room isn't really that full theirs only five people down near the bottom. Isabelle wraps her left arm around Danielle and then her right arm pulling her into a kiss before going back to watching the film. We see Bond In an aeroplane in what seems to be Switzerland chasing after a car with a professor of some thoughts. Isabelle wraps her left arm around Danielle cuddling her whilst they watch the rest of the film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later we see Bond with a Girl using a small SMG, shooting bad guys whilst trying to blow up Spectre's hideout then the film finishes with a dramatic end. ''Thanks Isabelle I really enjoyed spending time with you'', says Danielle. Isabelle sighs and pauses for a minute looking very distracted.<br>\r\n''Isabelle are you alright, you seem distracted'', says Danielle.<br>\r\n''What hmm, yeah I'm fine Danielle, I was just thinking... It doesn't matter'', says Isabelle still looking very distracted.<br>\r\n''No go on Isabelle, you can tell me about anything'',<br>\r\n''I'd rather not talk Danielle, I don't want to ruin a perfect moment or ruin the date for you'', she says empathetically.<br>\r\n''Ok, but remember you can always talk to me about this'', says Danielle.<br>\r\n''I know I know geez'', Isabelle said sarcastically.<br>\r\n''Can you ever ease up and stop being so stubborn and sarcastic for one minute and just lighten up'', says Danielle.<br>\r\n''I don't think you'd love that, if I changed because that's why you love me'', says Isabelle.<br>\r\n''That's very true, I wouldn't want you to change a thing'', she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 hour later Isabelle and Danielle get off the 79 bus and walk home talking about what ever comes into there heads. Isabelle walks Danielle to her house before going home. ''Goodnight Isabelle I'll see you Monday in school'', shouts Danielle.<br>\r\n''Goodnight hun'', Isabelle shouts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The leader of the so called pack was Stacy and her two other friends were called Christina and Amy. Danielle had just finished off some work in the ICT room she was in. She was walking outside of the gates when those three girls pushed Danielle against the metal fence. ''Well look who we have here, a little birdie told me that you were, what's the word again Stacy'', Amy  said mischievously,<br>\r\n''I think the word is dyke isn't that right you little freak'', Stacy shouts whilst spitting in Danielle's face. Stacy punches Danielle in the left eye giving her a black eye before then kicking her in the stomach so she isn't able to get up. '' So you like girls do you?'', Christina says playfully. Danielle gets up off the floor looking the three girls in the eye. Christina stands to the side looking rather lost in thought. ''Well if you like it so much why don't you try this'', Christina says. Christina pulls Danielle in quickly and kisses her, Danielle smells the sweet scent of Christina's perfume Summer Rose. Her lips taste bittersweet imploding into her senses. Finally they break apart. ''I can tell you like it from the way you look'', says Christina smiling mischievously. <br>\r\n''Nice work Christina that should teach her let's go'', Stacy shouts. <br>\r\n''Come on Christina leave her she's a nobody, don't help her up'', Yelled Amy. Christina looks at her friends and then pushes Danielle onto the ground. ''That's a good girl Christina show her who's boss'', Shouts Stacy. <br>\r\n''Sorry'', Christina whispers under her breath. Isabelle walks out of the gate and notices Christina pushing Danielle and she runs out of the gate to see what's going on. ''HEY WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING TO MY GIRLFRIEND!'', Isabelle shouts. She pushes Christina onto the ground and Amy kicks Isabelle to the fence. Isabelle gets up after smacking her head on the fence and boots Amy in the stomach and then punches Stacy in the face.
