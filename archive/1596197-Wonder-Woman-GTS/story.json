The hum of a jet engine slowly died away, letting the soft chirp of songbirds drift in to mingle with the sound of crashing waves in the distance. Wonder Woman stepped down from the platform before the door to the Javelin quickly shut. She brushed a few strands of raven-black hair from her face as she looked around the peaks of her homeland. Themyscira never seemed to change. The same rocky mountaintops hung in the distance, the same cities sat in the valley, and the same marbles statues laid before her. She casually strode forward between a row of columns that led to the city center. As she went armored amazons made a sign of obeisance, their spirits lifting when they caught of glimpse of their champions' unique red armor. After a short walk Wonder Woman stood at the foot of the main temple, upon whose steps stood an entourage of women clad in armor and distinguished robes of fine linen. A blonde woman with a bright silver tiara descended with several retainers following close behind. <br>\r\n         \"Welcome my child, I'm glad you have come, we...have much to discuss\" she placed her hands on Wonder Woman's shoulders and gave her a stern but worried look.<br>\r\n          \"What is wrong mother? I came as quickly as I could\" Wonder Woman said in reply<br>\r\n          \"The gods plot Diana, our oracle as seen great destruction coming for this world.\" Hippolyta said in a choked voice, \"Hermes came to me in a dream, someone is going to loose a great evil from the depths of Tatarus.\" At this Wonder Woman gasped.<br>\r\n          \"How can we be sure?\" she asked. Hippolyta shook her head in reply.<br>\r\n          \"Hermes revealed to me something else...he says Zeus had chosen you...\"<br>\r\n          \"Chosen me for what? What is it mother?\" Wonder Woman asked, her voice mounting with worry.<br>\r\n          \"To be the earth's champion, he wants to anoint you with godly powers\"<br>\r\n           \"What?\"<br>\r\n           \"It is the only way, they say Typhon is to be set free.\" Wonder WOman's heart stopped. <br>\r\n           \"But mother not even Zeus could truly destroy him? What chance do I have?\" She asked. Hippolyta moved to make reply but said nothing. Wonder Woman bowed her head, \"No, I understand, nothing can stop him, but I will try...\"</span></div></div>",

Hippolyta quickly hugged her daughter and sighed out with great dismay.<br>\r\n\"My dear you must go now, Zeus shall bestow your powers to you at the Mountain shrine, go and fulfill your destiny...\"<br>\r\nWonder Woman nodded and quickly looked around at her fellow Amazons, they looked on intently, some with confidence, fear, and sympathy. She took another deep breathe and took to the sky soaring upward towards the mountains that hung in a suspended fog in the distance. As she rocketed overhead she looked down at the city that lay below her. As she approached the shrine a thick layer of mist covered her advance. She touched down on the rocky slope and carefully stepped up the crags to the rotund shrine that lay before her. As she passed betweens its columns she saw a pyre alight with a blazing blue flame. A voice like thunder echoed forth. <br>\r\n\"Diana, Daughter of Themyscira, you have come...\" Wonder Woman quickly took a knee and bowed to the divine fire. <br>\r\n\"Yes my king, I am here to receive your most gracious gift.\"<br>\r\n\"This is no gift\" the voice sharply replied. \"It is a great power, the power of a god!\"<br>\r\n\"I swear to you and all of Olympus that I will wield it in the name of truth!\" Wonder Woman replied emphatically<br>\r\n\"I know you will....it is why I have chosen you\" The voice paused a for a long time there was silence<br>\r\n\"Typhon rises from a mountain in the sea, cast him back down into the pits of hell and the world will be safe...fail, and it will burn\"<br>\r\n\"What magic rouses him?\" Wonder Woman asked. The voice returned again, this time a little more strained.<br>\r\n\"There is no time to explain, come receive your destiny!\" Suddenly the fire grew brighter, forcing Wonder Woman to shield her eyes from the blinding glow. A ray of light shot down from the sky and illuminated the temple. Shortly afterward a crack of thunder could be heard a shimmering bolt of lightning shot down and struck the shrine with so much force the entire roof caved in. Wonder Woman clenched her teeth as the electricity surged through her. She clutched her head and could feel a smoldering power inside of her begin to grow. The entire mountain shook and began to crack. Meanwhile down in the city the Amazons scurried about in panic as they saw the mountains in the distance reduced to a pile of dust. The chaos was then abruptly interrupted by silence. Wonder Woman opened her eyes and saw nothing but dust. She stood up and looked down, the white marble floor had been replaced by the crack earth with glowed with energy. She turned her head and saw the city, but instead of being distant it sat right at her feet. She looked to one of the remaining mountains and saw that it came only to her waist. She had achieved godhood.</span></div></div>",

If she was to fight Typhon, she would need to do it far away from civilization. The tiny Amazon city below began to roar with commotion. Was it fear? Excitement? Wonder Woman couldn't tell, and she had no time to discern, she had a job to do. She set her feet a bit wider apart and launched herself into the sky. She could hear the winds warp and thunder as her colossal body moved through the atmosphere. She hadn't really considered where she was to find this island. Then, in the distance, a lightning bolt crackled across the sky. A torrent of clouds began to gather around it.<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that's as good a signal as any...\" Wonder Woman said to herself. With even greater speed she rocketed forward. She tore through clouds and gusts till at last the island was in sight. A tower, dark, jagged mountain of black rock jutted up into the tempestuous heavens. Swarms of tiny, winged creatures circled its crest. <br>\r\n\"Harpies?\" Wonder Woman began. \"Well I guess that means I'm in the right place then...\"<br>\r\nShe touched down on the beach, causing the whole island to shake. She brushed her hair back and look at the mountain. Though it was large it still only reached up to her chest. <br>\r\n\"Now then...where is this creature?\" she said under her breath. Hundred of tiny harpies swooped down out of the sky and assaulted the titaness, but she simply swatted them away with a few waves of her hand. <br>\r\nSuddenly, out of nowhere, she heard a noise.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sure enough a fleet of ships was parked just off the island. The row of frigates stretched out over the dark blue waters in a grey arc. Wonder Woman counted seven in all. Two Battleships, two destroyers, a missile cruiser, a submarine, and an aircraft carrier cut through the waves. The gigantic amazon sighed. She began to take a few careful steps toward the shore, flattening acres of forest with each step. These sailors didn't know what they were about to get themselves into. She needed to get these ships out of the way fast, before Typhon was released and she didn't want to have to worry about a bunch of tiny ships while fighting the monstrosity.<br>\r\nBoth of her colossal red boots crashed down into the surf. As she waded toward them, huge waves kicked up by her feet smashed into their sides, causing them to rock about violently. Through the wind she could here the frightened cries of the men on deck. She knelt down next to the nearest battleship and began to speak as softly as she could.<br>\r\n\"Men, you must get out of here, a powerful force is about to be set free here, you will not be able to combat, I urge you to turn and go. It's for you're own good.\" <br>\r\nAt first there was no response, only the minute chatter on board. Then, a radio from the ship's bridge crackled to life. <br>\r\n\"I'm afraid we cannot do that ma'am. We have orders to patrol these waters, large radioactive signals linked to possible missing nukes have been reported. So I'll have to ask you miss to STAND DOWN!\"<br>\r\nWonder Woman rolled her eyes. She tried to ask nicely, but luckily with her new found size this wouldn't be much of an issue. With one massive hand she reached down and wrapped her fingers around the ship's hull. With little effort she lifted the battleship out of the water. Compared to her, the hulking craft was only roughly a foot in length. It looked like a children's toy. She was careful not to grip it too hard or to tilt it over, lest any of the hapless crew fall to their deaths. With her other hand she reached down and picked up another ship. The radio crackled to life once more.<br>\r\n\"Wha-aaah, release this ship right now!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh I will...\" Wonder Woman replied calmly. \"Once you are at a safe distance....\"<br>\r\nWonder Woman took a few cautious steps through the ocean. After a couple minutes she was far enough from the island and deposited the boats back in the water. Already she noticed the minuscule fighter jets circling her body. The fly-like machines were only a nuisance however. When she returned to the rest of the fleet they were furious. Heavy cannons and machine gun fire rained up at her legs, but the rounds struck her with little effect. Again Wonder Woman rolled her eyes. It was then she noticed the mountain. It shook furiously. Suddenly...</span></div></div>",

They had been covering a mountainside that was being used by a crazy cyborg scientist to get a radioactive mineral for his robot army's power supply. Just as wonder woman tore through several colossal robots gaurding she was blasted by a powerful death ray from behind which sent her flying into the cave wall. She fell through and continued falling down a long narrow, and dark shaft which led deeper into the mountain's core. When she landed she was surprised to find that she could still see. It was then she say the cracks in the rock which let sunlight in. As she at up she saw a large flat plain she notices that it was covered with box like stalagmites. \"What the-'' wonder woman said as she stood up, curious as to what these strange rectangular objects were. She took a closer look and they looked strangely similar to buildings. She took a step closer, and eventually made her way down to the plain, looming over the box like objects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a different perspective...<br>\r\nIt had been a pretty normal day for Alchemas, the oldest of orphans in the small heritage. He had been waiting outside near the market when he saw the beast. First came the dark shadow, then the earthquake. He looked up, just as everyone else was doing and saw something truly terrifying. Whatever it was it was HUGE, most of the tallest building didn't even come up past its ankles. He couldn't see past the legs since the light shadowed the rest of the figure but judging by the physique he assumed it was female. Could it be, a colossal Woman? Alchemas didn't want to find out he ran about the market place gathering the younger children and got them all inside. By this time most everyone else was hiding away and the beast came stepping into the city. \"Oh dear mother illiana help us\" said his friend Theodis who now stood beside him. They tried to run away but as the creature neared the quakes became intensified and they fell and couldn't get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then wonder woman say what looked like two small insects crawling away.

As she extended her hand towards them, the tiny creatures began to inch away. Whatever they were they were terrified of her. One quickly turned and ran into the narrow space between two of the box shapes nearby. The second turned to follow but Wonder Woman quickly intercepted him by blocking its path with her hand. The tiny thing ran straight into her palm and fell to the ground. Wonder Woman carefully scooped up the tiny figure and brought it up to her face for a closer look. Upon closer inspection she saw that this creature was, aside from his tiny size, was no different from a human. She tried to speak to it saying \"hello...do you understand me?\" The tiny human didn't respond he simply sat up and cowered. Wonder Woman stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlchemas was petrified. He didn't know what to do, this gigantic woman had appeared out of nowhere and now he was at her mercy. 'What do I do? Call for help?' he thought to himself. 'No, its no use, no one can help me, not against...her' She had spoken earlier but he did not understand her. Her voice echoed like thunder, but with a still uniquely feminine undertone. He wasn't sure if he should speak. He tried to at first, but he could say nothing, he was just to frightened. The giant woman didn't appear hostile, she had sympathetic eyes which, despite their calm blue tones still felt piercing. The giantess moved a bit, but he couldn't really tell how far he was focused on her. </span></div></div>",

She slowly turned and saw one of the horrid attack robots from before drilling its way out of the bedrock. She quickly looked around at the tiny city around her. It was crude sure, but it seemed to be densely populated by these minuscule beings. The robot finally broke free and lurched back onto the caver floor below. Wonder Woman's attention shot back up to her metal foe. She could dismantle it easily but she could risk it harming any of these tiny people, so in a desperate attempt to keep the mechanical monster from the innocents below she quickly deposited the little figure on a nearby roof top and launched herself into the air. She flew like a missile into the robot's chest, forcing it back into the far cave wall. It clanked to the ground with a mighty thud, but quickly recovered. It raised its arms and let forth a spray of gunfire from a minigun mounted on its wrist. Luckily Wonder Woman was well prepared and simply raised her bracelets in defense, causing the bullets to ricochet off in different directions. The robot, seeing that its attack failed, lept forward aggressively. It swung its thick metal arms clumsily, which she easily dodged. She grabbed a hold of the robot's shoulders and began to pull its limbs off its body. The machine sputtered and emitted a foul smelling smoke, but Wonder Woman continued to pull off pieces of metal until all that was left was a pile of scrap. She turned her attention back to town and returned to city square where she stood a few moments ago. The townsfolk continued to cower in their homes and the little person she had picked up before still sat on the rooftop. He seemed a bit...disheveled, but that was to be expected. Wonder Woman bent down and plucked the little figure off the building and placed him carefully in her hand. He continued to shake with terror but she did little to ease his fear. Suddenly the crackle of a familiar voice interrupted her concentration on the little man. \"*Diana we're almost done here, where are you?*\" came the voice of Batman through her earpiece. \"I'll be right there, I...I found something\" she said in a tone of disbelief. She brought the little figure closer and whispered to him as softly as she could, \"I'm gonna bring you with me, just remain calm no harm will come to you\". At that she closed her hand around her new companion and flew out of the cavern. </span></div></div>",

As she approached the door on the side slid open and she entered, her hand still entrapping the tiny figure. As she stepped inside she was intercepted by the Martian Manhunter who stood against the far end of the fuselage. \"Diana are you alright? We lost there for a little while\" he said in his typical monotone voice. \"I'm fine J'onn, I stumbled upon something, under the mountain.\" she opened  her hand to reveal the tiny figure in her palm. The Martian's expression did not change, he gave a simple nod in reply. \"We should investigate this further this may be a new species, I'll check the Watchtower's database when we return in case we have an information on them.\" She nodded, \"Alright shall I return him to his home?\" she asked. \"Hold onto him for now, we may need to observe him later if nothing comes up.\" At that the green skinned man turned around and exited through a sliding door. Wonder Woman turned her attention to the cowering little person in her hand. \"Come with me little one, we'll make accommodations for you...\" she trailed off. She continued down the hall and returned to her seat, strapping herself into the chair and placing her companion on her thigh. As the javelin lurched forward the tiny figure flew back and tumbled down Wonder Woman's leg. She shot her hand out and caught him just in time. She raised him back up to her face, \"sorry little one, I'll keep you somewhere more secure.\" She looked down at her exposed cleavage and adjusted her breastplate fittingly, making a perfect spot for her minuscule companion to be stored.

It was apparent to her that she couldn't go in and fight it, she would no doubt hurt and kill many people, she had to get it out of the city but how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder woman then flew up into the air and soared over to the center of the city were the monster was rampaging. She quickly got out her lasso and roped it around the humungous abomination. In one hand the beast held a bus and in the other a smashed helicopter. Wonder then flew straight up into the air pulling the monster along with her. As she flew higher and higher the creature became more and more angry, roaring and thrashing about. It was becoming harder and harder for her to breathe because of the fact that her new size meant she needed more oxygen and as they went higher into the atmosphere the air got thinner and thinner. After awhile she got so hight up she almost coudln't breath at all. She was about to fling the monster into outer space but just before she did that she remembered the bus that it was clutching. She wasn't sure if it had let go of it while it was struggling but she pulled the creature up just to be sure. The monster was in fact still holding the bus, so wonder woman quickly grabbed the monster's wrist with one hand and began to choke it with the other. She choked it until it was unconcious, and then pried the bus out of it's hand. She held it up and peered inside, and say there was one tiny young man clutching to a seat, extremely terrified, and of course struggling to breath. Wonder woman then snapped the bus in half and carefuly dumped the tiny man into her palm. She knew she had to find a way to hold him while she got rid of the monster. So, improvising, she adjusted her breasts so they could accomadate her new little friend, then she gently tucked the tiny man between her massive amazon boobs. Wonder woman then swung the unconcious beast around a few times and then flung it of into outer space, never to be seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her task complete wonder woman glided back down to earth. She landed not far from the city and could tell that reconstruction was already underway. She knew she probably should go and help out, but she also knew that she could hurt people with her gigantic size. Plus she didn't want to much publicity about her new size quite yet. So wonder woman flew off. After awhile she remembered the little man, and stopped. She landed near a small down and as she came down caused a small earthquake nearby. She then carfully snatched the tiny man out from in between her breasts.</span></div></div>",
