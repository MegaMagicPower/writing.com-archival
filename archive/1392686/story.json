Getting up after a long night of nothing but horrified toucher of his roommates wasn't great to start a day off, much less having having them drunk off their ass and banging pots and pans cause they wanted to start a band. It kept him up half the night. Not to mention getting drunk himself, forcing to chugging down a gallon of nothing but wine and beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head pounded threw the morning and it didnt help when he entered the dinner hall and hearing the roar of people talking all at once eating there breakfast and chatting about stuff. He sighed sitting at a table with his friends but he started to get caught up in his own world cause he knew, after breakfast they get to go down and care for there life long dragon partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this world it was eat or be eaten and humans have become a deliciouses morsel among the creatures eaten in the world. in attempt from humans being whipped out, dragons had made a pack but on one condition. They become there riders and they chose who there rider will be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a child hits about 8 to 10 years of age they go in to 3 years of training to build there character and have the strength to defender their partner if it comes down to it. After 3 years, the ones who trained to the fullest gather within an active volcano,deep in to a cave were newly hatched hatchling wait for there rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon sighed daydreaming like it was yesterday. 5 years ago it was his third attempt to get a dragon, the first two was a dud cause none of the dragoons chose him as his own. but that year was going to be a night to remember. He was standing on the hot sands of the Hatching Ground, not even thinking or hoping for a silver dragonet to waddled up to him and decide to have him as a rider. Stopping a mere foot away, a small little silver scale dragon stared awkwardly up at him and emitted a happy coo sound. It stood up cutely on its hind legs, tucking both forepaws onto his chest, The little dragon looking at Leon with sky blue eyes until it lost it's balance. Falling over in the soft sand the hatchling looked deep into his eyes and time seem to slow down for the two. The world he thought and knew turned inside out, flip over and break in to a million pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis soul was enveloped in a sense of complete welcome and adoration, a security blanket of emotion that wrapped around him and let him know everything was ok. A velvety voice, cream and honey flowing in a stately golden river, filled his mind and named itself... \"I am Shade, and you, Leon, are mine.\" After a moment of nothing but warmth and friendship, the voice shifted tones. \"I am very hungry. Do you know where I could find some food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon snapped out of his trance and looked at his tray seeing his food is all gone. &lt;Not much of a filling meal&gt; he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon enough, Leon was the first to leave the dinner room walking a couple flight of steps he entered the stables were his dragon and a few others slept. It wasnt like a horse stable it was like a huge cavern made with a whole bunch of holes in the wall plus one opening that lead outside to a 300 foot drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe home of humans and dragons is very often living off a huge cavern, the village and castle on top of the cliffs above and in the cavern and caves is were the dragons flew and lived. Most dragonrider villages are like that because it worked out for both kind, and at an addition the close cluster of dragons all at one point, many creatures of air and land had strayed away cause if you mess with one human you mess with all of the dragons living there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon yawned, rubbing his head as he climbed on to the second row of caves and walked in to were Shade was sleeping. &lt;it's been a couple years since you chose me Shade...&gt; he thought walking to the dragon and reached out to rub his huge head. By now the dragon was about 65 feet in length it was amazing how fast the dragons grew in there first 4 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the day the two have become partners he started to feel sort of strange towards the intensity of Shade's hunger. He had started hand-feeding bits of meat to the hatchling when they first met, marveling at the quantities he ate his food. As his friend grew larger in the months ahead, Leon had begun to experience a weird but good giddiness during when the beast was feasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he had shook the feeling this as a feeling Shade felt when he feeds. none the less the dragon had grown quiet large and the rider started taking every opportunity to watch his lifemate fed until he was full. Observing the massive beast tear off pounds of meat, toss it into the back of his maw and joyfully gulp it down. Leon always felt intoxicated with arousal and passionate longing that he could not understand why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the dragon  and how deep asleep he was maybe he could get a hand and rub around his maw. Get a feel of everything inside, and the feeling of his hand encased by the warm flesh thou careful with the the dragon's teeth. Leon looked at the dragon and feared for what his friend might think if he wakes up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just looking at those teeth the dragon made the boy shudder and start to become excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached over to take a rock that was near by and put it between those shark teeth so he can slip his arm in. He smiled, blushing a little as his hand slowly slipped in, feeling Shade's saliva coat his hand and his smooth tongue wiggling a little when his hand slide across the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon smiled sitting there, feeling his hand around in those huge jaws he started to get caught up in the feel. By now, he began to slide his arm in more, up to the elbow causing the dragon to shift softly and start to drool at the human taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smiled in content at how peaceful his dragon friend and sort of wounder what the big scaly beast is thinking. Leon leaned in looking at within the cave like jaws seeing the drool drip down on the sides and hot air spreading over his face with Shade's deep breaths. The boy started to get more excited, now he wants to experience first hand on whats it like to crawl in and become helpless prey by the mighty beast before him, still he was uncertain if he should attempt to crawl in. After all, what will Shade say to have his friend in his jaws?</span></div></div>",

The silver dragon growls as he shakes his head growling softly, looking away in spit of the rubs. He snorted but didn't seem to notice his mouth open the rock or even the feel of those tasty flesh, guess he thought it was a after taste from a meal he had last night. None the less the dragon was sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon looked at him and chuckled, laughing as he leaned in and hugged his snout before pulling away and started to strip off his cloths as he didn't want them to get them wet and slimy, the last time they were wet was when they had to catch a frog for the princess in the swamps and he fell in to the water getting his cloths and armor wet, they had to be washed for 4 days cause of all the grim and slime on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rider smirked as he soon stood in the nude before his partner, blushing as he looked at those massive jaws. He then looked around making sure no one say him like this, the last thing he need is for someone to ruin his life. Before he stuffed those lean arms in, he took the effort to  stuff those cloths behind his dragon just in case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe damp warmth and followed by his head that slipped past those sharp teeth. the rider blushed as he pushed himself in slowly making sure not to wake Shade. He groaned as it got a bit tighter the more he went in those jaws squishing his head down and arms. he blinked and blushed feeling his hands touch the opening to the throat that was closed. he blushed as he pushed against the wall of the cave then the bottom for help. \"a little more...\" he whispered. as those jaws scraped against his skin in some places, causing discomfort for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon finally pushed his feet past those jaws accidentally kicking the rock out from between the teeth and made the jaws close down on him. He looked back as the teeth became a cage as the last of light that poured in the cave showing threw the teeth were now closed, sealing him in. Now he was helpless, under the power of the dragon as it slept. The rider groaned becoming hard from the erotic feeling groaning as it felt so good but his mind screamed as being in there was a very bad thing, still Leon ignored it and just closed his eyes and enjoyed the feeling of being in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long till the bottom floor started to move and shift under him slowly pushing the 'meat' forward. Leon gasped and wiggled around, feeling himself slowly sink in towards the throat that opened. \"Oh god... he's ... going to eat me.....\" he whispered to himself trying to stop but the feeling was too good to pass up. squeezing down the tight throat.</span></div></div>",

He shifted around and groaned as he tried to escape but he couldnt as from the tightness around his body. Leon trembled with the sensation of arousal wash over his body. Soon he just gave up and just welcome the tight embreace of his partner's inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade growled softly as he lapped his tongue around the live and wiggling meat in his jaws making him think it was some pour fish he had caught in his dreams. The large dragon started to drool on the ground tasting the 'fish' over and over. he flexed his claws on the cave ground, digging them into the dirt, shifting his body as he felt a pleasurable feeling enter his mind, amazingly the great dragon remained asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the jaws, Leon groaned as he was slowly eased alone the insides of the fleshy and rippling walls. pinned tightly in the muzzle of the dragon, he felt the predator approve of the when the tongue licked over his body more roughly. His heart pounded against his chest making him breathless at the experience. It was beyond anything he ever felt in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing his ride was gonna end soon as how close his head was to entering the tight throat he reached his arms backwards and started to rub the sides of the wiggling tongue, he often wounder what he must taste like to the big silver dragon. Mere seconds later, Leon felt a sharp forward motion as the prison enveloping him tightly and pushed him in to the rippling throat. This was insane and other wise crazy, he knew exactly what the dragon was doing, his mind screamed to escape the danger and it was  even heart stopping to do this while his friend is asleep, but he couldn't bare himself to care the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great silver dragon ruthlessly clawed at the ground as he got a taste full of the salty prey wiggling in his mouth, a lazy but quick toss of his head, he gulped hard, jamming the unfortunate 'fish' deep into his throat, beyond the point of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet, hot and fleshy cage violently squeezed Leon all around his smooth human body with a few scrapped skin here and there. Squeezed painfully against the slick palate ridges above the poor boy, had partially knocked the wind right out of him. Still, the persistent boy didn't want to end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPropelled forward in to the throat of his partner was worth having huge tongue, sending him back, deep into the maw of the dragon. He was then squeezed rapidly down the throat of the beast. The top ridges of the maw digging into his back and legs, the elastic surface pressed him in to a heap, moving past the pharynx of the animal. The walls of the chamber gripped him with a welcoming slimy embrace, tugging and pulling him downward the fleshy tube relentlessly downward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade sighed as he repeatedly gulped down his slightly oversized chunk of living meat and bone. The rider slid down his throat, forming a slight but visible bulge on the outside of his scaly hide. He let the feeling of the salty food as it was pulled deeper inside him. The lump passed beyond view of his long neck and slowly disappear into his chest.</span></div></div>",

He felt himself being squeezed through a tight opening into what he now know must be the dragon's stomach. Shoved through  with some powerful gulps, he tumbled into a slippery wall that encased all around his body. the jucies within splashed all around his body coating him with the salvia. He gasped at the tightness feeling alla round him, he kicked a bit but thats a bout it as he was already in a comfortable postion. all of this was so mind numbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrival of food in the beast's stomach made Shade shift around, rolling on his back, sighing in pleasure, rubbing over the budge within his sleep. He had finished off what ever prey he had chased in his dreams and now he was going to lay back and digest it, like good food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the walls push against his body, he wiggled around trying to make it stop as it made him sank in the flesh at the bottom, causing some of the juices to tingle his body. The walls seemed to expand outward to whatever size of a meal that it can hold up too. With little freash air to work with, there was a foul stench that had somewhat snapped leon awake from his trance of pleasure. He felt the slick, muscler flesh around him begin to exude a thick, sticky slime that he suspected would send him to the gods or even bond with his friend forever. All of this was in the name of hunger and pleasure for them both even if Shade doesnt know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGagging a bit on the acrid air that stung his lungs and throat, he realized that if it wasnt for lady luck he would have been gulped down as fuel and not food! ending up in to the fire breathing belly instead. Thinking about the horror thought, Leon laied back in the stomach looking at the darkness ridding of one thing then started with another, such as escaping the belly before he's dragon mush, maybe he should wake up his friend now and get out or he could spend a few more minutes inside it was kind of nice.</span></div></div>",

I need to get out of here\" he muttered pushing around the walls pushing out and kicking about. \"ugh .. Please wake up Shade\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the dragon groaned and murred rolling on his side, scratching his belly, enjoying the wiggling and muffled voice in his stomach that gurgled with the food. Yet something was amassed. He slowly opens his eyes, waking up from a dream about a fish he had scarfed down. At first he thought it was a dream until there was squirming movements caught his attention. \"wha-what?\" he said sitting up and looked at his gut. \"... did I eat a fish?\" he said licking his mouth and lips. \"no no a fish dosn't taste like this.... but it seems fami-- Leon?!\" he yelled in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Leon kicked and wiggled, he yelped when the stomach moved and he was now farther then the opening from which he came in. \"Agh! Shade! Help!\" he yelled louder then ever struggling to get out. He blushed as it was rather nice, being squished around by that powerful stomach but being digested wasnt his dish of fantasies. He pushed out on the walls feeling the walls squeeze him around more, coating his body in more saliva and acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade gulped softly looking at his got. \"Oh god... my partnar in my got... what should I do? ma-maybe he wont mind if I keep him in more.. maybe take one of my potions to heal him...\" he said looking around the cave then back at his gut, reaching a claw down and started to rub his belly. \"mmm...\" he said licking his lips. \"Maybe....</span></div></div>",

He sighed, feeling his stomach squeeze on Leon, making his human partner squirm even harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oohhh...\" the dragon couldn't help but flop over on his side and rubbed his belly some more. hearing the belch and the air become thin Leon started to panic and fight some more. \"Shade!!\" he cried out. Finally the dragon rolled back on his paws gulping fresh air down to him. \"alright alright ...... after breakfast\" he grinned proudly. The human grumbles wiggling around before he stopped and just sat away from the acids the best her could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is punishment isnt it....\" he grumbles as he just have to sit back and accept this from his friend. \"well yeah ... I mean it seems you had gone willingly anyway, I might as well enjoy you till I get you out.... besides.... I always wanted to try you before when I had matured\" he whispered the last part to him, letting a shade of red spread over his dragon cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, Leon blushed as well hearing the silver dragon say it. \"we-well fine!! but just please stop your acids or something it's really burning\" he said as he had been fighting back the pain and Shad walking about had only made the stomach acids a little stronger. Soon enough the dragon had stopped walking it seemed, but no answer came from him anymore. \".... Shade?\" He called rubbing the walls and pushing out. \"Is everything all ri--AGH!!\" he yelled as he was hit by falling chunks of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Shade happily scarfed down his breakfast with some other dragons that were awake. But most where half asleep and groggy so they wouldn't know of Shade carrying more then his own share of meat. After he was done, he begun to murr, feeling his partner wiggling around once again from the food packed in, making his stomach budge. The male dragon trotted out of the cave, jumping off the ledge, and bung to fly off to the forest to be alone with his fresh meal.</span></div></div>",

Moving the pieces of meat down below, so he would evade the acids for now. \"ugh ... please let me out soon...\" he muttered and yet, he was bare naked, living on a fantasy, and his friend even admitted he wanted to taste his sweet human flesh. When that idea sank back in his mind he started to blush and his member harden at the idea. \"mm... ok maybe a little longer\" he muttered to himself, reaching down and started to strock his member, smiling softly feeling the stomach walls grind him and the meat harder as the acids worked to turn the food in to mush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver dragon landed on the ground of the soft grass looking down to hear his gut gurgle louder. \"hmm...\" Leon are you ok in there?\" he called out to nudge his gut softly.

It was very hard to figure out where the vial was when the large was constantly being rolled around. \"SH-SHADE! Stop massaging your gut, i cant - AHH- find the vial.\" Leon dug another hand in the now mushier meat, the burning sensation growing. The walls around him still shifted a great number of times \"SHADE! STOP IT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright.\" The stomach let up a bit and you could have sworn you felt the vial just slip out of your fingers. You had to snap your hand back since it was now located in a pocket of acidic goop. \"Leon...*yawn* i think im gonna take a nap...\" On the outside, the large silver dragon rested his head on the ground and began to drift off to sleep, his own malehood seemed to be poking out of his own sheath. \"Just don't get caught.... in the sphincter... *snore*...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shade?\" Leon heard the loud rumbling of his dragon partner snoring. \"Damn dragon, always sleeping around and eating.\" While this was an almost dream to him, his skin began to itch crazily. \"Alright, i just have to-\" SQUITCH... \"OW OW OW!\" With the vial in hand, and his hand being almost completely covered in acidic goop, he uncapped the vial and chugged the contents. His body seemed to calm down but the burning was still there. \"It's not working!\" He began to panic a bit struggling to get Shades attention. His hand no longer felt numb or tingly,in fact, it felt quite cool, almost as if his entire body dropped temperature. With new found curiosity, Leon dug his hand back down into the goop of the stomach an was relieved to find no pain or stinging feeling. \"Oh thank goodness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy reclined into the stomach, letting himself get more comfortable each second. The soft gurgling noises were soothing and harmonious. A familiar feeling filled his loins and Leon began to blush a bit. When he found no reason to resist he began to idly stroke his cock. In pure bliss, Leon was distracted enough so that when he finally came, his cock was almost fully submerged in a warm sticky mess. Chunks of meat littered the soup and his body was half submerged in it. The stomach churned a little and contracted squeezing air out of the sack and traveling up into a-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRAAAAAAAAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, good one.\" Leon chuckled at his engorged friend. This was truly amazing being able to live out a fantasy and fill Shades too, it was a win win situation. It was so good in fact that he would want to try again sometime, maybe with less food next time. The stomach began to tighten again, this time, it began shifting the goop towards a small hole at the bottom. \"WHAT THE!\" Leon could feel his legs constricted by a small ring, then thought of what his friend said earlier. He certainly did not want to take a trip the whole way through. Leon tugged at his leg.</span></div></div>",

The tight throat continued to ripple and squeeze his body deeper and deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more of himself disappeared into its mouth, the body of the snake bulged very nicly to the outline of the boy's body. The snake made a sucking sound making Leon option to squirm and kick about like a helpless fish. With each gulp, the snake leaked a little air into the throat, giving him strenght to wiggle and squirm but it would soon end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake ahd worked it's way over his nakkied butt and only had his kicking leg left. gulping again the snake worked over his legs in a nice and slow pace just taking it's woudnerful time in it's nice meal. His legs kicked out uselessly, trying some how to stop the snakes decent, but failing completely. Its firm throat kept him at bay so he can not get out even if with his wiggling. Finally, all that remained was everything below his shins, leaving only part of his legs and his feet still kicking. The snake slowly worked its mouth down enjoying his sweet sweet flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a powerful swollow the snake reached it's open mouth forward engulfing his legs fully and closed it's mouth around his feet, leaving them to wiggle and twitch. Now he was entering the stomach once the mouth whraped around his ankles with little air to work with he just let it be and sliped inside effortlessly. \"nnnggghh... he flt a little groggy from the lack of air now, Now the snake swollowed the last of him, gulping up his feet and sending him fully with in his stomach. The rider was pushed in and was snug tightlywitht he strechy flesh around him, lecking acids to break him down now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon started to feel dizzy and lightheaded from the air he was using up rapidly. Most of his energy was spent trying to break free, so now didn\u2019t take long for the rider to slowly rocked to sleep.

Now tell me, do I know what you want?\" Leon nodded, remembering that Darkness had a habit of observing riders and figuring them out. \"I thought so, now listen carefully... most dragons have 2 stomachs, one for fuel, and one for food OR storage, now I suppose you know which one you want, but the trick is to make Shade's digestive juices not come in.

Just as that small daydream was happening he was shaken back in to reality by one of his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding beside him was a boy, just as old, tall and well built. The only difference was that he had long black hair with his lightly tan skin and his outfit was sort of forgen because he was an exchange study from the city other the ocean. He was here for about 3 years and one of Leon's close friends. \"Oh .... hey Raven\" he sighed softly. It was rather strange, of everyone in the castle who had a dragon would be the same gender at the human partner. Yet in raven's case he and a female dragon instead. By guessing they must have different rules from where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man .. you look tired... the guys kept you up all night?\" Raven said swinging a hand other his shoulder. \"yeah ..... at least they didn't end up embarrassing me like last time\" He spoke, flopping over on the table and closed his eyes. \"Well yeah, could be worst ... anyway Leon, if your still hungry Ive got some snacks back at the stable and I'm sure if you ask , maybe Shade can share his food with you\" he said trying to reasure him. Leon looked up at his friend and smiled. \"well I guess I can go ... as long you come with me. I heard Alia stay out late again and I rather not run in to her fat ass\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven chuckled. \"right right ... keep denying that and I'm sure you two would have cute little babies running around. Alia and  Leon jr. What cute names\" he teased. as they went off to the stables. Leon grabbed Raven and started to give him a noogie. \"yeah well maybe Amber should hook up with you!, little dragon babies running around, setting things on fire\" he smirked.

After all... humans dissappeared all the time.<br>\r\nRaven's dragon felt the weight of her meal hit her stomach and she sighed contentedly. She stretched herself and made herself comfortable for a nap. A small smile lit her face as she felt the weak struggelings of her prey in her stomach. The human would be digested soon enough but until then she would enjoy every moment of his demise.<br>\r\nLeon was digested away and not even Shade managed to discover where he had gone.

Back beasts!!\" She yelled at them trying to get them off her partner. \"Rune you have to fly!\" She called to her. \"I .. I cant too heavy...\" The might dragon whimpered, she looked back at her rider hearing hearing her scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw one of the green monsters grab at Alia's leg, dragging her off the back mount and on to the ground. The goblins laughed and cried out as they piled on the fat bronze dragon. Rune roared out trying to gulp the little beasts down as fast as they came but it was no good. Soon the two of them were over powered by the hord. Alia yelled and growled, screaming like a drunken sailor at the creatures to let them go, cursing and spitting all kind of volger at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblins chose to ignore the women's screaming, as she was the first to be stripped down of her items and tied up with some rope. She was tossed aside like a bag, while the rest of the hord went on to tied up Rune in some special chains just in case they ran in to a dragon. From then on they will decide on what they should do to them next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRune and Alia had to think of something fast or you two might end up as a meal to one of the many goblins.</span></div></div>",

You don't have to worry for you have my rider.  And be quick about it for they will not last long with the acid and lack of air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goblin Chief weighed his options.  The monster had swallowed his brother and oldest son.  Could he just kill the dragon, he wondered.  No the monster allowed itself to be bound because the woman was held hostage.  But it would not submit to death, and their weapons could not penetrate its thick hide.  Plus, with the woman as a hostage and the great dragon undrer his control, he would become the greatest Goblin Chief in the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\", he said , \"unchain the dragon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRune raisied her back legs high and dipped the front of her body low and began to hack.  In a few moments a great lumpy mass could be seen quickly moving up here throat, and a moment later, with a great retching sound she vomited the mass of writhing, choking goblins, as well as gallons of stinking, acid vomit all over Alia and the Goblin Chief, knocking them both down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head immediately darted forward to snap up the Chief, shaking the sword out of his hand before bolting him down. And before any of the goblins could react, she snatched up Alia, and with her stomach nearly empty, leaped into the air, and to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRune dropped Alia on a rock ledge way from the Goblins, and went back to wreak her revenge.  With their leader devoured, the Goblins were demoralized, and seeing the dragon return, caused them to break formation and flee into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was their death sentence, for divided they were nothing but morsels of dragon food, and Rune began the chase gobbling them up as they ran, and when the remainder went into hiding, her senstive nose ferreted them out.  Very few escaped, and again too heavy to fly, she slowly crawled back to the the spot of the first battle, and gulped down the struggling and dead goblins in the pool of vomit, and like a dog lapped up all of here mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent and sluggish with her enormous, meal she lulled off to sleep not realizing she had left Alia on a ledge, covered in dragon vomit.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia paced back in forth on the small rock  ledge, wondering what became of her dragon partner.  She itched, and stunk horribly but there was nothing around to clean the slime off with save for chips of sharp stone.  It would be dark soon, and dangerous predators would begin to lurk, and she wasn't sure if here terrible smell would attract or repel them.  It looked like there was was a way she could climb to the bottom, but then what?  Without her huge companion as protection, she would never make it back to a human settlement.  She weighed her options:</span></div></div>",

I just cant wait for her\" she said as she turned around, and slowly put her foot on the rock below the one she is on. \"ok .. this isnt so hard\" she said, slowly putting the other foot on it.

A big nest with 2 large eggs, one was cracked open with no chick inside the other was not even open yet.

Still it wasnt a good idea to use the egg as sapport when someone lended aganst it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough she fell forward, cracking it open and pouring the goo all over her body. At least it had washed the vomit off. \"ugh ... eeewww\" she said looking at her body. Sitting back up on the nest she had to get crawl down the rock side before, what ever lied these eggs had come back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to move quickly befor--\" her body froze as two large wings flapped on down, then a thud as the mommy or daddy came back. Slowly Alia turned back to see who it was, to her surprise it was a couatl, those huge beautiful wings tucked in against it's serphant body. Scales shinning against it's body from the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt cocked it's head to the side in confusion as it looked to Alia. It leaned in close and started to sniff her.

Still Alia didnt need to complain as long she didnt end up a snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature opened one of it's wings, folded it over Alia and bring her close to the other egg. Lending it's head in the still unhatched egg the creature started to nuzzle, and lick it. It seems to be waiting for it's other child to be born. Yet while the couatl baby was still developing the couatl mother would turn it's attention back to Alia, nudging her a few times, giving her belly a couple licks. The dragon rider giggled and wiggled softly under it's head. She was rather ticklish about her stomach but the mother wasn't playing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rider looked on and can tell that the mother was big.. maybe able to swallow 3 or 4 humans at a time by the look of it. Coarse she knew what the mother would do next. It started to bring up it's latest victim from the pits of it's stomach making a very slight budged in the neck. Now Alia started to worry again about what she will be feed. Couatl are snake like creatures and they like to eat things whole. So if she's given food, will she be able to eat it? and keep up the child couatl act?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother soon leaned in close, coughing up a furry, a small mouse boy who was captured at the wrong place at the wrong time. It was out cold for now and the creature just nudged it close. Alia gulped, as she was hungry but still worried that she cant eat it whole. \"I .. need to try\" she said not wanting to end up as a meal herself. Grabbing the mouse boy she pulled him close, moving it's head to face her then she opened her jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a mother, she helps with her \"child\". Taking her tail and started to stretch her jaws and lips seeing her having trouble with the meal. Alia winced and looked to \"mom\" as she stretched her jaws.</span></div></div>",

The dragon can easily BBQ this bird but he would also set fire to the forest and endanger his rider and the people of the village nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he charged forward alerting the bird with a throw of his tail and reach out to grab the dangling legs that hung from it's mouth. \"let go damnit!\" he snarled moving backwards, his clawed hand keeping a firm grip. the gryphon hissed and gulped, following his claw then just go against it when Shade pulled. \"My food\" It screeched, fluffing it's wings up, gulping up past the boy's waist now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the silver dragon got worried as the only thing left was his legs and every time he tried to pull away the gryphon would follow his grip, and swallow more of him. \"Grrr no way!!\" he yelled, letting go but suddenly clamped his jaws safely around the rider's legs and started pulling and sucking on him. Even if this was a death struggle between a gryphon and dragon, Shade couldn't help but savor the tasty body within his jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon whimpered as he was caught between two mouths, being a eating-o-war toy between two beasts. \"Ah ... Shade .... help\" He cried, suck tightly in the gryphon. He would fight against the tight throat of the bird, trying to help get free.</span></div></div>",

Taking to the skies again they scoured the surrounding land until something caught Leon's eye, it was an old friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shade, look who we have here!\" Leon said as he pointed to a small bunch of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon who had eaten Leon was hiding in the trees and still cleaning off from it's encounter with Shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, I think it's time I pay him back for what he did to you, Leon.\" Shade said as his stomach grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey landed some distance away to discuss how to handle the gryphon. Shade wanted to fly right down there tackle the gryphon immediately, but Leon had other plans, he wanted to have some fun. He told Shade that he wanted to lure the gryphon into the cave they found earlier where Shade would be waiting for him and the gryphon, that way he could rile up the gryphon and completely catch it by surprise like it did him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade agreed to the plan, as it sounded like an appropriate payback for what the gryphon did earlier and he would get his breakfast, not to mention it would be fun. So Shade flew off to the mountain and lay waiting in the cave for Leon to return while Leon walked down to where the gryphon was hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leon approached the small bunch of trees he shouted out the gryphon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bird brain! You missed me last time! You want another chance at this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon waved his butt at the gryphon and smacked it before running off in the direction of the cave. The gryphon was embarrassed and angry after the last time he tried to do anything to this human, he was also afraid of the dragon that followed him around. But he did not see the dragon here and was too angry to think that this might be a trap. The gryphon took to the air to pursue Leon through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon ran through the forest as quickly as he could, looking back over his should every so often to make sure the gryphon was still following him. He shouted taunts to the gryphon saying that it was too slow and couldn't catch him, this only helped to enrage the gryphon further and increase it's efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a couple times the gryphon dove for Leon in the trees, but it missed each time, getting only more frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon was just about to the cave and could see the entrance ahead of him, he knew Shade would take over once he got the gryphon inside.</span></div></div>",

They had found a spot around a bend in the cave that completely covered him in darkness so that he could surprise the gryphon when Leon brought him back. Shade could make out some shapes in the dark but was pretty sure the gryphon would be blind to him, this gave him all the advantage he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time waiting he heard the expected sounds of a chase, the gryphon screeching and flapping it's wings, Leon yelling and running, he was almost there. Leon's steps started to echo and Shade knew he had entered the cave. Leon got closer and closer until he appeared around the bend where Shade was waiting. Leon knew the spot and stopped while the gryphon caught up with him. Leon backed up toward the corner of the bend while the gryphon came into sight of Shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the signal he was waiting for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon grinned suddenly and shouted \"Gotcha!\" to the gryphon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade lunged forward and landed heavily on top of the gryphon, the low ceiling in the cave making it easier for Shade to hold him down. Shade proceeded just like last they met and engulfed the gryphon's head. Shade used his strength to hold the gryphon in place while he struggled and maneuvered him so that Shade could get to work on the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon's struggles were futile as Shade swallowed more and more of his body down his throat. Finally he was almost there, the gryphon's head had entered his stomach and started putting up a renewed fight just like last time. This time though, the gryphon wasn't getting out. As Shade swallowed down the remaining portion of the gryphon outside him he lay down on his side for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon went around to Shade's front and put his hands to the bulge in Shade's throat and stomach, using his hands to feel out the shape of the gryphon inside. Slowly the rest of the gryphon slipped into Shade until just it's rear end and legs were poking out of Shade's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon was hugging Shade's throat when he said \"Hey Shade, wait a little. I have a going-away present for our friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon had become too weak to struggle and just lay there mostly inside Shade. Shade slowed his swallowing and gave Leon some space to work. Leon went straight to the gryphon's sheath and massaged it, trying to coax him into arousal. Before long the gryphon was fully hard and Leon was jerking away at him. It didn't take long before the gryphon reached his orgasm and spurted seed all over Shade's mouth and Leon. When the gryphon finished spurting, Leon walked over to Shade's stomach and patted it saying \"Sleep tight\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade then resumed swallowing down the rest of the gryphon until it was all sitting in his belly, making a protruding bulge in his abdomen. Shade lay down and licked his jaw clean of the gryphon's seed while Leon climbed on top of Shade's bulging stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, you're as fat as Rune now.\" Leon said to Shade while grinning widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade retorted \"Not quite, just one human-sized morsel left to reach that goal\" just as he started licking Leon clean from the gryphon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I've already been down that road before.\" Leon pouted as he wrestled with the tongue licking him clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Leon was all clean they both lay down for short nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shade had anticipated this and was already fully erect, ready to go. He slowly craned his neck down, bringing the gryphon along with it and aimed the gryphon at his erect member.

This went on for some time before Shade started thrusting even more rapidly and finally released his seed inside the gryphon. Shade slipped out rested to regain strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon had quieted during the onslaught and was only twitching near the end when Shade reached his climax.

He was embarrassed about this fetish however, and did not want anyone else to know how much pleasure Shade's feeding brought him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting the dragon to see how excited this prospect was to him, Leon shrugged, and said, \"Sure, Shade, I'll come with you if you like\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade grinned.  Like most dragonriders, Leon  was unaware of his dragon's ability to read his rider's mind.  Shade  knew of Leon's secret, vorish fantasies, and he decided to use this knowledge best to his advantage.  He pressed his body low to the ground to allow Leon to mount on his back, just at the base of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne he felt Leon securely wedged between two dorsal spines, Shade playfully commanded, \"Hold on tight\", and lept into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed north towards the great valley where the Weyr's herd beasts that made up the bulk of the domestic dragon's diet dwelled,  in plain view of many dragons and riders commencing the morning routine.  Curiously though, once out of sight, Shade dipped low beneath the tree line, and circled back, unseen, south.  In a short tie they came to a stone inn, that was known to dragonriders for its stable of whores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade carefully landed on a huge stone boulder next to the inn, careful to leave now tracks, and promptly stuck his head in one of the inns upper bedroom windows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, Leon implored, \"Stop,  Shade what are you doing?  A shrill scream was heard, as the huge silver dragon pulled his head back out with a pair of wildly writhing female legs in its mouth.  His head made a quick jerk forward, and the struggling woman disappeared down Shades rippling, muscular gullet, her screams faintly discernable through the thick dragonhide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon slyly craned his head back to face Leon at uncomfortably close range, and said in a completely nonchanlant tone, \"What am I doing?  Silly boy, I am eating the only prey fit for a noble Silver dragon, besides overly nosy and immature dragon riders, that is.  And I know you won't tell, for if I am banished to the wilderness for breaking the dragon-human covenant, YOU will no longer be a dragonrider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Shade gave a toothy dragon grin, and shot his long forked tongue into Leon's crouch, were it touched a hard knot of muscle.  The dragon whispered, \"Do what I say and we'll never get caught.  Besides, I know you love this, Leon.  Now, how would you like to make love to the next whore inside my mouth, before I swallow her?   Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
