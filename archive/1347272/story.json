Out of the dormintories when he wasn't supposed to be.<br>\r\n He marched up to the suit of arms and peered behind, just as he did so a tiny fist flew from behind the suit of arms aiming for his face, Draco reacted quickly taking it in his hand and pulling, the person who had been hand was yanked from behind the suit of arms...</span></font> </span> </span><br>\r\n</div></div>",

What do you think your doing?\" She almost shouted. Draco couldn't take any chances he held his hand over her mouth and pushed her intoa broom cupboard, but instead of locking her in there till morning he came in after her her, quietly closing the door. </span></font> </span> </span></div></div>",

He gathered her in his arms with a firm grip and pulled her lips onto his.

Hw dropped his hwad into his hands. Sitting on the edge of a crate, small hands wrapped around his wrists pulling him to his feet. He opened his eyes and he could see her soft lips just below her cute little nose a few faint freckles lay across the bridge.<br>\r\n\"Im cold\" Ginny said as Draco wrapped his arms around her once again.<br>\r\n \"I still can't believe I locked us in.\" he said trying to make conversation.<br>\r\n \"I can...and for soe reason I'm happy about it.\"She smiled slightly and then tiptoed kissing him again.<br>\r\n Draco liked her a lot more than he should. She was a Weasley. They were the biggest blood-traitor family, after all and Father would never agree.<br>\r\n Then a sly little thought crossed his mind... what if Father never found out? or anybody else for that matter?<br>\r\n He smiled to himself and then kissed Ginny back with such passion she had to wrap her arms around his neck to steady herself .<br>\r\n \"I think we should get together...\" Draco stated suddenly. Surprising himself.<br>\r\n \"But...we hardly know each other and...\" she was lost for words.<br>\r\n \"I dont care what it takes.\" Draco's heart was set. \"I want to be with you.\" <br>\r\n She looked at the floor then into his eyes. She nodded silently and small smile creeping onto her lips. </span> </font> </span> </span></div></div>",

He pointed the tip of his illuminated wand at the door and said \"Alohamora!\"<br>\r\nThere was a loud click and Draco looked shocked at Ginny who just smiled and reached for the handle. Just as she was about to walk out Draco took her arm and pulled her back infront of him. He kissed her one last time and whispered in her ear \"I'll see you tomorrow. 10 AM here. Please?\" <br>\r\nShe looked into his eyes and nodded, kissing his lips softly for a split second and turning away. Back to Gryffindow tower.<br>\r\nDraco made his journey to the Dungeons alone and un-noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning at breakfast. Draco was up surprising early considering that he didn't get to sleep untill about 2 AM. His dreams had been filled with the smiling face of Ginny Weasley and the comforting thought that he was going to be able to see her again tonight.<br>\r\n\"Yo! Drake, what up?\" said Blaze sitting oppostie him.<br>\r\n\"Um...Nothing?\" Draco was taken aback by this sudden appearence.<br>\r\n\"Well then stop fucking gorming, dude, you really need to wake up, have some pumpkin juice and get to the Qudditch pitch!\" He said laughing at Draco's stupid expression \"Now!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey Blaze...Shud up man!\" Draco said laughing. Blaze was testing him. He didn't have Quidditch this morning, at least Draco knew he was awake enough to know that.<br>\r\n\"Well at least your awake for once. What made you get up so early anyway man?\" Blaze asked helping himself to toast and pumpkin juice.<br>\r\n\"Erm...Guess I just fell asleep lightly last night.\" Draco said to Blaze.<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, man.\" He replied nodding.<br>\r\nJust then Ginny walked into the Hall. Long hair tooked behind her ear on the left side and hazel eyes glittering in the morning seeping down from the enchanted ceiling. Draco was awear he was staring but he couldn't do anything. Ginny felt the intensity of his stare and looked over her shoulder at him as she sat at the end of the Gryffindor table she flashed a small smile which Draco returned with a cute grin.<br>\r\nBlaze looked over just as Ginny was turning around to get something to eat. Blaze scowled at the back of her head and then turned sharply back to look at Draco. Draco had focused his eyes on his plate and seemed very interested with his slice of toast.<br>\r\nBlaze opened his mouth to say something but Crabbe and Goyle sat down to the left of Draco and the right was taken up by Pansy.<br>\r\nHow Draco loathed this girl. She was nothing to him at all. All she did was bitch all the time. He hated her so much when ever he thought of her his skin crawled and he seemed to swear way to much.<br>\r\n\"Hey honey!\" she cooed. Draco felt like cringing but he knew Blaze was still staring at him. He smiled at Pansy and took a large bite of toast, fixing his eyes of Blaze's face, daring him to say something.<br>\r\nBlaze looked back down at his own toast and said nothing. The hall was grdually filling with people coming from their dormitoriers. Harry Ron and Hermione were all sat around Ginny talking about the day before. Draco stood up from the table and everyone around him looked at him questionly.<br>\r\nDraco left the hall and walked up the stair case to the 5th floor. He walked into a empty class room. Draco was counting the minutes and hours until Ginny was with him again. How had he fell so hard for her over just a short period of time. He has wasted so many years hating her he suddenly realised. If they were going to be together then people had to know and he didnt care about the consequences.<br>\r\n When the time finally came for him to meet Ginny. He had been sitting in the common room for way too long. He went to the corridor on the 5th floor and Ginny was already there, he almost burst with relief and happiness. They smiled and Ginny pressed her finger to her lips and led the way into the broom cupboard...</span></span></font>  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

People were staring and weren't even hiding it from them. More and more people were staring now and Ginny noticed it was mostly Gryffindors staring at the intruder at the end of the table.<br>\r\n Just then Harry, Ron and Hermionie entered the hall. Harry and Ron stopped dead in their tracks. Hermionie carried on talking and walking seeming to not of notinged what Harry and Ron had seen.<br>\r\n \"What the bloody hell is going on here?\" Ron blurted out without thinking.<br>\r\n \"Breakfast Ron it happens everyday. Remember it's the most important meal of the day\" Ginny said sarcastically. Draco looked from Ginny to Ron to Harry. <br>\r\n \"What the fucking hell is he sat at Gryffindor table for? Dont his little snakey friends like him any more?\" Ron said sneering at Draco with anger.<br>\r\n \"Ron, calm down Ginny's probably just tutoring him. He's never really been the cleverest person in the world.\" Hermionie just realizing what she was seeing. <br>\r\n \"Can we go sit on your table I can't be doing with people gorming at us like we're breaking the law.\" Ginny said half rising herself off the bench. <br>\r\n \"Just one second babe\" said Draco trying and succeeding in getting a flash of fury out of Ron. \" I just want to know what you dear brother has against me sitting down with you and having breakfast?\" Draco directed the sentence a both a statement and a question to both Ron and Ginny. <br>\r\n \"Your a Slytherin and your also a prick!\" Ron blurted out.<br>\r\n \"Just cause I go out with your little sister, fuck me, grow up!\" Draco spat at Ron.<br>\r\n They stood an inch apart as Pansy came into the hall and strode up to the small argument. Standing at Draco's side she gave Ron the evil eyes before asking Draco what was going in. When he didn't answer she asked again and snapped her fingers in front of Draco's face.<br>\r\n \"Fuck off Pansy! Dont you get the picture I dont like you, what you think is a relationship is nothing at all! I go out with Ginny!\"  Draco almost shouted to the whole hall. Ginny held onto Dracos upper arm ready to hold him back if anything happened, which she had a funny feeling would happen pretty soon. <br>\r\n \"You stupid bitch! Do you know who your messing with? Do you really want that trouble\" Pansy snapped at Ginny stepping forward in Ginny's face.<br>\r\n \"I know what I'm doing. I dont care who you are. I couldn't give a shit\" pansy snapped her hand across ginnys face and stroked away.    </span> </font> </span></span></div></div>",

They had attracted the attention of the whole hall and were being watched by all students but no staff were in the great at the time so they didn't see anything.<br>\r\n Ginny had thought too soon as at that moment Professor McGonagal had entered the hall and was taking her seat at the teachers table taking a glance around the hall she noticed that all sudents seemed to be staring to the back of the hall where Ginny was stood with Draco and the rest of them were.<br>\r\n Ginny realized her cheek was stinging slightly , she raised her hand to her face where Pansy had slapped her only two seconds before. She felt tears fill her eyes but she held them back. Ron was red in the face with anger at both Pansy and Draco. Ginny sensed it was more Pansy he was mad at. <br>\r\n McGonagal strode up to the small group and turned to look at Harry then asked what was happening.<br>\r\n \"Pansy just hit Ginny in the face Professor for no reason\" Harry said glancing at Draco, who was putting a comforting arm around Ginny as McGonagall turned around to look at Ginny. When she saw Draco her faced changed slightly though still stern.<br>\r\n \"Does this have anything to do with you Mr. Malfor?\" she asked crutely.<br>\r\n \"No Proffessor\" the answer came not from Draco but from Harry. Ginny smiled greatfully as McGonagall turned her attention back to Harry. <br>\r\n \"Well okay then. I will see that Severus hears about this.\" with that Professor McGonagall turned to the doors and walked to the dungeons.<br>\r\n \"Thanks Potter.\" Draco said looking at the floor.<br>\r\n \"I wasn't doing it for you! I was doing it for Ginny!\" Harry said sharply. \"I could of just left it but that would of got Ginny more involved!\" <br>\r\n \"Oh just drop it!\" said Hermionie and Ginny at the same time.<br>\r\n \"Cant we just get along please?\" Ginny added looking from Harry to Ron and then at Draco.<br>\r\n They all new it was for the best but how do you become best friends with some you that have been you enmy for so long? <br>\r\n But they agreed to give it a shot. After a quiet breakfast Harry, Ron, Hermionie and Draco made their way across the damp grounds to Hagrid's hut were they had Care of Magical Creatures.<br>\r\n \"I guess that now I'm going out with Ginny, I going to see you a lot more, I just want to get some things straight this time. I'm going to change this year and Ginnys an amazing girl. I've got to know her over these last few days and want me and her to work but that means that we have to work to so its not uncomfortable.\" Draco said honestly but alomst unwillingly.<br>\r\n Harry and Ron just stared towards the small hut on the grounds where as Hermionie nodded encouragingly. <br>\r\n \"I know we have our differences-\" he continued.<br>\r\n \"Really. Only just noticed do you?\" Ron snapped sarcasticly.<br>\r\n \"Oh, Ron, just give him a chance please.\" said hermionie looking at Ron.<br>\r\n \"Im not asking you to be my best friends, Ron, I just want to show you I can be a good person. I'm not even talking to half of my old friends anymore, I really want me and Ginny to work, I really care about her. More than anyone else before.\" Draco said quietly, almost desperately. \"I owe you all an apology for how I've acted towards you over the last few years, I was a hit and I'm sorry. It might not change anything but I'm hoping we can start again.\"<br>\r\n They had reached hagrids now and hagrids was stood outside the hut looking at all the students swarming down to the huts front door.<br>\r\n \"Alrigh' Harry?\" Hagrid boomed happily.<br>\r\n \"Hiya Hagrid! What's in store today?\" harry replied.<br>\r\n \"I think your gonna like toda's lesson\" he said with a small wink.<br>\r\nAs the rest of the class arrived Hagid motioned them to follow around to a small padock just at the entrance of the forest. In the padock were six small beaver like animals, purple in colour, slowly changing colours before their eyes. The class gathered around the padock. Pavarti let out a small \"oh\" with delight at the small creature sniffing at her ankles. <br>\r\n \"I though' they would be a good practical start for this term, I know' las' term want the greates' so I decided not to carry it on\" Hargrid said stepping over the padock and scooping up the nearest of the creatures. \"I thought the girls would like these, seeing' how they're cute an' all.\" he said scratching the head of the one in his arms. \"they're called snuffles. They like to be in small herds. They hate cold weather and changle colour to suit their mood. See how this 'in has gon' pink? Tha' means its happy.\" Hagrid carried on talking. By the end of the class they had been told to get into groups of three or four and pick a snuffle of their own to look after. Harry, Ron, Hermionie and to many peoples surprise Draco were one of those groups. <br>\r\n After that class Draco didn't seem so bad and Harry and Ron were okay with him. He usually sat with them at breakfast and people were less shocked to see them together. <br>\r\n Draco had finally made the right decision and he wasn't about to make a mistake by going back to his old ways.<br>\r\n After dinner the day before Valentines Day Professor Dumbledor came the Slytherin common room in search of Draco.    </span> </font> </span></span></div></div>",

Your father, unfortunately, doesn't. Just remember two things. Love is the most powerful force in the universe, and I will always be here for you, just like I am here for any of my students.\" Heart lighter, Draco turned back to the gargoyles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Professor,\" he said, his voice rougher than normal.

He'd face it head on. \"Hello, Father.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius stood in the middle of the room with his back to Draco, black cloak swept up around him. As he heard this, he turned. His eyes were blazing with rage and his hands were white-knuckled as he clenched them at his sides. \"Is it true, Draco?\" he asked. His voice was velvet smooth, contrasting with the rest of his body. \"Is it true that you and Ginny Weasley are dating?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Draco nodded. \"We are, Father. I like her very much.\" Rage flitted over his father's face before Lucius regained control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to break up with her? It would save you very much trouble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I - I love her, Father. I can't leave her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that she feels the same for you then,\" he said. \"Because you will be needing a place to stay over the summer holidays.\" Draco stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... What about...?\" Lucius's eyes flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My place? Oh no. You see, I fear that I only let family and friends stay at our house. And since you are not either, there is no place for you at home.\" Draco staggered back a few more steps. Disbelief filled his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... disowning me?\" he asked, almost managing to hide the slight catch in his voice. Maybe his parents weren't very nice, but they were his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You don't think I could actually let you go out with one of the blood traitors and still call you family? Surely even you aren't that stupid, Draco.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Draco shook his head slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. For a while you were so promising, but I guess even the best of things can go bad. I hope I never see you again, but if I do, you'll be warned. Stay away from me.\" Lucius's voice lost its velvet smoothness on the last sentence and Draco could hear the pounding fury and violence in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" Draco turned and headed back down the stairs. As soon as he was out of his father's sight, he slumped against the wall. His head fell forward and he stared hopelessly at his hands. He could feel the tears start to well up. What was he going to do?</span></div></div>",

At the very least, she might comfort him. He tried to push a nagging thought out of his head. What if she told him that she'd just been playing with him the last few weeks? That she didn't really like him? No, he told himself. That won't happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he passed Dumbledore, Dumbledore stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. \"Draco, are you alright?\" He shook Dumbledore's hand off, trying to fight the irrational rage he felt. Dumbledore hadn't done anything to him. His father had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" he muttered, staring at the floor. \"I'm just going to go find Ginny. Okay?\" His last words took on a sarcastic, sneering edge. \"I don't need to be babysat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Draco. Watch out, though - your old habits are starting to return. And remember what I told you before you went in.\" Draco nodded reluctantly and started back down the hall, anxious to get away from Dumbledore and his probing eyes and kind ways. He did try to calm down some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found Ginny in the library, talking quietly with Harry and Ron and Hermione. Draco walked up to them and smiled as confidently as he could. Nervous, he ran his hands through his hair. \"Ginny? Can I talk to you?\" She looked up, a smile dying from her face as she saw him. Do I really look that bad? I can't look too messed up, he thought. Can I? The others turned to see what was making her so upset and stared at him. He didn't meet any of their gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" she asked, reaching out one hand to him and touching his elbow. He flinched back some, not ready for anybody - not even her - to touch him right yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me!\" When he saw the hurt spasm across his face he instantly felt guilty and hopeless. First he couldn't keep his father happy and then he hurt the girl he loved? What kind of a freak was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Ron stood up from the table, mouth tight. \"You don't talk to my sister like that, Malfoy! And we thought you had changed!\" Draco stepped back, a headache pounding at his head. He didn't want to get in a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron, sit down,\" hissed Hermione, glancing over at Madam Pince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Ginny,\" Draco said. \"Please, can we talk in private?\" Ginny glanced nervously at the others, then stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Her voice only wobbled a little. He followed her out of the library and into one of the deserted classrooms. When they got there, she turned to face him and spoke before he got a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you dumping me?\" she asked. </span></div></div>",

It's not like they were ever really nice to me or showed that they loved me.\" Ginny bit her lip, then started speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know what that's like. My parents have always been there for me and loved me. But I know that I love you and will help you in any way I can. You can count on me for that.\" Draco smiled weakly at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Ummm... I know this isn't the best time, but I know that I'm not going to have anyplace to stay this summer. Do you think - could you...?\" He trailed off, embarassed to be asking this ofher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I what?\" Ginny asked, perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask your parents if I could stay with you this summer?\" He stopped then, realizing that what he was saying could be interpreted in the wrong way. \"I mean - stay at your house. I know they probably won't want me too, it's not like I've ever been nice to them or you, but... I'll make it up to them, I swear. I'll work around the house if they want, or - or -or do something  else for them, or-\" Ginny interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draco, hush. It's okay. I'm sure Mum and Dad will let you stay with us. They might not realize that you've changed at first, but I think they'd give you a chance. For me, at least.\" Draco smiled, but her words, 'For me, at least,' echoed inside of him. He'd been awful before. Everybody hated him now, except Ginny and maybe Ron and Hermione and Harry, and he deserved it. He'd been mean to everybody not in Slytherin - a complete jerk. And then he betrayed Slytherin by going out with Ginny, a 'blood traitor', as many of them called the Weasleys. He'd have to change that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Ginny,\" he said. He smiled at her, realizing how truly lucky he was to be with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to go back to the library?\" she asked him. \"You don't have to if you don't feel up to it, I'll stay here with you.\"</span></div></div>",

We'll find someplace else where we can talk and work at the same time.\" Ginny started picking up her stuff, and Draco reached out to take it from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can carry it for you.\" Ron glanced over, a surprised look on his face, then turned back to his work.

Where are we going, anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Room of Requirement,\" Draco said. Ginny glared some more at Ron, then whirled and stalked off, the others following. They found it and walked back and forth in front of it several times, everybody focusing hard on a place where they could all relax and work on homework together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they opened the door, it opened to reveal a place that looked very much like the Gryffindor common room, plenty of soft couches and tables and a fireplace.

Draco shifted on the couch, making himself more comfortable, and stared around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon stopped working on his homework and stood up, stretching. Noticing this, Harry, too, stopped working and looked warily between Draco and Ron. Draco didn't move at all, but he stiffened some. Ron dropped his hands to his sides and walked to Draco, towering over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Malfoy, I want to know what you're really up to with my sister,\" he said, his voice low and threatening. \"I was wondering at first, and now I need to know.

Ron inclined his head. If Draco hadn't been staring at him like he was then he might not of noticed at all. Seizing this as an opportunity that Ron would finally over come his passion to beat Draco's head in, he allowed himself a small smile in Ron's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he and Ginny left the Room Of Requirment he laced his fingers through Ginny's. Glancing back over his shoulder he saw the retreating backs of the others as they left through another door they all must of been thinking of. Draco kept Ginny at his side. She lead the way to the Owlery, as soon as she entered her family owl, Errol, was waiting on the window ledge. Ginny tutted under her breath, crossed to Errol, slipping an owl treat from her bag into his beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'd be best to use your owl, Errol, isn't the most efficent and I doubt he'd make it there, Fred and George use him too much at home, for deliveries.\" She said stroking Errol's soft head as he closed his eyes lazily to her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah okay,\" whistling softly through his teeth Draco stretched out his arm for his midnight black eagle to land on. \"I thought you knew I didn't have an owl. They don't seem able to carry the weight of somethings, whereas, Midnight has the ablity to carry excessive amount of weight.\" While saying this Draco pulled a slip of parchment out of his bag, handing Ginny a Quill and Ink Pot and the Parchment Slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny began to scribble down an explamantion of what had gone off and asking if he could stay over the summer. Curling the parchment into a scroll and sealing it in place with her wand, handing it to Draco who carefully tided it to the Eagle's leg. Letting the eagle fly freely from the window. Turning back to Ginny and leading the way down the spiarling staircase.    </font></span></span></span></div></div>",
