You and her had been friends since you were kids, but only started dating for the last couple of months. She was sitting on the couch, looking pleased with herself. You don't blame her; although she, like herself was curious into your family's weird actions over the last couple of years, you could tell she was more pleased about the fact she could finally enjoy herself while see was doing her cheerleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're glad that you're got a much better cheer captain, but that doesn't help me, Megan. Mel got home two weeks ago, and all I got from her when I asked the question, 'So where were you?' was I bet you'd look cute as a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you would\" a male voice laughed. You frowned, not happy with Harry's sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys. Mel's air-brained comments aren't helping. I need your help\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they'll tell you when you're ready\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like when? Don't you want to know? Doesn't it bother you? I know you've still got a thing for my sister\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blushed slightly.  \"I don't know what you're talking about, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you don't\" you said sarcastically. Slightly thirsty, you decided to get some cola. As you got up, you tripped over something. You saw it was some kind of leather bound book, like something out of the school's library. \"Real mature, guys\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, John?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This book. How did you get this old fashioned encyclopaedia?\" you asked, mainly towards Harry. He had a really strange hobby of collecting antiques and then selling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't mine\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me\" Harry protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks like the sort of junk you collect. The 'magic' book. Original\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was not an unpleasant sensation but it definitely felt strange. The feeling passed quickly but it felt you in a strangely placid mood as you opened the cover. \"That was odd.\" Muttering, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's odd?\" Looking over your shoulder, Megan asked. She looked at the book. \"The pages are blank, that is strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rose a single eyebrow. The pages were filled with words but in a language you did not recognize and the pictures seemed strangely out of focus. \"Yeah... they're blank.\" slowly, you agreed. \"Maybe its a journal one of my sisters picked up at a curiosity shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you closed the cover, you spotted mom walking in. She looked at you and then the book before giving a low sigh. \"John, that book belongs to me.\" Patiently, she said. \"Please give it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's noting on the pages, Ms H.\" Defending you, Harry said. \"No harm, no foul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not angry with anyone, Harry.\" Smiling slightly, mom said. \"Relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to mom and took her arm. \"Can I have a minute with you, please?\" Whispering, you asked. You pulled her out of earshot. \"The pages are not blank; what is this?.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a book passed on from mother to daughter.\" gently, mom replied. \"It includes a tradition and a year of training that is a well kept secret among the women of my side of the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you not tell me this before?\" handing the book back, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave you a sad look. \"We knew that you would feel left out, being the only boy in the family.\" softly, she replied. \"We thought it best to simply not talk about it in front of you.\" she gave you a sad smile. \"We will see what happens in a month, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a month?\" confused, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom did not answer, she merely sighed and walked away with the book. Worried, you decided to question her more later in private and walked back to your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom is acting weird, bro.\" shaking his head, Harry said. \"What did she say about the book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something passed on from mother to daughter.\" Honestly, you said. \"They didn't speak of it because they thought I'd feel left out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So its a girl thing.\" Smiling, Megan said. \"Maybe you don't want to know about it after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Wincing, you agreed. You paused then added, \"She seemed sad; I wonder why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nor your friends noticed that your hair had grown an inch and was a lighter shade of brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on decide to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know something was wrong, knew whatever it was was somehow linked to your greatest frustration, and you was determined to find out why. Having made up your mind, you quickly walked to mom's bedroom, where you knew mom had disappeared to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. Why are you so sad? You're certainly not yourself\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom took one glance at you, and froze. While Megan and Harry didn't notice the changes to your body, mom could see what was happening to you. Gulping rapidly, she wondered what would be the best course of action. Finally she gave a sigh and answered.<br>\r\n\"John. What would say to me if I told you that I have magic powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, mom. I know something is bothering you, but joking isn't the way to approach whatever is troubling you\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that would be your answer. That is why we kept this from you, that both I and your sisters have magic powers. Plus, I didn't want you to start panicking about something that may or may not have happened. Something that I can know see is unavoidable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. I don't know what you're thinking with all this witch crap, but I can tell that something is going to happen to me. What is it?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please understand, I had nothing to do with this. I don't know whether is due to a curse or some other spell, or your genetics, and you have to believe me that both Hayley and I have done everything we could, but.... you're turning into a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" you growled, tired of this madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about telling you to look at your reflection before telling you.

For the past few years, every time you've seen your reflection you've seen a figure that appeared older than your real age, which to you was a blessing and curse. Blessing, that you liked being bigger and stronger than your peers; a curse that you could not really act your age. Now, your face looked more like the 14 year old you were. \"Mom, you have magic powers? Why are you reducing my age.... MY HAIR!!!\" you screamed as your attention turned away from your face to your hair. Your now longer, blonder hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to believe that I'm not doing this to you, John. From what I can see, you're not just changing gender, you're also getting younger\" mom said, her voice sounding regretful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? You've got to do something. I can't be a kid again! Is this some sort of curse?\" you moaned. <i>Has someone done this to me, thinking its some sort of ironic punishment?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I know you have issues that you feel like you have to act the age you appear, but I have no idea whether its a curse, John. It's possible that its something that would have happened to you, regardless of anything. I just hope you don't get too young. my best guess is at the oldest you'd be is Brooke's age\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god</i> you despaired, wincing at the idea of turning into an 11 year old. \"And worse case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom winced slightly and said flatly, \"Hannah gets a little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, John, but I don't think you want me sugar coating it\" mom said, as she placed her hands behind her back. You stared at her suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you got behind your back? Mom... get that away from me. I'm not wearing that! How did you get that thing?\" you screamed, as mom brought her hands into view, along with the training bra that she was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a witch, John\" mom said, as the bra flew from her hands, onto your shirt. Instantly, it began to sink through it, onto your chest...\"</span></div></div>",

You had mixed feelings; shame and embarrassment that you was wearing a training bra, fear that someone would discover that awkward fact despite that externally nobody could see, and horror since it really made what mom said sink in. Your feelings of embarrassment won out; without waiting for mom's response, you fled towards your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've got to get this thing off. Thank god that Harry and Megan have left</i> you thought, panicked, as you rushed down the hall and into your room. After quickly locking your door, you turned and groaned. All three sisters were waiting for you on your bed. Instantly, you felt your checks blushing, praying that none of them would notice the slight changes to your body or the extra item of clothing that you wore, even though your hair was nearly entirely blond and a couple of inches past your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John. Are you okay?\" Mel asked, her voice sounding slightly anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he was calmer about this, he would say 'what do you think, you stupid airhead'. Of course he isn't okay. We can see that the changes have occurred and from the way he fled into this room, and from the look in his eyes, he knows what is happening to him\" Hayley answered for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't you start calling me and airhead!\" Mel pouted, causing Hannah to giggle slightly. She knew what you'd call your twin when she's at her ditzier best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, just leave me alone. I need to think\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you need is our help\" Hannah said, as the older sisters slowly nodded .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need your help\" you protested, before adding. \"Unless you can stop this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't. I can't even slow it down. Take a seat\" Hayley said, causing the blood to drain from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to see your magic. you'd probably give me a magic makeover\" you said. as you raised your hands defensively. Hayley gave a slight smile and to your horror, your nails began to grow out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is happening now?\" you moaned at the sight of your now long nails<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was me, John. Let me show you how shape them, then I'll paint them\" Hayley said, apparently taking the lead. Now more angry than fearful, you tried to run, but found you couldn't.

His hair is in his eyes and needs to be made pretty\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I agree that he needs to get his hair tied back, now is really not a good time. See his eyes?

The only reason why I'm any part of this makeover is that I'm trying to help you adjust. I don't want to torment you or something\" Hayley said. It didn't calm you down much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel snorted slightly, as she let you go. \"Sell-out\" You didn't pay much attention; the only thing you wanted was for all of them to leave, preferably with them  leaving with acetone, or something like that. \"We better leave her alone\" Hayley warned, as she motioned for your other sisters to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, mom yelled. \"John.

Typically, there was nothing on the net, and as for your body, you didn't need a mirror to tell of some of the changes; your hair was now brushing against your shoulders which was made even more infuriating since the rest of your hair had rapidly vanished into your body. Worse, something was happening to your face, though it could had been swelling because of your prodding. Still, the idea of rising checkbones wasn't as bad as the changes down below. To your horror, your balls had started to retreat about five minutes before mom's call. It make mom's estimate of a week seem like a cruel joke; from what you could see, you'd probably be all girl by breakfast the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the forth call, mom got up and knocked on your door. \"Forget it mom.

Half the time he just waited for you at the bus stop. but he had been increasingly waiting for you downstairs, though you suspected it was really Mel he was waiting for. While you was furious at Hayley for what she had done to you, you gave her a pleading look; no way you wanted Harry to see you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't come up, Harry. John isn't feeling well\" Hayley said. After a few seconds, you heard his footsteps coming up the stairs. Panicked, you said, \"Do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Hayley said as Harry opened the door. He saw you almost immediately, causing you to wince slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's John, Hayley? And who's that?\" Harry said, confused by the sight of you. You was stunned that he didn't recognize you, until you realized that you was thinner, way shorter, had longer hair done in a girlish hairstyle, and was in girls' clothes. Plus the other thing was that it was obvious that you was a Harrison, yet your clothes was far more tomboyish than anything the members of your family wore. There was no reason for him to suspect you was anything other than a 11 year old tomboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John is at the doctors. I'm....\" you said in the highest pitch voice you could, but Hayley cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't going to work, sis\" Hayley said as she shook her head. \"John is under the effects of some sort of magic, Harry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What are you doing?\" you screamed at Hayley, ignoring a disbelieving Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would figure things out soon\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what is going on?\" Harry said in an annoyed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you don't believe me. All I'll say is that I never knew you wore that. Don't worry, only us will notice\" Hayley snickered as she discretely cast a spell. Harry, annoyed had enough. He stormed out. Once you was alone, you turned to your sister, and asked in a worried voice, \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turned his boxers into plain white panties. Don't worry. Unless he comes across another witch with powers greater than mine, only he, you and me would be able to perceive it. Not even Mel you be able to see\" Hayley said, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly, you slip your hand down and confirmed what you feared; you was now completely a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\" you hissed as you stood up, realizing that wasn't the only change. The room seemed bigger somehow, and that hit you harder than your loss of gender. \"I-I'm ten?\" you moaned as you saw as much of your body as you could. Despairingly, you picked up your discarded top and overalls from the previous day and tried to put them on, only to find that they were too big. Stunned, you sank back onto your bed, wondering what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've got no choice. i hope Hayley can resize these for me</i> you thought as you grabbed your clothes and headed out. A look down the hallway told you that Hayley's light was off, but the bathroom light was on.

A few seconds later, you heard the door unlock, and you took your chance. you entered the bathroom and saw Mel's tear stained face despairingly looking at herself in the mirror. She was in her underwear, but you could see it was heavily padded. there was no disguising the fact she now looked like she did when she was twelve. She turned to stare at you, and started sobbing as she saw that you looked like a ten year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay\" you said, trying to comfort her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it will not. You're little, which means I'll be little\" Mel sobbed. While initially you felt sorry for her, you quickly became annoyed; it was you, not her than had more to lose.

Dropping to the ground, you pressed yourself against the top of the stairs exactly the same way as you did when you was eavesdropping on Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By now your sister would have completely changed into a girl and will need a new name. I've got my own idea what to call my daughter, but I want your input. What do you two thing?\" mom's voice echoed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She needs a pretty name\" Hannah's voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm torn. A part of me says something like Melissa, but another says a whole bunch of 'J' names. Jenny, Jodie, Joanie...\" Hayley suggested, cutting off Hannah. She was cut off herself by Hannah's giggles at the mentioning of 'Joanie'. \"That's cute\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Hayley said dryly as she cleared her throat. \"What my brain says though, is to stick clear of any name starting with J, or Mel. Mom, your thoughts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you listened, you felt even angrier. They were planning to rename you. and didn't even have the courtesy to discuss it with you.

Look at me! Its my life that has been ruined\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disrupted, not ruined, missy\" mom said. You winced, knowing that itself is a girls' name, but you felt mom was too casual, too dismissive of your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right.

Megan was still comatose, but Harry had an odd look on his face. You couldn't see it, since he was tied facing away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to. You don't understand, Lucy\" Hayley said, defending her actions. Her words had several effects. Harry gave a bemused snort at the mentioning of 'Lucy', which didn't improve your temperament, but her demeanor was the thing that was pushing you to breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do understand. All this is hard enough for me to deal with without you driving away the only people that could make be feel anywhere remotely normal. Let them go right now, Hayley, or I'll...\" you threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smirked slightly.  \"You want to fight me? You might be my little sister, Lucy... but you cannot win a fight against me\" Hayley said to another one of Harry's snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're threatening my friends, assuming they're not completely freaked by you, or the fact I'm a kid\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. If you're able to defeat me, I'll let them go and apologize\" Hayley said, giving you a shark-like grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you really make a poor villain, Hayley\" Harry said, a comment you found odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Harry\" Hayley said. regaining her composure, Hayley said, \"If you lose, you lose those overalls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?

You're forgetting that they did not run\" Hayley pleaded as you walked out of the room, to the laundry. You picked up and filled a bucket, which you carried to the freezer ensuring that you had ice-water. Smiling grimly, you took it back to your tried up friends, and without a word, poured it over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do that for?!\" Megan protested, the water effectively breaking whatever sleeping spell that was on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew why! This is the worst thing that I could ever had thought could happen to anyone. Look at me!\" you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make a cute girl, Jonny.

Mel was still there, pouting about how childish she looked though you didn't care about that. Instead you grabbed her make up box, which you guessed (correctly) she would had grabbed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing with that?\" Mel asked, slightly surprised. You ignored her and walked downstairs, where Megan and Harry were shivering, stilled tied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm a 'cute girl'. Do you know what that means in <i>this</i> family?\" you hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They know, sis. I know you're upset but you have to calm down\" Hayley urged, but you was far too worked up. You opened up Mel's make up box and grabbed one of her lipsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the things that will be forced onto me is this\" you yelled, madly waving the exposed pink cylinder somewhat menacingly towards Harry. \"How would you like it, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me.

We still want you in our lives, missy, but not if you're going to be some girlish brat like Hannah\" Harry said, softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you dropped the lipstick. \"What now?\" you asked, most of the fire going out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry said....</span></div></div>",

Can you see what is happening to me?\" you snapped, angered slightly by his comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I'm not going through some magical transformation, it doesn't prevent me from going. Besides, we both know how Mrs H would react if I stayed here\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you said dryly. Mom had always been pressing you (and your sisters) about a good education. A few times in the past you had feigned sickness, only to become sick for real within a few hours; sickness you now knew was generated by her magic. While you knew Harry and Megan knew nothing about mom's sick day spells, they both knew about the previous incidents, and they were smart enough to make educated guesses. \"Guess I'll see you after school. Enjoy\" you said, perking up slightly. Skipping school due to magical regression was about the only thing that you found enjoyable about the whole experience. Sighing, you flicked your hair from your face. <i>I have to do something about that</i> you thought as you walked up to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                  ................................................................................ .................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, a drained looking Harry pushed open the front door. \"How is the little cutie?\" Harry said, almost laughing as he entered. You didn't find it at all amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If mom gave me a magic book, you can find out for yourself\" you growled. During the day, you'd lost another few months of age, making you appear something akin to a 9 year old. Mel was slightly better, though her 10 year old appearance caused her to remain in her room practically all day. Even you offering for her to pick your hairstyle didn't break her out of her slump. Mom eventually intervened, first by fixing your hair by giving you a very girlish hairstyle, which clashed somewhat with your pink overalls, then magically forced her way into Mel's room and had a long talk with her. You didn't know what about, but you heard 'Lucy' several times when the screaming got loud enough to break down mom's anti-noise spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry John, but even you must admit you look cute. Just blame it on my black sense of humor\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Where is Megan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At cheer practice. She said something unpleasant came up and it stopped her from coming straight home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unpleasant? Like a new coach?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See refused to talk about it, but Megan had a real sour look on her face. Like yours if I said you needed a pretty dress\" Harry said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to see that\" a voice said. It was Hayley. After a few pleasantries, she said to Harry. \"So, you're going to babysit my little sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will be a handful\" Hayley giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would expect nothing less from 'Lucy'.  Maybe I should take her to the mall\" Harry said, flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your funeral. She hates the mall\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I. But I think she would prefer it with me than with, I dunno, you\" Harry countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know nothing about babysitting\" Hayley said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Harry said, unaware that Hayley had cast a spell. You gasped, torn between horror and bemusement as Harry changed into a 14 year old, female version of himself. She was average height, but petite, with rosewood colored hair which was about shoulder length and had b- cupped breasts.  Harry had no such torn feelings once she discovered what had happened; she angrily turned on Hayley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, you felt like changing Harry yourself after what happened that morning, but you had since calmed down. Just because fate dealt you a poor hand, it didn't feel right that she could mess with Harry and get away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley!

Twice you've put spells on me, and what makes you think I want anything to do with you?\" Harry snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll feel better once you're got more suitable clothes on. Mel would have some, though I think Megan's stuff would be more of your size. Don't worry about the doc; she has know about mom's secret for decades\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Doc Thompson knows about magic?</i> you thought, annoyed but the scene you witnessed. Seeing that it was going nowhere, you said, \"This is going nowhere, bro. She is in one of her moods, probably PMSing, and got this whole idea stuck in her head. And they say that I'm stubborn. Lets get out of here\" you said, half-growling. Harry nodded, still not happy with Hayley, but you could tell she was pleased by your check. You was the only one that could said such things to Hayley's face and get away with it. Harry followed you, but no without giving Hayley a death stare.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I doubt she would care what we take, as long as we don't do anything stupid. As you unlocked the door, and opened it, you immediately saw that you was wrong; Dr Thompson was getting up from a chair. Unflinching, you looked at her and said, \"My sister decided to have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that, though you know it could had been worse.

What about you? I think I still have some of Megan's old stuff\" Dr Thompson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. Once Harri had gone upstairs, you decided to press Dr Thompson for some answers. \"Do you have any abilities....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Thompson laughed. \"You meant, 'Am I a witch?'. No. Neither Megan or myself have any magic powers. I suppose it would be of some comfort for miss Rich. She is much cuter as a girl, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'O-kay.

It took less than a minute for you to Megan's door to open, and for you to hear a faint clicking sound. <i>She couldn't had picked any heels?</i> you thought, confused. Seconds later, Harri came into view, and instantly, your jaw dropped in total shock. Harry was wearing a cream colored spaghetti strapped top that did reveal her new assets, as well as a pleated green skirt. The clicking sound was caused by some strappy sandals which were slightly too small for Harri's feet, which more surprising, showed her recently painted nails. to finish it off, Harri's hair was tied with a green bow into a high ponytail.

A week earlier, you would had loved the idea of being alone with Megan in her room; now it just made you feel even worse. Megan, seeing your dejected look, placed a hand on you shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I hate this too, but you can be like my little sister\" Megan said kindly.

It'll be okay for you to wear it through the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing you had to accept, you nodded and allowed Megan to dress you in her old uniform. Once she had finished, she winked at you before saying, \"Why is Harri taking so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been twenty minutes, and considering the way she has always commented bout me, I thought she would be in and out of that shower.

At first you was bemused that it was the first time that Mel didn't want to go to the mall with Megan, but your amusement wore off the moment you approached it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lucy. Its not like anyone will recognize you\" Harri said cheerfully. It was disturbing; apart from a few moments where she had insisted that mom should change her back to normal, Harri has fully embraced her newly found femininity, even to the point of wearing a similar outfit to the one she wore the previous day. One that brought out the best of her teenage girl body. You stared at Harri, wondering what she's thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right, Lucy.

Seeing that you was getting second thoughts, Megan placed her left hand on your shoulder. Seeing that you had little choice, you allowed Megan to strip your clothes off and pull the dress onto you. As Megan was buttoning up the dress from the back, something that you found both demeaning and embarrassing, you heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy. Why are we going in there? Even dumb old Brooke wouldn't wear those\"  the voice whined. It was your girl taunting cousin, Tim, who was one of the last people you wanted to see in your present form.

Get back here\" Catherine boomed, which was a worrying sign. It meant that Tim was on the loose. Seconds later, the curtain was pulled open and you was a delighted looking Tim staring at you and Megan.

Five minutes later, she reached her destination, a store called Forester Antiques. It surprised you, as you had the impression that neither mom or Catherine liked it's owner, Samantha.

And do you think I wanted to be in this? Shut your mouth or we''ll both be wearing such things for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you in such a girlish dress?\" Mel asked in the most reasonable tone you've heard her use since this had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think wanted to see me like this?\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Megan would probably be the only person on the planet that would make you willingly and wholeheartedly try it on\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reluctantly would be the correct term. Anyway we kind of got distracted. Our 'delightful' cousin discovered us, and the condensed version is that after aunt Catherine punished him, Tim volunteered to finish up getting my wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim is a girl? And he is trying on our clothes. Ewww. Gross\" Mel said, disgusted. It wasn't the reaction you was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?

You broke the silence by saying, \"I can't believe  you're not even trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying? I am trying, little sis\" Mel said in her same sour tone that she's been using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right. All you've been doing is moping around and complaining how you've lost your curves and boobs. You'll grow them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand\" Mel said, her voice sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or is it magic? You'll regain that too. What about me? I've got to grow up again, though this time as a <i>girl</i>. Face it Melanie, even though you're a kid again, you're still the same vain, self-centered, ditzy airhead.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me an airhead, princess\" Mel threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?\" you said, purposely sticking out your tongue in a childish manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may not be able to undo this room, or my regression, but i can still do this\" Mel said, as a flame shot out of her right palm. It wasn't strong, the flames pale and only half an inch high, but it seemed to strengthen as Mel grew angrier. She glared at you and said, \"Maybe you need further introductions to girlhood, <i>Lucy</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give my own lessons. Lesson one,while its not ladylike, punching you in the head is now an option\" you snarled, as you clenched and unclenched your fists. As you did it the second time, a slightly stronger flame shot out of your own hand. Seeing it happen to your twin minutes earlier calmed prevented you from having a full freak out, but you was still alarmed. The only good thing was that it took the fight out of Mel. She walked over to you and wrapped her arm around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fold you fingers against your palm and the flame will extinguish\" Mel instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this possible?\" you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a girl, Lu. You'll be asking that question again in five years\" Mel said with a wry smile. Staring at you, Mel added, \"Magic is induced by a couple of things. Twins witches strength each other. That's why both of us can still work magic. if either Hayley or Hannah were in our shoes, they'd be powerless. The other thing is that strong emotions power magic, though I think we'll tell mom that you was wanting to 'tomboy' this room. I don't think she would be too pleased to hear that ignition occurred because you wanted to knock me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. What would had happened?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel nodded. \"Usually the punishment for fighting would be rendered powerless, but I suspect mom would have us both in dresses for a long time. You would hate it because its a dress, and I would hate it because its so.... childish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what outfits Timmy.... no.... Christina will be getting us\" you wondered aloud. It was a question you got answered an hour later.</span></div></div>",

Not going to happen\" you said, as breathed sharply at the sight of clothes that Hayley had just grown out of. Especially the pink bra, which unfortunately seemed to be in the c range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry John, but there are three things women in this family are known for, and bustiness is one of them.

Immediately, you tried plan B; hiding it until you can get help or force Hayley to remove it for you, but soon found that was pointless. The skirt was too full for you to stuff into any of your jeans (which were already ill fitting thanks to your physical changes), and it did nothing to hid your heels, or your gloved hands. Gulping, you saw that you had no option. you had to come out into the open. Cautiously, you opened the door and glanced into the hall.

She turned to you and Harry. \"Please, you two, get out of here. I can handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the three thugs then at Harry who had the same idea in mind as you did. \"You guys had better start showing some convincing proof that you have any such authority.\" Folding your arms, you said. \"This woman may be the 'black sheep' of my family but she is still family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha turned to you surprised but smiled slightly at your loyalty to family, even the 'black sheep' as you had put it.

That proved to be a big mistake on his part as you reacted fast and twisted his arm instead. With one push, you slammed the man's head against a display table, breaking the glass. This move stunned the man enough for you break free from his grip. The man retaliated by grabbing a bottle from the broken display and shattered it over your head. Its contents pouring all over your head and face. Angered, you hit the man with a round house, sending him to the floor unconscious. You sighed, looking at the display case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the mess, aunt Samantha.\" Apologetically, you said. \"We'll pay for any damages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I fear you will.\" Wincing, Samantha replied. \"You should have just left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out!\" Interrupting her, you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha screamed, narrowly avoiding a swing from the second man. Harry was attacked by the third man only he was surprised by Harry's strength. Harry slammed an elbow into the man's ribs before twisting free and sending him to the floor with a series of powerful blows. Desperate, the man started throwing things at Harry. One bottle broke onto his hand, sending a sweet smelling liquid splashing all over him. It painfully seeped into his cuts from the scuffle. Cursing, Harry landed a fierce blow, sending the man to the floor unconscious before turning to the second man. You had him cornered only he was holding Samantha in front of him as he put handcuffs onto her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her go if you want to walk out of here on your own two feet!\" Angry, you threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither you or Harry noticed that your voices had raised several octaves. Nor did either of you notice your longer hair or extra weight on your chests. The second man was staring at both you and Harry, his eyes wide in either fear or desperation. \"This was supposed to be an easy in and out operation.\" Clearly nervous, he spluttered. \"No one said anything about having to deal with witch boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case you haven't noticed, we're girls!\" Unimpressed, you yelled. \"Let go of my aunt Samantha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked at you, stunned.

Samantha was not permitted to have either one. Her only saving grace was that they were only splashed and not ingested, there was a chance the effects could be reversed if she was quick about it.

Right now, you and Bethany were girls, and thought yourselves as girls, but you still had boyish interests, including clothes.

Before she left her shop, she loaded two small darts with a counter agent that would buy her some needed time to reverse the potions' effects. Once ready, she carefully followed you and Bethany, making certain not to be seen. It was no surprise to her that you both walked into a women's clothing store; there was a huge sale on skirts and dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we need to update our look, Beth.\" Smiling, you said. \"Mom has been nagging me about her no tomboy rule for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my mom has been mentioning it too.\" Giggling, Bethany replied. \"Let's make their day by getting something really feminine for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one who gets the biggest reaction wins.\" Grinning, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany smiled. \"You are on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha watched, trapped between bemusement and fear as you and Bethany walked about the crowded store, picking out skirts and dresses for yourselves.

Slowly, Samantha assessed the situation and wondered if she should take the shot anyway. Before she could decide, Megan moved, breaking Samantha's line of sight with you. \"Damn it\" Samantha hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't. How are you?

She made certain not to leave out any detail as she had already informed Elvira Strange of the situation. \"I managed to give them both the antidote in time but I was forced to expose myself to Viki and her friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head, furious. \"Let me get this straight.\" Softly, she hissed. \"You had two of the most infamous banned potions in their purest form on display in your store!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha gulped as she nodded. \"It was not one of my best ideas.\" Wincing, she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you gone completely insane!?\" Hysterical. mom screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, I gave them the antidote in time.\" In a forced calm, Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It still reduces John and Harry's magic resistance to zero!\" Mom was completely furious and she had every right to be so. \"Do you have any idea how long it took and how hard it was on all of us to build their resistance while keeping them unaware!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other room, Hayley winced as she looked over an unconscious Mel and Hannah. They had heard the screams and came running. Hayley knew it best to keep them out of the fray, at least for the time being.

She sighed, seeing that you and Harry were being to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrrgh\" you moaned, semiconscious. The antidote, combined with the knock-out spray, gave you and Harry the worst headache imaginable. \"What happened?\" From your point of view, you could remember everything up to the point of getting teleported out of the mall, but you felt that it was some sort of crazy dream that shouldn't be mentioned to anyone. Ever. 'I must had eaten something hallucinogenic' you mused. As you fully opened your eyes, you saw Harry sitting up with his eyes half closed, as well as Megan, Lauren and Vikki. All three cheerleaders were beginning to stir as well, but that wasn't the problem. The problem was their mere presence. \"What the....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom bit her lip, knowing this wouldn't go well. Even though she had been nice enough to get you out of the girlish clothes, the three girls would be expecting Lucy and Bethany. Her fears were realized as your voice aroused the girls; one look at you and Harry resulted in all three of them screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! L-Lucy. You-you're a\" Megan screamed, her eyes wide open. Both Vikki and Lauren were having similar reactions, which in turn caused harry to have a major freak out as he realized his 'dream' was real. Before you could scream yourself, or things got too out of control, mom stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that all of you got involved in this. I'm afraid our 'friend' Samantha Forester is a witch\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...Why Lucy?\" Megan protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be surprised to know that 'Lucy' is your boyfriend\" mom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lauren spat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forester covered this by altering your memories. I have no doubt that she would had done it to you as well, Lauren, except that you, Vikki, have a natural inbuilt resistance to magic\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She altered my memories?\" Megan said, her eyes wide in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one. Poor John and Harry truly thought they were girls\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. How do you know all this?\" you demanded, your voice icy and fearful at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"It doesn't matter now. Forester is in major trouble for transforming you boys, albeit accidentally, and even more so for revealing magic to Vikki and Lauren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is that... thing?\" Vikki demanded. Both her and Lauren were deeply unnerved by everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha? I know you're in shock, probably disgusted and freaked by everything, but I wouldn't go calling a witch a 'thing'\" mom warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" you asked. \"Where is she? And how do you know? Is this why you always told me to avoid her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get her. Don't worry, she is now relatively harmless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harmless? Mrs H, she messed with my reality!\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me\" mom said. Five minutes later, she returned, dragging a teenaged girl with black hair and a scowl on her face.

Her eyes could be quite frightening when she was serious and, at the moment, she was as serious as you had ever seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is never a good idea to take the law into your own hands, young lady.\" Firmly but kindly, mom said. \"Now, I understand you are angry for what she did but please allow a more experienced person deal with her punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if reducing me to a thirteen year old wasn't punishment enough.\" Grumbling, Samantha complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should consider yourself lucky you are not playing dress up with my youngest daughter.\" Ice in her voice, mom countered. \"You know what your punishment involves and you better not screw up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha winced then frowned deeply. \"What about them?\" Gruffly, she demanded. \"Now that they know about us, what should we do with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Lauren and Viki stiffened. They looked as if they were trapped between running or screaming. However, they relaxed as mom gave them a warm smile. \"Et hoc est, non recordabor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, Lauren, and Viki stumbled back slightly as if they had become dizzy for a moment then turned to see you and Harry standing in front of them. Viki was the first to speak. \"John, Harry... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, you spoke up. \"You were here trying to get me to talk Megan into trying out for the college cheerleading team.\" Calmly, you said. \"They are holding high school tryouts this coming Saturday at the school gymnasium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the truth as they had been trying to get you talk to Megan about it for a while. That and you saw them at the mall. \"Oh, right.\" Slightly confused, Lauren said. She turned to Megan. \"It's a great opportunity to get on the squad early and show up Kristy Hart who did not make captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan giggled. Kristy Hart was a queen bitch and the captain of the cheer squad until she graduated high school. She thought she would be just as big in college but that is an entirely different world. As the girls talked over going to the try outs with you and Harry putting in their two cents, mom whispered in Samantha's ear, \"Viki is highly resistant to magic but not to subliminal suggestion. I merely suggested to her mind, 'you will not remember this' and she will not.\" She giggled then added, \"That is how I take care of business... <i>niece.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha grumbled. \"Show off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom then pulled Samantha out of the room. \"You remember what you have to do to earn your rightful form, do you not?\" Firmly, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded. \"I must rebuild John and Harry's resistance...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you cannot, penalties will come into effect\" mom said darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Natalie\" Samantha snapped as she stormed  out of the room. She was so loud and angry, the noise of Samantha's temper tantrum traveled to the den, where you, Harry and Megan were trying to make sense of things. While she hadn't confirmed it, you was certain that mom was a witch herself. Plus you was trying to help Megan, who was still affected by Samantha's spell. She accepted the truth, but was still deeply unnerved by everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she doing?\" you said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but it sounds like Mrs H read her the riot act\" Harry said, wincing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, but you quickly realized that Samantha was going upstairs. It caused you to panic; you sprang up from your chair. \"Where are you going, John?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That witch is going upstairs. I cannot allow her to go anywhere near my room\" you said, as you rushed for the staircase. By the time you reached it, Samantha wasn't in sight. You didn't stop to think whether the stairs themselves could have some sort of enchantment; you rushed up. As you was halfway up, Harry and Megan had caught up with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Maybe she has put a spell on those stairs\" Harry yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled as that thought sank in. Instantly, you paused and glanced around looking for a sign whether things were safe. To your surprise, you saw that magic had been at work, but not in a way you had expected. \"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, John?\" mom called from her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is an extra bedroom between my room and Melanie's. What is going on? You never told me how you know about Samantha. Right now, I'm guessing that you're a witch yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom didn't answer, though it was clear in her silence she wasn't going to deny anything. Deciding to risk it, you climbed up the stairs and headed for your room</span></div></div>",

The fact there is an entire new room up there gives me the creeps\" you grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep her away from me, John\" Megan said, with Harry nodding vigorously seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. I think I'll send Hayley to investigate. Mom has done everything but say 'I've got magical powers', and if she has them, why wouldn't Hayley or Mel have them?

It was a relief to go to bed, but the stresses from the new family arrangement wasn't, least you thought it wasn't, enough to keep you awake. As you closed your eyes, you hear someone opening your door. It wasn't loud; if you had been asleep it wouldn't had woken you, but in your restless state, you heard it easily. Carefully to give the impression you was sleeping, you opened an eye to see who was coming inside. It was Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha smiled as she saw you 'asleep'. Due to her only having forty days, and that you would likely freak out if you was conscious, she decided to not waste any time and start that night, using mom's tactics. She walked over towards you, knowing that casting the spell from the door would be riskier than at point blank range. <i>Good. He's still asleep. He'll never know that for the next five hours, she'll be a girl</i> Samantha mused as she quickly cast the spell. As your hair started to lengthen, Samantha leaned over to admire her handiwork. It was a mistake; you fully opened your eyes and punched her in her head.</span></div></div>",

Even though your voice was still normal, you fanatically started checking your body, much to Samantha's amusement. Chest normal, crotch normal, clothes normal.... Seeing that Samantha was laughing slightly, you angrily turned on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What part of me is girlish?\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Samantha said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you do, isn't it?\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly, but not this time. You're 100% male, and you proved that when you (giggle) started feeling yourself up\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" you demanded warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hadn't been so preoccupied, you would have noticed the extra people in the room\" Samantha said. You span around and saw nine sleeping bodies, all of you. Unnerved with seeing yourself, you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, isn't it? I've manifested different aspects of you into physical form\" Samantha said proudly. \"I can then....\" She didn't get any further; mom started pounding on her door. \"Open this open this minute, Forester, or I'll have you reduced to a five year old boy.\" Grinning, Samantha complied, and mom started in shock at seeing ten of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done?\" mom gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just manifested John's personality into....\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you have done! Restore him this instant\" mom snapped in a half frightened voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" you asked, concerned by mom's fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is risky magic, son. Plus I don't want to deal with any of your clones baring your negative traits\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that one?\" Samantha said, pointing to one with black ribbon pigtailed. \"Yes, that one has all of John's more unpleasant traits all combined, but that one is contained. If it even five feet away from me, it turns into a three year old girl. As for the others, we have Fear, and Curiosity, and Courage....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! Put him back this instant, and do something about those pigtails. It looks ridiculous on a 14 year old boy\" mom ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Its just not my children I'm thinking of. Its also John's friends. His girlfriend is already scared stiff of both magic, and of you! The last thing I need is for her to encounter anything more than one John. Especially that 'evil John' you've created. Plus have some feelings for all the Johns. My son was scared when he woke up; imagine nine more such encounters\" mom said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it or I'll have you back to childhood so fast.....\" mom hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but don't blame me....\" Samantha said as she cast her spell. Instantly, the nine other yous disappeared, and you felt stronger. that said, you felt uncomfortable by Samantha's expression. \"What were you going to say?\" you demanded with barely contained civility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I placed tons of safeguards to keep of you, well the other yous, in check. They last a day, which is more than the clones expected lifetime, so unfortunately, the safeguards have been transferred to you. One of them is that you have to be in proximity to me. That means me coming to school with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" mom growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another should be clear. i prefer at times to stick to what I know best\" Samantha said, in a voice that was trying to hide her glee. You looked down and saw your shoes had almost changed to black. Screaming, you watched as they hardened, became more rounded, and the laces disappeared, replaced by a single strap. Just as bad, your socks started to creep up your legs until you was wearing over the knee white socks. Speechless, you saw that it wasn't just your footwear; your legs also changed. As the socks grew, you legs became hairless, thinner and generally much more feminine looking. You knew what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry John, but this time it's only physical\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. I...\" you growled as the changes spread to your pants. Quickly, they shrank down to your upper thighs before the legs split apart and reformed into a skirt. the skirts quickly changed to a green color, before it started to take on a pleated look. Worse, you could tell that something was going on under the skirt. It wasn't painful, but you could feel your anger growing as you felt something twist in your gut as your hips and rear pushed themselves out. Seeing that you was completely female from below the hips, you angrily stepped in front of Samantha.</span></div></div>",

You took another step forward as you continued,  \"Are you trying to play the 'don't hit a girl' card, or is it 'only the witch that cast the spell can reverse it?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha turned to face mom, like if hoped that mom would intervene, but mom stood by the door, passively watching to see how this would unfold.

It certainly helped with those troublemakers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Troublemakers? If I'd known it would lead to you changing my gender <i>twice,</i> I would never had entered your store\" you hissed. By this point you felt a slight pressure in your chest, and you knew you was growing breasts. Sizable ones for a girl your age, and it fueled your temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. That's not you. You probably would had poured it onto the miscreants\" Samantha countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. You can't seriously be considering sending me to school like this!\" you complained, seeing that mom had finally acted by picking up your discarded, and changing schoolbag. You guessed it was her way of defusing an explosive situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry John, but I have to. Least you'll have Hayley and Melanie to look after you. And your 'cousin', for what's its worth\" mom said, her distaste clear in her voice. \"I'm going to go tell your sisters what's happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment mom was gone, Samantha started babbling an excuse, and a warning. \"You can't let yourself get angry, Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" you demanded, angered by being called 'Lucy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're a twin to a witch, and in a very powerful witch family. It's more than possible that you could spontaneously change, with very little warning, even without any of our 'help'. Natalie knows this. So does your sister, Hayley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could change?\" you scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have strong magical potential, and it could break free from it's holdings. Hell, you might even be princess material, and if I was the evil witch you picture me to be, I could have a lot of fun with this\" Samantha said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Whatever. I just want all the boys kept away from me\" you demanded, as you looked down at you now fully transformed, feminine form. Even in your disgusted state, you could see that you was bustier and curvier than Mel, and definitely 'eye candy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll see what I can do.

A dew ideas had floated through your mind, mainly to help with your new situation. The first was to keep Hannah happy and off your back as you had no desire to play with her as a girl, and the best way to do that would be to remove the main irritant to her a school; the bullies Karl and Greg. Bullies, you darkly thought, were indirectly responsible for you being in a skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing you wanted was help with your friends. Apart from being cuter, it was possible that Harry could mistake you for Mel, especially if your twin decided to try her clothes on you, something that was not acceptable. You had no desire for him to make out with you, accidentally or not. A bigger problem was Megan. She hasn't taken to this magic stuff all that well, and she would not be happy to see you as Lucy once more. While you're certain she would be partially placated if Samantha did something nice for her, you knew she still would be wary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me thing about it\" you said as you walked over to where you friends had gathered. Your fears were soon realized; without your sisters around, Harry thought you was Mel, and Megan distastefully eyed Samantha. Neither of them took it well when you told them you was actually John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Harry demanded, pulling away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! How do you think I felt when you tried to kiss me? you demanded. Seeing Megan's worried figure, you walked over to her and have her a hug. it felt strange having her breasts crushed against yours. \"Hey, it's okay. See Samantha's eye? That's proof she is not all powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan glanced over towards the witch and saw she had a still prominent black eye. \"She had an 'accident', and seems physical actions can interrupt a spell\" you announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B... but you're a girl\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't careful enough around mom. Neither was our 'friend', hence why she's my shadow. Don't worry, between my sisters and I, that witch won't do anything. I think both Hayley and Mel are following us\" you said. Seeing that Megan was becoming calmer, you added, \"Hell, I think the major thing would be your mom. If anything happened to you, the doc would hear of it, and then mom would likely have Samantha in a blue onesie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded, but she still distastefully eyed Samantha.

If Samantha had finally lost it and had actually gone and switched the gender of every boy in school, you knew it would be the final blow to Megan's sanity. It was already too late; Megan was staring at the girls with an increasingly horrified expression. Some of the girls you knew, but a significant number of the girls you couldn't recognize. Worse, that was the ones you could see from the gate. Gulping, you said, \"Harry. Don't step onto the school grounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feminine voice emitted a low growl, causing you to turn in its' direction. It was girl-Harry, dressed in a uniform similar to yours and Megan's, and she did not look happy. It was a good thing since it meant Harry still had his male mind, and that he was as 'appreciative'  of his unwanted gender change as you was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it witch. I'm gonna kill you! Megan, grab hold of her!\" Harry growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan didn't react, so you jumped in. Facing Samantha, you began your tirade. 'What is WRONG with you!?!

She walked over to Harry and said, \"Is that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I like John's idea. Maybe you and 'Lucy' can.... oh crap! You really are incompetent, witch\" Harry snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. In five minutes Hayley and Mel will see what has happened.

You jumped as you saw it was a woman in her mid 30's, wearing a skirt suit. Her black hair was done in a tight bun, and the only other feature was her eyes, which showed she was not impressed. It was the new principal. Ms Gladstone took on the role shortly after Mel's return, which you now knew was due to witchcraft, but you hadn't really had any dealings with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want a word with you, miss Forester\" Ms Gladstone said in a stern voice. \"My office, now.

You've have forced me to, not only clean up your mess regarding our magic resistant cheerleader, but to reveal myself to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reveal yourself?\" you interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, miss Harrison. Considering that there were two, possibly three, very powerful witches at this facility, it was deemed prudent for me to come here, but I was never supposed to reveal my powers.

The room had been sealed for privacy. \"I knew when you stormed out of here, you were not satisfied with my judgment.\" Calmly, she said. \"It was more than just your life that was turned upside down.

That includes keeping one powerful witch on a short leash. <br>\r\nYou have already proven through your actions in the mall that you and your friend can be quick to anger if the right buttons are pushed. Only now magic is involved and that makes you dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"Dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic is a powerful tool, Miss Harrison.\" Darkly, Gladstone said. \"It can be lethal if misused or worse used in a blind fury.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, feeling defeated.

The moment she saw that the school was full of girls, she started to look around, somewhat fearfully, but she really went over the edge when one of the strange, uniformed schoolgirls walked over towards her. It was Adam, one of the former stars on the guys basketball team.  Here, she was Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Viki. Forgot your uniform, again? You're lucky you can wear your cheer uniform\" Alice said in a good natured voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on? Who are you?

To the others, she looked like she was losing it, which was partly true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying that, Viki. Please, I want to understand\" Lauren said in a calm voice, trying to pacify her crazed friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I know something is going on! Just like the mall\" Viki said. By this time, a group of students had gathered in the hall, most wanting to know what had sent one of the cheerleaders over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me talk to her\" a voice said. It was Hayley. Hayley confidently pushed her way through the crowd and whispered into the panicked cheerleader's ear, \"Shut up and follow me.

I'm just wondering if your butt looks bigger. Or if your hips swing slightly as you walk\" Harri said, in a hurried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood drained from your face, as you suspected that you had more messages on your phone. \"I've got to go\" you said without looking at Harri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Is it just me, or is your sister's pranking you? if you had annoyed Mel....\" Harri said, but you had already started to sprint, and Harri didn't want to repeat herself too loudly in case she was overheard. You covered the quarter mile in about a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" you yelled, hoping she was around.</span></div></div>",

It puzzled you, least until you remembered that Hannah had her ballet lessons, and that mom would have no idea that you was still getting the transforming messages. As for Hayley, you had no idea what she was doing, but you imagined that Mel would had told her that you was a 'jerk'. Frowning sightly, you wondered how long mom was going to take and whether it was best to barricade yourself inside the house. Figuring that was your best option, you walked over to the door and began to close it. Without warning, it was pushed back open by Harri, who was breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it John. Do you have any idea how hard it is to run when you have these?\" Harri said, pointing to her breasts.You tried not to look; while Harri didn't have the large bust of Hayley or Mel, there was enough present for Harri to notice. Shuddering slightly, you shook your head. You really didn't want to find out how it felt to have your own set of breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarri's face softened. \"Why did you run? I was only teasing you\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep this between us. I'm in trouble\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How?\" Harri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip, torn between not wanting to freak your friend, but you knew Harri was as stubborn as you, and that a switch of gender wasn't going to dampen her from pressing you. \"Some witch has been cursing me and has been using my phone as the medium to do it. She sends me a message and I change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like your hair?\" Harri inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. i can't believe that nobody has noticed my lighter roots. That said, nobody has noticed your chest, Maybe not the best thing to say, bro. Plenty of people have noticed\" you said dryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Harri asked, seemingly ignoring your comments about some of the guys checking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do? I don't even know who is doing it\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Mrs H has something in her study that can help\" Harri suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom has made it clear her study is off limits. I don't want to be affected by whatever magic stuff she has stashed in there\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking she must have some sort of contact list, John. Do you think I'm crazy enough to go and look through magic potions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stepped closer, but stopped as soon as you heard Harri's giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you nothing was going to happen\" Harri boosted, much to your annoyance.

Ignoring your comment, Harri said, \"I think these are the potions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you asked, not wanting to get a closer view. You was still worried that something bad was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have labels on them, and I can clearly make them out\" Harri said. Seeing your worry, Harri giggled and said, \"You're acting more like a girl than me, John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harri.

John, I think there is something in Mrs H's drawers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding. Keep doing this, and you'll earn the title of 'airhead' from Mel\" you said, shaking your head, as Harri opened the drawers and pulled out what looked like an address book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be joining me, bro\" Harri said, as her attention shifted from the drawers to you. Swiftly, she grabbed you by the shoulders as if she was going to wrestle, but almost immediately, she released you. You winced, knowing she must had felt the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John. What the fuck?!\" Harri said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its my unwanted admirer. Just keep this to yourself, okay?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarri smirked, amused, but nodded. \"its not like I can comment\" she said, returning her attention to the book. As she flicked open the the first page, she gasped, her face twisted with horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of here right now\" Harri yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" you demanded, as you you pulled Harri out the door. It did not bode well that both you and Harri was shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems a security measure for witches is regression\" Harri said, fuming. Something was wrong; while you certainly felt younger, Harri didn't look it. She looked like a smaller version of her bustier self.... almost like a doll......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Harri, now fully changed, almost looked like one of Hannah's dolls, with the only exception was that she wasn't inanimate. She could still talk and walk, though the latter was somewhat difficult as she was only a foot tall, and her proportions were completely out of place. As for yourself, you had regressed back to eight years old; the only mercy was that you was still male. That, and both your and Harri's clothes had resized tp fit your smaller forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we hiding up here?\" Harri whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm currently a little boy with his own Harriet doll. I don't want to be a little girl with her Harriet doll\" you said, your voice torn between amusement at Harri's situation, and worry that someone would think your form isn't 'appropriate'. you hadn't forgotten your secret detractor, and hoped she didn't send any more messages to make a bad situation worse. Ten minutes later, you heard a car arrive, and you knew mom and Hannah were returning from ballet. Grabbing Harri, you hesitantly walked downstairs to meet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah saw and recognized you first. \"John! You want to play?\" Hannah said happily, noticing the 'doll' in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, Hannah. Its Harri in my hand\" you said, forcing down the urge to call your youngest sister an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harri? Do you wanna play?\" Hannah said gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom answered for her. \"Let me guess, you both went into my study.

While there was no chance of Hannah mistreating Harri, you knew Hannah would want to play with your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Persist and you won't be a young boy, John\" mom said in a cold voice.

You're finally following orders\" mom said the instant she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap, mom. What is your game?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's eyes narrowed. \"I'm trying to stop you from doing something rash. Like it or not, you're now directly involved with magic. You know nothing about what you're meddling with, yet you meddled with my study trying to find a cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then teach me. then\" you hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I won't.

It was like wearing a too tight shirt, so it should have be easy to pull over your head. After five different attempts to pull it from your body, you sunk onto your bed. You knew this wasn't an ordinary training bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn witches\" you thought, knowing mom was the only one home. The idea of asking mom for help wasn't appealing, but she did know about it, and you just had to get rid of the think before something bad happened.

Airhead yes, but not that\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its the same thing\" Mel screamed as your door suddenly exploded into splitters. You saw a fuming Mel, along with Megan who was staring cautiously halfway down the hall, ironically next to Hannah's bedroom door. Mel took one step towards you, and instantly her furious face turned into a bemused smirk. You heart sank; such a rapid change of expression couldn't be good for you.</span></div></div>",

Still, nobody has called Harri out yet, so maybe I can get away with this...</i> you mused as you walked down a deserted hallway. Almost deserted; you saw a figure walking towards you, and you immediately flinched; it was a 16 year old girl called Cassie Bane. You hadn't really interacted with her, mainly due to the age gap, and the fact that she had taken the role of alpha bitch from Kristy Hart. While that infamous cheerleader despised younger students, Cassie despised guys.  As she brushed past you, you noticed the slight bemused look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're bemused by something\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you speaking to me?\" Cassie demanded, but her normal icy tone showed that she was amused by something. You started to pray that she couldn't see what you was really wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're finding something amusing. What is it?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to know?\" Cassie said, her eyes gleaming with delight. That did it for you; she could somehow see through mom's disguising spell. It both alarmed you, and made you curious in equal measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know too much about you, Cassie but I bet my sisters would\" you said in a quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's eyes instantly lost their bemused look at the mentioning of Hayley and Mel. \"You have your own abilities, don't you?\" you pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to tell you anything\" Cassie said sourly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anything to do with.... this\" you said, grabbing the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Cassie replied in a prickly voice that made it hard for you to tell if she was being truthful. Without saying another word, she brushed past you and disappeared. You didn't waste any time; you knew you had to warn Harri, and more importantly, get answers from either Mel or Hayley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel was easier to find; she was sitting under a tree, talking to Megan. You hoped whatever it was about would end Megan's silent treatment towards you. Without waiting, you interrupted, saying, \"Mel, what do you know about Cassie Bane?

While you had a mixed feeling with your phone, as you was hoping it would be Megan, with her standing next to you it meant it must be from the witch. knowing a transformation would occur whether you read the message or not, you slowly read it, then passed it to Megan. She scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to attract Cassie's attention, girlfriend, start swaying those hips\" Megan spat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more\" you muttered. \"Get that schoolgirl look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that change.

It's only for a few months\" you said, trying to reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan didn't look happier despite your reassurance. \"I still want to strangle that bitch\" Megan growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agreed, but you knew you had to keep your temper in check in case you inadvertently used your own magical powers. \"Mom has arranged for me to have something to calm me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Harri snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.

Tell me that you're not serious!\" you squeaked in your most outraged voice. Amber is one of the girls from Hannah's class, and was invited to her eight birthday party. One which was princess themed, and had both Mel and Hayley dressed up, much to the delight of all the girls attending. All you knew of Amber was that she wanted a party just like your sister's. Fortunately due to your gender, you hadn't dressed up, but thanks to Cassie, that wasn't going to save you this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to send me to a girl's princess themed birthday party, and have me entertain them while dressed up as a princess? \" you complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It will be a good test of your temperament. Least you get to choose the costume\" mom said as she followed you to your room. You saw a box on your bed, containing about fifty costumes. Disgusted, you started going through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just pick one. You don't want your sister coming up here and start complaining\" mom said, causing you to frown. You felt like slapping yourself; of course Hannah would be attending.</span></div></div>",

I'm not used to this stuff\" you snapped, but Hannah wasn't listening. She dived into the pile of costumes and picked out the teen version of her own costume. Your face fell; of all the princesses she could had chosen, she had to had picked Cinderella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. Wouldn't it be better if we we something different?\" you protested as you tried to wiggle away from your overeager sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sis. We could be matching\" Hannah said in her cheerful voice. You looked over to mom, almost begging for her input, but she gave a slight nod. Of course, Hannah had to make sure things were 'proper', so ignoring her previous concerns about time, both her and mom did everything from doing your hair in the updo and securing it with a blue hairband, to even corseting your waist so the blue puffy dress 'looked good'. Once mom finished your make up, she allowed you to see their handiwork. From your blue gloved hands, to the hair, to the dress, you looked like a fairytale come to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy now?\" you growled, glaring at your still hyper sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so pretty, sis\" Hannah gushed as she flung her arms around your waist. It through you off balance; Hannah's contributions were some glass slippers. Before you could show your disapproval, Hannah grabbed your gloved hand and starting dragging you to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful\" you protested as Hannah pulled you outside. The first person you saw outside was Harri. She had told you earlier that day she had intended to spend the afternoon with Mel, but you thought she would had been over much later. She looked slightly shocked to see a pair of girls dressed like Cinderella, but her shock quickly changed to bemusement once she realized it was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice dress, Jo\" Harri giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up. Do you think I wanted to dress up like this? Mom volunteered me to do a birthday party. And you know what? I need an assistant. You can change on the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarri's smile went flat as you grabbed her hand and dragged her to the car. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While Harri was initially pleased to see her hair turning from rosewood colored to a similar brown she had before all this madness started, she was furious about being in a golden gown with similar detail to your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Harriet.

Stand here and look pretty?' you thought as one girl walked up to you. It was the birthday girl, Amber. She was dressed as Elsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah! I love how you two match. Your sister's costume looks the best. it's almost like the real thing. This is going to be the bestest party ever\" Amber gushed, much to your discomfort. Before you knew it, she wrapped her arms around you, and gave you a hug. Not used to heels, you fell over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not used to this\" you moaned as all the other princess dressed girls rushed over. Only after fifteen minutes of girls checking to see if you was okay, then wanting photos and one request for you to sing something, which you brushed off, did you notice that there was no Harri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she?\" you muttered angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Amber asked, her eyes idolizing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a slight sigh at this girl that wouldn't leave you alone. \"My best friend was coming to help me.

As you looked around for a chance to have a break, you was the gate open as another guest came in. It was Michelle.</span></div></div>",

About midnight, Harry's sleeping form started to glow as the island's magic started to do it's work. The first thing that affected was Harry's hair. With alarming suddenness, rosewood colored hair shot out of Harry's scalp, lengthening until it lightly brushed against Harry's shoulders. In a slightly ironic twist, as the hair on Harry's scalp grew, all the other hairs on Harry's body retreated, leaving Harry's skin perfectly smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed before Harry's skin started to tingle. It wasn't enough to waken him, but it was enough to trigger more changes, notably a reduction in Harry's muscle mass. It softened his skin, along with his face, before both his checks and lips swelled slightly, giving him a more feminine appearance. The changes to his face almost complete, the magic began to work on his chest. Slowly, Harry's chest started to swell as fat started to gather under Harry's now budding breasts. As the breasts grew, so did his nipples, not stopping until Harry had gained a pair of feminine looking, a cup breasts which suited his slim body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes to his upper body complete, magic started to reshape Harry's torso. His waist instantly collapsed, though like his previous changes, it did not cause any discomfort. Almost as quickly, Harry's hip flared out, combining with his new waist to give  a hourglass shape. Both is rear and thighs started to grow outwards, completing Harry's new girlish curves. Probably the most horrifying transformation, if he was awake to witness it, was that of his manhood. It rapidly decreased in size as it sank into Harry's body, leaving only a slight gash which signified Harry's introduction to womanhood. His, now her, internal organs were starting to form. Within minutes, Harry's ovaries were pumping out estrogen into her body as her body settled down to her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe island wasn't finished with her, though. The last thing it had to do was to transform Harry's clothes. Almost as swiftly, Harry's clothes started to shift in both shape and texture. By the time it was finished, Harry was wearing a pair of cotton panties and a matching bra, cupping her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first you thought it was either Penny or Paula, but you quickly realized it was much younger. Even younger than something Hannah would emit. Without thinking, you opened the door to investigate, and saw the cause of the scream. A young, fearful girl was running past the cabin.

It reminded you of the look someone gets when its payback time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on? Penny? Paula? We just had a girl run into your cabin\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls turned to face you and Harry. \"We told you to stay in the cabin\" Paula yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a terrified girl.....

You was so focused on him, you didn't notice the other boys. All of them were either crying, crying for their mothers, or despairingly examining themselves.

You could tell that she had expected you at that point to be three foot, and female. Quickly, she walked off, motioning for you to follow. You wasn't surprised to see her lead you back to her cabin. As she lead you inside, you gave a glance towards the bed, but there was no sign of Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets cut the crap, Penelope.

Forget that idea, because it won't work\" Penny said, revealing what clothes she had picked. Instantly you recoiled, seeing it was another pink bikini, along with a skirt and tube top. Without thinking, you started to back away. While Penny was blocking the exit, neither you or Harry had explored the cabin, so you was hoping there was a second exit. As you backed away, you bumped into a wardrobe, causing Penny to giggle. It was lucky , least for Mike, because it drowned out the feminine gasp coming from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. i should had known you would back away. That wardrobe could had made a nice trap and had you 'dressed' up\" Penny giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes at her lame joke. \"Why do you want to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. Since you and your friend have done the same things, it can't be behavioral otherwise you're already be in a skirt. You're either so magically powerful that its protecting you from the generalized spells of this place. If that is the case, you may or may not be affected by a targeted spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Forester witch sent me here, so I know I can be affected by magic\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.

Penny sighed, and lifted her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're forgetting I'm a witch, John. I was hoping you'd put it on willingly, but have it your way....\" Penny said. Almost immediately two things happened. The first was that you was lifted two feet into the air, preventing you from escaping. The second, more disturbing thing was that all your clothes disintegrated into dust. Penny didn't even give your figure a second glance; she quickly began to force the clothes onto you.</span></div></div>",

With the pink lip-gloss and nail polish, as well as jewellery, you was really going to look like your twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Penny had finished applying the makeup and jewellery. \"How do you feel, Mel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at her evilly. \"I feel totally great that you turned me into a total beach babe\" you said in a faux bubbly yet sarcastic tone.</span></div></div>",

No, madam head witch, this is indigenous to our world; there is no need to active the self destruct. I believe he was sent here by Samantha Forester... Sorry, but I won't name names as it is.... delicate. Yes, I believe that is the best course. He may not take orders from me, but he will from you. Yes, I will see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Penny ended the call, you stared, wondering about the things she said. \"What is going on? I believe its more than some perverse take on Pinocchio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. This island is a magical temporal point, or to put it in a term you'd understand, a tear between our reality and several others. Naturally, magic is concentrated, mainly down in the cave systems below, but there is enough for us to run our punishments. Normally, the witches on duty would not interfere, like how Paula and I have. Those boys would had slowly changed from their girl bullying actions. Like you said, a take on Pinocchio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this 'self destruct'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An insurance against unwanted influence from another universe. Witches can't handle radiation any better than a normal person. You're sitting on a five hundred megaton nuke\" Penny said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be joking\" you scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not joking. Not about that\" Penny said, as her face suddenly fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you demanded. A few seconds later, you sensed that someone was behind you. Turning, you felt your own jaw drop. It was your grandmother, Elvira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, John\" Elvira said pleasantly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was trying to trigger that temper of yours. Now try to calm down, and see if those breasts of yours will shrink\" Elvira said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What are you trying to do?\" you said angrily.

You'd make probably the best looking bride, Jonnie\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt another surge of anger, and with it, more breast growth. your girls were now in the double d range, and were starting to become very uncomfortable, a fact not lost on Elvira. \"You'd need some womens' clothes now, granddaughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" you said, relieved that you didn't change any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean the wedding dress\" you said with a slight grow.

Either that, you you're find love in either magic, or a man...:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love in WHAT!?\" you yelled as your arms slimmed down. Elvira took it as a sign and disintegrated your clothes. The wedding dress did to you what your temper didn't. As soon as the panties touched you, the rest of your body, including your manhood shrank down.

Its one of the more common things that a guy might find himself in since it is  a iconic female outfit. There is a test designed to vastly increase a boy's resistance, only used as a last resort as there is a real risk of the new bride becoming one for real. Either they're not strong enough to resist, or they actually find love at first sight. Don't worry, this isn't my intention for you, John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when its not a test?\" you said, as you released yourself for the top part of the gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, so witches think they know better and ran the test anyway. Our 'friend' Samantha had done so in the past. Hence  one of the reasons for Natalie's warnings. Others do it simply of of belief that it would give the boy a 'better' life. Don't pout John. Their words, not mine. And of course, there are the odd couple that just do it to get the boy out of the way.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.

Basically you were all rotten, and we're decided to fix you, hoping that you'd all be better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I must protest. Changing us that way will not make<i> them</i> any less of a jerk\" you said, interrupting. While some of the former boys gave shouts of approval, most showed their outrage. Although they couldn't move their legs, they could still throw, and unfortunately, most were armed with rotten food. Worse, you couldn't move either, so you couldn't dodge the barrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point young lady. I'll make things move comfortable\" Paula said, as she cast a spell. Instantly, you felt your underwear tightening, changing into panties. All it did was heighten what was missing, thanks to the snugness, though the soften did surprise you. The others, horrified that the witches were changing their clothes as well started checking themselves out. Instead, you was more focused on trying to move your stiff legs. Although they felt more mobile, you still couldn't move as Penny cast another spell. You watched helplessly as your shoes began to harden and the laces disappeared. A minute later, you stared, disgusted, at your new mary janes. They were, unlike the others, pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll show you what comfortable...\" the lead boy turned girl said almost the instant she realized she was in panties and black mary janes. She leaned down to pick up more rotten fruit, but as she did, her shorts started to shimmer. This lasted for two seconds before the shorts' legs wove itself together to form a a blue skirt.  She screamed, while the most of others started to point and laugh. You and Harry looked at each other and shook your heads. You both knew what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that looks better on you, miss\" Paula giggled. As the shimmering spread to the other transformed boys, their laughter dying in their throats. After ten seconds, the effects spread to you and Harry. Feeling more disgusted than anything else, you watched your jeans morph into a pink skirt. Glancing you saw Harry wearing a pleated green skirt, whereas most of the others had plain neutral colored skirts. It infuriated you; you and and Harry weren't anything like those jerks in front of you, yet you was coping the most feminine changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngrily, you tried to move your feet again. It partially worked; you was able to move your right foot off the ground and step half a step back, but you stopped as you heard the tapping sound of your shoe, and saw that your socks were changing too. As you watched your socks morph into ultra white tights, you angrily scolded yourself for allowing yourself to be distracted. You tried to move again, but the momentum was lost, preventing any more movement. Resigned, you watched your socks knit themselves together. Most of the others now wore tights, though not all. Harry was amongst those that had ankle socks, and she had a strange look on her face, showing she was frightened about her own situation, but deeply amused by yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only about being slowly transformed into a little girl, or that Harry thought that it was funny, but the almost resigned acceptance that the others were showing. While they showed fear and disgust, none of the them had done anything to attempt to escape, apart from some struggling at the beginning. For a bunch of girl- mistreating jerks, it was disappointing to see no resistance when they each got skirted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula got up and had a hard look on her face, her focus not at the group, but towards the second most feminine looking girl trapped in front of her. \"Hair is one of the things that a girl values most, so I take this one the most personal. I.... I had cancer when I was your age, and I do not want to put you though the sort of things jerks like you put me through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished, your scalp felt itchy, and almost as quickly, a few stands of honey colored hair started to fall into your field of vision, which quickly turned into a flood. She then went to each girl and non magically started to style her hair, mostly into pigtails, or ballerina buns, though to the second most girly girl, she gave the most attention, and gave her tight curly ringlets. You was last. After watching her give Harry a french braid, she walked up to you and said, \"You moved slightly since this started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spare me the story\" you snapped, your patience spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that, miss. Still, I shouldn't be too surprised.

Apart from her top, there was no sign of her ever being a teen or being male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, miss Rich. Since you've heard me, it shows you have some sort of exposure, though not enough power. Miss Harrison definitely shows signs of being able to handle magic right now, even as a five year old.

You felt betrayed, and your face showed it. You wanted to punish the girls for what they're doing to you, and since the revelation that you was a witch came out, you was fantasizing what kind of magic you wanted to unleash onto Penny and Paula. Instinctively, you knew that switching their gender the same way they switched yours was out of the question, but the idea of freezing them sounded good. You gave a slight giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up to mischief? We better get you and your friend off this island\" Penny said. She waved her hand, and you saw that the only part of you that was still relatively normal had began to change. You stared at your shirt as the sleeves quickly puffed out and took on a pinkish hue, matching your skirt. The color spread to the torso, as your buttons sealed themselves, before a new opening formed at the top part of the back. As the shirt fused with the skirt, you saw that a pink ribbon had materialized around the waist, forming a neat pink dress. You checks flushed red with rage and embarrassment; each inch of you screamed girlie little girl. Harry too had changed, except her dress was green. None of the others had changed, though all had clearly seen what had happened, and all of them were panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better. Guess you want to know what we're going to do with you?

Almost instantly, you both blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, you woke up. Opening your eyes, you saw that you was on your bed. Sitting up, you could see that everything was normal with your room, but something was strange. The room was bigger somehow, and you could see blond hair in your peripheral vision, both from hanging sown slightly and almost like it was dangling from the side side of your head. As you looked down and saw that you was wearing a pink dress, you gave a high pitched, little girl scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was real!\" you screamed. The screams had the effect of arousing Harry, how was lying on your floor, as well as attracting to your room both Hayley and Mel. Unknown to you, Hayley had detected the teleportation and was coming in to investigate, but your panicked, girlish screams helped to speed things up. As your sisters burst into your room, Mel held her hand to her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gotta help me, sis\" you began to plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley seemed more in control than Mel. She stared evenly at you and said, \"How did you get yourself into this mess, John? What are you? Five?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were sent to this island\" you started to explain.

Tim stared at his mother, but to your surprise, he remained silent. it was obvious to you that even with this threat against him, Samantha somehow terrified your younger, bratty cousin. The other thing you knew was that you couldn't allow your aunt to change him. Your reasons weren't entirely noble; you knew 'Tiffany' would never give you any peace. Slowly, you walked over to your cousin, and with a speed that belied your new size, you seized Tim's hand and started to drag him towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back here, young lady\" Catherine ordered, but you didn't know whether she was instructing you or Tim. It didn't matter; you pulled Tim outside and slammed the front door closed. Only then did Tim relax a little.

Annoyed, because it is typical Tim Towers, but surprised that he could not see the changes. Surely he could see that he was wearing janes on the feet he was swinging somewhat girlishly, or the fact some of his curly, girlish hair must be within his field of vision. Instead, he just continued to ramble on about how girls are gross and how your own change suited you, seeming oblivious that he was increasingly becoming more girl like himself. By the time mom pulled up into the mall's carpark and she started to release you both from the booster seats, you wasn't even sure Tim was a he anymore. At this stage, Tim had a cute, girlish face, framed with curly blond hair which was highlighted by a pink bow. The clothes weren't too much better, as Tim now wore ultra white tights, black mary janes, and a pair of overalls covering a purple t-shirt. It was a bad mismatch of fashion, which you was certain mom would rectify towards the girly side very soon. As Tim got out, you winced; she was a girl for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. Can you cast spells that would make people not notice things\" you asked as mom grabbed your hand and started walking into the main wing of the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom chuckled. \"Magic isn't real, sweetie.\" It caused Tim to smirk, and say, \"Stupid girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" you replied, certain that Tim had some sort of forgetful spell placed on her. It was only when mom stopped outside a clothing store, things started to spin out of control. You protested that you didn't need any of the girly things, mainly dresses that was inside, when a voice said, \"Hi Nat.\" both you and Tim knew the voice. It was Megan's mom and mom's best friend, Dr Thompson<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming Katie. These two could be a handful\" mom said with  giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you planning?\" Katie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These two need a new wardrobe....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't\" Tim protested. It was odd, hearing Tim voice albeit softened slightly, coming out of her girlish body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie raised an eyebrow. \"She doesn't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid so, though I think that is about to end\" mom said as Tim looked at Dr Thompson. She studied her face, before staring at her own body. Mom winced as tim's eyes grew with horror and disgust. \"Tiffany now knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what have you done to me!?\" Tiffany wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here, Tiffany\" mom warned, but Tiffany was understandably too distraught. She wailed, \"it was those booster seats...\" Without warning, Tiffany ran. Her changes worked to her advantage, and before anyone could do anything, she was lost in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was worse that the pink dress, mainly sue to its snugness, and how the flatness of the lower sections remained you that you was now a five year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like Tiffany\" Dr Thompson said, trying to cheer you. It was quieter and you both could take more freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know about mom?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've known about Natalie since I was your age, Britney. Basically, I'm in the position Bethany is in. Assuming of course, Bethany doesn't develop her own abilities. One more question, sweetie. I still need to get you some accessories\" Dr Thompson said, as she picked up some panties. You shuddered; you had least a dozen questions that you wanted answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you asked with a slight sad yet angry tone, \"Why Britney? I sounds like I should be some ditzy, airheaded cheerleader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A combination of Girl Island and your mom. You don't get to choose your name, and Girl Island is big on ironic punishments. Think about what you call your big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was silent as you watched Dr Thompson pay for your new clothes, and helped you back into your pink dress. \"Where do you think Tiffany ran off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I hope she is okay. There are some unpleasant people around here. Lets get you some accessories, sweetie\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Karl and Greg were bullies, who liked to target any girl they could. Age didn't matter to them, as long as they could get away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you running from, little girl?\" Greg said as he seized the panicked eight year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say it's herself.

I think she is a tomboy. She needs mud\" Karl countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have mud. I say she wants a royal makeover. How would you like that, princess?\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany gulped. She knew of these two, how they would physically embarrass a girl. Tiffany's nature wasn't allowing her to remain quiet. She turned to Greg and said, \"I know of you two. You like to flash our panties. maybe since you like it, you want to wear some yourself.\" As soon as those words exited her mouth, Tiffany scolded herself; she had identified herself as a girl. Plus, she wondered why those two could get away with it. There were more than enough aggrieved witches to teach them a lesson. <i>I get threatened; its either I lose the frog, or I get a skirt</i> Tiffany thought, bitterly remembering Samantha Forester's threat after her pet, Fella accidentally caused some damage to Forester's shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg and Karl stared at each other, and started to drag Tiffany away. Before they could take more than a few steps, a figure in black appeared from nowhere. While the figure was obviously female, there was no other visible feature, as she wore a mask and hood over her head, and a black gown and cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you thing you are? Darth Vader?\" Karl mocked as he released Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, though I believe you'll wish I was\" the figure said in a deep voice. She raised her hand and said, \"Tomorrow when you do your usual breaking into the girls' lockers, you'll wear the clothes instead of your usual wanton damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe this woman, Karl? Karl?\" Greg said as he noticed his friend was in a trance. \"What are you? Some kind of witch? What have you done to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will spend the money you stole and buy yourself a new outfit\" the woman said. To Tiffany's amazement, Greg gave a nod. As both bullies robotically walked away, Tiffany said, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in black didn't say a word. instead, she pulled off her to reveal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could see it in your eyes that you loved what I did to those two jerks and that you want to have such abilities yourself\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ugly old...\" Tiffany spat out, but she was quickly silenced by Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't language that a pretty young lady like yourself should use. I gave you a clear choice between having your pet or becoming a girl, and you choose being a girl. It's not my fault you skipped without payment\" Samantha said in a sweet calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a hypocrite. That damage to your store was an accident, yet those two jerks have done things a hundred times worse than anything I've ever done and you've done <i>nothing</i>. Do what you will, you hag\" Tiffany said defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's eyes narrowed. She absolutely <i>hated</i> anyone calling her a hag, yet deep down she respected Tiffany. It tempered her reaction. Without warning, Tiffany was magically forced backwards into the bathroom, and her tomboyish clothes were removed. As Tiffany's tights turned a very pale pink, she was dressed in a pink spaghetti strapped dress. To finish off the look, Tiffany's ears were magically pierced with a pair of floral earrings. \"Much better. There is no way any adult won't think you're a pretty young lady, and even your friends won't keep your eyes off of you. I suppose you're old enough for a small amount of makeup to compliment  the look\" Samantha gushed in a pleased voice. Samantha would had been less pleased if she had saw tat Tiffany had her pet in her discarded overalls. Fella peeked from the clothes, and hopped onto the older witch. Before Samantha could do anything, the frog had somehow hopped onto Samantha's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                          _____________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like that Samantha Forester\" Dr Thompson said in a distasteful voice. Ironically you was passing the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it's mom?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, hostile interrogation? It's possible, Britney\" Dr Thompson said. \"Either that, or your cousin has gotten to her. I want you to stay behind me at all times while I investigate, and if something happens, run. This is a powerful and seriously messed up witch, sweetie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't need to had been told twice. Cautiously, Dr Thompson walked into the bathroom, and saw a pleased looking Tiffany watching Samantha. She was on the floor, trying to get Fella off her face.</span></div></div>",

Threating Tiffany because she put a frog onto you? The other witches would think you're a joke\" Dr Thompson said, quite bravely staring at the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to, Katie. I've known both Natalie and Catherine almost as long as you. Tiffany will be within a ballet leotard within a week\" Samantha snapped, as she finally seized Fella and angrily tossed the frog away from her. To your surprise, Tiffany's pet was unharmed. Grumpily, Samantha stormed out the bathroom, almost knocking mom, who was coming in, out of the way. Mom saw Samantha, but allowed her to leave. Almost immediately, she walked over to Dr Thompson. You could tell that mom was tense, having seen Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie. Are you okay?\" mom asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine. I found Samantha on the floor, with Tiffany's frog on her face\" Dr Thompson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You threw your frog are that woman? What were you thinking?\" mom demanded. Tiffany pouted, hating that her new name was constantly being used. Unhappily, she said, \"I was attacked by those jerks from school. Samantha rescued me from them, but we had a difference of opinion. Aunt Natalie, please turn me back to normal. I can't be a gross girl and I don't wanna have to do dumb girls stuff like ballet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us\" you added. Samantha was right about one thing; mom was quite girly, and all three of your sisters have or at least, had done the whole ballet thing. You didn't want to make it a clean sweep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You haven't tried it\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're not really girls! Damn it, mom\" you said, temper boiling over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"I know it's going to be hard for you, Britney...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom.... don't you realize how odd it would be to have a pink clad girlie girl with a frog perched on her shoulder everywhere she goes?\" you said as an idea came to you. Maybe a rational argument would help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where you're going, and you're right. A girlie girl wouldn't have a frog as a pet, but a witch would. You're a witch now, Tiffany Towers. By the way, there is a strong protection spell on that frog\" mom said as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tiffany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done a lot of things to that creature. Dropped it down dresses. Put it into drawers. Perched it onto your shoulder. Placed it on egotistical, powerful witches. Yet, it has remained unharmed, and hasn't been lost\" mom said. Abruptly, she changed the topic. \"Still, types of magic is a discussion for another day. Time to get you two home.\"</span></div></div>",

Hayley had a troubled look on her face, like if she expected something bad, while Hannah had a look of stunned glee. You gulped slightly, believing that you youngest sister must be believing there is another young girl for her to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't scowl, Britney\" mom started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? It's my life that has been ruined.

I know you're upset right now, but you'll quickly adjust....:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adjust? Have you gone insane? How would you all like your genders be switched, told you're not getting changed back? How would you like to be a baby boy, Hannah? Would you be smiling then? Why don't we find out\" you ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah paled, seemingly getting your point, but mom stepped in. \"Be thankful you're a girl with magical powers. Do that again, and you'll find yourself learning how to be a normal little girl, Britney\" mom threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you really think my life can get any worse by that?\" you said disheartened. \"You're already  turning me into your perfect girly princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strong emotions amplify magic, sis\" Hayley said for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think putting me in a pink dress would help\" you said sarcastically. \"I'm going to me room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to give you some lessons....\" mom said, but Hayley said in a quiet voice, \"Let her go, mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Got it!\" you yelled. \"Plus I was told I'm too young to work magic anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're correct, or at least, you're partially correct, Britney\" mom said, ignoring your request. \"You are to young to even to attempt to break a spell from Girl island, which I might add, has a 95% failure rate. You are old enough, though to work some basic magics. That is not the sort of lessons I had in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you said, your voice seething.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl lessons.

The only downside to the girl was that her fashion sense was shocking; for some reason she was in a Cinderella costume. it immediately made you think of Mel; this girl looked similar to what your twin would look like if she had lost her mind and gave in to Hannah's constant and annoying pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you asked, wondering what this girl was doing.

Harry, who was looking increasingly uncomfortable with the direction of the conversation, asked what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wearing a bra!\" you yelled, alarmed by the development. Even more alarming was the way Penny nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but while it's the island's doing, it would not have done so selectively unless you made a comment.  To be honest, I thought your aborted comment on how your twin sister is a ditz would have done something else to you\" Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked at you, tearing up slightly. \"Its my fault.... I'm turning you into a girl. What would.... me do?\" Megan wailed, thinking of the version of herself in your reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. you would know better than me. She would probably get me to try out...\" you said as you suddenly felt a gust of wind. From the other's stunned looks, you knew it couldn't be good. hesitantly, you looked down and saw that your pants had turned into a skirt. One that was nearly identical to Megan's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm turning into a cheerleader?!\" you moaned.</span></div></div>",

As you remembered the near cat-fight between Megan and Kristy, you thought,<i> That girl had a big ego. A real princess.....</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, you realized your mistake. The first thing to change was your breasts. While already on the large size for a girl your age, they doubled in size to a double d. That shocked you as they were far larger than Kristy's, but not for the girls in your family. Next thing that changed was your body; it grew more curvy and more mature looking. You gulped; while you were already fairly attractive (much to your disgust), the changed that you just underwent turned you into one of the hottest girls in school. Panicked, you went for a mirror as clothes materialized onto you. Squirming slightly, you realized they were a copy of Kristy's uniform. You looked at your reflection, and the girl staring back at you was a mixture of Mel and Hayley. She didn't look comfortable wearing her cheer uniform either. You swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John?

While you suspected that mom and your sisters would be able to help, you didn't know for sure. About a mile from home, you saw some girls from school.

You struggled to remember the names that Megan told you, but after a couple of seconds, you remembered that her name was Lauren.

This was certainly the type of underwear that Mel would love, but unfortunately, you knew it was the type of underwear 'Britney' would go for as well. Disgusted, you was about to pick up the bra and toss it away, when it suddenly floated up from the drawer and hovered in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" you gasped, mainly out of annoyance. Was this some kind of joke? Magically change your clothes, then have them hovering? Who would do it? Hayley or Mel? Frowning, you leaned over to grab some of your underwear, when the bra suddenly flew from it's position and straight for your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore angry than anything, you gave the bra a tug. Relieved that it didn't have time to secure itself and that it came off,, you made your third attempt at getting some male underwear, only to see that something was wrong with your chest. your nipples were darker, enlarged and slightly puffed up. being 14 and coming from a house filled with girls meant you knew what it meant. instantly you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? What's wrong?\" a voice called out. It was Mel. Another voice, Hayley's added, \"Do you have any reminders of your transformation? i was afraid that mom couldn't do a full reversal transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting attacked by clothes\" you growled, unhappily. The only thing that was good about it was that Hayley was genuinely concerned. Unfortunately for you, it also meant that she and Mel decided to come in to help you. the moment the door opened, both your sisters got a good look at you. Mel's protests of \"Ewwwww! John, that's gross\" was barely out of her lips when you dropped the bra to cover your lower regions. It was the chance the bra needed. It quickly flew back to your chest and secured itself. Worse was to come; the pair of panties flew out of your drawers as well, and rushed for your hands. Caught off-guard by the attack as you was trying to rip off the bra while covering yourself, the panties wrapped themselves around your hips and began their work. You had barely enough time to squeak, 'help' before your bulge began to shrink, and chest began to push out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And my double didn't have such a stupid name\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you're getting one anyway\" Mel started, but she was cut off by Hayley. \"Double? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I encountered an alternate me on Girl Island. Girl, in a err... dress and with a small party\" you said, wincing. There was some parts you was too embarrassed to say, because you feared it would give both of them ideas. Mel particularly liked the idea of 'makeover for her new twin sister'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley looked at you thoughtfully. \"Interesting\" she said after a couple of minutes.

What do you think you are? A genie? If you like that sort of thing, why don't you dress up as one?\" Tim mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespairingly, you glared at your cousin. While everyone in the room seemed, with varying degrees, appalled with Tim's behavior, nobody seemed to want to shut him up. \"Do you think I like, wanted this?\" you demanded, annoyed that you added the word 'like'. It made you sound like a ditzy valley girl, and a part of you was worried that it meant your vocabulary was changing once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I think you wanted this you porridge brained airhead\" Tim said with a massive grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that's so mature of you, Timmy. What are you? Four?\" you said, causing Brooke to giggle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim had an insult for everything. His smile never broke as he replied, \"Now you can't add, cootiebrain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine, apparently having enough of her son's behavior, turned her glance from you and said, \"Enough, Timothy. You're forgetting what i have told you regarding magic\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mush head has. Remember how she though she could just wish me into being icky, dumb girl like her? I always knew she was....\" Tim said, but the moment he said 'girl', Catherine's hand started to glow. Tim noticed, and immediately stopped his teasing of you. \"Mommy, what is happening?\" Tim said in a panicked voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granting Britney's wish. While she can't do it herself, yet, I can\" Catherine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide with horror. Yes, Tim was being an insensitive jerk, and a royal pain, but you had already seen three such transformations, and you found it horrifying. Catherine's magic was quick, though, and as you uttered a cry, Tim's clothes were already changing, and it all happened at once. Tim's shirt started to change shape, with its' sleeves puffing up, yet becoming slightly shorter. The buttons disappeared, and the opening on his shirt closed within a second, before a new opening appeared around the back. As this was happening, the legs of Tim's shorts merged to form a skirt, which then merged with the shirt around Tim's waist, to form a dress. All this took about two seconds, barely enough time for Tim to register what was happening to him. By the time he saw he was wearing his new pink princess dress, Tim's physical transformation was underway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy. I'll be good. Please stop this\" Tim whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's too late, Tiffany.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwwww! that's a stupid gross girl's name. I'm not a dumb girl\" Tim protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you?\" Catherine said calmly. Everyone could see that answer; at this point, Tim definitely looked more like a Tiffany, and she you didn't need to see her now blond shoulder length hair being magically restyled, or her girlish face to see. Tiffany gave a shriek of terror as she checked her panties and saw that she was now a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy.

Slowly, you looked down, fearing that your mounds would be bigger, or your body more of a guy's fantasy, but to your relief, you hadn't changed. However, the cheerleaders took your observations as a sign that you felt comfortable. As soon as Vikki had grabbed a gown, she said, \"This is totally you, Brit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you saw which dress she was pointing at, you heart sank.

It was white, but had a colorless crystal pendant hanging down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" you said, nervously looking at the choker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It 'helps' a young lady get used to her new form. If you don't do something willingly, it forces you to do it\" Samantha said with an evil glint in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to put it onto me? Are you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha paused as she thought. \"No. Although it would be amusing to see you trying to resist it from changing you into an airheaded cheerleader, or even better, me turning you back into a child, then watching you succumb to your new little girl role, i think it'll be better that you confront your fate on Girl Island. Hope you don't mind mud, Britney\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you demanded, but you suddenly felt faint. After passing out, you woke, finding yourself in the same clearing as before.

At first, you was reluctant to approach it, fearing that it would contain more troublemakers, but you quickly realized that this cabin must belong to the witches living on this accused island. This realization brought new fears, mainly of them doing worse things to you, or trying to finish off the job, but your desire to seek help- any help- was stronger.  Before you could change your mind, you walked up to the cabin's front door, and knocked on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\" you yelled, but received no response. Least from the cabin; instead you got a taunting response from the jungle from the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect\" you muttered. Seeing that you had to either run, or hide in the cabin, you decided to least try the door. To your surprise, it opened easily. Without hesitation, you dashed inside and closed the door. For some reason, none of the boys tried the door as they ran past, searching for you. As their noise faded, you felt relaxed enough to actually notice the interior of the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the cabin was obviously occupied by teenage girls, there was no sign of the girls themselves. Praying that the girls weren't meant to be you and Harry, you cautiously opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\" you muttered, seeing that it was well after sunset, and that it was pitch dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">Does it get this dark naturally, or is this place toying with me?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">Stay the night.

Blushing you saw that you was going to have a shower regardless, you allowed yourself to have your shower. You had a shower in the evening anyway; you just didn't want it then simply because the voice wanted it as well. Much to your surprise, the paint washed off your body and out of your hair easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">Much better. You should try on some of the clothes left in here. Try them on, style your hair....</span> the voice said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">Adaptive magic</span> you thought uneasily as you looked around the bathroom. It contained hair products, make up and several types of bras and panties.

Somehow by entering the pool all your girlish features had disappeared. You weren't as reassured as Harry though; while he looked like if he was going to jump into the pool, you still felt sick. Instinctively you had a feeling something bad would happen. That feeling still remained as Lucy magically lifted you from the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go home now?\" you asked your double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. I want to make sure of something first\" Lucy said, as she and Penny led you and a reluctant Harry. who still wanted to 'cure' his increasingly changing and girlish body, outside the cave. Once there, Lucy gave you an unusual cheeky grin similar to one a mischievous Mel would make and magically dumped water all over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you coughed, fuming that she had somehow conjured gallons of water from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that, John. Don't tell me that you wouldn't to that to me if you could. Besides, this isn't plain mischief. It has a purpose\" Lucy scolded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The magic water had turned you completely into a girl- you didn't need a much higher voice to confirm that. That said, you felt that something wasn't quite right. Uncomfortable, you shifted your weight and immediately fell over. The reason for you lack of balance became perfectly clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, John! You're... you're a....\" Harry gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for stating the obvious, Harriet\" you growled, as you stared at your tail. It was orange, similar color to a coy and the scales went up to just below your hips. As for your chest, your now sizable bust was covered with scales of the same color. As you stared at your mermaidfied body, you wondered why you wasn't in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My doing\" Lucy said. \"I feared this was going to happen to you, so I put a spell onto you to help calm you down.

As you was starting to get back onto your feet, Lucy again summoned some water, and once again after about twenty five seconds, you found yourself flat on your back, staring at an orange tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind?\" you said, angrily staring at your counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry John, but I had to do it\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out of your mind?

Trust me, I know exactly how you feel. finding yourself part fish must be much worse than dressed as your youngest sister's idol. As for you being 'like this', remember where you are. The island wouldn't allow a girl to be naked to be seen by usual jerks on this damn place, so it gave you the tube top like scales. Would you had preferred a seashell bra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I would prefer is my legs back, then a cure\" you growled as Lucy dried you off again.

Slowly, as you concentrated, a flame rose from your right hand. Panicked, you closed your hand, fearing that it would trigger a change, but the only sensation you felt was the extinguishing of the flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, why did you demand that I try magic, and when will I end up like Harry?\" you growled as both the witches turned towards each other, as if they were in some sort of conference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, John, but I needed to get Penny's opinion on this. She agrees with me that you will not change\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I... God damn it!\" you roared as Lucy splashed you with more water. Eleven seconds later, you changed back. As you looked towards your tail, you angrily turned to the witches. \"You said I won't change!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, John. I meant you won't change into a girl. The pool's water has turned you into a mermaid. Before, you was in your human form, which is male. However, you was still a mermaid. Since mermaids should not exist in this reality, or mine for that matter, it has left you with magical abilities. it's complicated, but it means that you're a guy with magic powers. Just don't get wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't make any sense. Penny has told us you changed because your magic needed an outlet\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yours has found an outlet, <i>Ariel</i>\" Lucy said. It earned a few snickers from Harry, but you wasn't feeling too happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure some training can prevent your changes from being so random. So far you can from anywhere between ten and thirty seconds, so I'm hoping it can become more.... uniform. there is little more that Penny or I can do for you, or Harriet. Good luck\" Lucy said.

Mom stared at you in complete shock while Elvira closed her eyes before shaking her head. \"This is bad.\" Softly, she said. \"The pools on Girl Island are doorways to other realities. Your son is in a reality flux.\" She turned to Harry. \"Did you fall into one of the pools?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry quickly shook his head. \"No, ma'am.\" Honestly, she replied. \"I just got turned into a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going to happen to me?\" Frightened, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless your condition is repaired soon, your body and mind will become unstable.\" Darkly, Elvira said. \"You could find yourself gaining visions of alternate realities of this world. Such visions have been known to drive witches completely mad and only the reset potion can free them from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this reset potion help me?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"Honey, the reset potion has another, more sinister name.\" Wincing, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The potion was never designed to be used on boys.\" Eying you intently, Elvira explained. \"Only, fifty years ago, a boy accidentally drank some and it 'reset' his body and mind to that of a girl. Hence, it had been dubbed the 'girl maker'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any other options?\" Hopeful, you asked. \"Preferably one that won't leave me as a chick for the rest of my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira paused, looking out the window as mom did the same. After a long pause, they turned to each other and nodded before Elvira turned back to you and Harry. \"There are only three options at this point and I fear neither of you will like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's eyes widened in shock. \"Wait! Can't one of you just change me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that since you two were sent to Girl Island together, your fates are linked.\" Shaking her head, Elvira said. \"What becomes of one will happen to the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing, you asked, \"What are our options?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighed. \"The first option is both of you take reset potion.\" Gently, she explained. \"As you have magic as a boy, it may simply return you to your male state. As you and Harry are linked, he will become a boy again as well.\" She shook her head. \"However, there is an equal chance that it will make you both girls for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A coin toss.\" Sighing, you muttered. \"Perfect! What are the other options?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second option is to send you both back to Girl Island.\" To your horror, mom replied. \"If you both are perfect gentlemen during the summer, the magic may repair the damage.\" She winced. \"Again, there is an equal chance that you will both fail and become girls for life. On the bright side, your situation will become stable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, not liking either option. \"What is the third option?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth mom and Elvira were silent for a moment before Elvira keeled down to your level. \"We have what are called witch tests that seek out and correct flaws and conflicts within witches and in witch boys.\" Softly, she explained. \"Some are more extreme than others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elvira and I agree that one of the more extreme tests may push you both enough in mind and body to correct the problem with your own powers.\" Tearing up, mom said. \"Again, there is the chance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chance that we fail the test and become girls for life.\" Shuddering, you finished. \"Those aren't very good options, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We told you that you would not like them.\" Elvira pointed out. \"However, those are your best options to fix the problem at hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Harry turned to each other, uncertain.

On its' own, it seemed harmless, but you sensed it was related to the girls' clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarri grunted in response, showing her displeasure. \"Okay, what else? A bracelet? A heart locket?

Rip off you clothes and get away from there!\" you ordered, but Harry was still in a trance-like state.Even if she was fully aware, there was nothing she could had done. The princess dress she was wearing quickly morphed into a white, puffy princess inspired wedding dress. Even Harry's ridiculous bow in her now undyed rosewood hair had morphed into a veil. Last of all was her gloves. An exact copy of the elbow length bowed gloved materialized on your friend's arms.

Only, to your surprise, nothing seemed to happen. You gazed up at mom and Elvira who both smiled innocently at you and Harri. Suddenly, the phone rang, startling all and mom turned to answer. After a moment, she turned to Harri. \"Mel has been invited back to Witchbloom all girls boarding school to be a teacher over the summer.\" Happily, she said. \"Hayley found her true love while at Witchbloom in that nice boy who served as a teacher's aide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira did well to hide a sly grin. \"Perhaps Melanie will find her true love there as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Angry, Harri thundered. \"Melanie is my girlfriend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look much like a boyfriend to me right now.\" Forcing a serious expression, mom countered. \"The only way to beat this is too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can test us later!\" Rushing up the stairs, Harri screamed. \"I'm not losing Melanie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Elvira stepped aside to allow Harri to leave.

You were too frustrated and annoyed to realize the test had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, mom talked to Hayley and Katie Thompson. \"The test is actually very simple.\" Smiling, mom said. \"Harri's task is to keep Mel from falling in love with another male who visits the school. However, he must she must do so as a proper lady or her fate is sealed. If Mel remains in love with 'Harry' by the end of her teaching school, he will be back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about John?\" Worried, Hayley asked. \"If he has magic as a boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His task is the opposite of Harri.\" Still smiling, mom replied. \"Because he has magic as a boy, he will remain male inside the school. He must remain faithful to Megan all summer to repair the damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will not be made easy for either of them.\" Serious, Elvira said. \"Mel is quite a prize to any witch boy as she is the granddaughter of the head witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, with John being Elvira's grandson, many witches see him as a valuable prize as well.\" Sighing, mom added. \"This test will be harder on him, I fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is some sort of love triangle test.\" mussing, Katie said. \"A boy friend and girlfriend with competition all around them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded. \"Exactly. Also, the two will be learning magic. Harri as a girl and John as a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is John and Harri now?\" Curious, Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled. \"They are already at Witchbloom by now.\" She sighed, her smile vanishing. \"All we can really do now is watch and wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you, Harri, Mel, and Megan all arrived at Witchbloom where...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

John Harrison is not the princess\" Samantha protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is magically potent, and even you knew that, You also know that under the right conditions, he could become it, whether he is willing or unwilling. John met his counterpart from an alternate universe. From what i have gathered, that very unwilling John transformed after he was dressed as Cinderella after a prank\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this isn't possible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to help me test John, or do I have to be harsher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll cooperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. This is what is going to happen. Mr Harrison and Miss Rich won't be too kindly towards you right now. Whatever they do to you, whether magical or physical will be your punishment. Do you accept?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to test their rage and desire for revenge?\" Samantha gasped. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't my question and I don't want any questions from you. Now, what is your answer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I accept.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You meet them again in a week\" Elvira said to the still bound witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you wasn't happy with everything. Becoming girlier wasn't part of your plan when you wanted that bath, nor was being stuck in that stupid school uniform.</span></div></div>",

Water...\" Mel said, but on the mention of water, you panicked. You knew you could not let your sister splash you. Mel hadn't noticed your sudden panic; she continued her explanation. \"Since i do not want to roast you, or fry you Star Wars style, I'll give you another bath\" Mel said as a jet of water burst from her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you yelled as a surge of power ripped through you similar to when you was confronted by mom and Elvira. Mel's water stream was instantly frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel looked confused but the sudden change, as she didn't expect the counter. \"You can use magic offensively? How?\" Mel spluttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" you lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's impossible. You're a boy.... Wait! Why were you so unfazed when I tried to turn you into my true twin, yet you freaked when I tried to splash you?\" Mel demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I just don't want to get wet. It's bad enough I have wear this stupid uniform. Its embarrassing\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel remained unimpressed. Without warning, a dozen snowballs appeared and was magically flung at you. You vaporized nine, the the remainder got through. Mel even had the nerve to melt one of her own projectiles just before impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Mel!\" you screamed, as you looked for anything to help you. However there was nothing.

You have no idea how embarrassing it is\" Harry said, sticking out her chest to show her source of embarrassment. You bit you lip, trying to reign in your urge to talk. Yes, it's awkward for Harry, but to others, including her other students, Harry was just another teenaged girl. You was the guy in a skirt and heavily padded bra. Harry saw your irritated expression and said, \"Sorry, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it feels weird for you\" you said, sighing as you headed for the library. You half expected it to be some cavernous hall, with some older witch sitting down as if she was on guard duty, but instead it looked like a normal, compact study hall. There wasn't any staff on, but there was a big sign that warned, 'No practical use of magic allowed in this room: Elvira'. A much smaller sign had the standard 'quiet please' notice. A few girls were in the room, and gave a few giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you nervously approached one of the older girls. \"Hi. Any idea were to find a book on transformations?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Accident in class?\" the girl asked sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that\" you said dryly, as you realized that the girl thought you was a girl that had been transformed into a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not going to work. Only a witch can read a magic book. Trust me, I know\" the girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll think of something\" you said, as you shifted your eyes towards Harry. You knew you'd be able to read the book, but it made you nervous. What if it made you more of witch by making you more of a girl. You was still unsure of yourself as you picked up a magic book. <br>\r\n\"Do you want to do this?\" you whispered to Harry, whom had a book of her own. You frowned when you saw it was about Girl Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We have to\" Harry whispered in response, as she opened her book. You had barely started to read the 'boys must not read this book' warning on the front page of your book, when a loud voice said, \"Looking good, John\". It was Regina.</span></div></div>",

Even though she was only with her friend, Fawn, you knew Regina could cause trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to congratulate you for finally changing. Maybe you'd prefer Melissa since you're becoming a breasty, blond ditz like your twin sister\" Regina said. She didn't get too far; Harry seized her by her collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been studying, and I can show you the most effective counter to magic without using magic yourself\" Harry growled. The threat of being punched didn't deter Regina or Fawn. Fawn walked over to you and without warning, grabbed your chest. Over your protests, she said in an annoyed, slightly disappointed voice, \"They're fake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Harry was fuming, and that you was red with both anger and embarrassment, Regina didn't care. Smirking, she said, \"Doesn't matter, as she is already changing. They'll be real within a week and you'd be trading skirts with the bimbo and your little attack dog... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your problem?\" Harry growled as she closed her right hand on Regina's main spell casting wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? She is much better off as a girl. She is prettier, neater, and has magic. Just like you. Admit it, you like being a girl, and the only thing stopping you from completely accepting that you're a girl for all eternity is a new, pretty name, bitch\" Regina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry lost her temper. \"John. What is the spell to turn this bitch into a boy?\" Harry said menacingly, knowing you had the book of transformations, and gender would be a prominent part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Page seven\" you replied, noticing that Fawn was backing away very quickly, leaving her friend to her fate. You also noticed that the others in the library were staring, wondering if Harry really intended to proceed.</span></div></div>",

The girl didn't care; she grabbed Regina even more firmly, and tore the bullying witch from Harry's grasp, forcing her to walk out of the library. You looked around, and saw that nobody dared to follow them. A part of you expected someone to comment about your situation, but nobody did. Instead, the other witches went back to their studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. What do you think, John?

Regina will be back to normal in 24 hours. I'd be wary of her, though. She will try to girlify you, probably with some hair extensions and styling. Maybe some why to give you curves.

It's not just Samantha Forester that is sensitive\" Sam warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We never mentioned that it was Forester's fault that Harry is in a skirt\" you said suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering where you live, she was the most likely person to do it\" Sam quickly said. \"In any case, it is highly unusual to leave that island without certain changes. I suggest you keep that to yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changes?' Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John is more obvious. Normally he would have left without the need of fake boobs, assuming he doesn't leave as a child. Plus there tend to have mental changes. Are you attracted to boys, Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\" Harry said as she blushed slightly. Without another word, she got up and walked out of the library. While you was suspicious of Sam, you wanted to help Harry. Giving Sam a slight nod, you walked out of the library and back to your dorm. Harry was there, on her bed, non responsive to questions that were being fired at her by both Megan and Mel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, John?\" Megan asked as she was staring at your chest.

While she never said anything, you had spent enough time around teenaged girls to know Harry did find herself attracted to a picture of a 'hot' guy. It all came to a head when you came out of the bathroom after your morning shower, and found Mel giving Harry the whole 'you're a girl now so its perfectly normal to be attracted to guys' speech. Naturally, Harry didn't take such a lecture from her own girlfriend well, especially since Mel had proved the point again showing that Harry was physically attracted to girls. You could imagine your friend also took it as a break up speech as well, though you never got the chance to ask; Harry had locked herself in the bathroom and refused to come out. A part of you wondered if that was your fate with Megan, and if you had any feminine thoughts whilst in your mermaid form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking, John.

The troubled girl, who was back to normal had a small flask in her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jenny. or is it....\" Regina said in a pleasant voice, which caused her friends to giggle.

Before Fawn, who was the closest could seize her, she was pushed back by a powerful blow; Megan. She was using her cheerleader skills offensively. Momentarily stunned, Fawn stumbled back, but Regina's other friend, Nicole was close enough to accurately splash your hair with the contents of Regina's flask.

Before I was turned into freaking Ariel, I met an alternate version of me. Apparently an alternate Harry and alternate you, stuck the alternate me into a Cinderella costume, and <i>she</i> has been dressed like that ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's face darkened. \"Is there any other unpleasant surprises?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems it could, in theory, happen to Mel.

As you walked, you grew angrier, partly because of the, least from your perceptive, lack of empathy from your twin, the whole 'it will be okay' from Megan, but most mostly from the feeling from your own body. Thanks to your larger, girlish ass, you was walking quite girlishly. Fuming, you pushed open the dorm's door, and saw that harry was still around. She was in bed, and from the looks of things, hadn't moved since you and Megan left from class. It was obvious that she had been crying as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're back?!\" Harry said, shocked. She had been expecting you much later, and your presence had taken her by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel was being her irritating self\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Did she... Oh my God, John! Did she do that!?!\" Harry screamed, noticing your new bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Even though everyone knows she would not be too upset if she got her 'true twin' she has always wanted, she did not do that to me. Regina did.\" you said in a low, distasteful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? You're immune\" Harry said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She dumped hair growth potion onto me. That potion is water based....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry winced. \"Did you... you know?\" Harry asked, knowing you hated your mermaid transformations far more that Harry hated her own, feminine situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two and a half minutes. Enough time to get away, but Megan found out\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing you'd say more when you're ready, Harry changed the subject. \"That explains this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been in bed all the time. This was left outside\" Harry said, pointing to a basket on the main table.

It caused your temper to boil over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to kill that witch!\" you ranted. Barely a second passed before someone knocked on the dorm's door. Thinking it was Regina and her friends, you stormed over and roughly slammed the door open. Instead, the only thing in sight was a single handwritten note. You brought it in, and started reading its' contents to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning girls. If you want to solve your 'troubled girls' problem, meet me at the nearby mall at 10am tomorrow, when I believe you have a free class\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.

I'm guessing that something happened during your visit to G.I\" Hayley said. You stared closely at her face, and saw she was telling the truth. While out of everyone, Hayley was the most likely to actually help you, and not treat you as a magical curiosity, but even then, you was hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you later\" you said, sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meg. Harry. Can you let me have some time with my brother?\" Hayley asked. You friends nodded, with varying degrees of reluctance. harry hated shopping, and it seemed Megan wanted to take her time doing it. Once alone, Hayley gave a rueful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assumed that you'd need cheering up. so we'd be having some sister bonding time\" Hayley said, shaking her head.

It was the perfect size for you, if you didn't grow a tail when wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a long sigh as you decided to tell her. \"I fell into a pool when i was on girl island, and it transformed me. Lets just say I've got the 'splash' effect and leave it at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley nodded. \"What else has happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a slight smile, seeing that Hayley was unfazed.

Luckily, the only thing the passing bystanders saw was a flat chested tomboy arguing with her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise it will help you feel better\" Hayley said as she tried to coax you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not into that girly stuff\" you said, aware that your earlier yelling had drawn in a crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Trust me, I'm not trying to turn you into a princess\" Hayley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reluctantly, you followed her, though you was far from happy. While you got Hayley secret meaning, you felt she still didn't get it. Apart from your face, and hips, you was still very much your normal self, albeit one with a very nasty curse and you didn't want any more of this girl stuff. It was bad enough that you had to wear a girls uniform while at Witchbloom. Fortunately, no one else followed you in, sensing that Hayley had one your argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" a voice asked. It was the store owner and she stared staring at you, making you feel very uncomfortable. You wondered if she knew you was a boy, or whether she was a witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. I know what we want\" Hayley said, earning a grimace from you. Not only she was picking you a dress, she had also discretely changed your clothes, or to be more accurate, your underwear. 'Damn it Hayley. I do not want this' you thought, annoyed. The store owner disappeared to another part of the store, along with your sister. Hayley returned a minute later, holding a pair of plain, white over the elbow gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not wearing them\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll stabilize your 'curse' and make you pretty for the Witchbloom ball\" Hayley said. She stared at you then added, \"Who knows. Maybe they would bring the princess out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not what I want\" you growled, not liking Hayley's dark humor,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But I also know you hate this whole drawn out process, 'sis'. You'd much rather things be over\" Hayley said. You gave a slight nod; Hayley was right in the fact you'd rather be a full girl than be stuck as you were if nobody was going to change you back. Awkwardly, you pulled the gloves onto your arms and once they were on, you felt a slight tingling.</span></div></div>",

You knew this wasn't natural, and that some sort of magical transformation was happening to you. At first, you thought that the gloves were transforming your arms, or worse getting stuck to your arms like your alternate universe counterpart, but as Hayley came over to see what was happening, you could see the gloves themselves were changing. Before, they where plain; now the gloves had an fancy beaded pattern on the hand part of the glove, and it was spreading up the arm section. Instantly, you knew what type of glove these were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wear bridal gloves, Hayley\" you said, the fear clearly shown in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that.

Nobody would want me as a wife\" you said in a panicked, disjointed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I believe that your magic has become unstable. Whether this is a good or bad thing, I don't know....\" Hayley said with unbelievable calmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?!\" you said; you was definitely not calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could mean your water issue could be solving itself.

Initially, you feared the worst, that your jeans was becoming the white dress of a bride, as the legs of the jeans merged together to form a skirt, but after a couple of seconds, you saw this wasn't going to happen as the material and color remained the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" you demanded as Hayley came closer. It didn't make you feel better as she started to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sis\" Hayley said with a slight giggle. You looked down to your shirt and saw that that had completely changed into a pink spaghetti strapped top similar to something Mel would wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your magic is turning me into Mel?\" you squeaked, somewhat frightened. Of all the things that had happened to you, this was a new low. even the prospect of being a mermaid or a bride was much better than being exactly like your ditzy, airheaded twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It means that your own magic is becoming highly unstable. I can tell because I doubt Mel would ever willingly wear that\" Hayley said, bemused as you tripped over. Somehow, your jean-skirt had transformed into a green colored fish tail.  The only thing that stopped you from falling over was that you could, unlike with your water based transformation, feel your legs.  Annoyed, you pulled off the mermaid tail, as saw it magically change into a mermaid inspired skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" you demanded. If your clothes all became a tail, staying dry would be kind of pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your emotions are directing your spells. You was thinking of mermaids, right?\" Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" Hayley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How I don't want to end up like a ditzy airhead like Melanie\" you confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley giggled. \"I can so totally see you like that. Oh my god. That would so suit you\" she said, parodying your twin. You gave a slight giggle, but it cut short when you saw she was serious; Hayley wanted you to wear this girlish, puffy peach prom gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since she had sent you, Megan and Harry, with Elvira's backing, for some alternative teachings, Mel had found herself temporarily reassigned. Much to her disgust, it was the six year old class, consisting of a dozen young witches. while it was obvious the people amongst the class was age regressed, and doubly obvious who was gender swapped, majority were six year old girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Harrison? Why can't we do that?\" one of the girls asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it would be noticeable. We have to remain secret\" Mel said, wishing that Hannah was there; your youngest sister would relate better to those girls and would be able to explain the rules of magic better. Sighing slightly, Mel was about to continue her speech when she noticed her blouse was glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Harrison? Why are your clothes glowing?\" another girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel frowned; and her frown deepen as her clothes turned a peach color. To the young witches, it was a lesson in remaining inconspicuous. To Mel, it was mass confusion. \"As you can see, doing this is highly noticeable\" Mel continued, trying to hide her worry. A couple of seconds later, a couple of girls giggled. Mel turned and stared at herself. Instantly, she could see what was happening. Already, her blouse and skirt had merged into a single dress, and the skirt part of it was blowing up. So too were her sleeves, giving her a far more puffy and 'princess-like' version of the dress that you was staring at. As Mel's new gown completed itself, she knew what had happened. Over the reactions of her class, she gave an angered cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                         ------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John?

You ruined my class. Why did you turn me into some fairytale princess!?\" the voice demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley! I'm hearing a voice in my head...\" you said, panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it sounds like Mel, it's normal, John. You're twin witches and can communicate that way. If Mel is communicating that way, she must be angry\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel?\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play innocent. Why did you turn me into a princess in front of a group of six year olds? My lesson is ruined, and....\" Mel's voice demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Besides, look what he did to me. I'm dressed in this monstrosity, ruined my lecture to a bunch of kids, called me an airhead, and made me even girlier\" Mel protested, her body still clad in her princess gown. You, in your temper had also done up her hair and make up, making Mel ready for the prom, or princess ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? What about what you did to me? You knew it was an accident, yet you dressed me in this!\" you protested, tugging at your own gown. Mel's retaliation had dressed you into a nearly identical dress, and over the course of the hour, done up your own hair, makeup and had given you opera gloves as well. Thanks to her, you knew that nobody would think you was a guy now. \"That isn't the worst of it. She goes and does some kind of Jedi mind thing to me, mocks my changes, and worse, I think this is starting to affect me physically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! I have warned you both about this sort of behavior before and told you that if you both continued to act as naughty like children, there would be consequences. Melanie, if it wasn't for the fact you have to look after miss Thompson and miss Rich, I would have no choice but to fire you. I'll deal with your punishment later. Dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel gave you a furious glare as she stormed out of the room, leaving you with both Elvira and Hayley. \"I'm disappointed that you retaliated, John\" Elvira said in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else could I do?

Happy now?\" you said sulkily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. This means your witch magic of this universe is starting to assert itself over your mermaid magic\" Elvira said. As she said this, you felt a stabbing pain in your chest. To your horror, two small mounds started to inflate. \"i'll do some further testing on you at a later time.

The first was the fact that she hated doing it, as it was to her a sign that she was accepting her fate as a girl and witch. The second was more of a primal fear; Harriet couldn't be planning to burn those clothes off. Could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Harri?\" you gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving you another cheeky grin, Harri said, \"What do you think? I'm turning that gown to ash, princess. I've seen it done before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you gone completely insane?! I'm wearing it!\" you protested, but Harri ignored you. She said, \"That thing is so poofy, I can burn off the skirt without touching you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you? You hate doing this whole flame thing as it makes you feel more like that you're a girl than wearing bras and skirts. I know you want to help, but you don't have any practice. You'll toast me along with this gown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not going to happen, John. You're my friend, I was even changed because of it\" Harri said as she gave Samantha's body a hard kick.

If I even heat up any part of you, you can give me a full makeover\" Harri said. \"Just trust me on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her and sighed. seeing that Harri still had her flame ready to go. It was the longest she had ever had a flame ignited. \"Fine. Start at the skirt, but don't do anything around my torso or arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarri gave a slight nod, and stared at your skirt. Eyes narrowing, she moved in and started to move her flame towards your dress. You both expected it to start smouldering, or have some sort of arid smell, but there was nothing. \"It's not burning\" Harri grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't; a voice said.

You cannot burn it, shrink it or in other way remove it. It will self alter as you grow, and can be altered by your own magic.

If you haven't noticed, the spell is progressing faster. You both make beautiful brides\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a bride. Neither is John\" Harry protested in <i>her</i> angriest voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Samantha said in a faux surprised tone. \"Female. Check. Wearing white bridal gown. Check.Nice makeup and hairstyle. Check.  Accessories such as gloves and veil. Check....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God\" Harry breathed sharply as a veil formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flowers. Check\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a half growl as a bouquet of flowers materialized in your right hand. \"Okay witch. Lets get the unplesantries over and done.

Normally I would have just made the change and be done with it, but I thought you both need something extra. Something to really teach you a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What lesson is that?\" you asked politely, even though you was starting to think Samantha was a lunatic. Samantha never answered; instead Harry screamed. Knowing that he rarely did that, you turned to him. His response was to point that your legs. Surprised you looked down, and instantly you froze; your socks were growing up your legs. Worse, so was his, something he figured out quickly. both you and Harry watched in stunned silence as your socks grew to past your knees. Samantha's giggles snapped you out of your silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?! I'm with over the knee socks!\" you hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That isn't the only thing, Jonny\" Samantha giggled. Remembering you previous weird feeling, you panicked and checked your underwear and saw that somehow, they had been turned into panties. Plain white panties with a pink bow and trim. You felt sick. You felt even sicker as you watched Harry's jeans crawl up his legs, and morph into a pleated skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change me back, y- you witch!\" Harry pleaded, seconds after he realized that slight change. You recognized the skirt; it belonged to the uniform of some private (and non magical, though you didn't know about that) school just a few miles away. Some had suggested that Hayley and later Mel had been sent there, but you knew it was false; St. Bella's had no boarding capacity. A few seconds later, you felt a weird rush of wind, telling you you too, was wearing a skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Samantha said, her voice sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Harry yelled, stomping his feet childishly.

When they finished, mom sighed. \"Lucy is partially to blame for her new situation but not completely.\" Shaking her head, she stated. \"She and Sarah need to realize that their life is not over but simply changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we need is a plan.\" Sighing, Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was silent for a moment, staring out a window. \"I'm open to suggestions.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only, for a boy, it would turn him into a girl for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did Harry get a hold of that?\" Worried, Hayley asked. \"I thought there were only two left in existence, both with the head witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, Harry's parents found a third.\" Darkly, mom replied. \"They are both immune to magic so it is possible that they had no idea what it was when they gave it to Harry for his birthday last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom conjured a photograph of Harry proudly wearing the gem with a note on the bottom reading, 'Happy 12th birthday to our little entrepreneur'.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry had that for a year...\" Almost whispering, Hayley said. \"He was already changing when he drank that potion.\" She shivered. \"When you cast the unaware spell, Harry's parents must have instinctively called their new daughter Sarah after the girl they had lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"That brings us to John, or rather, Lucy.\" Somewhat regretful, mom said. \"The gem has been known to effect witch boys without them even having to touch it.\" She shook her head as if angry with herself. \"I recently found evidence that he had been slowly changing on the inside for the passed year. Thus far, I had ignored it, figuring it was my imagination but now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised Hayley. \"What kind of evidence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John has a supply of sanitary pads.\" Shaking her head, mom said. \"I also found hair dye... he had been hiding the fact his hair had been turning honey blond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would he hide this?\" Confused, Hayley asked. \"Especially after learning the truth about us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, John had to have been freaked out by it. Then when he learned the truth, he put two and two together and became convinced that we were responsible for it all happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that solves the mystery behind what had happened.\" Wincing, Hayley said. \"Only what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed, waving her hand.

As she took another step, to go down the stairs, your vision instantly turned to black. You instantly knew what had happened; mom had teleported you somewhere. Moments later, your vision cleared, giving you an idea why Sarah looked so shocked when she was teleported into mom's study. The first thing you saw was that you certainly wasn't in mom's study as the room was blacked out, and seemed larger. it almost looked like some kind of changeroom. Worse, you felt that you was wearing something different to the shorts and shirt that you had on, but it was too dark to see what you was now wearing. the only thing you knew for sure was that you and Sarah were the only people inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? i'm trying to find a light\" the girl growled. She quickly found a light and you instantly wished she hadn't. The moment the lights came on, you saw that Sarah was wearing a pink leotard, light pink tights, lace up ballet shoes and had her hair tied in a bun. A quickly look down saw that you was wearing an identical costume. Mom had turned you into a pair of ballerinas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your fault\" Sarah raged as she lunged at you. You dodged it fairly easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fault? You was the one that ran first\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care\" Sarah replied, making another lunge for you. Again, you dodged it easily, but this time you spotted something taped to Sarah's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think mom left us a note. Its on your back\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stopped lunging for you, and reached for her back. After pulling off the note, she opened it and began reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sarah and Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had hoped you would had listened to me when I told you that I had something important to tell you, but instead, you both insist to act as rowdy little boys.

No, I'm using this note, then I'm making it clear....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what was coming as it was obvious that Sarah still blamed you for everything. You didn't blame her as you didn't know which would be more confronting; her name, the loss of her age, or obvious flatness of her crotch. \"I know you blame me for this, but the real person we should blame is Tim! He could had warned us. he could have caused a scene to divert our attention. Hell, he could had even knocked the liquid from those glasses. And worse, after all of this, he escaped intact. I'm going over there right now, and would really like you to be there.... Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah closed her eyes as if she was thinking, fighting her personal demons.

You gave a slight sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see your point. I wouldn't blame you, Harry if you want out, but I have to go in. Tim somehow knew about Forester. It means either he was transformed into a girl in the past and somehow was changed back, or he discovered magic by some other means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have heard some of the insults that have come out of the little toad's mouth\" you said as you opened your aunt's front door and sneaked in. You looked around and saw that nobody was around. Even better you heard the sound of a video game being played in the den. It meant that not only Tim was home, he was distracted. Cautiously, you began to walk through the house. Both you and Sarah were amazed how silent you both moved. It seemed Sarah, for the first time actually found something she liked about her unfortunate situation. Noiselessly, you moved to either side of Tim.

You both got yourselves into skirts because of your own stupidity\" mom said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Could you tell me more about Jack, mommy\" you said in a faux cheerful voice. Sarah stared at you, her eyes wide as she mouthed, 'Jack?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, but you'll have to do something for me\" mom said. You nodded, and turned to Sarah. To your surprise, she was gone. Mom smiled and said, \"It's not for everyone to hear. I teleported her home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what about Jack. Is he still alive?\" you asked, remembering how he died two and half years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.Jack started to change in his twenties, and when I was about your former age\" mom stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But I've seen him as a guy\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true. He never accepted what was happening to him, so he did everything he could. He eventually married our 'friend' Samantha's younger sister, hoping it would help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He married for a cure? So is that why you dislike Samantha?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong on both questions. He dated for a cure, but it was a real relationship. As for Samantha, I dislike her for an incident which I will NOT be discussing. Press me about it, and you'd be wearing pink dresses and pigtails for the next year\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd probably be wearing that stuff anyway since you go for that kind of thing' you said humorlessly as you looked at your pink leotard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom continued her story. \"Jackie got got at changing her form, but eventually it became increasingly more difficult, until her form was locked. Lucy, it really ate Jacqueline up. Maybe it's for the best  that Forester did turn you into a little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You can't be serious?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am\" mom said. </span></div></div>",

As soon as he was home, he turned around and said. \"Okay, now can you get rid of that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I think you should try it on\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.

Sitting up to look around, Harry thought to himself,<i> \"Where am I?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, the first thing that caught Harry's attention was that the room likely belonged to a woman; as there was an open closet full of dresses and skirts.  The next thing Harry noticed was a clock on a nearby table that said 5:15 in the morning.  <i>\"Why don't I remember the last 14 hours?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to find some answers, oblivious to the sudden weight on his chest and the hair touching his shoulders, Harry climbed out of bed to look around.  As he walked to the door, he glanced at some of the pictures and saw that they all had the same attractive women in them; some of them even included kids and another man.  Although Harry couldn't figure out why; he couldn't help but think the kids seemed familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing his walk towards the door, Harry spotted something in a nearby mirror. Turning to look closer, he was surprised by the reflection in the mirror.  Instead of being the reflection of a 15 year old boy; the reflection was that of a grown woman in a nightgown, the same woman from the pictures. The woman was quite attractive; with a decent figure and D cup breasts along with brown hair to her shoulders. Had Harry been older he would've been very interested in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that it was some parlor trick, Harry looked down to find a pair of breasts in his field of view.  As this a pair of breasts in hands wasn't enough; Harry realized the reflection copied his every move.  In disbelief, hearing his new feminine voice for the first time, Harry said, \"What the hell is going on here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Harry thought things couldn't get any worse; he heard the bedroom door start to open.  Fearing that whoever had done this to him was coming back for more, Harry started to panic and find a place to hide.  He ran out of time when the door opened and a young girl walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry quickly recognized her as Hannah; John's 8 year old sister.  She was wearing a pair of Disney Princess pajamas and holding a teddy bear in her arms.

Something clicked inside Harry's head and she was suddenly overwhelmed with maternal feelings and instincts towards Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling down, Harry picked Hannah up in...her arms and said, \"What was the bad dream about, sweetheart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was running through the woods wh-when I tripped and fell into a big pile of spiders.\" Sobbing and shuddering, Hannah said, <br>\r\n\"Th-They were biting me as I tried to climb out; b-but I st-started turning into a spider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knew from the past that Hannah was terrified of spiders.  Holding Hannah in her arms, she said, \"It's alright, sweetheart; there's no spiders here and you're still my beautiful little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes but Harry was able to get Hannah to sleep in her bed; leaving her once again to figure out what was happening here.  As she walked out of the bedroom, Harry said, \"<i>I'm not Hannah's mother; where are these...maternal feelings towards her coming from?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe further down the hall Harry went; the more evidence she found that showed she had become the mother of his best friends.  Despite this, she still needed to check their rooms to know for sure.  First stop was John's room; peaking inside Harry saw that John was fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a hushed whisper, hearing her now feminine voice for the first time, Harry said, \"<i>This is going to be so weird; explaining to him that I've somehow become his mom.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext stop was Hayley's bedroom, directly across from John's.

After a quite dinner of leftovers and watching TV, Harry went to bed around 8:45.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry woke up around 7:45 the next morning; still asleep enough not to realize things were different.  Seemingly overnight, his room had been transformed from that of typical 14 year old boys with video games and sports memorabilia to that of a young <br>\r\ngirl with dolls and stuffed animals strewn about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill oblivious about the changes to his room, Harry groggily got out of bed and walked to the attached bathroom; unaware that he was clutching a teddy bear in his now smaller hands.  Harry must've been aware of his surroundings on some level; because he made sure to avoid a table with a tea set on it as well as a dollhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obliviousness to his surroundings quickly ended when Harry walked in front of a mirror; which hadn't been there the night before.  Looking at the mirror, wondering where it came from, Harry was surprised to see the reflection of a young girl in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn closer inspection, he saw the girl was wearing some Disney Princess pajamas and holding a teddy bear in her arms.  Not only that; but she seemed to be confused about something as well.  Thinking this was a joke being played on him, Harry moved his body around to find that the reflection did the same.  \"<i>What the hell is going on here!?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't have to be a genius to figure out what was going on; although he was confused as to how it had happened, he'd been turned into a little girl probably no older than 8 years old.  Looking around the room, he saw the other changes that had been made.  His room was definitely that of a young girl who, from the number of dresses and skirts in the closet, was very girly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercome with shock, and fear, Harry screamed at the top of his lungs; silently noting how high pitched his scream had <br>\r\nbecome.  If being turned into a young girl wasn't enough surprise for one day, Harry was even more surprised when his mother came running into the room.  Getting a good look at her; Harry saw that his mother had become very pregnant overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, in a panic, Harry's mom said, \"What's the matter, Grace?\"</span></div></div>",

With his best imitation of an 8 year old girl, Harry said, \"It's nothing, mommy; I thought I saw a spider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; I'm glad it's nothing.\" Smiling, Harry's mom said, \"I was worried you were hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father is leaving for his business trip; why don't you go say goodbye before he leaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do, Harry nodded and ran out of the room; his now shoulder length brown hair bouncing all over the place as he moved.  Running downstairs, he heard a voice in the kitchen and made his way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stopped in his tracks at the kitchen door; realizing the man at the kitchen table wasn't his father.  It took him a moment; but he recognized the man as Michael Anderson; a co-worker of his mother's.  Apparently whatever had made him into a little girl had made it so his mom was married to this man and he was now Harry's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from the newspaper, the man said, \"Hi there princess; did you come to see me off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah daddy; I'm going to miss you.\" Still playing the part of the girl, surprised by how easy it was for him to act this way, Harry said, \"When are you coming home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be home in a few days.\" With a smile, Michael said, \"Don't worry; I'll be here for your ballet recital; I know how much Hannah and you have been practicing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to...her father, Harry walked back upstairs to the bedroom.

You quickly arrive at your destination, your main lab.

As you wait for the laundry to finish, the drier started to shoot electricity.  Quickly, you pull out the plug and start coughing from the smoke.

You've got to watch it, miss\" Rikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped walking at that comment, \"What did you just call me?\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I see is a slightly tired, bratty little girl\" Rikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does it\" you growled. Both Sam and James also were becoming annoyed since to them, Rikki had gone crazy and was unfairly targeting you. As you was preparing to run for the gates, you felt a slight pain in your shoulders. Wincing, you tried to ignore it, but the pain seemed to be spreading to the rest of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is happening to me? Help me. Get a doctor\" you moaned, the pain clear in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just stand there\" Sam scolded Rikki. \"Help him... arrgghhh\" he moaned as both he and James started to get pains. You looked over at them and screamed. \"You're shrinking!\" you screamed in a increasingly squeaky and higher pitched voice. Upon hearing that, you looked down and saw that you was shrinking too. Looking closer, you saw that your muscles were receeding. It could only be one thing; you're getting younger, though oddly your clothes seemed to be resizing with your shrinking frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to us?\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you tell yet?\" Rikki asked as your vision was obscured by brown hair. As you reached to touch it, it changed color to a honey gold, just like the hair found on mom and your sisters. Similar things were happening to the boys, though both Sam and James looked more like girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Change us- arrrgh\" you moaned as you felt strange as your internal organs changed and external ones inverted, changing you into a little girl. \"What have you done to us?\" you said horrified in your new six year old girl voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Witchbloom, the leading school for young witches. Didn't you know? Ah crap\" Rikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be a widdle girl in a witch school\" James said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

Like I said, the three of you know nothing, and I won't have you looking like a mess\" Rikki said. Within seconds your hair was divided into two pigtails, held by a small bow. Sam and James were marginally better; James hair was braided into pigtails, which in your opinion made her look more mature. Sam was the luckiest; her's was secured by a green bow. Rikki nodded, pleased with herself. \"Better, but you girls still need more work. Take those shoes. They're a disgrace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with my shoes?\" Sam asked. The three of you looked down and saw that the shoelaces were wiggling out from the shoes. \"This better not be what I think it is\" you growled. it was; and moments later, your shoes hardened, became rounded and was secured to your feet by its strap. James looked at her new mary janes horrified. \"Isn't it enoghff you turned us into widdle girls?\" James wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It could be worse</i> you thought disgusted. James and Sam's shoes were black. Yours were pink, making you look my far the girliest out of any of them. You looked sharply at Rikki, who seemed to be enjoying herself. trying to deepen your girlish voice, you said, \"Funtime is over, witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its just beginning, miss Harrison.

You had no doubt what it would end up as, but you was determined not to go down without a fight. \"If you like all this pink so much, why don't you wear it?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so silly, little girl\" Rikki snickered. Her laughter died in her throat as a powerful voice said sternly, \"Miss Turner. What do you think you're doing?\" You turned, and was stunned into silence. It was your grandmother, Elvira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam Head Witch\" Rikki said uneasily. You looked at them bewildered. <i>Head Witch!!?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your behavior is totally unacceptable. I've told you that greeting new students in this manner is not the way I want them to be introduced to magic\" Elvira said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....\" Rikki said. Elvira didn't allow her to get another word in. Elvira continued her rant. \"I think you've been especially hard since this group contains my granddaughter.\" At this point, Sam and James turned their attention to you, their faces showing their surprise. Your own face showed you was just as surprised. Elvira was oblivious; she continued to scold Rikki. \"Give me a good reason why I shouldn't give my granddaughter a new witch doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do anything to me\" Rikki pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been warned. Now get out of here. I'll take of this myself\" Elvira thundered. As soon as Rikki scurried away, you turned to Elvira. By that time, your shirt had completely sealed itself at the front, split down the back and had buttoned itself up and its sleeves had began to puff up. Basically it was the top part of a little girl's dress. Color-wise it had also started to fade to a light pink. Both Sam and James also were experiencing similar changes, though they were 'lucky' to get pale blue and cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the head witch?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am. I am truly sorry you had to discover this in this manner\" Elvira said warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you do anything about this?\" you asked as you felt an unfamiliar feeling as your jeans split, and refused into a long dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira ignored that question, instead answering the real one. \"I bet you want to know why you're all kids. In all your files, it said to regress. Rikki took it too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Mom wanted this?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a twin, John. If you was changed first, it was areal possibility that you would remain like this permanently\" Elvira said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about them?\" you asked, pointing to the two girls, who were now wearing their dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell Bella and Olivia privately\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're renaming us?! What's wrong with Sam?\" Sam demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some names that are off-limits for witches. Samantha is one of them, Olivia\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a witch of that name that has caused us endless trouble. I had to personally prevent on more than a dozen occasions her exposing magic to Lucy\" Elvira said, pointing at you. She smiled, and said, \"I'll let the three of you talk and find your way around the grounds. Good luck, girls.\"</span></div></div>",

If their mother had waited much longer, their own bodies would have transformed to give that magic an outlet, making them witches for life.\" she smiled. \"All three of you have a chance to remain male by simply enduring a year of grade school as little girls; learning magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens to us after this?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You return home as teenage boys and continue on with your lives.\" Smiling again, Tia said.

Let us show you how magic can influence your lives for the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, you, Olivia, and Bella nodded. \"Where do we begin?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia smiled and replied, \"We begin with regular first grade classes with real girls your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Witch girls?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As girls, you are witches too.\" Serious, Tia said. \"This is to get you used to being girls so learning magic will be easier. Also, the real girls here have no knowledge who is a real girl and who is a transformed boy here.\" She grinned. \"So, unless you want to be teased...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to try to blend in.\" Gulping, Bella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia nodded. \"Right now, I suggest you three....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You winced since your young body didn't exactly have the attributes to look tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to happen. I know what is your problem. You've started math in Lillian's class, and you can't do it. Admit it, little girl. You are one now. Sure you don't want....\" Rikki mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy?\" a voice said from behind you. You saw it was the teacher, who you now assumed was Lillian. Her face was much softer, belying her former strict demeanor. </span></div></div>",

Because you didn't read the instructions on how to do the problems, you lost your ability to do them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't Sam or James affected? When will this wear off?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia and Bella\" Rikki corrected in her almost sneering voice. You're more than a little uncomfortable being about her, an even more since Lillian seemed content to allow her to bully you. \"You should be remembering your skills in a week. If you do it again, it would be a month. Third time, you'll be the little girl you now are. Right, Lil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct. It may seem harsh, but magic can be deadly if mishandled. As for the others, they must had read the instructions, therefore they haven't experienced your problems\" Lillian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. One more question. Why are you enjoying being mean to me?\" you said, pointing at Rikki. \"My little sister would be calling you a stupid poop head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had my way, so would you, princess, Others disagree\" Rikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're targeting me. I heard you mutter 'typical boy' when you assumed I didn't read the instructions\" you hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pretty girl like you shouldn't hiss. It isn't ladylike\" Rikki said.

Run off and cry?\" You winced, hating the fact this witch bully had turned you into the girliest looking girl she could; it made you an easy target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough. I think you enjoy your job a little too much\" Lillian said. She leant down to you, her stern exterior returning. \"I want you to head back to class, Lucy. One more thing; don't run out my class again. Each student eventually freaks out and runs, but I only give a student one warning before I have to punish them.\"</span></div></div>",

Unlike you, both she and Bella didn't get caught by the magic trap, so they found the lessons incredibly boring, hence they were keen to get back to your dorm despite its' girliness. Tia spent most of the class writing notes on a pad, though you doubted she was trying to cause mischief; due to her background, you suspected she knew about the traps lying in wait. Amanda, due to her age, was the most engaged amongst the group, though you could tell she was frustrated in not learning about 'witch stuff'. Between lessons, she spent time trying to befriend the other dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. They couldth fixed me, or at leath show something\" Bella said wearily, seemingly not caring about her speech anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was magic. The books were trapped, and I feel for it. Now I have to do things like Amanda for the next week\" you said sourly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you've lost your gross boy stuff?\" Amanda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, you replied, \"No, I haven't lost my knowledge. God, you're worse than my little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I...\" Amanda said. Tia cut her off. \"Remember how they are. It is possible to physically change you in a similar way Olivia, Bella and Lucy were changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. I just thought....\" Amanda said. you gave a slight smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay. I know you're trying to be friendly, but I'm not in the mood. What was you doing in class, Tia? Writing notes?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to figure out how to regain my age. I was just trying to write down my thoughts\" Tia said, chuckling humorlessly at its' irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do you think we'll get to do any magic?\" Olivia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon I hope.

She knew the direct approach was out of the question; you wouldn't listen to her, nor would you or the others allow her to enter your dorm. Frowning slightly, she decided to try the best indirect approach. Elvira. Smiling slightly, Rikki walked to Elvira's office and barged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira was in her office, looking at an orb on her desk and wasn't too happy to see the arrogant young witch. \"Why did you come in here unannounced?\" Elvira demanded, her voice showing her irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watching the students?\" Rikki said, ignoring Elvira's question. She had managed to catch a glimpse and knew it was showing you and the others in your dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just making sure the students are okay after all the trouble <i>you</i> caused. You still haven't answered my question. Why are you here?\"  Elvira demanded, showing a hint of menace in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've detected that miss Harrison is quite powerful, and...\" Rikki said, pausing slightly. Gathering her thoughts, Rikki continued, \"...She needs an outlet. Her friends too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree on both counts\" Elvira said, smiling slightly as she thought, <i>I imagine my granddaughter's preferred outlet is pummelling this arrogant bitch to pieces. I know Lillian hasn't given the first graders any sports for a month or two because they're so young. Maybe that is a mistake. I don't want Lucy getting so frustrated she runs amok. We all remember what happened last year.....</i> \"I will allow them to do an hour of sport per week. Their choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it, Elvira\" Rikki said, as she left a fuming head witch in her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was fuming too.

I've got two announcements. The first is that I'm going to teach you all some magic. It will be basic, but I think you'd love this.

And it was Rikki's fault that I get to hear the same well intended but careless 'gross boy' comments you hear\" Olivia said somewhat diplomatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rikki? Why are we talking about her? That poop-brain took the head of my favorite doll\" Mia complained. It triggered an avalanche of complaints from everyone....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She made fun of my hair\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said I was ugly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She turned me into a kid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She threatened to turn me into a gross boy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She tripped me when I was playing jump rope\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said I was a dumb as a little girl, knowing exactly what happened to me. What I'm going through.... Its like having amnesia\" a voice said from the door. It was a fuming Tia. It stopped the complaints since Amanda's older cousin had actually had amnesia and had then told the others about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do about it?\" Bella asked. Tia turned to you, almost expectantly. You didn't like it much; it made you feel like they already thought of you as the leader. Gulping slighting, you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She would be at ballet lessons just to gloat at me and Olivia. This is what I think we should do.....\" you said as you outlined your plan.</span></div></div>",

Girls are gross!\" Tim protested, speaking for the first time. The only thing Elvira did though was to raise her eyebrow inquisitively, which gave you, Olivia and Bella a sinking feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not his fault. He was teleported in too\" Olivia protested. Tim, now had gotten over his protest, and looked at Elvira slightly in awe. \"I never knew you was a teacher\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shut up</i> you thought, as Elvira smiled. \"Yes, I am a teacher, in a sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These girls are dumb.

So far, the only changes you could see were his longer hair, and that his body looked slightly more petite. \"How could you do this to me?\" Tim wailed, his voice obviously higher. upon hearing his own voice, Tim grabbed his throat, and massaged it in a vain attempt to get it back to normal, but after a few seconds, he fearfully pulled his hand away as he felt another change. Elvira, who was watching this, sighed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spell is on a timer. Its not like its you come here and click- you're a girl, Tiffany\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Amanda asked nervously, like if she was slightly afraid to interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a conversation for another day\" Elvira said gently, as Tim began to whimper uncontrollably. At this time, he looked more like a young girl playing dress up in her older brother's clothes. \"Tiff- If it makes you feel better, consider it inevitable that you'd find yourself in this form. I've placed some clothes in the spare locker. This is going to be your quarters, and you'll be with Lucy, Bella, Olivia, Tia and Amanda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Please. Get me out of this cootie infested hell hole\" Tim said as he clawed at his hair, but Elvira had already left. From his movements, and from your own transformation, you knew that Tim's transformation into 6 year old Tiffany was complete. Already some of the more girlier girls were beginning to crowd Tiffany, which made her very uncomfortable. While you knew they were only trying to befriend Tiffany, you knew it wasn't the right time. \"Could you leave me with our new roommate?\" you asked. Slightly reluctantly, the others left, leaving you alone with your terrified cousin. She stared at you, and you knew she was noticing that you was dressed the girliest out of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from me\" Tiffany protested, as she stepped back, towards her assigned bed. \"i don't want to be turned into a pink obsessed cootiebrained, ickhead like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed since you knew you wouldn't be able to hide the truth from her. \"use your brain, moron. Who do you think I am, and if you give me any of your comments, I swear, I'll beat you up.

I was annoying Melanie, and mom brought me here. Why do you think I teleported something from my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you dressed like a dumb giggly girl?\" Tiffany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a really mean witch called Rikki and she  thought pink is my thing\" you said, as you opened Tiffany's drawers. Frowning slightly, you saw a plain, white puffy sleeved t-shirt and pale yellow skirt. Far to girly for Tiffany's tastes but infinitely better than the dress you was wearing. \"Get these on, and give me a hand.

Unfortunately, the footwear that Rikki had cursed you and the others with wasn't made for sneaking. Every time you heard the clicking of Tia's shoes, you felt that someone would awaken and demand why three six year old students were creeping around at 1am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not. Its your shoes doing all the clicking, Lucy. Haven't you learnt how to walk in your janes, yet?\" Tia said. You could tell that Tifaany thought it was funny, so you gave her a poisonous look. After two minutes, you managed to open the main door to the science wing. You walked in hoping to find some chemistry equipment, but to your surprise it wasn't difficult; the lab looked like any other science-focused classroom from any school on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought this is a magic school. Why do they have a science lab?\" Tiffany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They teach more than just magic. Besides I'm guessing that chemistry would have some value for things like potions. We needs some beakers, some flasks, that hotplate, some chemicals.....\" you said, half hissing in an attempt to remain stealthy. Originally you thought about cooking up the slime in the lab, with Tia and Tiffany standing guard, but you changed your mind, deeming it too risky. Instead, you decided to take the equipment with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what we're looking for?\" Tia hissed back as she passed to you a bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We should had asked one of the others to come. This is heavy\" you moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You're just weak like...\" Tiffany started to say, but you cut her off by dumping several bottles in her arms. It shut her up for the remainder of your time in the lab, something that you thought was a small miracle. You quickly took the pillaged equipment back to your dorm and began your work. Amanda and Bella were asleep, but Olivia was still awake. She looked slightly surprised that you was able to get the equipment back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Olivia asked, almost like if she thought someone would be knocking on the door at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get some sleep.

Yawning slightly since your body wasn't used to the punishment you was giving it, you got out of bed, and opened your textbook. As you started working, you heard someone stirring. It was Amanda; she yawned and noticed that you was watching some liquid on a hotplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there really a recipe for making slime?\" Amanda asked somewhat timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're afraid of some little boy doing to you what we're going to do to Rikki?\" you asked. Amanda nodded slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Its not here, but you can make things if you know the principles behind it. I suppose its like magic\" you said reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Lucy, I think you're missing something\" Amanda said as watched you sir the now green looking mixture. Ducking away from you, she searched for something in a box by her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked, before moaning at the sight of the fairytail princess hat that Amanda was holding. You knew she meant for it to be an improvised witch's hat. \"Fine\" you muttered, as Amanda placed the hat on your head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tiffany knew this, and said as she pointed upwards, \"I'm going to enjoy it, you brainless witch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" Rikki as she saw the slime dripping onto her. It fell right onto her face, hair and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real mature. I'm glad you're acting your age. You really think this would be embarrassing?\" Rikki said sarcastically, as she wiped the slime from her mouth. As she did, she grabbed her stomach. \"What did you put into this?\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" you replied as Rikki, still holding her stomach, rushed to the bathroom. With Rikki gone, Olivia smiled. \"I've got the whole thing . So Lucy, what did you put in that slime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not what you think\" you said, smiling slightly. \"So what now?\"</span></div></div>",

Ten minutes later, Rikki emerged, still covered in the slime, looking slightly sick, and extremely furious. Her eyes narrowed as she saw that you was patiently waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!

Did a bunch of 'babies' get the better of you?\" you asked, in a overly sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tried to poison me!\" Rikki screamed, attracting some attention from some of the older students. From their glances, you guessed that you and your classmates weren't the only ones that Rikki had tormented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I didn't Now, what are you going to do? Start treating us with the respect we deserve, or admit you just got outwitted by a six year old?\" you asked. Despite yourself, it actually felt good saying you was six, and could see why Hannah occasionally played the 'cute' card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikki glared at you, silently as if she was deciding how to respond. You never got to heard her immediate response since Elvira, attracted by the crowd, came to investigate.

Miss Jameson isn't exactly the most friendly, or humble witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you hire her?\" you demanded,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to know, young lady. It does present all sorts of problems\" Elvira said, sighing. You remained silent, waiting for Elvira to continue. <br>\r\n\"While I, and many others on the staff, I might add, won't say I'm displeased that you put Rikki in her place, it does leave you open to retaliation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Retaliation?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. As you know, Rikki is fixated on the idea of Princess Lucy Harrison. It is certain she would try to get you into a princess costume  any means she can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Would such a costume just stick to me? I regret doing this, but since Timothy is now here, why not Princess Tiffany Towers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are magically stronger than any of your sisters or cousins, Lucy. Just watch yourself.

Tiffany seemed to realized this as well; she panicked, as she leaped out of her chair in near record time.

You might be wondering why I choose to hit miss Towers with water? Especially since she foolishly invited me to cast something more amusing\" Lillian said, her stern features morphing into a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Mia asked. You knew she wanted to get Tiffany in dress similar to everyone else, and you knew that Tiffany would be close to starting WW3 if she tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't fight what you can't see. I heard what all all did to that Rikki and I think some precautions would be appropriate. Plus Tiffany is a transformed boy.

You think I'm going to be stuck like this, and Timmy would be the last guy in our family? Not going to happen\" you snapped. Pausing, you added, \"If it wasn't for Melanie, neither of us would had discover the truth! What is it with you witches and boys? See 'Bella'? Her mom preferred her like that, and 'Olivia' wasn't even allowed to keep her name, Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bring us into it\" Olivia muttered to you.

Within seconds, your dress became even more puffy, your shoes became glass slippers, pale pink gloves formed over your arms and a tiara materialized in your hair, giving you the look of a little girl playing pretty princess. Worse, Catherine changed both Bella and Olivia as well, though both hadn't realized it.

The magic keeping you a girl was powerful but a few boys had managed to break its hold on them long enough to do some damage if a teacher or student angered them enough. She feared you would return as a boy long enough to cause Rikki physical harm as she was the first to rush into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, princess?\" Smiling at your anger, she asked. \"I heard you say that I lied to you.\" She gave a mocking pout. \"Did I say something to ruffle your pretty little curls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rikki, you are out of line.\" Unimpressed, Lillian said. \"If he reverts to his male form, even for a moment with you so close....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lillian continued to scold Rikki, you fell into an almost trance like state as your mind struggled to contain the rage you were feeling. You turned to a line of girls' book bags and smiled, thinking of how it would be fitting for them to take Rikki down a peg. Unknown to you, your magic reacted to that thought and the book bags began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A transformed boy has not broken the school's spells in ages.\" Giggling, Rikki said. \"I'm not scared in the least of this bo....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped mid sentence and gasped hearing deep, incoherent babbling coming from behind her. Slowly, she turned to see that the book bags belonging to you and your classmates had somehow come to life! The shoulder straps had torn in half and were serving as legs and arms. The open zipper of the main compartment was their mouth. Rikki screamed as they spit shredded paper at her before charging, leaping onto her body, hitting her with the school books that were inside them. The terrified teacher ran out of the room and down the hall with the book bags giving chase, babbling like angry natives from some forgotten tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire class was stunned by the aggressive display. They were more stunned to find you completely zoned out but having a slight smile on your face. Seeing this, Lillian sighed and turned to her class. \"Girls, this is an example of what can happen if a transformed boy is pushed beyond his limits of patience and and control.\" Serious, she said. \"I feared that Lucy would have reverted to his male form and attacked but instead, she unconsciously lashed out with her magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean that Lucy is a girl for good?\" Worried, Tia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but it does increase the risk of it happening.\" Firmly but kindly, Lillian replied. \"The point I am making is this... Never anger a 'son of a witch'. You simply do not know who 'she' will react.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, waved her hand, causing a loud pop to sound near your ear.

You looked down at yourself, more fearful than embarrassed with your situation, though you would had been feeling more awkward had you known that Hayley was watching every move you made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could they be turning me into a girl?\" you muttered, slightly fearful at the idea.

You had tried that before, without success, and it made you wonder why it gave away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'His physical attributes is neutralizing the spell. Good.... oh crap\" Hayley thought, as she saw that once you had released the left shoe so you could work on the right, the left shoe's strap reattached itself to the shoe, and secured your feet once more. You gave it another pull, but while the strap strained, it also held tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He has potential, but lacks control. Much like Mel.

It was your own subconscious way to alert you if anyone had been snooping around without your permission. Hayley knew this and added a DVD to your collection. You noticed it immediately as it was out of place and looked at the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home videos?\" Curious, you muttered. \"I don't remember making any...\" You stopped, realizing that it had to be planted there and slid it into your DVD player to view what someone wanted you to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a video of Mel wearing boy's dress shoes, dress pants, and a ruffled boy's shirt. She did not look pleased at all as she pulled and tugged on the clothing to no avail. \"This is not funny, Hayley!\" Annoyed, Mel complained. \"Get these gross boy clothes off of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take them off.\" Casually, Hayley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've tried!\" Angry, Mel snapped. \"You told me you were a witch!

What is she hoping to gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped as a flash filled the screen before you saw the clothing rip apart off of Mel only to come right back onto to her, fully intact. Hayley shook her head, bemusement on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cast the spell to keep you from ripping the clothes off of you.\" Serious, she explained. \"That same spell also prevents you from using your magic to the same effect.\" She paused. \"Figure it out, sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can change the clothing into something more my style?\" Hopeful, Mel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley shook her head. \"You can't cheat a spell or take shortcuts with magic, Mel.\" Frowning, she stated. \"If you want to take those clothes off, you have to do it the proper way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to your surprise, Hayley turned to the camera. \"You are a bright boy, John. Use your brain before you use your brawn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen then went blank and the DVD case vanished as if it were never there. Not that you noticed; your mind was preoccupied with what you saw in the video. You leaned back in your chair, pondering over it as if it were an impossible riddle. \"Is there a <i>proper</i> way for a girl to remove her clothes?\" Thoughtful, you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis intrigued and frustrated you at the same time. You knew that there was a sort of ritual to putting on and taking off the eighteenth century clothes Mel was wearing in the video. Everything had to be put on and taken off in a certain order. Perhaps there was a similar ritual to girl's clothing as well, even for modern clothes. The only issue is that you had never seen any girl get dressed or undressed before so you did not have a clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I managed to get one strap off in my room so privacy must be a factor.\" Pacing the room, you mussed. \"Only I ripped it off and that is not the proper way so it went back on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smiled slightly, seeing you move from frustration to constructive thought. However, she also knew that, like Mel, you often preferred to solve your own problems.

Your anger growing, you focused on your shoes as you reached for the buckle. to your surprise, the shoe came off easily.

Your lips were coated in something pink, which you assumed was some kind of lip gloss and your nails, which were still rough and generally unkempt, were painted a light pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing to me? You hit me with two spells?\" you screamed, showing that you was both angry and frightened with the sudden change of pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley gave a slight, pleased smile. \"Good. I can see you can perceive when you're affected by two physical spells. Like I said, it's nothing a hot shower can't fix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, you pushed your way out of your sister's bedroom and headed for the bathroom. Once you had securely locked the door, you realized another problem; your spell affected clothes. With the physical changes, you had partially forgotten about the skirt and the maryjanes. After tensing yourself, you reached from the buckle, which after some resistance, it came undo. After casually discarding the show, you reached for the other, half expecting some kind of trouble. To your surprise, the other shoe came off and soon it joined the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased, you went for the skirt. It too came off easily, allowing you to see that the girls haven't decided to mess with your manhood, or your underwear. Least not yet. That thought was disquieting, and you quickly closed your eyes, not wanting to think too much about that possibility. It was bad enough that they were making you look like a girl. Sighing, you removed the knee socks, followed by your underwear. You actually wanted to have a shower; mainly to relax and de-stress, but also as a way to get rid of the lip gloss you was beginning to taste on your lips.</span></div></div>",

The blow knocked all the wind out of her, making it impossible for her to scream at the moment. Fortunately, the mattress on her bed rose up on its own, catching her.

Her berserk button is being called a 'hag'. Do that and she would likely shift into the 'wasted talent' class of witch, though maybe that is a little harsh. It would probably be more like 'turn you into a girl so you can find out what its like' kind of witch. Jonny, in a couple of seconds, she is going to burst through that door. try not to say anything, touch anything, and most of all, don't eat or drink anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley had barely finished when the door burst open, revealing a tall, dark haired woman in her early 40's.

Hello, Jonnie\" Samantha said in a polite voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't respond, which didn't seem to faze the witch at all. instead, she said, \"Nice outfit.

I can see the results from your tests. While crude, it is marginally effective. Have you tried multiple transformations, or spells from multiple witches?\" Samantha asked, a smile forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley frowned. \"John has perceived every change that we've thrown at him\" she said.

Tomboys tend to want to be stronger, that will increase our risk of becoming boys and losing our magic powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So boys can only get so strong.\" Guessing, you said. \"What about a witch's magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, witch boys can become literal juggernauts.\" Serious, Hayley said. \"The only issue is, they can not use their dormant magic power to get there, they have to work for it. Witches can become super strong but they must use their magic to do it, they can not physically work out at the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A balance of body and mind.\" Bemused, you muttered. \"So, witch girls get transformed as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley nodded. \"That is why mom has been so strict with her rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis changed everything in your mind and you turned to Hayley with a determined look. \"Let's get this test over with so I can get to some real training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smiled and gave you a warm hug. \"I can speed the test along but it will increase the risk of you becoming a girl for life.\" Releasing you, she said. \"If I take it slow, as I have been doing, the risks are much less; it is up to you, bro.

Be fair warned that the witch who swaps roles with the boy will slowly transform into the likeness of said boy while the boy will become her. She must repair the damage and swap back before the swap transformations are complete. Otherwise, she will face the consequences of failing her own test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the best way to fix this.\" Reading the necessary steps and spells to perform the swap, She said. \"John will still be a girl but only until I fix the damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley, not wanting to make another mistake, read further then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

End her test? Why didn't she do that before I urrrgh.... put on Hannah's ballet leotard?' However, you knew something else was wrong. For some reason, you felt heavier, especially in the chest.

The only difference is the approach to learning it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt slightly higher and off balance. You looked down to find yourself wearing four inch heels which went well with your new white summer dress. \"Mom!\" Blushing, you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need this and I am not having any of your arguments!\" Irritated, mom snapped. \"Eyes forward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's sudden change in demeanor startled you enough to obey and you felt a book being lightly placed onto your head. \"A witch must have perfect balance.\" More softly, she explained. \"This is so she can cast strong spells and move quickly to dodge them without falling over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like a football player running on the line of scrimmage without stumbling out of bounds?\" Morbidly curious, you asked. \"They have to dodge other players while doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" With a slight grin, mom said. \"A witch boy must have perfect balance as well but we will talk more about it when or if you return to your male self. Right now, we must work with the form you currently possess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I supposed to do?\" Worried, you asked. \"Walk around in these heels without dropping the book while you add more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave you a bemused grin. \"No, I think I can make it more interesting than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed then muttered, \"Me and my big mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had you walk up and down the stairs with the book balanced on your head. She threw an occasional pillow at you to simulate spells. When you protested, she silenced them by asking, \"Would you prefer I throw real spells at you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, mom kept Mel busy at Megan's house and she asked Harry to take Hannah to the mall for some shopping. A few hours later, you managed to keep four books perfectly balanced on your head despite mom tossing pillows in your direction. You did not want to admit it but you were rather proud of yourself for learning so quickly. Although mom would not admit it, she was a bit impressed with your progress but she had only started. There was still a lot for you to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then moved on to her next lesson which was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once you found out that mom intended to make you speak like a proper lady, you vigorously protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Yes, I know I have to impersonate my sister, but this is too far. I'm not going to sit here like I'm in some odd fashioned finishing school!\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will, young lady\" mom said in an oddly calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me one good reason\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two very good reasons. The first is that speaking like a proper lady means you're not being a tomboy, and increasing your risks. The second is even more important for a young witch such as yourself...\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even want to be a witch, and I do not appreciate that you're trying to write of my chances of returning to normal\" you interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk back to me, 'Hayley' Harrison. I could easily pour down that throat of yours a potion that would make you talk like a lady, but we have cautioned you not to take the easy path. That said, I think a visual example would cut through that stubborn male pride of yours. Melanie. Can you come in here for a few minutes?\" mom yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm trying to get ready for school. I'm going to be, like, late\" Mel answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to smirk, even though you didn't want your twin to see you like this. Mel certainly doesn't talk the 'proper English' that mom was trying to jam into you. Mom however, didn't seemed to be fazed. \"Now, Melanie. Your sister needs a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel walked in after a couple of minutes, still in her nightgown. Mom smiled, as if it was the confirmation she needed. \"Okay. I'm going to teach 'Hayley' the value of speaking properly, especially when it comes to dealing with magic\" mom said, She smiled and said a string of words that you couldn't make out. Instantly, Mel's clothes shimmered and shifted shape into a skirt and spaghetti strapped top. You knew it was something she would want to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Crude, but effective. Now, I'll show you what happens if i mispronounce a word.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I get your point. But I don't need the magic lesson. Mommmm!\" you wailed, vainly trying to stop her, as mom said a similar set of words. The difference was that you ended up in a girls' school uniform. Something that Mel (and Hayley) did wear. Naturally, Mel thought it was funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute dressed like that, Joanie\" Mel teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\" you growled. Turning to mom, you said nervously, \"You're not actually going to send me to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet.

Especially in the presence of Mel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are somethings that are not discussed in textbooks, John\" mom said as she waved her hand.

No Witchbloom spellbook covers this spell. I need to teach your new sister how to pee, and I cannot wait the couple of hours. Follow me\" mom ordered, as she half dragged you towards the bathroom.

While you are doing a reasonable job, your body is that of a 15 year old girl.

Just let go of your male ego for a few seconds. You know I'm being truthful. Now for the main lesson\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any other 'pleasant' surprises?\" you snapped. The idea of periods and boys was too much for you, and it wasn't helped by mom showing you over the past twenty minutes how to deal with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"I'm going to give you a break, 'Hayley', as I know this is much to take in. I'll continue your lessons in one hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking forward to it\" you sarcastically said as you left.

Both Mel and Harry were curious as well, though neither had wanted to press Mel into giving up the secret.  You had barely finished asking your question when the spell had been cast and had started to affect you, or to be strictly accurate, your clothes. Unknown to you, there were two classes of magic that Mel was good at; elemental based magic for some odd reason, and fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects were instant; immediately your shirt started to shrivel up into nothingness, and the neckline instantly plunged down to your upper chest. It would had given anyone a slight glimpse of your breasts, if you had any. The material around the neckline changed as well as more of your shirt disappeared, giving you thin straps, just like the spaghetti strapped top that Mel was wearing. Te only difference was yours was green, but that didn't last too long; within one tenth of a second, color started to bubble and radiate from the center of your new top, turning it pink like Mel's. All this took about half a second, barely enough time for Megan and Harry's brains to register the changes. As their eyes opened wide with shock, the other part of Mel's upper outfit formed on your body; a replica of her padded c cup bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your top changed, your bottom changed too. You jeans instantly shriveled up in the same way as your top did, leaving only the part above your knees intact. Almost as rapidly, the stitching in your jeans came loose, as the fabric shifted to a soft cotton, only for the stitching to link up, forcing the torn leggings to come together into a skirt. You barely had time to register that the strange feeling of a breeze flowing up your skirts wasn't quite right when your underwear started to shift as well. As rapidly as it was for your other clothes, your underwear softened and twisted shape into a pair of pink cotton panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You chalked that last part up to Mel\u2019s insecurities about her body; all of the woman in your family were big chested and at 14 years old Mel was only a B cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing your arms in frustration, you turned to Mel and said, \u201cOkay Mel, you\u2019ve made your point; now get me out of this silly outfit before Mom or someone else sees me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so...dear brother.\u201d With a smirk, Mel said, \u201cI said I was going to give you a taste of my powers; the problem is that only girls can be witches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of dread appeared across your face as you realized what Mel was going to do next.  \u201cPlease don\u2019t, Mel; I-I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Putting your arms up in self defense, you said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get you mad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad; I\u2019m just having fun.\u201d With a chuckle, Mel said, \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to have a twin sister; now I guess I\u2019ll have one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that point both Megan and Harry had stopped laughing; with Megan coming to her boyfriend\u2019s aid.  \u201cMel; don\u2019t overreact here, it was just some simply teasing from your brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStow it, Meg; you and I both know John needs to learn a lesson here, especially after he\u2019s less than supportive whenever you have your monthly visitor.\u201d Turning to you, Mel said, \u201cPerhaps a few weeks where he experiences life with my powers and perhaps his own monthly visitor; he\u2019ll be more understanding about what we go through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Meg in desperation; hoping that she was going to continue siding with you.  You were shocked when she turned away and walked towards Megan.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry babe, but your sister is right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I don\u2019t need your support then.\u201d Turning to Harry, you said, \u201cI\u2019ve got my best friend on my side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry man, but don\u2019t drag me into this.\u201d Stepping away, Harry said, \u201cI still have nightmares from Hayley swapped me and my pregnant aunt last year.  Childbirth is not something a 13 year old boy should experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing you were outnumbered, you sighed and said, \u201cFine, just get it over with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Megan and Harry watching in silence, Mel continued the changes to your body.  The first things to change were your hair and face; as your hair grew to just past your shoulders and your face became more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you struggled to get the hair out of your eyes, you felt your chest starting to feel puffy.  Looking down you saw it growing until you had breasts the same size as Mel\u2019s.  After that the rest of the changes progressed quickly; it wasn\u2019t long before you were a complete girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last change that Mel made was to change the color of her top so that the two of you could be told apart.  As you walked over to the mirror to see yourself, you were stopped when _______ walked into the room.</span></div></div>",

She was so mad. Everyone was overreacting! It wasn't like John...sorry, Amanda...didn't deserve it. Mel opened her spell book and tore through the pages, casting spell after spell in anger, not even fully realizing what she was doing. Soon enough, flowers were growing from her floor, her T.V. turned itself on, and she could swear that she heard some kind of ghost that she probably accidentally called into the house. Most ghosts tended to be friendly, so that wasn't a big deal. Ugh, why was she even doing this? physical transformations were some of the hardest spells to reverse, so for all the knew, John was actually stuck as Amanda forever now. If only there was something she could do to make it right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mel kept reading her spells randomly and things kept happening, she didn't even realize the spell that she had just landed on. It was a simple spell, but required some very advanced magic. It wasn't until after she said it, when the book began glowing brightly, that Mel realized what she had done. She started yelling \"No! No! I don't really want this! Stop the spell!!!\" to no avail. Every exploded from the book, hitting everything it could find. The picture on Mel's desk of her and John changed into one of her and Amanda, her twin. All family pictures that had John in them changed to having Amanda. Even baby pictures changed from having a baby boy to a baby girl. As the energy hit John's room all of his clothing changed in size and design to become much more girly and fit someone of Mel and Amanda's size. All the videogames were replaced with girly books and magazines and the room became a place with much similar taste to Mel's. Then the energy spread away from the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was looking at all the pictures of herself with John, crying about the possible loss of her boyfriend. She really loved him and didn't know what she would do without him. Suddenly, the energy hit her room. The pictures of the two of them on dates were changed and all the pictures of the two of them on her phone got deleted or altered. The one she was looking at now suddenly changed to a picture of her with Amanda. Megan frowned as the energy hit her. She suddenly held her head, now having a huge headache. She moved a hand to her eye and felt a tear. Had she been crying? Why would that be? She looked at her phone and smiled at the picture. Nothing could brighten Megan's mood like seeing a picture with herself and her best friend Amanda. The two were practically sister's and were on the cheer squad together. she flipped to another picture of her photo bombing Amanda and Harry's first kiss. The two of them had been a couple for awhile and Megan was always hanging out with them. Megan laughed, wondering if she could crash their next date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\nBack at the house, the new Amanda was getting being helped by her mom to get dressed in a comfortable dress when the energy hit both of them and they held their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? why were you helping me to get dressed again?\" Amanda asked, confused as she fixed up her dress and looked int he mirror. Her mother looked at her with an equally confused look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, sweetheart. Why don't you go back to your sister and work on magic together?\" she asked, turning around to leave. She smiled as she watched Amanda run over to Mel's room. Her twin daughters were getting better by the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nIn Mel's room, she was crying hysterically. The last thing she wanted was to cast that spell. If all of reality was now changing, there would be no possible way for John to come back, because no one would know who John was. Mel was still crying when Amanda walked into her room. \"Hey, are you alright, sis?\" she asked, concerned, kneeling to the ground. Mel pushed her away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course I'm not, John!\" she yelled, reading more random spells from her book in an effort to reverse things. Amanda just looked confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? Who's that? Why are you reading all these spells from our book?\" she asked, recognizing the spellbook as the one that the two girls had always shared and learned from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and let me fix this!\" she yelled as the energy came full circle, hitting Mel hard. She dropped the book and fell to the floor, holding her head. As her concentration broke, her room returned to normal. Amanda shook Mel's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sis, what happened? Helloooooooo....earth to Mel?\" she asked, taking the book from her sister and flipping through it. Amanda found a spell for healing a headache and said it with a smile.

I'm more concerned about the present day. I was never going to show you this, but thanks to your sister, you three have questions that need answering\" mom said, as she lifted her hand. A 3-D map of the globe appeared above mom's desk. Harry and Megan looked impressed, but you weren't so happy.

What's it like?\" Harry asked in an impressed voice. He was always more interested in this sort of stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five universes actually. One has magic far stronger than ours and seems that all the myths you're ever heard comes from this reality. Another seems to had magic seeded into it. Whether from our universe or another, I don't know. Another universe is much more technologically advanced compared to us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice\" Harry said, apparently interested in mom's story. You and Megan weren't sharing his enthusiasm though. Mom gave a thin smile. \"We've add some nasty things come through that tear, though luckily it seems the people on the other side somehow blew themselves up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice...\" you muttered, not sure whether to believe mom's story. \"What does this have to do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled, though you wasn't sure whether it was one of sadness, regret, or distain. \"Just before we lost contact, my brother tried to reverse engineer some tech from that world, but mom caught him. Its like giving allowing children to play with a nuclear weapon. This leads to a point of divergence.

Now!\" you thundered, trying to sound as tough as your new voice would allow.

Mel, you're not dueling Hannah anymore. You're dueling John.

Being a girl isn't bad. once this is over, I'll take you shopping\" Mel offered, her voice filled with confidence and while she meant it kindly, it did come across that she expected to win quickly, and get you into the girly stuff fast. As you wondered despairingly how to overcome the two disadvantages that were facing you, you heard Hayley's voice saying, \"This fight will involve elemental type magic. Vaporize water so Mel can't see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you thought, as you looked around, expecting to heard Mel's moaning that it was 'unfair' that Hayley was giving you advice on how to fight Mel, but Mel was still looking at you, with the same smile that was generated by the thoughts of having a 'true twin' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel won't be able to hear us, John.

Now, move to the left...\" the voice said. You obeyed, as Mel knew out what looked like lighting. It caused both Megan and Harry to panic, but mom was unconcerned, saying that it wouldn't harm you... only incapacitate you, and win the duel for Mel. You barely noticed, since you was focused on Mel's slightly shocked face. She obviously expected to win in the first move. A surge of anger rippled through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Magic is like hard exercise, 'sis', and Mel will be using a lot. Counterstrike now. Imagine water. A lot of water, and boil it\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned and to your shock as you imagined water, water magically appeared above your hand. \"H-how?\" Mel stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're forgetting your training. John is a girl, and all girls in this family, even Hannah would have some ability to work magic\" mom said irritably, though she gave a faint smile as you tried to throw the water into Mel's face....</span></div></div>",

Enough to get you through a year, though Witchbloom does teach more than just magic. Think of it as a reward for not running out the door screaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to happen. Firstly Witchbloom is a girls' school. More importantly, you said that we'd be in the same class as John. What if you decide that he is having a 'temper tantrum' and enrolls him in kindergarten?\" Harry demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is true. You would be same age as my little sis. There is no 'dishonor' or punishments for declining, guys. Even Samantha wouldn't.... never mind\" Hayley said, though you was suspicious of why she cut herself off. You was also angry that your friends had a choice, whereas you was being forced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you hiding?\" you hissed, in an accusing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out.

Deal with it since you do not, repeat, do not want to find out what happens if you don't go. Least you have someone to talk about this stuff, which is more that could be said about either Melanie or me\" Hayley snapped. \"Start acting like the 14 year old you're supposed to be before someone decides to match your body with your attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens if John doesn't go?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be considered at John was defeated in the duel, and she would have to get used to the idea of bras, skirts and boys. And I'm not going to let that happen, sis. Sorry guys that you had to hear 'Joanie's' temper tantrum.

It was slightly surprising, since both of them had good reasons to stay. Harry was the more obvious; it didn't escape his attention or yours that in order to attend Witchbloom magic school, you had to be a girl. The other thing was that there were two things that would have kept him here. The first was at ever since Mel had returned, three months previously, Harry had been making weird eye movements towards her, much to your disgust. The other reason was more personal; for much of his thirteen year, Harry's parents had been absent. It all came to a head six months ago, when Harry discovered why. It turned out that Harry had a twin sister, Sarah, who was kidnapped when she was extremely young. While he could certainly emphasize, things got (understandably) quite heated, though you knew that currently, his relationship with his parents had been patched up.<br>\r\nWith Megan, it wasn't quite obvious. She was eager to follow you, though you've uncertain whether  its to do the things to you that you'd never allow Mel to do herself. The other thing was that  Megan was a cheerleader; a very good one. Without the former head cheerleader's bullying, Megan had really blossomed within the squad. Going to Witchbloom meant giving that up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're going. Someone has to stop you from getting into trouble\" Harry said, a half smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you thought this through? Both of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. God, you really are a whiner, Lucy\" Megan said, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want either of you to regret this.

Unbeknownst to John and his friends, this was actually a spell book passed down from mother to daughter for generations; because the women of this family were in fact witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the spell in question, with a smile on her face, she said, \"You'll be sorry you didn't spend more time with me, John.\"<br>\r\nAfter taking a breath to calm down, Hannah looked down at the page and started to recite the spell.  \"Ut alicui melius, experiri ambulantes ad mille passus calceati.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall in his bedroom, John was booting up his computer while Harry and Megan poured through history books about World War 2.

Looking around, he found himself in Hannah's bedroom; made obvious by the large of amount of stuffed animals around the room.  \"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stopped when he heard the voice coming from his mouth...it sounded like Hannah's.  In a panic, he turned to the mirror and saw Hannah's reflection looking back at him.  After a moment of shock in which the reflection copied all of his movements, John screamed at the top of his lungs.  \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the door opened; as  _________________ came running in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTranslation of the spell:<br>\r\n<i>To know someone better; try walking a mile in their shoes</i></span></div></div>",

He looked at the book. \"It's blank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Harry as if he had lost his mind then turned the page to find it filled with letters but they were all in a language you did not understand. What made it more curious was that they seemed familiar somehow like a language you had spoken years ago but had forgotten. \"You don't see the words or pictures in this book?\" Confused, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shook his head, chuckling. \"You're funny, bro.\" he said. \"It's probably a journal one of your sisters picked up from the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... maybe.\" Closing the book, you said. \"I'd better take this to mom. She can find out who it belongs to and give it to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked down the hall to mom's study; the door was open. You stepped inside to place it on her desk but paused as you spotted a letter from a school you did not recognize. Curious, you looked at it and found that it was a private school inquiry letter with you name on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like Mom is thinking about sending me away, just as she did with Hayley and Mel.\" Worried, you said. \"Only what is this school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the letter again and found that there were two schools offering to accept you due to excellent grades and a 'powerful potential'. One was Witchbloom all girls boarding school and the other was Witchstone all boys boarding school. This only made you more curious as you never heard of either school. Still, you were not about to attend an all girls boarding school, being a boy. Also, you were not sure you were willing to just up and leave as Hayley and Mel did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater you decide to question mom in private only when you finally got a moment with her, she did not seem to be in the mood to talk. \"I'm sorry, John but I am very busy right now.\" Patiently, she said. \"You may ask me one question but make it quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, frustrated and tried to think of what would be the most important thing to ask mom and finally asked her about...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She summoned a flame to her hand to prove it, causing you to jump slightly. \"I and your sisters have the power to harness and control the powers of magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with me?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only girls have this power.\" Patiently, mom replied. \"You will have this power only if I or one of your sisters change you into a girl.\" she sighed. \"As a boy, you have powerfully enhanced attributes; making you blessed physically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why I'm the strongest boy in school?\" Your curiosity rising, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sat down and urged you to do the same before the door to her study closed quietly on its own. \"Yes but that is only the tip of the iceberg, John.\" Smiling, she said. \"You will develop incredible physical prowess that will match your sister's magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled but it flattened with mom's frown. \"As a twin to a witch, you may fall under a condition known as the twin factor which means you will change into a girl and a witch to match your sister to form a balance.\" Serious, she explained. \"As you go into training for your physical powers, Mel stands the risk of changing into a boy to make the same balance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch...\" Wincing, you said. \"I'd hate to know I was responsible for her being a boy for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom let out a low giggle. \"Mel basically said the same thing only she would not mind having 'girl John' around for a few weeks.\" she said.

Seeing this confused you as you thought the school taught girls how to control magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic and potion making is an exact art.\" Whispering, Rikki explained. \"Mathematics plays a very important role; it is crucial that all witches know their math well and the best way to make certain of that is to start at the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.\" Smiling slightly, you said. \"I mean you would not want to make anything too weak or worse too powerful, it may hurt someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you understand, Lucy.\" Smiling, mom whispered. \"This is why Hayley and Mel needed to be away for a year. Reckless use of magic is dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both boys and girls come to this school to learn magic.\" Smiling, Rikki said. \"For the girls, it is a requirement but for the boys it is a chance to feel closer to their sisters and experience magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some boys who come here decide to remain girls for the rest of their lives.\" Chiming in, mom added. \"However, they must make the choice out of their own free will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you and my sisters kept this from me for so long?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of it.\" Sighing, mom said. \"I know how curious you are; I did not want your sisters to be tempted to sway your decision one way or the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then followed mom and Rikki as they moved on to another room where the teacher was demonstrating a simple spell.

From the hall, you watched in wonder as the teacher took notice of you and sent the fiery horse running to you. It galloped around your head then neighed before vanishing. Your eyes were wide and filled with a childish wonder as you turned to the smiling teacher. \"That was cool!\" Whispering, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is called a summoning spell.\" Politely, the teacher said. \"I am Lucy Connor; welcome to Witchbloom all girls boarding school... Miss Harrison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Connor taught Hayley and then Mel during their year here, Lucy.\" Smiling, mom said. \"If you choose to attend here, she will be your teacher as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to try that spell...

You jumped when Lucy placed a gentle hand onto your shoulder. \"Lucy is a twin to a witch.\" Speaking to her stunned class, she said. \"As such, her magical potential is much stronger than usual. Her sister also had a very strong magical potential only it was harder for her to control as Lucy here was a boy at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have magic as a girl?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded, smiling. \"Yes, you will.\" Politely, she said. \"However, it must be your choice to want magic before we can train you.\" She shook her head. \"It is unwise for a witch boy to toy with magic if he does not wish to be a girl for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you were excused from the class and Rikki asked, \"Would you like to see more of the school or have you sen enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please think about it; magic does carry its own rewards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving Witchbloom, mom instructed you to remove the bracelet before she changed you back to your male form.

You recognized him as your grandfather, Moriarty Strange. \"Welcome, Natalie.\" With a warm smile, Moriarty said. \"I see John has reached that curious age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dad.\" Managing a smile, mom replied. \"He has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoriarty sighed. \"You know I am not permitted to try to sway your son one way or the other.\" Patiently, he said. \"I am here to offer you two a tour of the school and show you what we teach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead the way, dad.\" Calmly, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoriarty nodded and lead you and mom into the building. \"First of all, Witch boys have heightened everything.\" Motioning to a large room, he said. \"Attributes, senses, reflexes, everything physical and mental is enhanced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible.\" Surprised, you said. \"How far are they enhanced?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing that you would categorize as a 'super power', I assure you.\" Smiling, Moriarty replied. \"Witch girls can summon the same abilities with their magic but it comes naturally to the boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic or muscle...\" Mussing, you muttered. \"That is how Rikki at Witchbloom put it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the choice that faces you at this moment, John.\" Serious, Moriarty said. \"As a trained witch boy, you can defend your family and friends from any non-magical threat that falls upon them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I face a bad witch?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is where your sisters and I come into play.\" Firmly but kindly, mom replied. \"As strong and fast as you are, you will never be a match for a fully trained witch in a head to head duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This school does not teach you how to fight witches.\" Serious, Moriarty said. \"We teach you how to control your heightened physical prowess so you do not accidentally injure someone.\" He sighed, his face softening. \"The witch community has its own law enforcement, you need not worry about facing any magical threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the first thing they teach you?\" Changing the subject, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoriarty opened his hand, producing a glowing ball of energy the size of a bowling ball! It hovered and spun over his palm. \"This is called a witch boy's 'spark'.\" Smiling, he said. \"This is their physical power personified into energy; a witch can gauge how physically strong a witch boy is by the size of their spark.\" He chuckled. \"As you can see, I'm fairly strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you opened your hand and tried to produce a spark as you were instructed to produce a flame at witchbloom. What appeared was a sphere the size of a baseball. Seeing it, Moriarty smiled. \"Is is a good thing?\" Confused, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it shows that you are very strong, considering you just discovered magic a short time ago.\" Calmly, Moriarty said. \"I can give you a tour of our classes or I can give you some literature to take home; its your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to mom and noticed that she still seemed uneasy. You decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are both a bit uncertain of what we teach here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner smiled. \"Well, Ms Harrison, we teach witch boys how to control their own powers without injuring anyone; especially those they hold dear.\" Kindly, she said. \"Boys in witch families do not have magic but their enhanced physical forms more than compensate for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are boys not told until they learn about magic on their own?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is an excellent question, Mr Harrison.\" Smiling, Tanner replied. \"You see... and I mean no offense when I say this... boys mature more slowly than girls and they tend to be more aggressive in nature so it is important that they are trained at a later age when they gain some maturity and are less likely to use their gifts out of anger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told that witch boys deal with non-magical threats.\" Still curious, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was what I was explaining here.\" Motioning to her class, Tanner said. \"Please, take a seat and you can listen in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, you walked into the class and took a seat at a desk marked 'visitor' near the teacher's desk while mom and Moriarty watched from the door. \"The witch community is a very secretive group.\" Turning to her class, Tanner began. \"If our existence were to be exposed, there will be people who will attempt to make use of us for their own selfish ends. This is the same for both the girls and the boys; you can imagine how some groups would make use of 'super soldiers'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the boys in the room shuddered as Tanner continued her lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boys in witch families deal with burglars, bullies, nosy neighbors, and so on.\" Firmly, Tanner continued. \"Each case is different and each are handled in various ways. The point is, boys in witch families are the guardians of their family secret.\" She smiled. \"With a mere glare, witch boys can send a chill down the spine of a non-magical man. It is not magic, it is all confidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your hand and she nodded, allowing you to speak. \"It would be wise not to mistake confidence with arrogance.\" Politely, you said. \"Even the strongest of men can be taken down by someone half their size, if taken off guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Mr Harrison.\" Smiling, Tanner said. \"You are correct. Witches learn very quickly in their training that they are not invincible merely because they have magic. Witch boys will learn the same lesson; massive muscle does not equal invulnerability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the class, Moriarty took you and mom to another room where a boy was blindfolded while three other boys were swinging wooded staffs at him. Your first instinct was to run in and defend the blindfolded boy but you paused as he blocked each and every swing with a wooded staff of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough.\" Firmly, a female voice instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys stopped and the other removed his blindfold as a short, plump woman came into view, smiling. \"That was incredible, Miss Rave.\" Happily, the boy said. \"I could hear the staffs moving through the air when they swung them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Witch boys have enhanced senses as well as enhanced attributes.\" Firmly but kindly, Miss Rave said. \"Just remember that witch girls can summon the same skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So witches are still better than us?\" Pouting, the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No!\" Giggling, Miss Rave replied. \"Witch girls are blessed with magic, a powerful tool. True, they can do many things you can not but you are blessed as well.\" She paused, seeing you and smiled as she turned back to her student. \"Witch boys can see and hear things before a witch girl is even aware it is there. They have an awareness that magic can not summon; that is why they are the guardians of their families.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smiled at that. \"Thank you. Miss Rave.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are there only female teachers here?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is simple, young man.\" Walking up to you, Miss Rave said. \"A witch teacher can better control a class of rowdy boys if they get out of hand. Also, this is a very new school, there are not too many properly trained men to take the position of teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before, it was the mother's duty to train their sons in the use of their enhanced strength.\" Frowning, mom said. \"However, witch boys and witch girls require different approaches to training...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So its hard to balance the two.\" Sighing, you said. \"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was thought that making the boy a girl would give that boy a sense of participation.\" Patiently, Miss Rave said. \"However, it did not teach that boy how to control his strength or to work against his instincts to gain revenge for being 'violated', being toyed with for his family's 'amusement'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing amusing about it.\" Almost sadly, mom said. \"It was all thought to help the boy gain resistance to magic and feel as if he belonged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"I understand.\" Softly, you said. \"I think I have seen enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoriarty nodded. \"Very good then.\" Smiling, he said. \"If you will follow me to my office, I will hand you some literature to pour over to help you with your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, you were back on the road with mom on the way home. \"So what do you make of Witchstone school?\" Curious, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay, I guess.\" Shrugging, you said. \"Only a lot of what they are offering I already know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father taught you a lot of that.\" Smiling, mom said. \"He was pushing for that school to be built before he passed away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you did not want to go there?\" Tearing up, you asked. \"It reminded you of dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I see a lot of your father in that school.\" wiping a tear from her eye, mom said. \"He would be proud to see you go there but I would miss you the entire year and when you got back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be too much like dad.\" Whispering, you finished. Mom nodded. \"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You gulped, taking it all in and began to seriously worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks better on the inside.\" Wincing, Rikki said.

All of the walls were a calming pastel pink with a number of pictures with beautiful landscapes. The furniture was all wood but seemed to shine with an almost unnatural glow.

Upon returning home, Hayley led you to mom's study. There, mom pushed a button under her desk you did not see before, opening a hidden door in the back of the room. \"This way, John.\" Firmly but kindly, she said. \"It's time for you to see and understand the family secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you followed mom and Hayley through the hidden door which closed behind you. Beyond it was a long stone stairwell that led to an underground room where you found libraries of books lining all four walls, a huge iron cauldron over a stone fire pit in the center, an impressive garden surrounding it and various work stations that look similar to a small laboratory. \"What is all of this!?\" Darkly impressed, you asked. \"It looks like a scene from a Gothic science fiction movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Hayley giggled. \"This is a private training center, John.\" Smiling, mom explained. \"As my eldest daughter, Hayley had to go to a special school to learn how to control a certain gift all girls in this family are born with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A certain gift?\" Raising an eyebrow, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One step at a time, John.\" Gently, mom said. \"Boys in this family are not born with this gift unless certain conditions are met but, because you are Mel's twin, you may soon gain that gift without anyone helping it along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you're scaring me.\" Uncomfortable, you said. \"Are to telling me that I may turn into a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a real possibility.\" Wincing, Hayley said. \"As you reached thirteen, we sensed that the dormant magic in you was very strong and decided to wait a year before telling you anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys are telling me that I'm in a family of witches?\" Unnerved, you asked. Mom and Hayley nodded. \"What difference does a year make in telling me all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A year ago, you were dealing with puberty.\" Calmly, mom replied. \"With all of those hormones running wild inside of you, it would have been dangerous for everyone to introduce you to magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had to wait until your body and mind calmed down a little first.\" Equally calm, Hayley added. \"Boys who are born into families like ours are blessed physically. You would have been a real handful if you were to be panicked or worse enraged a year ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you insisted upon the athletics and meditation.\" Catching on, you said. \"To prepare me for all of this and, I suspect, more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Now for the kicker.\" Placing a hand onto your shoulder, she said. \"We fear that your own magic is slowly changing you from the inside out. This is the most difficult of all transformations as it can be painful.\" she winced. \"Or worse, painless and unnoticed by all until it is too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran a hand through your hair, frustrated. \"Is- Is there anything you can do to stop it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, John.\" Flatly, mom replied. \"You see, it is a condition known as the twin factor. You and Mel are mentally and magically linked so, once Mel learns magic and starts to practice it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will transform into a girl and a witch to form a balance.\" Guessing correctly, you said. \"What if my physical strength raised above her magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, John but that is not how the balance works.\" Gently, Hayley said. \"Your best bet is to keep your strength and other attributes equal with Mel's magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and there is your own dormant magic to consider.\" Serious, mom said. \"If it becomes too strong for your body to contain it, you will spontaneously switch genders to give that magic an outlet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long before I know I'm changing?\" Begging, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed and pointed to a mirror on the door to the underground room. \"Sorry, John but I fear that...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Immediately you saw that the walls had scorch marks, a sign there had been a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" you said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want you to worry, John, but our sweet, well behaved cousin got into the potion store\" Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God.

Mom was in her study, and from the way she spoke,  you could tell she was really happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head to the bathroom. I'll be there soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom....\" you protested. You knew you had to tell her about Kristy, but mom was insistent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can talk later\" mom pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" you said, as you flung down your backpack, which was to your relief something a teen girl would have rather than one a girl your apparent age would love, and headed for the bathroom. Mom was already there, and was running the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? I can bathe myself\" you said crossly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that sweetie, but you're still new to being a girl. Let me help you\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. Eek\" you squeaked, seeing that mom zapped away your clothes. Embarrassed, you tried to cover yourself, but mom laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're both girls, sweetie\" mom said, as she motioned for you to head into the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a problem\" you tried to say as mom 'helped' you in the bath. You was getting annoyed, both with mom's childish treatment of you, and her not listening to what you wanted to say. She seemed to be in her own little world. Fuming, you allowed her to continue, figuring it would be best to allow her to finish. After she had passed you a towel, your heart sank further. In the corner, there was several silver colored boxes, and you suspected that it was some sort of dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open them\" mom gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuluctantly, you opened the smallest box first. it contained a heart shaped pendant, but unlike the one Hannah wore, it was far more expensive looking. It also looked older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has been in our family for generations, Lucy. I want you to wear it... least after you get some clothes on\" mom chuckled. You didn't know what to say; instead you focused on the next box. it was plain white panties, which wasn't something you had an issue with. Quickly you put them on, and focused on the next box. It was something you had been dreading as much as a dress; a training bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Considering that you're....  you, and and that I do not allow Hannah to wear one, I decided to allow you to have one, Lucy. As you know, magic isn't the only dominant thing to run through the women of our family, and I know when you reach 14 again, you're going to be at least as big as Mel, if not bigger....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. Can you talk about something other than the size of the breasts of my sisters?\" you said, slightly disgusted as you stared at the white thing in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a part of being a girl. You know Hannah wants to do the things that Melanie and Hayley does. Anyway, you're a big girl and since you're not a grade schooler, I though maybe this would help you feel more grown up\" mom gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" you said, not entirely convinced. Without warning, you felt a slight caged feeling around your chest. \"mom, did you had to magically put that thing onto me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I know you were hesitant. We're running late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what other 'surprises' have you got for me?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom magically opened up the last box. It was, as you feared a dress, but this one was white. Another box containing wrist gloves was next to the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? What is going on? And why white?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would prefer white to say, pink\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"White is fine\" you said as you felt another weird sensation as mom zapped the dress and gloves onto you. As she zipped up the dress, you said, \"That Kristy Hart is back and knows who I am.\"</span></div></div>",

How could the return of the biggest bitch you knew be anything but a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hart got caught trying to use magic she stole from Samantha Forester. And in Samantha, Kristy has met her match. Do you know who she is?\" mom asked, as she motioned for you to sit down so she could do your hair. You made no attempt; instead you continued to pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't go near her. That witch has a short fuse. There are worse things than being a teacher\" mom said, answering her own question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going anyway?

While there was several kids your new age inside, the only one you recognized was the only boy; your cousin, Tim. That surprised you, as you was expecting to see just girls. Hannah was surprised as well. She turned to mom and whined, \"Why is Timmy the Toad here, mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I want to know as well. He cannot see me like this. I thought only girls can work magic\" you whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley and Mel gave a slight giggle at your complain, while Hannah started to grin.

I doubt aunt Catherine would had bothered if he was going to end up like me\" you said, slightly sourly. Ignoring Mel's giggles, you continued. \"Two. Look at his face. He is clearly stressed. He knows where he is, who he is with and what could happen. I think he will be on is best behavior tonight.\" You sisters seemed to be eager to put it to the test, especially Hannah. They immediately walked over towards your slightly terrified cousin. You stayed back; you wasn't ready to face him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work\" a girl said from behind. You turned and saw an eight year old girl smiling at you. She was similar to you, except she worn a pale blue dress and had her mousy brown hair secured with a bow. Her brown eyes showed intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening Lucy Harrison.

Anyway I was sent to deal with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sent? What do you mean?\" you asked, partly out of curiosity and partly out of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kind of the problem solver when it comes to anything to do with kids and witches. Your transformation meant that magic could no longer be hidden from either of your cousins, Tim or Brooke, so the head witch decided that maybe a talk between me and Tim would calm him down\" Robyn said with a slight shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did the little toad do? Put his pet frog down your dress?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeans actually. No. He said he won't let cootie brained creatures corrupt his sister whilst he poured oatmeal into my hair\" Robyn said. She pouted slightly as you gave a slight involuntary giggle. \"I glad you think its funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim has done worse, Robyn. Last year he dropped Fella -that is his pet frog- down one of the school cheerleader's top. While he certainly fears girls, and likes taunting them, there is a pattern to all of it. Nothing physical. Protect his favorite target.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean his sister?\" Robyn said dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Tim probably is worried that someone will teach Brooke bad habits. Mainly to use against him. Wanna go and ask him\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn's eyes lit up. \"I wouldn't mind watching him squirm a bit more. He will recognize me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Robyn walked towards Catherine's table, where Tim was pleading to his mother about something. You guessed it was for her to get him out of there, but whatever it was, it was irrelevant. Tim spotted you and Robyn and stopped pleading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timmy\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess cootiehead\" Tim responded, but you could tell it was a front; he was terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was bad enough that you was stuck as a girl, something that made you reluctant to been seen publicly, but to walk up onto that stage appearing like a very girlie girl was something else.

Just walk up there and be yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That is easy for you to say', you thought darkly, as you reluctantly walked to the stage. You didn't care why Elvira wanted you in the spotlight, but you knew it was better to obey, then run away as soon as you could. Elvira was oddly distant; the only sign of acknowledgement was a slight nod of her head. Her attention focused back to the crowd as she continued her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young ladies. Lucy was the victim of the magical condition called the Twin Factor...\"Elvira said, or at least, tried to say.

You blushed even more, seeing that some of the little girls had figured out what had happened to you, and thought it was funny. Daring a glance over towards Tim, you saw he was looking increasingly angrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira continued, seemingly undisturbed by the interruptions. \"However, Lucy's case is unique. She only regressed to her 'twin's' age, and started to change her sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwwwwwww\" the same voices protested in the crowd.

It was apparent they found it funny to see him the only boy at a ceremony for girls with magical power. A glance from Elvira brought silence as Tim reluctantly walked into the spotlight on the stage. Elvira placed a firm hand onto his shoulder. \"Tim was the victim of a near tragedy involving his little sister, Brooke.\" To everyone's surprise, she said. \"A young witch with no chance of having children of her own attempted to kidnap Brooke from her own bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasps rose from the audience as Hayley turned to mom, startled. \"I didn't know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I.\" Worried, mom replied. \"There must be a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim confronted this witch, becoming a miniature Juggernaut like my husband, Dr. Moriarty Strange, easily overpowering the witch's magic.\" In a serious tone, Elvira stated. She waited for her words to sink in before continuing. \"Just as strong emotions augment magic in girls, it augments a boy's physical strength; Tim nearly killed the witch in his attempt to stop her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim began to sob slightly, blushing brightly but Elvira ignored him and continued. \"The witch placed a taunting curse onto this young man, forcing him to taunt every girl in sight. It loses it's grip over him when Tim either becomes a girl permanently or falls in love.\" She smiled at the audience. \"The reason he is here tonight is to celebrate him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only because of what Elvira said, but because a few of the girls in the audience giggled at the idea.<br>\r\n\"What!?\" he said in a oddly quiet, disbelieving voice. \"You're going to turn me into some icky, gross dumb girl?! Not going to happen.\" Seeing that Elvira was going to grab his hand, Tim pulled away and started to take a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make this harder, Timothy\" Elvira said in a gentle voice, but Tim wasn't listening. He had moved to the edge of the stage and was risking taking a glance around the room, apparently looking for an escape route. Everyone could see this, including Elvira. She frowned and said, \"You're not going to run away, Tim. I promise it won't hurt, and I promise that you won't get any more 'comments' for the audience\" she said in a slight dark tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to run. I would have done the same\" a voice said. It was Robyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why transform Tim? Or why I'm here? You look tense, Lucy. As for Tim, I think the head witch is bluffing. Lucky for her; if she was anyone else, I think that cousin of yours would had punched her in the guts, then fled\" Robyn said, as Tim made a dash for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he can escape?\" you asked, as Catherine roared, \"Timothy Towers! Get back here at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From a room full of witches? The only way he can escape is if we let him\" Robyn said, as you glanced around. Nobody seemed to want to stop the panicked boy, with two exceptions. The first was Hannah, who was whining to mom. The other was Samantha; while she didn't move, yo saw a glint in her eye that you didn't like. It was if she was planning something, and you instictively knew it would be bad news for Tim.

You remembered her look she had before Tim's flight, and you <br>\r\nfigured that she was plotting something. After three minutes, mom walked over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're going to leave the dinner, find your cousin, and persuade him to come back and accept her fate\" mom announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?

She turned to Tim and said, \"You know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim hesitated, but it was irrelevant. Steve and Rick came to investigate and once they saw that Robyn (reluctantly) wanted Tim to kiss him, they started their own taunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww. No way.

Seconds later, she saw her girlish body.

An hour either way....\" mom said, trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered, thinking of what it could had been. \"Why does Tim have to bee transformed? There has to be someone out there that can just kiss him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Tim. Why didn't you tell me he was here?\" mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really expect an answer, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Just like how you don't need an answer for how I know he was here. Whether he is with Robyn or not, Tim is almost out of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is just like that? Hand him over to Forester to have it done like those friends of his?\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" mom demanded, confused by your comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha changed Tim's friends into girls. Worse, they seem to think they, Tim included, have always been girls, and that a magic wielding Tim goofed up a spell\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Lucy, once you've done your hair, tell Hannah I need to see her, then head off to school\" mom ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                               *************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy.

I thought you was supposed to be, like, teaching.\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm preparing for it. Is one plus one too difficult for you?\" Kristy said.

Little girl is throwing around some big words. And what is she wearing? That training bra doesn't make you a big girl, Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering how she could had known that; you had covered all signs that you was wearing one, you turned to leave.

You'd hate it more if you was in the same grade was us. Or even better, the same age as Lucy\" Megan said with a slightly mean smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristy stared a Megan, seemingly like if she was finally listening to her, but she quickly covered it with a forced smile. \"I'll see you three in class\" she said in a stiff voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bitch\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, not wanting to say that she was a lot more competitive and generally more Kristy-like when she was in a verbal fight with the hated teacher. \"Yeah. Thanks for not letting her know I could do those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you?\" Harry asked, a slight tone of worry in his voice. You shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.

Like before, Kristy was making the class as boring and unpleasant as possible. Everyone was uncomfortable, but you was fuming. Kristy was messing with everyone's futures simply because she hated Megan, and found delight in your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. They'll get rid of her, Tonya\" you whispered back. You liked Tonya; she was more accepting, other than Megan and Harry, of having an eight year old 'genius' in her class, and treated you like if you was a teen. Whispering though was a mistake; Kristy was waiting and walked up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No talking in class, little girl\" Kristy sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't take it any more. \"If you was a better teacher, or even person, I wouldn't need to talk. Besides, I know that last year you constantly gossiped in class\" you snapped, saying what everyone else was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to enjoy having you sent back to where you belong, you little grade-schoolgirl\" Kristy mocked, empathizing the girl part. You felt angrier than ever, and something had to give. A white flash shot out, engulfing the room. As your vision cleared, you saw that Kristy had drastically changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow your magic had regressed Kristy back to 14. She was thin, awkward looking, and had lost most of her curves. plus she was now dressed in the school's uniform. You didn't know if this was what Kristy looked like when she was 14 the first time, but it was clear this time, she wasn't the athletic type. You hurriedly looked around the class, but apart from Megan, Harry and the shocked former teacher, everyone acted if it was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Kristy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because the teacher had to rush out of class, doesn't mean you have to act like if you're it\" Tonya shouted. It was all you needed to hear. Confused, you thought, <i>Did I do that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                   *********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn</i> you thought as you headed to the locker room for PE. A week ago you would had loved the idea of being in the girls' locker room before PE. Now, you was just one of the girls. Worse, Kristy had decided to follow you and Megan. Whether it was out of fear or suspicion that you changed her, or she was somehow fitting into the life of a 14 year old, you didn't know, but it was alarming. As you entered the room, you noticed that a letter was sticking from the locker. Picking it up, you saw it was from Elvira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She started to scan the paper, much to your horror, but threw it back at you after a second. You released your held up breath; from Kristy's point of view, the letter was blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you that you don't belong in here. freak\" Kristy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave her alone\" one of the girls yelled in your defense.

You'll get these in a few years\" the girl cheerfully yelled back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" you replied in a small squeak as you didn't relish the idea of going through puberty as a girl. You turned to reply to Kristy, but she was gone. Shaking your head, you thought, <i>Did she look different?

Worry, because Tim's deadline was up, and that you hadn't seen Kristy since you inadvertently cast a spell onto her. That said, Kristy wasn't your concern; Tim was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up. Want to come with me to help deal with Tim?\" you asked Megan and Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Got practice.

See you around, Princess\" Harry stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning slightly, you headed for your bike, which was fortunately, a reduced version of your old one. Five minutes later, you arrived outside Tim's school and saw that he was walking away from a crowd of girls, which wasn't a situation you was familiar with. on closer inspection, you saw that the group consisted of Hannah, Robyn, and his two transformed friends, Stephanie, and Raquel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Timmy' please listen to her. You'll feel better once you're back to normal\" Raquel said. You groaned slightly; it was clear that Raquel and and Stephanie still thought that they, and Tim were really girls, and that Tim was the transformed one. Sliding next to Robyn, you said, \"Fill me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy. It seems that both 'Raquel' and 'Stephanie' are an odd mixture of extreme tomboys and extreme girlie girls. One minute, they want to play with dolls and dress up with Tim and Hannah. Next minute, they're running around like if they're boys. Must be some sort of side effect from Forester's spell\" Robyn said distastefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Tim?\" you inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still no kiss, and I don't think it will ever come. You can here what he is saying\" Robyn said half relieved. You understood; while you knew she wanted Tim to break the curse, you knew that she knew she would be the most likely target, and that was gross. You ignored Tim's pleas for them to leave him alone, and that girls are dumb and gross. \"We will be forced to change him within the next five minutes\" Robyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea. Can you get the 'girls' and Hannah to back off to about twenty yards?\" you asked. Once the girls had stepped away, albeit reluctantly, you turned to Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up, Tim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away Lucy. I don't want to be a stupid icky girl. You heard what they're said! Once I'm 'back to normal' I'll feel better, and that Princess cootiehead wants to play dress up with me. And Rick and Steve are worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget your stupid pride. Either go kiss one of the girls right now, or I'll have you dressed in one of Hannah's ballet leotards.

Do you want me walking to the mall in this stuff?\" Hayley countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel paled. Everyone knew how vain Mel was and how this would affect her. Even Tina knew, and she started to giggle again. Not that anyone paid her any attention. Mel had finished her spell when she noticed Tina. Like before, Tina had her hand over her mouth the instant she realized that she had giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this? Don't worry, I would totally giggle at it too. There is nothing wrong giggling, Tina\" Mel said in a friendly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I don't want to be a brainless... girl like all of you\" Tina said, as she took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is plenty of good things about being a girl, Christina. Maybe if i dressed you up...\" Mel said excitedly. Her eyes were excitable, which meant bad news for Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop\" you protested, but Mel was too excited and had cast her spell. It only took a few seconds for Tina's clothes to shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why did you do that, you airhead?\" you growled, looking over at Tina. She was staring bewildered at the sight of the pink leotard and tights that had encased her body. Before you could scold Mel any further, or Mel to respond to your insult, Tina teared up and fled to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                      **************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina?\" you said as you pushed open her bedroom door. The girl was slumped on her bed, sobbing, and had her pet frog, Fella perched in her shoulder. She also hadn't bothered to take off her ballet clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away, Lucy\" Tina sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you focused your attention onto your cousin, and cast your spell. Tim barely noticed that he was back to his normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rogue witches abuse that which they are gifted with... that is a real curse as its a waste of talent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised a single eyebrow. Tim had said two full sentences without taunting girls. Then you realized that Fella was a female frog. This caused you to giggle. Tim had fallen in love and that love was returned but it was not the type of love one would expect. It was a love a boy has for his pet but it was love none the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you giggling at all of a sudden?\" Curious, Tim asked. \"There's nothing wrong with having a frog for a pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, Tim.\" Grinning, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim shrugged and continued to pet an coo Fella. Watching him, you knew there was a sliver of hope for him. His heart had opened up for a frog there would soon be room for a girl as well.

I've heard about what happened at school, Christina, and I'm going to have a long talk with the guilty party. For now though, I've come to say enough is enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you be more specific?\" you asked, as you felt a sinking feeling in your stomach. It wasn't so much for you, but for Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina's curse. As you know, I wanted to break it a week ago in the cleanest way possible. However, thanks to your meddling, an additional difficulty has arisen\" Elvira explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to keep me like this? I'd much rather be a dumb boy...\" Tina said. Both you and Robyn caught that and anxiously stared at Tina. While you had noticed Tina had started to use words that Hannah used, you had brushed it off. This was different; Tina was taunting boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. The curse is causing Tina to taunt the opposite gender now. It can still be neutralized by her kissing someone, or again keeping her in this form. Christina is taunting you two mainly out of habit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough is enough, Lucy. While your attempts is admirable, you know how this going to end. So does she\" Elvira said, waving her hand. You winced as your vision blurred, as Elvira teleported you to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on, unless Christina is, as Tim, actually going to kiss a girl, you're at not, I repeat, not, going to change her gender. If you defy this order, you <i>will</i> grow up again from a much younger age\" Elvira ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that will keep me as a gross girl\" Tina whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Tina\" Elvira said apologetically. \"I know this doesn't seem fair, but its the way it has be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second thing is you, Lucy. Enough is enough\" Elvira said, as she cast a spell. you watched in horror as you bedroom, your teen boy bedroom, quickly morphed into a pink, princess themed girlie room suitable for an eight year old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry i had to do this to you two girl. I wish there was another way, but the situation forced my hand. I'll leave you three alone\" Elvira said, before she vanished</span></div></div>",

While they were no different compared to what they were when she walked in, for Tina it felt like she had be completely changed. Robyn saw that Tina was on the verge of hyperventilating, so she tried to calm the panicked girl down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elvira didn't say you'd be 100% stuck like this like me or your cousin. What is your opinion, Lu?\" Robyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't hear her; you was too occupied inspecting your own changes. While the changes to your bed, and decor were obvious, you wanted to see what was in your wardrobe. Swiftly opening the wardrobe's door, you saw that it was filled with dresses, both for everyday use, and at least five different dress up costumes. From the clothes, it may as well had been Hannah's wardrobe, despite it lacking the pink leotard of a ballet loving brat. Your heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy!\" Robyn hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you demanded, finally hearing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need help with your cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you haven't noticed, I have problems too. Have you seen what is in my closet?! We could all play 'pretty princess' and still have a change! And once we're done with that, i'd still be in a dress. There's no sigh of pants anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina gave a half giggle, which infuriated you. \"This is all your fault, you little.... girl!\" you thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fault? You're the one that has always been a girl\" Tina replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and your stupid pride. All you had to do was kiss someone, but no, you couldn't even do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then turn me back and I'll kiss a girl right now\" Tina said angrily. From the look in her eyes, you knew her intended target was you. Robyn had backed away slightly; she didn't want to be kissed by Tim Towers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not like you could go and kiss something gross\" Tina loudly muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?

Her smirk vanished as she stared to make chicken noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Tina. We're not afraid of dolls, and you know it. From our point of view, its would be like you trying to be entertained by a young  girl toddler's toy\" you said to your cousin's chicken sounds. \"As for it being gross, we find dolls as gross as you would find Fella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina stopped her clucking. \"Fella isn't gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed\" Robyn said. closing her eyes, she said, \"I've been like this for a year, and even then I'm not comfortable with a lot of things for 'our' age. I can tolerate playing things like 'pretty princess' though I don't like it. i wouldn't expect either of you girls to do so either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not afraid of Lucy's favorite clothes\" Tina said defiantly, apparently taking Robyn's comments as a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. As for dolls, I can 'play' with them, but only by using my powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you do? Launch them? Melt them?\" Tina asked, causing you to smile slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget the dolls. I don't think any of us wants to know. This place needs a serious renovation, but first thing i want to do is to get out of this uniform\" you said. Tina nodded as well, much to your relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is my book?

Quickly scanning it, you found the page that you wanted. \"Here is a spell on clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes?\" Tina asked. You could tell she had become curious, thinking of the possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you try it?\" you coaxed, as curiosity overcame Tina's caution. She quickly read, then cast the spell.

Or....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better not\" you said, wincing as you looked at Mel. You felt frustrated; before your own transformation, you would had the mobility to tell Harry what had happened, even with the threat of magic powers hanging over your head. Now, you felt slightly helpless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Come on, bro. Whatever it is cannot be worse than whatever comes into my head\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, there is some aspects to your girlfriend that should be left alone.
