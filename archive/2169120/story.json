            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The category you choose will determine the types of cases you will find, the categories are still fairly vague so as long as it sticks to the main theme you can have any type of case you'd like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the categories to choose from:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Supernatural Mystery</font></b><br>\r\nMysteries in which the monsters are real, any type of supernatural or paranormal case is allowed as long as the characters remain on earth, space mystery is another category. <br>\r\nExamples: Martin Mysteries, Archie's Weird Mysteries<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Cosmic Mystery</font></b><br>\r\nSpace is a huge place and there are bound to be a load of awesome mysteries to solve. Much like space, this category is very vast as it can include all the other kinds of mysteries as long as it takes place on a planet other than earth.<br>\r\nExamples: Voltron - Legendary Defender<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Hoax Mystery</font></b><br>\r\nIf the villain is a shady real-estate developer in a costume it's a hoax mystery. These mysteries are generally less life-threatening as the others but can be just as scary. The level of 'realness' the monsters seem can be anything from a guy wearing a sheet to a guy commanding a highly advanced android.<br>\r\nExamples: Scooby Doo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Spy Mystery</font></b><br>\r\nWorking for a larger organisation to take down criminals is the way of Spy Mysteries. The villains generally aren't supernatural in any way but are just as dangerous. You'll have to be stealthy, cunning and quick to stop them from accomplishing their world ending goals.<br>\r\nExamples: Totally Spies<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Murder Mystery</font></b><br>\r\nNot so surprisingly, there aren't a lot of Cartoons depicting murder Mysteries. These mysteries always start with the death of someone and most of the time don't include anything supernatural, though that depends on the case. Though most of the time more gritty than the other categories not all of the cases need to be, Hoaxes can still exist in murder mysteries.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to a world of great mystery and paranormal activity, where danger could lurk in any corner and thrills at every turn. Jump in as a mystery solver, either going in solo or as part of a team, to solve the mysteries and crack the cases that plague the world. The cases can range from just petty crooks in costumes to aliens planning to invade earth, it all depends on the choices you make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story will focus more on mysteries you find in cartoon shows (Scooby Doo, Archie's Weird Mysteries, etc.) There will also be five categories of mysteries to choose from, that will determine the cases your character/s will receive. Play out the mystery and solve the case before moving on to the next one, evil never sleeps and neither will our characters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the rules! They're pretty much the same as my other interactives but read them anyway to refresh yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a 13+ story: I'm sure you can read up on the specifics of what that means but essentially make it appropriate for young teens and older to be reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe categories will define the type of mystery you'll find there but this isn't law, if you really like a character or set of characters in the Hoax category there's nothing stopping you from giving them a case with a real monster, as long as it only happens a few times (Afterall, sometimes in Scooby Doo the monsters are real)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice long chapters: No one likes one-liners, they waste chapters, there's no point asking people if they want the character to be called Fred or Mike, just pick the name you like and if someone doesn't like the name, they can always make a different storyline with their own characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllow multiple characters: When starting a story, make sure to leave an option for someone to create a different character, not everyone wants to play the same character as you do, and hey, with more characters being made you could even have them appear in another character's story as friends or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo Wild! As long as you stick to the 13+ get a crazy as you want with the stories, these are your stories and you can shape them in any way you want. You want your character to have a 50-foot one-eyed, one-horned flying purple people-eater as a pet? then go right ahead (Though maybe teach it to eat pork instead) I'm not going to delete chapters for being too crazy, as long as the other rules are followed you have free reign.</td>",
