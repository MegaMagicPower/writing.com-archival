            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was after the fall of the Red Flame Dragon.  The boss of level seventy had been a peeling burn for over an hour, with its own regenerative powers in the lava pits.  No lives had been lost, but it had cost a plethora of healing potions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito had not dealt the killing blow, so he volunteered to activate the next level\u2019s portal.  Joined by a few others, they ascended the pumice stone staircase that had fallen into one of the lava pools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they reached the top flight of stairs, Kirito fell behind the others while opening his inventory.  Upon realizing he had no more healing potions, he pulled out some food parcels to heal his health-even a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease \u2026 help.\u201d  Kirito looked around.  The group was already on the hilltop, out of calling distance; he snapped to a defensive position, looking for the distress call.  A bush rustled, and a maimed AI character crawled out onto the village path.  Kirito rushed over, and checked the man.  The man was fatally wounded, with a dropping health bar.  Kirito was surprised; most AI characters were Immortal, unable to die.  \u201cMy daughter!  She is trapped out in the swamp.  If you are willing, take this.  Aid her!\u201d  A blue gemmed pendant dropped out of a clenched fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito picked it up, and accepted the challenge, \u201cI will help her.  Hold on.\u201d  Kirito tried to feed some jerky to the man.  The man nibbled, and the bar stalled.  \u201cWhere is she?  How do I help her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man groaned, \u201cThe Malady Swamp is to the east.  The sunken boulders will point you towards her.  The pendant will help her.\u201d  A sigh escaped his lips as the health meter finally emptied.  The man burst into a pile of blue data shards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito zoned out, until a notification pinged on his screen.  It read, \u2018New objective added.  New Item added: Goul Syrup Pendant.\u2019  Kirito shook himself out of his daze.  He slipped it onto his neck as he started to jog towards the eastern marsh swamps, determined to save the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito found the Malady Swamp easily.  He followed the sunken boulders with a little difficulty.  The early afternoon sun shone on his back as he followed his shadow deeper into the swamp.  Looking at the ruined bog in front of him, Kirito realized he had no idea what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bog was covered in a layer of algae, hiding the open water and the mud holes from the safe rock trails.  Torches illuminated the area, indicating an enemy intelligence inhabited the bog.  An island of flowers blossomed in the distant center.  A body lay still, possibly sleeping at the crown of the island.  Looming over the petite body was a massive carnivorous plant.  It looked like a Venus Fly Trap, with a bluish hue on the outer hinged parts, and a stem of watermelon red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWary of alerting enemy monsters, Kirito called out, \u201cHey there?  Are you awake?  I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite body stirred; a child in a torn dress with lots of grass stains stood.  Seeing Kirito, she sank low and tried to crawl down the hill.  A frenzied rustling of fabric and flora reached Kirito\u2019s sensitive ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudden bursts of flowers and vines covered the island.  When the petals settled, the girl was bound in vines.  Kirito tried to start across the swamp, but a tiny high voice amplified across the swamp, \u201cStop, you\u2019ll sink!\u201d  Kirito looked closer; the girl was holding a pure white flower to her lips.  \u201cFind a white vocal flower.  It will help you talk to me without waking the ghouls or vine plants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the AI\u2019s instruction, Kirito scoured the bog\u2019s boundary for such a flower.  Pulling a small, white flower, Kirito whispered, \u201cIs this the flower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  The roots of these flowers are hollow and wiry with a long stretching stem.  It allows for vocal messages, provided they\u2019re in the ground to allow vibrations.  How did you find me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father sent me to find you.\u201d  Kirito was not sure if the cyber girl was aware of the loss of her father.  If not, she did not need to kill herself with frantic struggles.  \u201cI want to help you.  If I could cross the swamp, I would cut you loose from the vines and carry you out.  Can you tell me if there is anybody around here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl spoke into the flower in hushed tones, \u201cThe ghouls roam more towards sunset.  If you add me to your party list, I can help navigate you to this island.  Do you trust me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn invite appeared in front of Kirito.  Skimming the generic script of the message window, he accepted the invite from Amelia Grace.  Amelia\u2019s health bar popped down under Kirito\u2019s; the girl\u2019s life was not dropping, but it was much larger than Kirito expected for an AI child character.  Holding the white flower up to his mouth, he asked, \u201cI trust that you know what you are doing.  Now, how do I get to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia responded, \u201cYou can\u2019t get to me, but I have a plan.  Did my father give you a pendant?  If you don\u2019t have it, you can\u2019t help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito responded, \u201cYes, I\u2019m wearing it.  But how can you do anything when you\u2019re tied up?  How does this pendant help me help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia\u2019s hands wiggled through her vine bonds and reached to her neck.  She pulled out a flower like the ones around his feet.  \u201cKeep wearing the pendant and stand very still,\u201d Amelia breathed steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito observed a small thin item slip out of her sleeve and into the new flower.  Suddenly, a stabbing sensation blossomed in Kirito\u2019s neck.  He dropped to his knees and the screen darkened.  Just as suddenly, the screen brightened to normal levels.  Kirito checked his screen.  Everything looked normal, but Amelia Grace\u2019s health bar showed her as paralyzed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kirito tried to call out to her, there was no audio signal.  His hands rose up, and clenched and flexed by themselves.  His arm rose to his neck and pulled out a needle-thin blade from the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can relax for the moment, Mr. Kirito.\u201d  It was Kirito\u2019s own voice, but he had not said anything.  \u201cIf you want to talk, call up the message box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito typed, \u2018What did you do?\u2019 He tried to move his arms and legs, but the program seemed to deny his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Amelia.  I used my pendant to hack your character.  This needle is laced with doping nectar, producing body manipulation.  I can control you to rescue me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito typed furiously, \u2018I could have come to you, while you spoke directions into the flower.  You don\u2019t have to steal my body.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia spoke again in Kirito\u2019s voice, \u201cThat won\u2019t work.  Vocal flowers don\u2019t work in water, and there are too many dangers in this swamp for swift responses.  Relax, the possession process leaves no physical harm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito fumed.  He typed, \u2018You could ask first.\u2019 Lazily, Kirito\u2019s arm pulled up the menu, and flipped through the inventory lists.  Amelia changed his combat boots out for some simple sneakers and put away his Midnight Cloak. \u2018Now what are you doing?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia explained, \u201cI can control your inventory.  Right now, I am accessorizing to make you light enough for the swamp; the alga drags anything that touches it underwater.  Hey\u2014why do you have two swords?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito banged out a harsh response, \u2018THAT\u2019S NONE OF YOUR BEESWAX!  NOW GET THIS OVER WITH!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.  Watch and learn, human player.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia stood up and stretched Kirito\u2019s legs, and paused for effect.  She launched Kirito to the first boulder.  Surprisingly, Kirito observed his body had a new grace and fluidity as Amelia piloted his body through a complex maze of sunken islands and marshy passages.  No monsters appeared, but the setting sun put some pep into her step.  Finally, Kirito\u2019s body was just short of the center island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now for the monster slaying part,\u201d Amelia whispered as she opened the weapon\u2019s inventory.  \u201cI would have liked more throwing knives, but this will do, to get in close enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito scowled in his void.  \u2018Excuse me, but I just finished a boss fight.  No time to resupply before I got swept into this rescue quest.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia equipped the white sword and a fistful of throwing spikes.  She squatted down in Kirito\u2019s body and dipped the spikes in the algae.  The spikes suddenly took on a new poison ability.  She noted, \u201cThe algae does have a toxic reaction to metal.  Another reason to be light on your feet here.  Now, I will either pin down or poison the vines, and then cut my body loose.  Hopefully, I won\u2019t have to cut the plant down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Whoa, why not?  This thing could kill you and me!\u2019 Kirito typed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia whispered, \u201cThe plant produces the alga that contains the ghouls to just the Malady Swamp.  Otherwise, the whole level would be overrun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito acknowledged, \u2018Ok, level apocalypse would be nice to avoid.  Keep it up, and let\u2019s get out of this bog.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia armed and launched four shots.  She marched onto the island and up to her own unconscious body.  The blue Fly Trap was paralyzed, the tentacles flipping all over the island.  Kirito\u2019s sword arm swung the white blade; Amelia\u2019s body slumped into the flowers.  Sheathing the sword, Kirito\u2019s body lifted the unconscious Amelia and slipped down the slope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito watched in awe as Amelia danced across the swamp with two bodies to balance.  He even wondered if his own player skill could pull off such a feat.  When Amelia reached the bog\u2019s edge, Kirito suddenly felt a heavy weight on his shoulders.  He was back in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia\u2019s petite body started heaving breaths.  She wheezed, \u201cYour turn, Kirito.  Go out the way you came in.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kirito flipped open his inventory.  Other than the upgraded poison spikes, everything was as he had left it.  Changing the sneakers back for combat boots, he hoisted Amelia back onto his upper back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started onto the trail of boulders leading out of the swamp.  Amelia Grace wrapped her arms around his neck and he carried her piggy back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunset cast their shadows behind them and that was quite convenient.  It allowed for Kirito to see the four ghouls patrolling Malady Swamp\u2019s only exit before they noticed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito squatted down and asked Amelia, \u201cDo you think you can stay here while I beat those ghouls away?  I can\u2019t fight them and protect you at the same time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t.  Protect me, and I\u2019ll fight them.\u201d  Amelia pushed herself free of Kirito and looked at the ghouls.  A small needle blade appeared from her sleeve and she threw it through the air.  When the needle pierced one of the ghoul\u2019s neck, Amelia crumpled, falling towards the swamp algae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito grabbed her.  Pulling her towards relative safety, he looked over his shoulder towards the patrol.  One of the ghouls put a thumbs-up into the air.  Kirito looked down at Amelia; her body was unconscious and paralyzed.  He looked up again just as Amelia the ghoul struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other ghouls never stood a chance; their programming prevented them from attacking one of their own.  Ordinarily slow and ignorant, Amelia the ghoul was swift and calculating.  She tore the arms off the first monster.  Using one dismembered arm as a baseball bat, Amelia attacked the head of the second ghoul.  The two broken ghoul bodies burst into blue shards, and the missing body parts burst into blue fireworks.  She grabbed the third enemy ghoul and spun the creature to face her.  When the creature fell away, Kirito noticed a cavity in the chest just before it disintegrated into data shards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia the ghoul waved him over.  Picking up Amelia\u2019s unconscious human body, Kirito closed the distance from their hiding spot to where the entrance to the swamp was.  The only obstacle left was Amelia\u2019s ghoul body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came in striking distance, Amelia raised her arms in surrender.  Amelia growled at Kirito, and moved a finger in a slashing motion across her ghoulish throat.  Kirito asked, \u201cWhat, you want me to attack you?\u201d  The ghoul nodded, and made a self-stabbing gesture to the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito pulled out his white sword and held it out.  He wasn\u2019t sure how this would work.  Amelia the ghoul just rushed him and impaled her false body.  As the ghoul disintegrated, Amelia\u2019s body woke up and watched the fallen monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia wheezed, \u201cDon\u2019t dawdle.  Let\u2019s get out of here before more generate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito exclaimed, \u201cHold on!  Are you ok?  My sword just stabbed the body you inhabited, but you just sound exhausted, not wounded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia heaved a sigh and answered, \u201cYes, there is just exhaustion from the possession process.  If a body suffers fatal damage, my spirit returns to my body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito nodded, and started to carry Amelia out of the swamp.  Crossing the boundary lines, he was struck by a horrifying thought.  \u201cWait one minute, girl.  That means if you had failed in the bog crossing to the island, I would have drowned, and you would revert to your body!  Of all the lowlife dirty\u2014\u201d  Kirito screamed at Amelia and dropped her to the safe dirt path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia Grace landed hard on the path.  She exclaimed, \u201cOw!  Alright, you could have died, but I have roamed that swamp all my life.  If you want, I can reward you for your extra troubles.  You did accept my father\u2019s quest after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito glared at the little girl.  He knelt down, and answered, \u201cOk, fine.  I\u2019ll accept your reward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia Grace pointed at the pendant hanging from Kirito\u2019s neck.  \u201cFirst, I need my pendant back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito activated the inventory sale menu, and pushed the \u2018Goul Syrup Pendant\u2019 into the sale column.  In Amelia Grace\u2019s side of the menu, three lines of stars appeared.  Curious, Kirito accepted the sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia grasped the pendant in her hands.  \u201cThank you, Sir Kirito.\u201d  She leaned in and kissed him on the cheek.  \u201cI have to get home now; Daddy should be cooking dinner.  Bye!\u201d  In a blur of flowers, she was gone, a shrinking speck heading to the false safety of her home\u2014with her father gone since the quest started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito started to go after her, but a notification flashed in his face.  The announcement box read, \u2018Quest Complete!  +XP 10,000  +Gold 500  New skill Received!\u2019  Intrigued, he read the new skill.<br>\r\n&amp;*&amp;<br>\r\nPossessive Lunge<br>\r\n\u2022\tCan only be used in dungeons or city limits<br>\r\n\u2022\tWhen activated, USER becomes paralyzed and Immortal Object.

Just carry me, and I\u2019ll take a breather.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito flipped open his inventory.  All his supplies were there, including the improved poison spikes.  Taking a second, he dipped several mason jars into the algae, collecting samples for Asuna, Kline, and Lisbeth.  If there was a way to blend the algae to other metals to create poison weapons, he wanted to pioneer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito rearmed his black sword and combat boots before throwing Amelia\u2019s body over his shoulder.  With a running leap, he hopped back down the boulder trail to the edge of the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia had recovered her full movement ability in about 5 minutes.  They reached a sandy arena, an off-branch that Kirito had missed on his way into the swamp.  Kirito let Amelia down, and they stretched for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, ghouls appeared on the far edge of the arena clearing.  There were fourteen ghouls coming towards them from the far side.  Kirito swung to the entrance, and almost bit his tongue.  Six more had risen from the swamp and blocked the boulder trail out of the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito quickly armed his two swords.  \u201cI really don\u2019t want to fight these creeps; I\u2019ll advance on one group, and the other side will rush and kill you and overwhelm me.  Tell me, can you stick close while I fight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia Grace glared, \u201cUh-uh!  I have a better plan.  Just defend me, and I will resolve this.  Can I trust you?\u201d  Before Kirito responded in either agreement or disagreement, Amelia threw a needle out towards the ghouls.  Amelia dropped to the sandy ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito dropped to a knee so he could check Amelia\u2019s symptoms.  Her body registered as paralyzed, and she was unresponsive to his touch.  Before he could check her body further, a moaning roar caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mob of ghouls was rushing towards him.  He braced himself; there would be no repeat of the \u2018Moonlit Black Cats guild disaster\u2019.  He lopped off the arms of the first ghoul to reach him, and stabbed another monster through on each blade.  Pulling his blades free, he counted his frontal enemies at nine monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what?  Kirito double-checked his mental math.  Fourteen with three stabbed was eleven, not eight.  Wait\u2014 only eight now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw the solution.  He witnessed a ghoul suddenly swipe its claws out against the rest of the frontal assault group.  The group turned towards their fallen comrade, but only saw another ghoul.  Their programming prevented them from tagging one of their own as a traitor; it never occurred before.  With Amelia Grace\u2019s possession power, she could turn the enemy into a puppet assassin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito watched in fascination.  The ghoul rebel, possessed by Amelia, pointed behind Kirito in jerky movements.  Spinning around, Kirito realized he had his own fight to worry about.  The six ghouls guarding the exit had joined the fray, just as he had feared.  He launched himself into their midst.  Before they could figure out what to do, four were bursting into sprays of blue shards, with a fifth covered in red slash marks; Kirito had stabbed two blades into the skull of the last ghoul monster.  As the last two baddies disintegrated into data shards, Kirito turned to check on Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia was fighting two ghouls, forcing them to turn about in circles.  The third and last monster was almost on top of her unconscious body, aiming its slobbering maw for her face.  Amelia was unable to see this development, with her back turned, and her clawing hands otherwise occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito was too far away for his sword moves.  Struggling with his throwing knives satchel, he watched Amelia\u2019s body in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maw of the ghoul reached down.  The jaw closed on Amelia\u2019s neck.  There was a blinding flash and the ghoul was still hunched over her body.  An icon flashed above her unconscious body: Immortal Object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the ghoul could try again, a poisonous stake was jutting out of its slobbering mouth.  It stood, jerking its limbs as Kirito marched over and decapitated it.  In a second swing, he brought the sword down on Amelia to the same result: a flash of light and the Immortal Object icon.  He marched over to the ghoul possessed by Amelia and jabbed it through the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw, Kirito.  What\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito whirled on Amelia, leaving the ghoul body to disappear.  He yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re Immortal?  When were you going to tell me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia flinched, but her body was still paralyzed.  She whimpered, \u201cOnly during the possession period.  Some smart monsters realized they could still pick me up, even when I am Immortal.  After I release the body, or the host body is killed, I return, lose the invincibility, and stay paralyzed for a while.  That window allows monsters to kill me.\u201d  Some digital tears had rolled down.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to tell you.  That\u2019s how I got so deep in the swamp.  Now, I\u2019m tired; I\u2019m thirsty and hungry; I wanna see my daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito felt bad for blowing up at a child AI character.  He lowered himself and patted Amelia\u2019s cheek.  He apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled.  I thought I\u2019d lost you.  C\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you home.\u201d  He lifted her petite body into his arms.  \u201cOne more question: Where is your home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had cleared Malady Swamp\u2019s borders, Kirito set her down feet-first.  On the dirt trail through the woods, the two simply talked about the woods, Kirito\u2019s feats, and Amelia\u2019s misadventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the cabin, Amelia stepped onto the log porch and turned to face Kirito.  Smiling, she said, \u201cThank you for escorting me home.  Also thanks for being honest about my daddy, Sir Kirito.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito nodded, \u201cHappy to help.  Listen, do you want me to come and visit?  I think my friends would like to meet someone like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m mostly a loner.  I don\u2019t do well with anybody, but my dad.\u201d  She stopped and sniffled.  Looking up, something caught her eye.  \u201cHey, Kirito, can I have one last thing?  That necklace is special, and I would like it to remember my daddy \u2026 and you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito nodded, and took the necklace off his neck.  He handed it to Amelia Grace, who clasped it to her chest.  She leaned in, and kissed Kirito\u2019s cheek.  Waving good-bye, she slipped inside the log cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito turned away from the cabin.  He was about to start back into Village Seventy-One when an Award Notification appeared.  It read, \u2018Quest Complete!  +XP 10,000.  +Gold 500.  New Skill Received!

And, as part of its original programming, in-game events occur weekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of these, S-Class Madness, catches the eye of Asuna, who begins hunting down as many rare creatures as she possibly can and creating divine dishes with them. However, she doesn't realise the effect the rare ingredients begin to have on her waistline...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">The Cornucopia of Plenty</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a reward for a rather simple quest, Asuna receives an odd horn with the ability to create food from nothing. Intrigued, she tries a bit only to find that she has trouble eating anything not created by the horn. And even then, she just can't get enough of its delicious treats...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \"Attention, players. This is an update on this week's in-game event...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna, who had been in the middle of shopping, paused. While she never really cared for the events the game chose for them, occasionally she would take part in them. But only if it benefited her in some way, like extra gold drops or EXP gains. Not if her only reward was satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This week, the spawn rate of all rare S-Class creatures has been increased exponentially. Additionally, all rare drops from a S-Class creature have a higher rate of dropping\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna's eyes went wide. The chances of a S-Class creature spawning normally were incredibly low, and for good reason. For those that enjoyed cooking, they dropped the best ingredients that gave the best XP gains. In her whole time cooking, she had only ever cooked one and it had been the best meal she had had since being imprisoned here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up the in-game menu, Asuna quickly equipped her combat gear. Her yellow sweater and brown skirt faded away in a bright light, revealing a pristine white outfit with red crosses patterned over it. Making sure her rapier was at her side, she headed for the teleport gate, ready for a full day of non-stop hunting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hiyah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny rabbit before her let out a squeal as her rapier, glowing with a blue light, cut into its neck. It twitched briefly before exploding into blue particles. In its place, a slab of red meat and a light brown hide appeared. Stooping down, Asuna pulled them into her inventory before straightening up and signing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've been at this for hours...\" She mumbled under her breath. \"I think I've got a half-decent haul. Let's have a look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her inventory, Asuna whistled. Sitting in her inventory were ten whole hunks of Rag-Out Rabbit, the S-Class creature for the floor she was on. Aside from that, she had a few hides, which could be applied to leather armour to significantly improve its defence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Think that should do me for now!\" She said happily, pulling a Teleport Crystal out of her pocket. Before she teleported, her eyes flitted up to her health bar. Hers was full, however below it was one with a little missing from it. As she watched, a good chunk of it vanished, only to be replaced a moment later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Should I invite him?</i> Asuna wondered. <i>Nah, not this time. This time, I did all the work, therefore I get all the rewards!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that decided, Asuna held her Crystal up and teleported back to her home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging into her cooking attire, which was an apron over a t-shirt an pair of shorts, Asuna dropped the days haul onto the counter before her. Ten shining hunks of delicious, juicy meat... She had so many plans for what she could do with these!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, each one had been chopped up and assigned to a different dish. She was easily cooking enough to feed her for a week, maybe even two, but that didn't bother her. If she really wanted, she could eat it all today with no consequences. After all, in VR, you never got full and you never put on weight. It was part of the reason Asuna had decided to take up the cooking skill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed quickly for her as she cooked. Eventually, however, her table was laden down with various steaming dishes. Meat drizzled with juice, a pot of stew, strips of grilled meat... She had really gone all out this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat at the table, Asuna inhaled deeply. Even the mere scent of the meat was enough to make her stomach grumble! Pulling the stew towards her, Asuna began to eat her feast, unaware of the reason why S-Class ingredients were so rare...</span></div></div>",

In the game it was very clear that as nice as the food was, it was never as real or as tasty as real world meals could be. But this was different. It was like her taste buds had high definition or something. And as she swallowed, she felt the warm sensation slide into her stomach. It felt amazing! She took a much larger bite this time. Everyone in sao had became used to the constant feeling of hunger they would have throughout their time. Asuna had forgotten how starving she actually was. She scarfed down the rest of her plate like an animal. It was gone too fast, she grabbed another meal she'd prepared. She tried to savour it but she couldn't help herself, that was gone even faster than the last one. She continued to chow through more of her various meals with this pace. She was aware of her slightly rounding belly. But even that felt great, being able to gain weight like before. She refused to let that slow her down though, and removed her armour to change into a sports bra and workout shorts. She was aware this was becoming unhealthy, but chose to ignore it. By this point she had developed a small tight pot belly. But it didn't remain that size for long. Asuna reached out for her next plate but- there were no more. She had devoured every single meal! Her stomach then let out a very unhappy gurgle. It was at this point she looked down and realised how big it had inflated. She had sprouted a firm taught and large pot belly. She almost looked pregant! She couldn't believe it, nobody gained weight naturally in sao! Curiously she placed her hands on her tummy, this jostling forced a loud *uoorrrp* from her lips. She blushed furiously, people didn't pass gas in the game either. Her belly gurgled as it shifted and released more gas *URP* \"oh god...\" she moaned. Her stomach hurt, she couldn't remember feeling so full. But she was also curious as to how this was brought about. She went to lay down on her sofa to think. This movement was too much for her belly to handle *UUOORRP* \"ecu-\" *URP* \"excuse-\" *BURRRR* \"excuse me!!!\". Her belly gurgled, the expulsion of gas had left room for more. \"You want more?!\" *URRRP* \"I can't get more S meat in this state!\" She lay there all round and full feeling sorry for herself. The hunger she had adapted to feeling so well was suddenly unbearable. She thought about her options</span></div></div>",

She'd skimmed it and came to the conclusion of free food and was content with that. She'd never read about the cursed though. After 10 uses the cornucopia would stop making food when she asked, and instead when it wanted to. And she would be swept over by hunger and unable to eat anything else until she finished it. At first it would just give her a few fruits, or a sandwich. Then it became treats full of dairy. The game was so in depth it knew about Asuna's lactose intolerance. She was not enjoying the gas. Then it became larger treats. She would be forced to devour whole cakes and macaroons in public. And it was starting to show. The gassiness and growing food baby were so embarrassing she began to stop taking quests. She currently was making her way though a three tier cake, loudly burping at regular intervals.

She was rather... insistent on that. Something about a heavy sword with a black blade?\" Asuna recalled. \"He thinks that it might be his sword from SAO, so he was off like a shot\".<br>\r\nYui forced a smile. She had hoped that Kirito and Asuna would've been present to see her enact her plan, but it was off little consequence.

What is it?\"<br>\r\nYui took a deep breath before continuing. <br>\r\n\"I think you're forgetting about me!\" She said angrily, clenching her hands. \"You never take me out on quests anymore, even though I'm an immortal object!\"<br>\r\nAsuna's mouth hung open slightly as her adopted daughter continued to shout at her. <br>\r\n\"It's so lonely here! The 22nd floor is practically empty! There's only woods around this place, and the town is on the other side of the floor. Not that it matters much, I'm not allowed to leave anyway!\"<br>\r\nYui's voice had risen to a shout by now as she continued. <br>\r\n\"Being stuck here gave me loads of time to dig through Alfheim's code, or what I can access. I found unimplented code from the last update that I worked on while I was stuck here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui stopped briefly, breathing heavily. Asuna said nothing, surprised by her daughter's sudden outburst. <br>\r\n\"Well, it'll be difficult to forget me now!\"<br>\r\nYui pulled up a console and tapped a couple of keys. The console gave an affirmative beep before disappearing. After a couple of seconds, Hui began to glow, which finally prompted action from Asuna. <br>\r\n\"Yui? What's happening to you?!\"<br>\r\nYui smiled at her mother. <br>\r\n\"Now, we'll be together for a while\".<br>\r\nYui's small body began to break into the glowing particles that were present upon death in SAO. <br>\r\n\"Yui!\"<br>\r\nAsuna sprinted for her disappearing daughter, but was too slow. Yui's head broke into particles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Asuna screamed, grabbing for the particles, which, strangely, floated around her. Looking desperately at the particles, Asuna yelped as they all flew at her. They flew low to the ground before flying up her skirt. Asuna moaned as she felt them enter her body. As the last particle disappeared into her body, Asuna groaned. She felt really heavy now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1:<br>\r\nAsuna's pregnancy progresses like a real-life pregnancy.

Her white dress, meant for her slim form, immediately tightened. Asuna groaned again as her slim stomach continued pushing forth, tightening her dress immensely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" She asked, unable to act as her belly quickly grew to the size of a beach ball before stopping. Her dress had ripped, revealing the taut globe to the world. As she ran her hands over her new belly, the rest of her slim form grew to match her large belly. Her breasts, reasonably sized for her age, ballooned, filling with milk which sloshed around as Asuna fought with her tightening bra. She managed to open the clasp, revealing the swelling orbs. The top part of her dress clung to her breasts, showing off her erect nipples which dripped milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna's lower body plumped up, her reasonable ass putting on weight. Her thighs and hips followed suit, her thighs growing to resemble small tree trunks and her hips growing to child-bearing proportions. Her ass grew to the size of football's before stopping its growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Asuna's avatar stopped its growth. She groaned as she stood up and felt how heavy she now was. Her milk-laden breasts, supported by her dress, lay atop the globe that was her belly.

She recoiled as she felt a kick answer her. <br>\r\nShe didn't even bother saying it. Yui had made her pregnant, all because she didn't pay enough attention to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Asuna could do anything, a bing sounded. An exclamation mark appeared, indicating a new quest. Pulling up her quest list, Asuna found a new quest with no name. <br>\r\n\"A nameless quest, huh...\" Her eyes scanned the description, picking out key words as she did. <br>\r\n\"So, I'm pregnant, and the only way to get Yui back is to complete this quest?\" Asuna sighed, one hand on her gravid belly. \"I suppose I've got no choice.

Her throat was tight and hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he slid all the way down into Asuna's churning stomach. Asuna had a large bulge in her belly.

Not wanting to be rude, the shop keeper just smiled and Asuna headed towards Liz's shop, unaware that the blue spot on her neck was spreading. Once she got there she made her way to where Liz always is, forging weapons to improve her skill. Liz immediately recognized Asuna and greeted her cheerfully. \"Whats up Asuna? What brings you to my shop?\" Liz asked. Asuna walked up to her friend with the gift behind her, with the biggest smile on her face. But once she got into the light, Liz saw that Asuna's neck, face and even parts of her hair had become blue. \"Uh...Asuna?\" Liz said with concern, \"Why are you...blue?\" Asuna stopped dead in her tracks and looked at her in confusion, \"What? What are you...talking...\" She slowly realized as she looked at her hand, which was on the verge of completely turning blue. She dropped the box she was holding and looked at herself in fear, \"Wh whats happening to me?\" Liz could only watch in fear as her best friend slowly turned blue.</span></div></div>",

Asuna could feel her belly expanding and pushing against her clothes, before long, her skirt began riding up revealing her ever expanding blue gut. She then felt her breasts and butt join as they expanded along with her belly, she could feel her armor getting tighter on her expanding form. Liz slowly backed away step by step, she looked in horror as Asuna grew bigger and rounder. Asuna kept expanding with out end, until her armor and clothes ripped off revealing her bra and panties, allowing her to expanded at a faster rate. She soon felt her arms and legs get bigger, making them wider to the point of them sticking straight out, becoming unusable. Liz noticed that Asuna was starting to become more round, she even noticed a faint sloshing coming from Asuna's stomach, she stepped closer and put her ear to her friend's stomach and her suppositions her confirmed, she was filling was juice. \"Hey, Asuna! I think I know whats happening to you.\" \"Really? What?\" \"Did you get stung by anything today\" \"Yeah, why\" \"I think you were stung by a black berry bee, you're turning into a berry\" \"What?!\" Just as she found out what happened to her, her cheeks blow up into her face, causing her to lose the ability to speak, and her arms and legs sunk into her still expanding body. When she reached 25 feet in Diameter and her breasts reached 5 feet in Diameter, Asuna finally stopped, but she had a new problem, two.</span></div></div>",

Asuna let out a moan of pleasure as blushed a deep purple, her breasts were leaking juice, and she was, surprisingly enjoying it. The juice kept flowing until the juice seeped out and flowed onto the floor, where Liz was about to inspect it.

The bee quietly flew up to Liz, it then let out a sweet smell that caused Liz to get...interesting thoughts. \"Asuna...why do you suddenly look so...good?\" The bee then quickly stung Asuna in her gut, it slowly died but managed to put all the venom it had in to the one sting. Asuna immediately felt the effects and swelled up even more. Her cheeks swelled up more, nearly blocking her vision, her hands and feet sunk into her body and her breasts filled with even more juice. While all this was happening, Liz just watched in delight has Asuna swelled more and more, though, she felt something was wrong. As soon as the thought came to her head, Asuna's bra and panties ripped off, not being able to hold for much longer.

Asuna soon had the same problem, as did Liz, their top shirt buttons had popped off revealing their growing breast being held back by their bras, which were looking a bit strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna then turned her attention to Silica, who was growing in another area, Silica took one hand off her belly and placed it on her now growing butt, which was causing the back of her skirt to ride up revealing for panties, while her still growing belly slide the front down.

Their skirts then ripped in two when they couldn't handle both their bellies and butts, their jackets had ripped off when their arms had thickened, and their stockings were on the verge of being ripped apart. Liz spoke up saying \"This has to stop eventually, right\" \"I think the gum was meant to used one at a time, not all 5 at once...I think we still have a ways to go\" Asuna mentioned, looking back at what has become of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir backs began to round out, and their torsos began to grow at a rapid pace, their arms and legs sank into their bodies, and their breasts grow at a slimier rate, sticking out of their rounding bodies.

The girls turned their attention to a moaning Sugu, she was moaning louder by the minute and her breasts were growing faster then the rest of the girls, and with in a split second her bra snapped off and breast started to leak a blue liquid. Asuna looked at Sugu's face, she was blushing a deep purple and she was in the middle of enjoying it and wanting it to stop, Asuna looked at Liz who looked at her own breasts, \"Heh, well, at least there's something we can \"enjoy\" about thi-\" before she could finish, she felt a rush of liquid going straight to her breasts, she blushed a deep purple before her bra snapped off as her breasts has a sudden growth spurt, she let off a moan of pleasure as her breasts started leaking with the same blue liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna was now both scared and slightly excited for what will eventually happen, she waited for the inevitable, while Silica sat there watching 2 of her closest friends moaning as their breasts leaked a blue liquid.

She soon realized she was actually getting smaller, the liquid was quickly escaping through her...vagina, and she was returning to her old size. After about 10 minutes, Silica mostly returned to her old size say for her sightly big butt, leaving her in her bra and panties, she was relieved but she noticed that the other girls were still growing. She didn't know what to do, so she tried to think of something. She looked down and saw the blue stain on her panties, she was embarrassed but she immediately got an idea.

Asuna was conflicted on the feeling, on one hand she is feeling more pleasure then she ever have, on the other hand, she was technically being violated...by her own friend. After a good 5 minutes, Asuna let out the loudest moan she had ever produced, releasing all the liquid in her, Silica made sure to move but her arm got hit by the tsunami of fluid. She saw the liquid was a bit thick but had a very nice aroma, she reluctantly gave it a taste and was surprised by what she tasted. \"Blueberries\" the info immediately snapped, her and her friends had become blueberries. She turned to see how Asuna was doing, she was very close to finished, she had returned to her original size, say for her belly which was sticking half a foot out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilica helped Asuna up and made sure she was okay, \"How are you feeling Asuna?\" \"Ugh, I feel so bloated, but at least I can move again.\" Silica explained to her how to return the other 2 to normal, Asuna was confused at first, but understood what she need to do, Asuna took care of Suguha while Silica took care of Liz. Liz ended up with thick thighs and Sugu (obviously) ended up with larger breasts, the only problem they had left was that all 4 of them were still blue, and they didn't know if it would happen again. Not to mention, their clothes have seen better days, Asuna grabbed her phone and texted Kirito, telling him to pick her and the others up, and bring some towels. She also said to wait at the end of the path with his eyes closed, he respected her wishes and brought the towels and the extra cart for the others, she told him to drop Liz, Silica and herself off at their homes, when he dropped Liz and Silica off he made sure to close his eyes knowing full well they'd probably slap him if he peeked. Asuna was the last one to drop off, she gave him a kiss and said the next time he sees her, he'd be surprised, Kirito and Sugu made it home Sugu ran to the bathroom and jumped in the shower in the hopes that the blue would wash off, and possibly to get the excess juice out of her breasts.</span></div></div>",

Let's just grab some of this...\"<br>\r\nReaching up, Leafa reached into the beehive, and was promptly accosted by a number of large bees. <br>\r\n\"Of course there's bees!\" Leafa whined, drawing her sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief fight, Leafa sheathed her sword. <br>\r\n\"Now then... Honey!\"<br>\r\nShe reached into the beehive and pulled out a glowing orb. As she watched, it morphed into a jar of honey with the letters, B.E.H, stamped across it. <br>\r\n\"I suppose a little taste wouldn't go amiss...\"<br>\r\nTaking the lid off, Leafa dipped her finger in. Licking the honey off, she squealed. <br>\r\n\"Oh my God! It's so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting about the quest, Leafa proceeded to stuff the entire jar of honey onto her mouth, moaning as she swallowed the sweet substance. <br>\r\nHowever, as Leafa continued to gorge herself, she failed to notice her green bodice growing tighter around her large breasts. Already the size of melons, they grew rounder and larger. If she had read the description of the honey, she would be found that, instead of going to the stomach, the honey flowed to someone's breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leafa finished a second jar, she let out a delighted moan. <br>\r\n\"This is so good! I need to tell Kazuto about this!\"<br>\r\nGrabbing a third jar, Leafa was still oblivious to her honey filled breasts, which jiggled as she tore the lid off the jar. Digging her fingers into the jar, honey dripped onto her now massive breasts, each one slightly larger than her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing a third jar, Leafa...</span></div></div>",

Asuna had suggested she take a break, it was true that she needed some personal space, so she agreed. The people could find another blacksmith for a while. Even if none would be as good as her. So she decided to go all out, stocked her home with her favourite snacks and got a good book. The whole shebang. And with that, making sure everything was set up. She began her staycation with a large bite into an even larger steak. It was good! She hummed with pleasure as she went for another bite. Chewing this one faster than before. Soon enough the whole steak was gone. She then cracked a beer and got another steak out of her inventory. She was usually a light eater but the taste was too good to resist. She chewed ferociously on the meat and then decided to wash it down with her beverage. She lifted the bottle up to her lips and tipped her head back enthusiastically making loud gulping noises. After a 3rd of the bottle was in her stomach she pulled back for air before proceeding to finish the rest of her meal. She continued in her cycle of eating and chugging, changing the meats to sugary treats and replacing her beers. She was beginning to feel her stomach expand, unused to this amount of food. \"Fuck it\". She muttered to herself. \"I'm allowed a treat.\" She kept going and going until she realised with horror she had depleted most of her food stock that was meant to last her 4 days. Only a single cake remained in her inventory. The one she had been saving. Curiously she poked her now swollen tummy. It was tight like a beach ball. On the one hand she was concerned, on the other she was interested in how much more she could complete. She removed the party sized cake from her inventory, and hesitantly dug her fork into it without bothering to cut slices. She lifted it up to her mouth... It was amazing! Her swolleness was forgotten once more and she quickly devoured the entire thing! Only stopping to remove her dress as it had become less clothing and more of a restraint. It was a struggle even getting it over her belly. But now she was free and was licking the remaining icing off her fingers greedily. It was then she felt her now bare tummy bubble. She'd never eaten so much before! It ached so bad she had to lay down on the floor. Her swollen belly now sagging on it too in front of her. She rubbed it with her left hand, which pushed a monstrous *BURRRRP* from her esophagus. Her stomach bubbled again now, but more furiously. It had finally discovered a way to release all this gas and was perfectly happy to use it. Pushing up belch after belch getting deeper and larger. Lisbeth was sure if it didn't stop soon she'd not be able to breathe in time. But it did right as she was starting to see dark spots around her eyes and she lay there thankfully taking deep breaths. She wasn't sure how she felt about this gluttonous act of hers. But the belches did feel good.</span></div></div>",

She asked Asuna to watch the shop for a little bit while she went out to get the rare material she heard about, Asuna accepted seeing how she had nothing else to do, Kirito was out doing his own thing and her guild didn't give her any missions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz made her way to the floor the material was on, armed and ready just in case, she heard it was mostly peaceful but she still wanted to be ready in case anything tries to stop her. Little did she know, the material had attracted more unwanted attention then she wanted, a group of red players wanted the rare material for money, they had a way to deal with anyone who stands in their way, darts with an experimental serum, they didn't know what it did but they knew it would cause the target to be instantly affected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Liz and the red players were close to their destination, a large stone with a good amount of the material coming out of it, it was a nearly clear group of crystals, worth a ton and can be made it to some of the best weapons. The players saw the crystals and tried to plan out how they were going to get the whole thing so it couldn't respawn, all the while, Liz was already a couple feet from the stone, pickaxe in hand ready to mine a good amount, not all, but enough so it can still respawn. But the players had other plans, they readied the darts and tried to fire, but it failed, they tried again, and it failed. The darts were not launching, Liz was almost done mining and she had no idea she was being watched. After Liz finished mining the crystals, the players finally got it working and aimed the blow tubes right at her back, she started walking toward the exit if the clearing but she dropped one of the crystals. She bent down to pick it up and the players shot the darts...right at her butt, she reacted accordingly, she screamed and reached for what got her hoping it wasn't anything dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out the darts and her heart sank, \"Darts...that's not good\". She heard the players in the bushes and she bolted towards a safe place to used a warp crystal, the players jumped out and started firing at her to see of they could get any extra shots on her. As she ran from the clearing, a couple darts got her in, where else, her butt, \"Grr, why do the darts always get my ass?\", she found a safe spot and used the warp crystal on the spot, warping right to her Shop where Asuna was waiting. \"Liz, your back, there was one person how was looking for you, she said something about a group of red players with a strange blue goop in darts. Did you run into any trouble when you were out there?\" \"Well, I think a got a taste of what those players had, but I think that goop was just colored water, I feel fine.\" Liz pulled the last dart out of her backside heading toward her bedroom for the night, before Asuna headed home for the night, she caught a glimpse at Liz's butt, it looked...thicker and...blue? She dismissed it as just her eyes playing tricks on her from being so tired, she headed home hoping something will happen tomorrow to fill her time, she didn't want another day of boredom.</span></div></div>",

She turned her body around to get out of bed, but when she tried to get up she had a bit of a hard time, with a bit more effort, she got up and headed toward her kitchen to get some breakfast, she changed her clothes to her usual clothes on the way there, she made a piece of buttered toast and made her way to her forge. Before she got there she noticed a weird feeling in her butt, it felt...heavier, not to mention her panties felt tighter on her, \"I hope its just minor swelling from the darts, I really don't want to be exposing myself\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was at the door when she took a quick look at the mirror to make sure she looked formal, once she looked down to dust herself off, she saw something bulging under her skirt, something blue. She turned and when to feel it, she realized what she just put her hand on was her own ass, which was now blue was sticking out from under her skirt, she ran as best as she could to her room and striped down to her bra and panties and saw that the blue coming from her butt was spreading up her torso and down her legs. She rubbed her the blue reached and she felt a bit more sensitive, she looked in her full body mirror and saw how her but had affected her figure, not that she cared too much, but she didn't want to look ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just when she thought her problems were over, she felt a weird feeling in her legs and belly, she put her hands on her belly and looked down, she saw her belly start to swell in her hands and a slow pace, to make it worse the blue started to spread at a faster pace. \"N-no, no, this can't be happening!\", she stepped back and watched as her belly, legs and butt continued to swell, she wanted to scream but she'd risk someone seeing her, so she ran to her shop and closed all the blinds and locked the door before anyone could see her, but just as she gave a sigh of relief she felt the weird feeling in her chest and she placed her hands on her breasts and felt them swell along with the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon felt the same feeling in her arms and then her back, she continued to swell and even becoming more rotund, her legs and arms started to sink into her body and her breasts continued to swell out, sticking out of her body. After 10 minutes of swelling, the blue finally reached the top of her head, turning her hair and eyes from pink to blue, she suddenly heard the door open and heard foot steps walking around to her front. It was Asuna and she was, reasonably surprised from seeing her best friend in the state she was in, \"Liz? What happened to you?\" Liz was about to answer her but her cheeks started to swell so she tried to explain quickly, \"I think this is what the darts from thmm mhmhm...\" but she couldn't explain fast enough as her now swollen cheeks made speech impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Asuna got the picture, she explained that she would find someone that could fix this and ran out the door, little did you know, she allowed the same red players to \"finished what the started\" as they snuck into Liz's shop undetected with a whole bottle of the serum the originally used on her, only it was much stronger. They knew she wouldn't willingly ingest the serum so they had on of their members impersonate Asuna, \"Liz, I found it, the thing that will bring you back, all you need to do is roll up on you belly, close your eyes and drink this. Liz trusted the voice and did just that, but she would soon regret it, as soon as she finished the bottle, the other red players had started rolling her back on her crouch, she felt the same weird as before, but was all over her body, she started to swell again, her torso absorbed her hands and feet, her breasts swelled even more, and soon her bra and panties couldn't take any more and snapped of her ever swelling body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to swell more and more to the point where juice had to find a way out, and it did, through her breasts, mouth and clit, her cheeks swelled more to the point where she couldn't even make a sound. After 15 minutes of swelling, she stopped at just shy of the ceiling of her shop and her breasts were a third her size each, she couldn't take it any more, she was so full, her body felt weird and she was so embarrassed. \"Please let it end!\" She thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

I'll start out with my own in game Character bio here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Zeig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 22.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass: Assassin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlignment: Neutral-evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills and stats: Uses mostly skills that involve getting him from point A to point B as fast as possible, and without alerting the enemy to his presence. His stats are mostly focused around attack and speed. Allowing him to not only reach his destination ahead of schedule, but also to be the first one to attack when the need arises, and when the going gets tough enough for him to withdraw from the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquipment: Zeig travels light at all times so as not to be burdened by the wight of extra loot. He uses two daggers and a crossbow as his offense, combined with various types of herbs and/or poisons designed to either incapacitate, or assassinate the target victim. He also owns a sniper rifle, but he only ever uses it is when his target is too far away from the range of his crossbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccupation: When he's not off killing other players/enemies, Zeig is busy helping out part time making clothing for a traveling caravan. And some of the clothing he makes he keeps as camouflage for use in future missions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory since joining SAO: When Zeig realized that he and the other ten thousand gamers were trapped inside the Sword Art Online, he quickly realized that it was either kill, or be killed. It was nothing short of luck that he decided to use a assassin as his Character class as he was used to sneaking around and doing his own little thing. From staying on the sidelines and watching from afar, he was able to not only learn the rules of the game rather quickly, but also learned about the pros and cons of the other Character classes. And after he encountered a group of player killers, (Who failed to keep true to their name.) their leader offered him a job to work for him. Killing other players/enemies who get in his way, and paying Zeig more cash than he would ever earn working at the caravan in a month.</span></div></div>",

Along the way, many townsfolk (AI's and other players.) kept their distance upon seeing me walking down the streets. It wasn't because they knew who i was or what i did for a living. Not most of them anyway. But every player in SAO is given a gem that hovers above their heads, which tells the other players what kind of person they are, based on what color the gem is. If the gem is green, then it means you're a friendly player. If it's yellow, then it mean's you've committed a crime within three days. After three days have passed however, it turns back to being green. But if you've ever killed another player or players like i have, then it turns orange. And since everyone can see what color my gem is, everyone knows of the many sin's that I've committed. But even as they stay a good distance away from me, they still know that they're protected. So long as they remain within the safe zone inside the town, their HP will never fall below one. But if they ever run into me, or another PK outside of town, even if it's just a few feet away from the safe zone, they're pretty much screwed. Soon enough, i reach the inn and walk up to the front desk for my room key. The woman at the desk has her doubts about giving me my key, but she knows well enough that so long as i keep paying up, there's very little that she can do. With room key in hand, i make it to my room, lock the door, turn the lights off, and lie down for a quick nap.</span></div></div>",

Staying on the rooftops, i ran across them in the hopes that i could make the deadline for my next mission. Tonight, a convoy of well armed guards, said to be from the lead group, was to make camp on the 22nd floor. Which was the floor i was on right now. Their mission, to find a rare item that only spawns every three months. As much as i didn't like encountering the lead group, an item that only spawns every three months is well worth the risk. Making my way through the forest without encountering any obstacles, i soon see the camp up ahead, and duck down before anyone can see my approach. As i crawl to a large bush, i take a peek through it and see a bunch of players around a campfire. One of them catching my eye. A woman in a white outfit with a cape that went down to around her knees, and a red skirt. She had white socks that met her skirt and also had a red cross design at the top. She has long orange-brownish chestnut hair and hazel eyes. White shoes, and a rapier still in hilt on her left hip. No doubt she was in charge of this unit. One would take a quick look at her and say, i could take her. But if you've faced enough players like i have, it's that you never underestimate a player. While the monsters or other AI's have a code that they always have to follow, players on the other hand, are unpredictable. And can always surprise you. That's why i decided to wait things out and see what they were going to do first.</span></div></div>",

And pointed to one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone know what kind of item it is? I mean, it can't be some low level item, or there wouldn't be so many of us out here. Right Asuna?\" I gave him a quick nod and responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct. The item in question has been identified as a new skill. What kind it is, we don't know. But as you all know, having extra skills is paramount if we're to complete the game and defeat the final boss on the 100th floor.\" All of the hands went down except for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has it been decided who gets to keep the skill?\" After he spoke up, the other started talking amongst themselves. Thinking the same thing. If they were going to get it first. I had to think of something to calm them down and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While we still don't know who gets to keep the skill, our job is to bring it back to HQ and receive our pay. Which in case you were wondering, is to be divided amongst all of us evenly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how much are we getting paid for this mission may i ask?\" This came from the same man as before. Then i looked down at everyone and said-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1.000.000.\" Then the campfire erupted in shouts of celebration of such a vast amount of wealth. While i was happy for such a large reward as well, i think they might have missed the part where we divide it all amongst ourselves. As the men kept raising their voices, i kicked one of them down into the other men beside him. Creating a domino effect. Knocking most of them down and giving them the hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're all done talking, then it's time for us to search the forest for the spawn location. Move out!\" Everyone got up and started loading up the supplies and putting out the campfire. Then i proceeded to move out as well.</span></div></div>",

Then, at 1:15 AM on the dot, a surge of energy came from the platform. Then a bright light. And then, the item appeared. And sure enough, it was a skill. Just as the lead group said it would be.

Followed by some other men from the lead group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there. Who are you, and what are you doing here?\" The woman spoke up.

Thankfully, ALO had a secret diet solution that can impact her IRL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile playing ALfheim Online, gamers still feel fatigue and hunger (even if their real bodies are not hungry), yet they can also eat in-game to dispel hunger in the real world, which has developed into a form of dieting for some people as a result.

I've put on a few plans in real life.\" Alicia whispered, sweatdropping. Sakuya nodded to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be honest I have a good diet plan that goes along those lines. Come and eat with me and then we'll talk about it. Maybe I can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd appreciate it alot.\" the blonde haired girl said as she went with her statuesque friend. The two of them continued to catch the glance of others in the area until they finally made it inside the restaurant. Once there they saw the place was already packed to the brim, with Leafa delivering the food trays to others along with Kirito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cafe was large, with six people to a table, mostly men gawking at Leafa or Asuna, or people clamoring for more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center was a dueling area for shows to be put on while players dined. There was an audience to watch people duel if the mood so struck them. Already some low level players were fighting, their beginner level blades clashing as a few of the diners cheered them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling and feeling happy, Sakuya and Alicia barely noticed a new patch had been added to the game. They decided to look at it later, but for now...</span></div></div>",

They saw their friend Leafa turn around and beamed, walking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two! Welcome to Ragout Rabbit's Den!\" Beamed the blonde Sylph. She was dressed in a waitress outfit reminiscent to ones wear by German waitresses, which revealed some cleavage from her modest bust. \"So, how do you like this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems rather okay. I'm glad to see my investment has paid off,\" smiled Sakuya lightly. Alicia was leaning with her elbows on the table, chin on palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you look like you're having a good time workin' too Leafa! How's it like under Asuna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna is as good as a employer as I ever seen! Or had, as this is my first job in a sense.\" Leafa rubbed the back of her head sheepishly. \"Good thing Ymir installed that new patch of the currency transfer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYmir installed a new patch in New ALO where when you earn currency in-game, you can exchange it for real life currency, at a Yen to Yuld rate. Somehow, the one who made the idea and transplanted it in is in the talks for some economics award.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a 'ping' rang out and Leafa's eyes shifted. \"Oh! Someone else's order is ready! I'll have one of my co-workers handle your order, I have to take care of by business and what not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia's tail swished as she nodded. \"Of course. Handle you shtick.\" Nodding, their blonde busty friend jogged off. Turning towards Sakuya, Alicia saw her deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somethin' up? You are always thinkin' whenever you had that look on your face.\" Sakuya perked up, looking at Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Nothing much. Just that...well...you know my birthday is in a month right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What about it?\" Sakuya blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be 25...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threshold. The line of no return. If Sakuya does not have a significant other by that time then no would want to so much as 'touch her' in Japan. The 'Christmas Cake' urban legend and standard still held true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really believe that?\" Asked the Cait Sith with eyes quirked. \"I never expected someone like you to be worried about boys. I always thought you swung the other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya looked flustered. \"What! No! Just that...I have high standards for men is all. They need to the ability to look at 'me', not at-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your boobies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet you.\"</span></div></div>",

PArt of Sakuya thought that all the people working would be other girls like Asuna and Leafa, but to her surprise a young man came over to her and Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladies, welcome to Ragout Rabbit's Den. I'm Leorin.\" he said. Observing him, Sakuya was surprised to see that it was a Caith Sith like Alicia. He was tall and had creamy white skin, a flawless complexion. In addition to this he had bright, emerald green eyes. Like many Caith Sith's, his eyes were slittled and catlike. One fact about him that stood out though was his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was young and handsome, but overweight. He looked to be about  in the range of the upper two hundred pounds, with a large belly emphasized by his fine looking and tight clothing that included a black tie and vest over his dress shirt. He had an air of gentle elegance about him despite his size, his chubby cheeks and slight triple chin giving him a friendly look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia smiled and looked at the menu before replying whilst Sakuya still observed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the frenzy boar ham and mandrake fruit please.\" she said before smiling. \"Ale to drink please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, and you ma'am?\" the man asked. Looking, Sakuya saw his name was Leorin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the, erm...Ragout stew please with a side of cream and bread.\" Sakuya said, still caught by the man's looks. Something about him just drew her eyes. When she was done ordering he took the menu and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lovely choice ma'am. I'll be back with your meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Leorin.\" Sakuya said before he left, smiling. As Sakuya watched him leave she wondered who he was. Looking at Alicia she spoke. \"Do you know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. He's probably not into the race politics. I've met plenty of Cait Siths who've played for a while who don't even know who I am.\" Alicia said. \"Still he does seem cute...Or at least you seem to think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush!\" Sakuya exclaimed, blushing before he came and gave them their food. As he handed them their food he smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoy them. May I get your names...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Alicia, this is Sakuya. We're friends of Asuna and Leafa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see. Well they keep lovely company.\" he said, making Sakuya blush a bit more. \"Let me know if you ladies need anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Leorin went back to the kitchen while Alicia giggled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shall we enjoy our meals?\" Alicia asked as she began to munch on the delicious ham. It was cooked to perfection and she sighed happily as the warm meat went down her gullet. Deciding to get on with her meal, Sakuya dined as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to slurp the delectably rare delight of a dish happily, dipping her cream slathered, warm bread into the broth. She had never tasted anythign so fine in real life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she realize the recent patch was a calorie calculator, meant to account for changes in physique for avatars. They could gain or lose weight, as well as musculature or scars from old battles if they so chose. Though this meant that excessive eating in game would cause change for the avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost players wouldn't notice though, because it was a low priority update. Mostly this meant fixing minor visual or programming details  like different hues of leaves or detailing on buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now the two best friends continued to dine, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Complimentary from Asuna.\" He set them on the plate for the two. \"She knows the two of you as great faction leaders, plus Sakuya gets her meals for free here as she invested in Asuna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia pouted. \"I should have pooled my money when I had the chance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine.

You played in the old ALO?\" Asked Sakuya, dipping her bread in the soup for some extra flavor. \"Launch day or afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Launch day. I got some grief from my parents for getting a VRMMO what with the SAO Incident, but I wanted to try it out first hand. My one gripe was the lack of leveling up. I...really don't care about an all PvP game like those MMBAs that was and still is all the rage. So I mainly stuck with leveling up my Beast taming, Holy, and Water Magic Skills. I got quite a few invites to play as heals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a healer.\" Said Alicia, resting her head on her interlocked hands, smirking at the taller man. \"Given your size I assumed you would be a big bad tank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that a lot. I mean, on other MMOs I played as tank, but I wanted to go for a change of pace, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand the feeling,\" smiled Sakuya, finishing her meal and moving to her ice cream. As she picked up the spoon, a menu opened up in front of her. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morphius Ice Cream. When you touch it, you can have whatever flavor you want and a choice of 2 to 3 toppings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously!\" Said an astounded Alicia. \"I'll pay it!\" She opened her menu and exchanged some of her Yuld. \"Man...virtual reality...\" She pressed some buttons, her plain dull white dairy treat turning into a chocolate confection with whip cream, strawberries, and graham cracker powder. \"Is the best!\" She began to dig in, her ears perked with joy as she tasted the flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here here!\" Added Leorin. \"I'll write your check Alicia-san.\" He bowed lightly towards his leader and then to Sakuya. \"Sakuya-san.\" And he walked off to the back...</span></div></div>",

That food was too good to pass up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree, but I doubt they have any more ragout rabbit stew. After that I'd kill a dozen bosses for a few more servings of that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well I heard a rumor that there was a ragout rabbit den. Maybe we could go there and bring some in. Even if we don't eat them we'd have tons of cash for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. I'm really glad they brought over SAO elements. It almost makes me wish we had been able to play.\" Sakuya said semi-seriously. Seeing what an impressive fighter Kirito and some of the SAO survivors were made her really admire what trials they had overcome. Even so she much prefered when games were simply games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, but for now I think I'm just happy I'm here in ALO. The best of both worlds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true as well.\" Sakuya said when she noticed Leorin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her wanted to pursue him, maybe ask about a friend request, but she couldn't help but wonder if he was really as charming in person. What if he disappointed her expectations? As shallow as it seemed Sakuya hoped he wasn't anything like people who's whole world was the game and the game alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she...</span></div></div>",

Is there something you need?\u201d He asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I was wondering\u2026\u201d Sakuya pondered over her worlds. \u201cI was thinking that we could party up in the future. Taking on dungeons and so forth back in Alfheim, outside of Aincrad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter than asking someone to go out. Asking for dungeon-crawling is much more preferable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing!\u201d He grinned, opening his menu and asking for a friend request.

We\u2019re going to a dungeon when he gets off of work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia giggled. \u201cSounds like a date to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired Sylph rolled her eyes. \u201cIs not.

She\u2019s only 10 levels away from the Cap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafa blushed. \u201cI maybe level 90 right now, but it\u2019s really thanks to Oni-chan\u2019s and me joining in on the raids.

There will be two new zones, each half the size of Alfheim and separated North and South. To get to these new realms, you need to go through a specific portal. One in in Gnome territory, the other in Salamander territory. The one in Gnome territory takes you to the Land of Ice: Nifhelheim. The south portal, to Muspellheim, the Land of Fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire and Ice?\" Sounded Sakuya. \"Sounds like that one popular book series made into a TV series...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than 10 years later and STILL no Netflix or Hulu...HBO is a bunch of greedy goons,\" griped Leafa. This brought her wide eyed stares from her friends. \"What? I like Game of Thrones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways...\" Alicia went back on topic. \"In addition to those new realms: new items and weapons will be found, much more potent then even some higher level ones found in Alfheim and the lower levels of New Aincrad. In addition, the level cap will be raised from 100 to 135. It was originally supposed to be 120 but the developers who play this game and are with the clearing raids know how hard the Aincrad floors above 20 are so they raised the cap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...I take it these new realms will be around the 100s range?\" Asked Sakuya. She needs to catch up badly! But her duties as faction leader are getting in the way! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supposedly.\" Alicia shrugged. \"But for what it's worth I'm in the low ends as well. Only Leafa is near the cap to level up. We'd have to power level hard when we get the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so...\" The dark haired sylph ate at her ice cream as she turned towards the blonde Sylph. \"Leafa, you wouldn't mind ummm...power leveling us when we have time right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Leafa beamed. \"We'd need to grab a good heals, I know both you can me can heal but I can't last out in level 40-50 dungeons FOREVER.\" She chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia got a cheeky cat-like grin as she turned towards a certain chubby Cait Sith taking another person's order. \"I think I know a certain guy~. Plus, we could always ask Kirito, Asuna, and others to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya shook her head. \"It's best we stick to 4 members for a party, if we have too many the EXP would be spread too thin. So we have...us...\" Her finger pointed towards everyone. \"And Leorin.\" She turned towards Alicia. \"How much longer until the Expansion is released?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About...two months?\" Alicia pondered. \"So, wanna do some farming on the lower Aincrad floors or head to Alfheim? Or, would you rather wait on Leorin here until his shift is over?\"</span></div></div>",

Smirking as she admired her new stat boosts, Alicia looked back at Sakuya who was standing at ready. \"Switch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Sakuya said, running forth, her Katana at ready for attack. Swiftly she began to attack the foes. She smirked, knowing that with her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her Leafa was watching in case she needed to intervene for either of the others. So far the two leaders were doing well. Alicia smiled and then started to attack. Confident in her skills she was able to move about swiftly, evading their strikes with ease...And yet somehow she thought she was slower than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer speed was still great, but she felt heavier and less mobile. She couldn't place her finger on it, but she certainly wasn't quite as fast as she had been in the past. She figured it might be her profile lagging or somesuch, but she continued to fight, executing the last ape in a matter of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted from the combat, she sat down on a stump near Leafa, who was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job. We can rest for a bit before we start again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! Who knew cleared floors could still be so hard.\" she said as she looked to the charcoal black labyrinth of the eight floor. The large forest-like area reminded her of the raid where the Sylphs and Salamanders united to defeat the boss. She and Eugene had actually acted as a team in order to fight and overcome it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso the monsters of the area were transplanted from monsters of higher floors. The Drunken Apes were among said monsters. They were good for training and gave a good exp yield after the difficulty spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll agree.\" Alicia said before sitting down. \"I can't imagine how tough the higher floors will be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It'll be a while before we get there. For now we can just take it easy. You two are making great pace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but something is bugging me...\" Sakuya said, looking down, contemplatively. When she did she could swear she had a bit of a belly. It was odd. She hadn't gained a pound in real life, yet her avatar seemed thicker, more full figured. Her clothes didn't feel tight on her avatar's body, but she could swear her face was chubbier, but her assets had also grown. Alicia seemed a bit larger too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But the avatars match our real weights, and mine hasn't changed at all...' she thought, wondering what exactly had brought such a thing on. That was when her belly rumbled again, embarassingly. Leafa looked at her and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, seems someone worked up an appetite. How about a lunch break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm starving.\" Alicia said, her long tail wiggling about as she thought of nourishment. Sakuya was feeling much the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case I guess I could go for...\" She began when she saw that......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Is that...\" Out of the corner of her eye Sakuya spotted the rare monster over by the trees. Slowly walking towards it, she gave a loud 'shhh!' to Leafa and Alicia. The Cait Sith and Sylph shrugged and turned back away. Sakuya will fill them in earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya went over her skills. She could use her Wind Magic, but can it catch up to the critter and kill it? There is also her throwing weapon skill, but that was incredibly low, so she could easily miss and the rabbit would get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wing Magic it is.' She thought as she whispered the glowing arcane incantations. It was a simple Wind Spell that sent a slice of air pressure towards the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ragout Rabbit still munching on the shrubbery...not aware of Sakuya. Until it's ears perked up as Sakuya said the last syllable of the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released the spell, and the rabbit leaped...only to be sliced in half by the spell, giving out a cry before shattering into polygons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a ping in her inventory, Sakuya inspected it and beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Ragout Rabbit's Meat was in her inventory with a durability of 5 in-game days before it goes rotten and disappears. That is plenty of time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui Sakuya,\" Alica jogged up to the taller Sylph. \"Whatcha got?\" She asked, seeing the look of amusement of delight on the dark haired Sylph's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, just an incredibly rare item that I could sell for over one hundred yuld.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me!\" Alicia gasped. \"You got some super rare item from a low level mob!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya nodded, placing a hand on her softer hips. \"Indeed. One Ragout Rabbit's Meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My big brother got that back in his SAO days!\" Leafa said in surprise. She then beamed a little. \"It was the very meat that bonded him and Asuna together. After all, a man to a man's heart is through his stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can adhere to that!\" Added the Cait Sith with a giggle. \"My dad was always a bit heavyset, but my mom managed to nab him because of said cooking,\" She then turned towards Sakuya, once again with that cat like look on her visage. \"Got someone in mind to give it Saku-nyan? Hmmm~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya blushed a bit. \"M-Maybe, but only because my own cooking skill is rather low! I have no use for it and I have enough Yuld already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\" Alicia said. \"Over one hundred grand here is like, one hundred yen IRL. That can get ya some nice stuff. You sure on this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Alicia finished her sentence, the round of growling rang out. And it wasn't just from Alicia and Sakuya's stomachs, but also Leafa as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde sylph laughed. \"Yeah...had breakfast at like, 5 a.m. this morning due to my Kendo practices. Want to nab some lunch at one of the towns?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya nodded, with Alicia giving her approval. \"Say no more. All this grinding as left me hungry!\"</span></div></div>",
