She had no problems changing in front of Harry, partly because she was unsure as to if he was even aware in his form, and also he would be spending a lot of time with her breasts so if she had any problems she wouldn't be doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry initially had no idea what he was only finding out her was clothing when Hermione said 'worn', wonder what he was when she began to strip, when she flashed her breasts to him Harry knew 2 things; he was a bra, apparently Hermione's size, and that Hermione had beautiful, big, bouncy tits. He was picked up again and brought closer to his prize, though he stopped at her face (which if Harry had would be pouting) and she began speaking \"Okay Harry you're about to go somewhere very special, so behave right?\" Harry just looked back at her thinking \"I'm a bra! What do you think I'll do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione must've realised her flaw too as she giggled before lowering him to her breasts, then attaching his clasp with a smile. Harry was enjoying himself, Hermione's breasts felt as soft as then looked and were really perky, there was just one slight problem; Hermione's nipples were hard and stabbing into him. Though even that he put up with mainly because it meant she was very aroused by the current situation and his presence, including his current position. Nice to see they were both getting enjoyment. Hermione was surprised by her thoughts on the matter; she'd expected to be apauld by this; she felt it as wrong but damn the feel of him on her skin and the idea of using Harry for something this naughty got her wet (and very glad she hadn't turned Harry into a pair of panties)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now what?</span></div></div>",

So silent, so discreet, but lifting it up to examine it in the dappled light filtering through the window, she was fairly sure it wasn't hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly looked the right size to fit, and with a shrug she admired the modest design. She knew she wasn't the most blessed of girls. Indeed she shared the dorm with Roberta Ravenclaw. The umpteenth generation heir of the Silver lady, there was still a recognisable trace of Helena and Rowena to justify her admission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little sad, that Cho found herself doubting Roberta's wisdom. Judging her harshly for having a fuller figure, as if that somehow made her the bimbo the Slytherins' called her behind her back. But... Well, her marks were borderline for a Ravenclaw. Cho hated thinking that way, but she tried to reassess her opinion as she slipped her arms into the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was soft, warm and comforting. The constraint making her feel more in control, Harry also found his own pleasure, as he felt the toasty touch of her supple flesh. The stiff caress of her nipples sliding home. As her fingers slid from the clasp, Cho sank back on her bed. Snuggling deeper into the bed, like a cat drowsing in a sunbeam. It took Cho a few moments to know something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls felt safe and secure as ever. But fuller, than before. Cupping the bra against her chest, reassessing whether her guess that the bra was her size. She couldn't deny it any longer. She was being blessed/cursed with a bigger bust. Harry moaned, at the urgent pressure of Cho's hands atop her bra. The soft, exploratory mauling, confirming she truly was filling those cups... and that those cups were truly as large as they now felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/35facc6b81b1628be97a10f097b38f37/tumblr_okufbw7ZOi1w2lwkto2_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/35facc6b81b1...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guilty rush, teased Cho's stomach, as she imagined flaunting this body, these curves.

The next time she huddled low to the handle, cradling it like a stiff cock in a joyous cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/cfee0a6687bec0c2f40aa10dc20d9282/tumblr_okufbw7ZOi1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/cfee0a6687be...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the momentary doubt, what if this was permanent.

With mountains of books piled nearby, and rivers of parchment wending their way across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was decorated with scratches and spots of ink. Ironically it was Harry she needed, he had an intuitive grasp of magic. He knew how to mix spells, he didn't need that ... that book. It was the real reason for her anger, she knew Harry didn't need the Half-blood prince's cast offs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour previously, she had dismissed a helpful Ron Weasley. Believing he was really looking for Harry, even if for different reasons. She certainly wasn't about to admit her mistake, or expose Harry's current condition to his best friend. Hermione knew how quickly it would spread to Fred and George, and from there to Peeves, and around the whole school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a low groan of frustration. For all her work, she didn't have a single way of tracking Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen inspiration hit. She snatched at one scrap of parchment, then another incomplete incantation on another piece of crumpled paper. Then looked with determination for a third. With low hissed, 'Yes', she smoothed out the three pieces of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween them she could craft a spell, a new piece of magic. She silently read the spell to herself, imagining the gestures. It felt right. Or at least she thought it did. Still a niggling doubt teased her, surely Harry didn't face this constant doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resolute snort. She looked over the wreckage of the table. She'd done the research, she was sure it would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping her left hand, she waved her wand around and around. The incantation flowing from her lips. A low yellow glow built between her fingers, illuminating her palm. The light slowly sharpened and took shape. The edges hardened, as it formed into a compass needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the incantation, she breathed a sigh of relief, and lowered her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her left hand, the light vanished in an instant, becoming a faint yellow sand and drifting to the table surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tore at Hermione to leave the books, and the library table in such chaos, but she needed to find Harry. He might be in imminent danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a last sorrowful look at the mess, she left the library, and went find a quiet corner near the main stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the glowing compass needle formed, and gave her a new bearing towards Harry. She barely paid attention to where she was going, just relentlessly following the directions she was given.</span></div></div>",

But, she did get a very bad feeling when she looked at them, or talked to them. There was a coldness, an absence behind their eyes. Even at the Slug Club, they'd spoken little, and paused frequently, as if mentally reviewing their words, as if checking that they wouldn't reveal too much, or say something incriminating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment that was missing, as the three of them were talking animatedly. From the giggles, the glances and the cautious hands, it was clear that Pansy was bustier than before. While not something she paid a deal of attention to, it was hard to deny that Pansy suddenly looked like she was stuffing her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hiding place, Hermione bit her lower lip.

Hermione saw her lips move furiously, but equally silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione wanted to act, but couldn't with two witnesses. At least, Harry wasn't in imminent danger.

The threads drifting down from her body, only to turn to smoke in the air and blow away on the breeze. Even as stone, she felt the chill as her nakedness was revealed. The caress of the air teasing her perfect stony nipple. She was even able to see the cuffs of her blouse and jumper as they disintegrated before her eyes.</span></div></div>",

Even Pansy found them a little unsettling, they had an unnatural coldness and distance in their every reaction. She raised her finger to her lips for silence. Millicent gritted her teeth, and beckoned for her to follow, as she too headed off to join the Carrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPansy whispered in Hermione's stony ear. \"Enjoy this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking out her wand she traced it down Hermione's spine, allowing the wood to slip between, her marble cheeks. Imprisoned and immobile, she wanted to twitch, and writhe, to ease her distraction.

She was sure she recognised the Hogwarts gardens, but her immobility was terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEqually unsettling, was when she felt a tender kiss on her rump. It felt like ... like ...

Of appearing naked for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know whether to feel insulted or relieved, as the students arrived. The round figure of Pomona Sprout toddling along behind them. None of them paid her a great deal of attention. Although, there was a flurry of whispers. They centred around the surprise at the new statue, and not what Hermione Granger was doing buck naked in the Gardens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, this made things clearer to her.

Her warm earthy nature in tune with her subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students were soon drawing the various flowers that were passed around. Intricate drawings of the various leaves, with their various uses and dangers noted in careful script. These were true Ravenclaw students, dedicated and diligent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes caught on one student's drawing. His large page wasn't covered with an sketch of a flower or a leaf.

Her diagrams were stark and utilitarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched, she saw he was drawing a gorgeous woman. It was only when she spotted the glances, that she realised, he was drawing her.

An ability to conjure a disguise would be invaluable for someone hoping to be an Auror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter careful (well some) research, Harry found that keeping to human form was the simplest, with a complete animagus form being the most difficult. Some were relatively simple, and while he had enjoyed Tonks' games with changing her nose, he doubted it would impress his Head of House.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing nervously, as the idea built he knew what he needed to do. A gender transformation was key. All he had to do was prove to the professor that it wasn't merely polyjuice. The girls bathroom was as quiet as ever, with only Moaning Myrtle occupying it. It's reputation wasn't helped after the discovery of the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. Besides, there was an amusing irony or parallel with surrendering his masculinity in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing himself in the mirror, he tried to imagine the changes. It was essential for the final swish of the wand, and would help him concentrate on his female form as it developed. He... She could guide it, so that..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frisson of excitement raced down his spine. Did he want to be a cute girl... or mousy and anonymous... The idea of being abundantly feminine made him smile then blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarling at his reflection, he screwed his courage up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further delay, he started the spell. Until at the climax he shot a beam of diamond sparks at his reflection. The bathroom vanished in a blinding flash. Even blinking, and eyes watering Harry could feel the spell working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't going quite as Harry expected. Harry felt his uniform begin to slough off. Spreading thin in places, the merest brush of his fingers causing it to turn to dust and drift to the ground. Rubbing his watery eyes, Harry still couldn't properly make out his reflection. Leaning forward he peered deep into the mirror, his face just inches from the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when he removed his glasses did everything jump into focus. He saw the reflection of Myrtle, attracted by the flash of magic she watched. Her hands folded atop the cubicle wall, her gaze fixed on Harry's cute rear end. Catching his eyes, she giggled, and gave an approving nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tingling from his chest brought Harry back to think about his imminent changes. Already he could see his nips spreading wider, and rising higher. Instinctively, his hands rose to confirm what his eyes told him. A gasp escaped his lips, as his fingers brushed over the new nipples. This drew another giggle from Myrtle. Harry's stomach twitched painfully, and he felt his waist pinch inwards. He'd never been fat as a child, but now he... (a glance downwards confirmed this)... he was getting some significant curves. A crack announced the shifting of Harry's hips, as they widened, adding the curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a disapproving pout on Myrtle's face, as Harry's arse started to swell. Growing from a taut male posterior, into a fulsome and rounded rear. Running his hand over the developing ass, Harry spotted that his fingers were slender and feminine, and tipped with a glossy nail varnish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissing Myrtle, Harry tried to concentrate. He needed to concentrate if he wanted to have any hope in directing his transformation. Pressing forward against the edge of the sink, Harry found that she was now the right gender for the toilets.</span></div></div>",

Looking around the small dorm room, there was still nobody there to argue him out of it. They were practising Quidditch, or watching the practice. Hell, he'd be there too, if his damned broom wasn't jinxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading the incantation, and practising the wand movements, Ron repeated and repeated, until he was sure he'd memorised it correctly. This was probably the most time he'd get alone, and the reversal spell looked simple enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Masculo Femini Transformi</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white sparkles shot from the tip of his wand, flying in a circle around him, until they coloured, taking a pinkish hue, before darting straight towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting his eyes against the bright light, Ron suddenly realised he hadn't visualised his... no her... final form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a little afraid, Ron concentrated on his breathing. His chest felt heavier, she snorted. That sounded kinda cute, and with her eyes still shut, she reached to explore her new bust. She found it a lot quicker than she expected, and her slim fingers seemed to roam forever, over the vast expanse of her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes snapping open, Ron took in the Goddess kneeling on his bed. She was built for sex and nothing more. 'Crikey..', she spluttered, as she spotted her ass was fighting her bust for prominence. There was no trace of any Weasley ginger in her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/0698fd2338800f8602b16be24bfca9fc/tumblr_olhkt2SNxS1w2lwkto5_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/0698fd233880...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bloomin' Heck', she muttered as she took in 'every' detail. She suddenly thought of the twins, she had to keep this secret from them. Though a smile did sneak out, as she had to admire the woman that was lurking within.</span></div></div>",

The fit tight and revealing, Ronni blushed at how it cleaved to her fleshy thighs. Still masculine enough in his mind to picture them wrapped around his broomstick. But now feminine enough to imagine them crushing some manly torso in their embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she plucked at the uniform jumper, she was stopped momentarily, as the name tag was visible inside it. Veronica Delilah Weasley was stitched on a tag. It took her another moment, as she felt the embrace of her new formed bra tighten. The girls lifted and contained in a way that made her both proud and self-conscious. The weight already burdensome on her shoulders. That concern displaced as the felt her underwear shift. Her panties drifting, diving like a pearl fisherman for the depths of her ass cleavage. The binding tightness of her skirt, preventing her from ripping it free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head in a futile denial, only her hair flashed back and forth across her face. Reality was as immutable as ever... Well, her current reality with these massive, heavy, unwieldy titties, and that equine ass. A pang of sympathy, that she'd displaced Ginny as the first female Weasley at Hogwarts. Was displaced by a sense of envy that Ginny wasn't as defined as these curves. Her body was more suited for Quidditch, and not simply made for sexual athletics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA doubt was planted, was she still Gryffindor goalie? Or now reduced to being a cheerleader... a prize for Harry to hoist. She shuddered at the idea... and it's siren appeal both wrong, but still so seductive.</span></div></div>",

The chapter was quite short, and confirmed what he expected. The form an animagus took, reflected their personality. Ron nodded to himself as he thought over the different wizards and their animal forms. Peter Pettigrew becoming a rat, Rita Skeeter being a bug, Professor McGonagall a rather aloof cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips moved silently as he rehearsed the incantation. It wasn't terribly difficult, to find out. But even then, it still might not be possible for him to gain his animagus form. That spell <b>was </b>difficult. Drawing a deep breath, he settled his nerves. He wasn't sure how he'd react when he found it out. Suppose it was a timid mouse... or a bug himself... He tried to picture himself becoming a magnificent stallion. But a doubting smile quirked the corner of his mouth even now. But to be the first Weasley animagus, surely that was worth the risk. Even if it wasn't the most terrifying of creatures. Even a fierce grim, would be awesome, Ron thought. Surely his loyalty and friendship with Harry and Hermione would count in his favour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can always stop.\" he whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the incantation, and the wand gestures the bottom half of the page was blank. That was where his animal form would appear, an animated sketch of his future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wand flicks were tricky with his other hand holding the sheets up. But the book started to glow as he read out the spell. It pulsed brightly in time with his gestures, and he tapped the page with the tip of his glowing wand. Instantly, ink flowed in from the corners of the page, dancing and whirling, as they darkened and took on a clearer shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still impossible to make out, even now with the lines now clear and sharp. Half a dozen half glimpsed images came to mind, and vanished just as quickly.</span></div></div>",

Harry wasn't happy to be the target of a transfiguration spell, but he wanted Hermione's goodwill. Besides, he could repay her with DADA homework. Ron had made an excuse, when Hermione had asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn excuse Harry had accidentally undercut when he accepted Hermione's request. So, currently Ron was practising Quidditch, ably assisted by Ginny. Who'd promised to go easy on him, and even encourage him... if she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's back pressed against the pillar, with nothing behind him to distract Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked up, she was already starting to chant beneath her breath.

The wand faltered, and he felt the air crackle as the magic dissipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to concentrate and visualise it.\" She answered Harry's unspoken question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Harry started awkwardly, \"Can you tell me what you'll transfigure me into...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just something I can visualise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... but what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione continued as if she hadn't heard the question. \"Something, I can feel, smell and experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks were starting to redden, and Harry scowled at her. The awkward evasion collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to transfigure you into a bra.\" she admitted in a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" she asked sharply. Harry was still struggling to think of objections, or questions, but as she took on a duelling pose. He knew it was too late. Her lips moved silently, and her wand traced it's path through the air. Leaving a faint trail of gold speckles in it's path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting his eyes, as the blast headed straight for Harry. He could only feel it as his body twisted and turned. The sensation of falling, gripped Harry and his eyes snapped open... Or rather he could see again. It was an odd sensation, being aware, but mute. Having no ears, but still able to hear Hermione's excited squeak at her success. He spotted her give a little skipping hop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry hit the ground it was only a soft impact. He was unable to see himself, but wasn't sure he wanted to. It was only as Hermione picked him up, that his body responded. He felt Hermione's fingers explore his cups, the chest band, and the shoulder straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was oddly erotic, and he wanted to protest, to squeal himself. But without a mouth, his groans, moans and sighs existed only inside his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks a little big.\" she half-muttered to herself. A look of consternation on her face.</span></div></div>",

It felt like a hug he couldn't break, as she fastened the band into place. Harry's 'eyes' flicked open for the briefest moment. He caught sight of himself, as Hermione admired her reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head tilted this way and that, as if examining him.

Harry wanted to hide, certainly not be discovered as a bra. His mind raced, that someone could even knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision turned paler, and another shudder of joy passed through Harry. It took him a minute to realise that Hermione had slipped her blouse back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute...\" She called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like Hermione was expecting a guest. Harry's vision was further worsened as Hermione pulled a loosely woven jumper over the blouse.

Checking her reflection, she smiled to see how well it clung to her boosted bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in.\" To the unknown person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was mortified to see two figures enter. The one on the left slightly taller than the other. Both topped with copper hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you away from your books, and actually practising.\" Harry recognised it as Ron. So the shorter figure had to be Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you... finished?\" Ron asked, stumbling in the middle. Even through the blouse and jumper Harry was able to tell, that Ron had sneaked a glance at Hermione's bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spotted he was slightly sweating, and Harry felt a pulse of warmth pass through Hermione's body.</span></div></div>",

Pulling it from her bag, tapping it with her wand, she muttered a low incantation, and the yellow and blue shifted. Before Harry's eyes, even the eagle shifted, the stitching dancing before his eyes as it rewove itself into a lion rampant, in gold flecked thread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like his seeker's kit. Well, at the end of a long practice. The dirt was still intact ingrained into every seam and crevice of the strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's head bobbed from side to side, as he weighed up the options. He didn't want to start as Captain by forgetting his strip, and he didn't want to offend Cho either, so reluctantly he took the uniform, and gave Cho his best sincere thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her excuses, and darted away.

It was still tailored for Cho. Luckily they were both similar in size and build, slender and short. With some carefully loosened straps he could make it fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking to himself, he knew that at some point Cho would realise this herself. Opening up the trousers, a flash of white fell free. It was Cho's panties, plucking them off the grass he could still feel their warmth between his fingers. They were still damp with sweat too.</span></div></div>",

Swallowing, he tried again, \"Be... be right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ron's feet trudged away, Harry released the breath he'd been holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling into the seeker's outfit, he saw despite the Gryffindor colours and other changes it was cut for a female player. Being rather snug in some places, and looser in others. The shoulders were a squeeze, as he rolled them trying to get the uniform to fit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teasing chill of satin, brushed his tiny male nipples, as they discovered the built-in support of his top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe already felt committed and knew he couldn't change back now. Aware that every moment he was in the tent was another chance for someone to poke their head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the protective padding and the cloak, he was happy that it at worst looked unisex, and at best wouldn't draw any more attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching his broom like his slipping confidence he left the tent, before his nerve gave way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was only a few paces away, and the rest of the squad stood ready. From high in one of the stands he saw Hermione give him and Ron the thumbs up. He tried to hide his surprise as he spotted Cho sitting beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden a smile crossed his face. He imagined Cho enthusing about Quidditch to a less fascinated Hermione. He resisted the desire to constantly pull at the uniform.</span></div></div>",

The desire to rip it free, to rip them off entirely was growing uncontrollably. But, even for a practice, Harry knew, there'd be all kinds of scopes and glasses focused his way. He knew Hermione worried, and was sure that Cho would be paying particular attention to him today, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting his grip on the broom seemed to help, or at least distract him from the wandering panties. As time wore on, the weather worsened, and Harry had other concerns to occupy his attention. The ill-fitting panties faded, the thong no longer over riding his thoughts. The cut of the material no longer crushing his crown jewels quite so intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwooping down lower, he gave some advice to Fred and George. Always, a risky proposition, and some encouragement to Ron, hovering nervously near the goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to over-do it, he rose higher, as a bludger chose that time to head in his direction. He was already dodging, and didn't see the quaffle Fred chucked in his direction.</span></div></div>",

Hopefully, with everyone busy on their own, he could adjust himself without attracting any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><i>Acquam Sicco</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed the wand at his uniform, and a cloud of steam came from his clothes. The warmth pleasant without being too hot. Tugging at his top, he realised it felt baggy and loose. Dismissing that as his imagination, he gave his trousers a tug, they were clinging to his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the second sensation that confirmed the first. His legs felt wrong. It wasn't his uniform that was too big... it was also too small. It felt tight around his hips. The borrowed panties leapt back into his mind, and he discovered why they weren't quite so snug, and confining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry realised his ... his junk... lil' Harry had vanished. His hands explored finding more behind him too. A quick glance around to see in anyone was paying attention to him, confirmed he was shorter. His eyeline looked to be several inches lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, his hands rose. Pretending to adjust his uniform shirt. Harry found he was the proud bearer of a small, but unmistakable bust. The surge of sensation was unmistakable. The sensitivity totally distracting, and entirely unfamiliar. Thankfully the uniform was baggy enough to hide his revelation from any casual observers, and his distance hopefully meant those lost inches were invisible too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry realised he was now a she. She swallowed sickeningly, 'The girl who lived', and hoped that her changes had run their course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried not to whine, but inside her head, she wailed, \"Isn't the scar enough... I don't need titties to draw any more attention.\"</span></div></div>",
