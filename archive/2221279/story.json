Pam routinely hangs her coat, places her purse next to her cpu, and sits down in her chair and turns on her computer. <br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n6:30am Jim walked into Dunder Mifflin about an hour and a half before Pam or anyone else. His goal: move Dwights desk into the break room as a classic prank. But Jim didn\u2019t get too far into the prank until a beam of light zapped him near reception, shrinking him down to 1cm. Jim found himself amongst giant pencils, sticky notes, and a Jumbotron which turned out to be Pams computer.. \u201coh my gosh.. what.. what just happened..?\u201d Jim said immensely shocked. \u201cOk, I\u2019m on Pams desk... I\u2019ll just wait for her to arrive and get her attention. She\u2019ll help me I know it.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n8:30am: Michael had no luck getting Pams attention from the floor when she had walked in. He decided his best course of action was to climb her shoe, up her pantyhose, and to her shoulder to get her attention. Michael did just that. He grunted as he pulled his 1cm tall self onto Pams shoe. The expanse before him was daunting, but the manager was determined. He leapt onto the pantyhose and began his ascent up Pams shin, using the threads of the pantyhose like a ladder.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n9:00am<br>\r\n\u201cDUNDER MIFFLIN THIS IS PAM\u201d <br>\r\nIt made Jim\u2019s tiny ears ring, he yelled as he covered them. The sight of Pam\u2019s immensity completely threw him off and he found himself cowering behind a coffee cup. \u201cWhat if she thinks I\u2019m a bug? I don\u2019t want to risk that.. I should though.. I need to get outta this mess\u201d. Jim had loved Pam for years, unfortunately she was engaged to Roy. That never stopped Jim from flirting. He had to be honest, even from this angle, Pam looked equally as beautiful as she was while he was a normal height. \u201cOk, no more hiding. If I can get her to hear me first, I\u2019ll stand a chance. I have to get to her shoulder.\u201d Jim made a break for Pams resting hand on her computer mouse.<br>\r\n\u201cNO IM SORRY, JAN.. MICHAELS NOT IN TODAY, HE DIDNT CALL IN SICK SO IM NOT SURE WHERE HE IS... NO JIM IS NOT HERE EITHER... COME TO THINK OF IT, ALMOST NO ONE IN THE OFFICE ARE HERE.. ITS JUST ANGELA, KELLY AND I.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I not the only one like this?\u201d Jim thought to himself.. he never did hear any other guy come in the past hour. \u201cWhatever, focus man you can do this\u201d Jim said as he made it to Pams pinky that just freely hovered over the desk, not really being used for the mouse like the other digits. \u201cHere goes nothing\u201d said Jim before jumping and grabbing onto Pam\u2019s pinky nail. Pulling himself up, he gazed upward to see Pam completely fixated on her computer screen and finishing her phone call with Jan. Jim then ran across Pams pinky finger onto the football field of Pams back hand. Jim took a minute to observe this new landscape.. hair, moles, wrinkles, it was all completely magnified to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI WILL, THANK YOU JAN\u201d Pam hung up the landline. What was going on? Michael, Dwight, Jim, Oscar, Kevin, Creed.. ok creed is usually late.. but all the other guys.. they\u2019re just gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela Martin approached the reception desk. She wore a grey button up shirt, her blonde hair draped down. \u201cHave you gotten any calls from anyone?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNo one. It\u2019s like they all evaporated\u201d Pam joked. \u201cWell when you\u2019re done making entertaining comments, I\u2019ll be at my desk awaiting information\u201d Angela huffed as she turned and walked back to accounting. Pam rolled her eyes and returned her attention back to her computer, moving some loose hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was frozen once mega Angela approached the desk. The sudden appearance caused him to fall and grip the skin of Pam\u2019s ring finger. But the worst wasn\u2019t over, the minute Angela walked away, the ground beneath him rose, causing him to reach out and grab Pams engagement ring. Jim yelled as he saw his inevitable destination: Pams reddish hair. The movement was so quick Jim lost his grip and was hurtled to a spot above Pams forehead, but deep in the forest nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Jan is a giantess and her heels crash onto the rug, creating thunder-like claps. Yowza, Michael Scott though, she's like a sexy Statue of Liberty. Still as she takes these steps closer he realizes he can get squashed and this situation is highly dangerous. He ran under the door of his closed office. It would be safe in there since no one ever wanted to go in. That is usually how the day goes but to Michael's surprise, he heard the doorknob turning and a titanic being coming inside the  dark office. Michael scurried across the rug towards the safety of being underneath the huge desk. He watched in awe as Jan's gargantuan heels stepped forward and the door closed behind her. There was a few seconds of darkness before the light clicked in and Jan was shuffling around, sighing in annoyance, and checking reports on her phone. Michael hadn't seen Jan in a few days and it wasn't like her to come into his office, especially if he is not there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael is further surprised as Jan took a seat and stretched, groaning in relief. The entire seat shook around as Jan stretched her back onto it, rubbing her tired muscles into the leather. Underneath the desk, Michael is watching his giant boss and occasional lover get very comfortable. Down in between her heels, his view is disrupted when the giant shoes shake around. He tries to run out of the heel's damage range but is knocked over as she kicked off her heels. A giant leather shoe flew off almost crushing Michael in a second. When he lifted himself back up, his heart beating fast with fear and arousal, he now saw Jan's huge nylon-covered feet under the desk, her humongous toes settling onto the rug.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
