They were a modern wave that would put the very old cards out of commission. Not to say some couldn't be used still though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to buy some of them to make a new deck. Perhaps even several new decks since you were a collector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had black hair and wore a long black biker jacket with green cargo pants and black shoes.

You had bumped into someone and both of you fell to the ground rubbing your heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh sorry about that, I wasn't watching where i was go- you were about to say but you were cut off by the sight of the girl you bumped into. She had to be the most beautiful girl you had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was a clean smooth brown that framed her face with bangs while the rest of it was tied into a ponytail held by a pink scrunchie. She wore a sleeveless yellow tank top that exposed her shoulders. 2 pairs of bracelets were on her wrists. She wore a cute pink miniskirt fastened by a white belt. She wore long black socks that went up to her thighs and pink platform sandals. <br>\r\n  As she was sitting her legs were bent upward and together. Man those legs were divine. Long and elegant, perfect for dancing and dishing out kicks. You wouldn't mind being kicked by this girl as weird as that sounds. And her chest. You didn't care much how big a girl's breasts were but she was impressive. All around she looked like a diva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat staring she said something.<br>\r\n\"Uh hey, you ok? I'm sorry I bumped into you\". Realizing you had been caught staring you snapped out of your trance. <br>\r\n\"Uh n-no it's my fault, I wasn't watching where i was going\" you said. Both of you got up. You could see that you were a little taller than this girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in a rush and didn't see you, sorry\" she apologized again. She was so cute when she was sorry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah its no problem\" you said. Noticing a card on the ground you said \"is that yours\" pointing to the card near her feet. It was a newer card, Berry magician girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's mine. Must have fallen out of my purse, thanks\" she said as she bent down to pick up the card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You duel?\" You said trying to start conversation. Thank goodness for that card falling out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm still a beginner but I want to learn\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tea by the way\" she said extending her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonus\" you said accepting her handshake. Her hands and skin felt so soft. You just wanted to hold them forever. Cursing yourself for letting perverted thoughts come into your mind you then said \"Well i hope you become a pro so we can duel\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha yeah I'd like that\" Tea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know someone who's really good at duel monsters though\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered who she meant. \"Really?\" you said in a curious tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you could even say he's the best\" she continued. You wondered who she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Leonus it was nice meeting you\" she said. \"I gotta head out back home\". You said \"Same to you, and alright, I'm heading towards the game shop\". \"Oh really? Gonna buy cards\" Tea asked. \"Yeah\" you said bluntly.  \"Well good luck with what cards you get\" she said. She walked ahead past you. Turning around you saw the orange glow of the setting sun. It was afternoon going to into evening as the sun was setting and the orange glow basked Tea's walking figure in its light. You weren't a pervert but you had to admit she had some nice round buns as her butt shook left and right against her skirt as her hips swayed and legs moved. Feeling a blush creep over you you cursed yourself for such actions and walked ahead to the game shop, hoping you will meet her again soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

Serenity yelled \"Look out!' but then you drew a card and played it. \"Come forth, Gil Garth.\" Just then the monster you summoned became real and the goons ran into it. As they fell to the ground you told them \"You have two choices; Either you leave this beautiful girl alone, or Gil Garth can force you to leave.\" The goons were smarter than they looked, as they ran away as fast as they could.

She was blushing bright red from that compliment. She asked you how you did those things. You told her that you were born with the power to make monsters become real as well as magic and trap cards. Shortly after you answered her she asked if you wanted to hang out. You knew that she wanted to get to know you better, so you accepted her offer. So the two of you got to know each other better when Serenity asked what your name was. \"My name is (Name).\" Shortly after her brother Joey and his friends showed up and asked who you were. Serenity explains everything and Joey says to you \"Thanks for saving my sister. What's your name?\" You introduced yourself to them and they did the same.

So the duel began. Serenity was amazed that you were sticking up for Joey. Then you made a bet with Kaiba.

Soon you were ready and went to pick up Serenity. When you arrived at the adress you rang the door bell. Joey answered the door and gave you a warning, keep her safe and sound. You told him that you would on your word as a duelist. He trusted you and shortly aafter that Serenity came down the stairs. She was extremely beautiful. She started to blush and asked if the two of you could go to the beach. Luckily you anticipated this and had some swim trunks on you. She also had a bikini with her. So the two of you went off on your date. You took Serenity to the movies where she wanted to see a romance film and you paid for everything with pleasure. Durning the movie Serenity leaned on your shoulder when it got the the romance scenes. When the movie was over, the two of you went down to the beach. The two of you went to the changing rooms and came out in your bathing suits.She looked HOT. After your time at the beach, the two of your wraped up your date with a trip to the park. It was around 8:00 P.M. There was a full moon out that night. What Serenity didn't notice was that you had a white rose behind your back.

Any damage we take in the duel, our bodies take as well.\" You then said to the duelist. \"I accept. LET'S DUEL!\" The two of you activated your duel disks and the duel began.</span></div></div>",

His life points havn't been touched, while your life points were down to 1200. You had Dark Armed Dragon, Mystical Beast of Serket, and Fortune Lady Earth on the field. Alexis was very worried about you. You saw this and said \"Don't worry Alexis. I have one card that can finish this.\" It was your turn and your last chance, but you drew the card you needed. \"I sacrifice my three beasts to bring forth my ultimate creature! Oh mighty protector of the sun and sky, I beg of thee, please heed my cry. Transform thyself from ball of light to bring me victory in this fight. With your appearance, grace our humble game. But first I shall call out thy name; Winged Dragon of Ra!\" Just then, Ra appeared from the sky and Alexis couldn't believe her eyes. The shado duelist had no face downs, and one monster. Ra's total attack points was 8000. \"I activate Ra's special ability, by giving 1000 of my life points, Ra can destroy all monsters on your field.\" Just then, your life points went to 200 and your body grew weaker. But you now had a clear shot. You gave Ra 100 more attack points by giving half of your life points. Your body was about to give up, but you attacked the shadow duelist directly and he was sent into the shadow realm. You won the duel, but you passed out right after your victory. Alexis ran up to you and caught you just before you hit the ground. She looked at you with amazment and wondered ho you controled the Winged Dragon of Ra. But she would worry about that later, She then dragged your body back into your room.</span></div></div>",

She gasped and embraced you with all her might. You began to rub her back and saw that you were in the medical room of the school. You noticed a bunch of other people were sitting around you as well. You sat up, but your side hurt from the duel you had. Alexis introduced the other people to you. Jaden Yuki, Zane and Syrus Truesdale, Chazz Princeton, Hassleberry, Addicus Rhodes, and Bastion. You greeted them and they did the same. Then Alexis asked how you controlled the Winded Dragon of Ra. You told her that one night you had a dream where you were riding on Ra's back and you saw the entire world. When you woke up, you saw a card glowing at the top of your deck, and that is how you obtained Ra. They believed you. You then wondered why that man came after you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The good news was that after years of studying and saving up to be able to be selected into the prestigious Duel Academy, you'd finally made it. Not only that, but you'd aced the entrance exam. Sorted directly into Obelisk Blue from day one. Well, your parents were very proud anyway. For you, the bad news was that the whole place seemed very daunting. Everyone around you was an expert duellist, while at home you were untouchable. It reminded you of your very first duel. Somehow you'd always had an excellent intuition for duelling that you couldn't explain - in fact your parents told you that you were duelling with the cards before you learnt to count. It just came so easily to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging your loud suitcase through the lavish corridors of Obelisk Blue, you soon found your room - which, honestly, seemed more like a palace to you. Mirrors, cool paintings - you even thought you caught a glimpse of the dining room. Such luxury and opulence as you'd only seen in movies. It was almost as cool as duelling, but you still felt very out of place. You were used to the grimy suburbs of your hometown, the turf you ruled with your uncanny knack for winning card games. Here you felt like you were just a novice, like a fish out of the water. Even your fresh blue uniform, though pretty cool-looking, felt awkward and uncomfortable compared to the torn shirts and jeans you were accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you set down your things in your new room and relaxed on your mammoth bed with your deck of cards. You were sure the bed was at least the size of your former house! You'd always dreamt of making lots of money in tournaments to help out your family... you guessed, perhaps, that this could be your break. You went over and over your cards, admiring your talent for always drawing the cards you needed from your deck. Although foreign and alien, at least you figured you were now among duellists who might be able to offer you a challenge again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, therefore, you shuffled your deck and headed out of your room, intending to make for the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch where you're going!\" said a cute blue-haired young girl, bumping into you. She was wearing a red vest, which was weird, but it suited her.<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry!\" you replied, collecting yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok, you must be new here. I'm Blair.\" said Blair, shaking your hand \"You must be pretty impressive if you made it all the way to Obelisk Blue from your entrance exam. Especially since you don't look much older than me.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess you could say that\" you replied shyly.<br>\r\n\"Come on - you've got to work on your ego\" joked Blair \"Everyone knows trash talking is half the battle! How about you and I have a duel, right now? I'd like to test you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uhm, right here in the corridor?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course! You can duel anywhere you like in this school.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's agreed - let's duel!\" yelled Blair \"While you get your cards shuffled, I think I'll start this show by summoning Shining Angel in face-up attack mode! I doubt you've got the skills to take down his 1400 attack points, but just in case, I'll set two cards face down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" you reply \"My move! I summon Rockstone Warrior in attack mode! Rockstone warrior has 1800 attack points - more than enough to take down your Warrior Lady of the Wasteland. Rockstone warrior, send her lady straight to the graveyard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad\" shrugged Blair as her life points went down to 3600 \"But that's what I wanted you to do! Shining Angel, activate your special ability now! When he's destroyed, I get to summon a light monster with 1500 attack points or less directly from my deck. I choose ... Maiden in Love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ... you swapped out your angel for an even weaker monster? Your maiden only has 400 attack points.\"<br>\r\n\"You sure have a lot to learn. Now it's my turn! I draw! First I activate my trap card, Defense Maiden! This prevents you from attacking any of my monsters except my Maiden in Love!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think I was planning to. Your maiden is looking pretty vulnerable there.\"<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure. Next I activate my other trap card, Magician's Defense! Let me explain. To use Magician's Defense, I need to control a spellcaster-type monster. Right now I have my Maiden in Love on the field. So long as I do, any battle damage I take is halved. But my Maiden won't be alone for long ... I summon The Unhappy Girl in face-up attack mode!\"<br>\r\n\"You have a thing for girls with 400 attack points, don't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Alright then, come on! Try attack me! I'll just set one more card face-down and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" you replied, drawing another card \"Rockstone warrior! Destroy her Maiden in Love!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I forgot to mention\" smirked Blair \"Maiden in Love has a special ability - she can't be destroyed as a result of battle while she's in attack mode. Don't forget about my magician's defense either, halving the damage I take from the battle. But that's not all! I activate my trap card, Enchanted Javelin! This increases my life points by your attacking monster's attack points. So although I lose 700 life points in battle damage, I gain 1800 life points, putting me on... 4700, right?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll just end my turn by setting one card face-down then\" you said, disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, stud, you've got to be good if you want to keep up with me!\" cheered Blair as she drew \"I equip my Unhappy Girl with this card - Cupid's Kiss! When I take battle damage from any battle involving The Unhappy Girl from a monster that has battled my Maiden in Love, I get to take control of that monster! Plus, did I mention that my Unhappy Girl can't be destroyed by battle while she's in face-up attack mode either?\"<br>\r\n\"So that means...\" you replied, worried.<br>\r\n\"That's right! Go my Unhappy Girl! Make his Rockstone Warrior fall in love with you!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" you cried as you watched Blair's life points go down to 4000 again, and your Rockstone Warrior marching off to her side of the field to stand beside her Unhappy Maiden.<br>\r\n\"Now, Rockstone Warrior and Maiden in Love! Attack his life points directly!\"<br>\r\n\"Argh!\" you cried in pain as your life points dropped to 1800.<br>\r\n\"One more turn and it's all over\" chuckled Blair \"You don't have enough life points to withstand one more attack from your Rockstone warrior. So I'll just put down one face-down card too and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're as good at duelling as you are cute!\" you said, impressed \"But now the time for playing around is finished! I activate the magic card - Dark Hole! Your monsters may be impervious to being destroyed by battle, but not card effects! All your monsters are destroyed!\"<br>\r\n\"Nooo!\" whined Blair as her monsters went into the graveyard.<br>\r\n\"Next I use another spell card, Call of the Mummy! Now I can special summon a zombie-type monster from my hand, so long as I have no monsters on the field. Since I have no monsters on the field, I use Call of the Mummy to summon Zombie Master from my hand!\"<br>\r\n\"Eww! Gross!\"<br>\r\n\"Zombie Master has 1800 attack points - ugly, but effective. Next, I remove my Rockstone Warrior from my graveyard to special summon The Rock Spirit from my hand! He's not a zombie monster, but his 1700 attack points are still an earth-shattering force! Finally, I normal summon my Immortal Ruler! He's a zombie too, with 1800 awesome attack points! Altogether, 1800 plus 1800 plus 1700 ... I think that comes to ... oh yeah, more than enough damage to take out your life points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go my monsters! Attack her life points now and end this duel!\"<br>\r\n\"I activate my face-down trap card, Negate Attack!\" yelled Blair \"Your battle phase ends now! I'm still in this duel!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think so! I chain my trap card, Seven Tools of the Bandit! By paying 1000 life points, I negate the activation of your trap card! It's all over!\" you replied while your life points dropped to 800.<br>\r\n\"Argh!\" she screamed as she fell backwards dramatically, giving you a great view of her panties, and her life points dropped to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" you said, offering your hand to help her up \"That was a really good duel.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow\" she replied as you helped her to her feet \"Yeah, you... you're incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment the two of you stared into each others eyes. She seemed different now that you'd beaten her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remind me of someone\" she said \"I've only met one duellist who's captivated me in quite this way before...\"<br>\r\n\"I've never met anyone like you\" you replied \"So beautiful ... and talented ... it's been years since I've been challenged like that.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? I'd have thought rock and zombie aren't exactly types that go together\" mused Blair \"I can see why they put you in Obelisk Blue.\"<br>\r\n\"Would you like to show me where I can find some dinner around here, maybe?\" you asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was finally over. You were a Ra Yellow at Duel Academy and were about to finish your first year. One day, word got out about a duel tournament being held in the abandoned coliseum on the far side of the island, with first place getting promised some rare prize. Everyone wanted to sign up with hopes of getting a rare card. Strangely though, only men were allowed to enter, leaving the female students miffed. You entered, got your spot and waited for it to start. The weird part was, from the start of the tournament until the very end, nobody had seen the host or even knew who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you had just crushed your last opponent in the finals with your ace, Ra (you think they chose your dorm based on that alone.), and were announced the champion. Then the MC approached you and said that the host wanted you to return to the field once everyone had left to recieve your prize. You thought this was strange but complied anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been 2 hours since you won, every last spectator had left and had been gone for a while. You were standing in the middle of the arena, waiting for this host to show. Just as you consider bailing, the gate opposite you opens. Now we're getting somewhere, that gate hadn't opened during the whole tournament, and now you know why, that's where the host was hiding. Out of the shadows steps a large woman, easily taller then you by a head. She was toned to hell, with every muscle looking like it could break you with a touch. It looks like she has some kind of claw mark over her eye. Her breasts looked like D-cups, but were just as firm looking as the rest of her. She wore what looked to be some kind of armor, with the chest leaving everything from her shoulders to the tops of her breasts exposed. The whole set was completed with a pair of combat boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome my new champion. I'm Tania, the host of this tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured, so what's my prize?\" You ask without trying to sound too disrespectful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So forward, so eager to get started. Mmmmmmm, nothing gets me going more then an assertive man who knows what he wants. Very well then, your prize is that you get to be my husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to take a double back and clear you ears to make sure you heard that right. \"What did you just say?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me lover boy. As the winner, you get the honor of being my husband, a very 'rare' prize indeed. You see, I want to marry the strongest man I can find, that led me to Duel Academy to find a potential suitor. I hosted this tournament to find the best.\" Now it all makes sense, the exclusive entrance requirements, the mystery host, the vague prize, it all adds up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I say 'no'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'd be a fool that turns down a body like <b>this</b>.\" She gestures to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got you there, you were really turned on by her, and you did just fight a whole tournament to win this. Plus you did prefer strong women over those girly girl types anyway. \"Alright Tania, I accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then let's duel to see who gets to be the dominant one in the relationship, then we'll get right to the honeymoon.\" She says with a wink. You both activate your duel disks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's duel.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the duel go?</span></div></div>",

Then Akiza started to blush and came out of her hiding place. \"Funny. Now we have both spied on eachother.\" She laughed at the fact that it was completely true. Soon th e rest oof the day went by when the two of you realised that the fortune cup was tomorrow. So the two of you got your decks ready. But then you pulled out a duel disk that looked like an ancient egyptian version of the duel disk. Soon the two of you went to bed with you on the couch again.</span></div></div>",

Then the man said \"My name is Roman and I bear the mark of the spider.\" Just then everyone gasped at the fact that the vision you all saw was the mark of the spider. He told you that he would leave them alone if you won in a duel. You accepted the terms and ran to your duel runner. Akiza came with you and the three of you went to the center of the satilite. Shortly after the duel began. But unknown to you, three of the kids were fallowing you. Soon Roman had the Spider Web feild spell activated. You knew that you were running out of time before he summons his Earthbound Immortal. But before he ended his turn he used a weak monster to attack you directly. The pain you felt was 100% real. Akiza asked if you were alright. You told her that you were ook and she was releaved. Hust then two of the kids were seen in the flame. Soon Roman summoned Earthbound Immortal Uru. As the kids were turning into light about to be absorbed by Uru, Yusei grabbed the kids and his mark protected them. Uru then attacked you directly but you used a trap card to prevent damage from Uru. But his attack hit a building where Martha was trying to save the thired kid with Trudge. Before Martha slipped she told you to take care of the kids and to also help the others. Then she turned into light and was absorbed by Uru. \"MARTHA! NOOO!\" you yelled. Then you said \"Roman, you're going to pay for that.\" Just then you dueled with everything you had. Soon you had Ra out on the field. You knew that you couldn't attack Uru so you attacked Roman directly. But instead of hitting Roman you hit one of Yusei's friends. But he was still standing. He then summoned Turbo Cannon and destroyed Uru, causing him to lose the duel.</span></div></div>",

There is nothing driving you but thrill, ambition, perhaps boredom?\" Sherry asked you. Then you asked her what drives her to turbo duel.

She then told you and Akiza her story and said to you \"If you race with me, you will find the drive you seek.\" But then, some kind of truck crashed into the duel lane. It was about to crush Sherry when Akiza called your Dark Armed Dragon to the feild and it caught the truck. But the duel had to be shut down. \"Sherry, you ok?\" you asked her.

You decided it was time to take things into your own hands. But the building began to shake as if an earthquake hit only this building. You had to act fast. You first went to the location where Sayer had the old geezer and the man named Tanner were locked up. <i>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</i> Tanner asked.<span class=\"cblue\"> \u201cMy name is Sasuke Uchiha. And you two are free. Go, get Leo and Luna out of here.\u201d</span> The two of them agreed and you told them where they were. But the building was shaking more violently than before. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI need to get Akiza out of here.\u201d</span> You ran through the halls as fast as you could and you soon found her dueling someone with a massive amount of dark energy coming from her. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAkiza!\u201d </span>you said running towards her. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cSasuke, you have to get out of here.

But up above, Sayer was facing a dark signer as well. There was no doubt this was what your visions warned you about. But not too long after that, Luna and the others showed up. You noticed this and said <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAll of you need to get out of here!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI am staying with Akiza.\u201d </span><span class=\"cred\">\u201cSasuke\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cOh how sweet.

Using your powers, you managed to get out of there before it was too late. You looked at Akiza and noticed she passed out. It was obvious that all of this was too much for her. You soon ran into Jack on his runner. <b><span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cSasuke, is Akiza alright?\u201d</span></b> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s just passed out.

Carly was staring at you with lust. You told her that it was time to find and destroy the other signers. But she told you to relax a little. You did as she asked and the two of you went home. You then noticed that Carly was staring at you with lust and she sat on the bed and asked you to sit next to her. You did what she asked and then she grabbed the back of your head and kissed you passionatly. You could feel her tongue poking at your lips.

I summon Earthbound Immortal Xalu.\" A giant crane came from the sky and  screeched at Yusei and Akiza. They were very scared of your Immortal, and who could blame them? \" Now I attack Yusei directly!\" Then Yusei's life points went down to zero. Leaving Akiza to fight for herself. \"Before I end my turn,\" you said \"I activate my Immortal's special ability. By seending it to the graveyard, Carly can summon a monster as long as it has Earthbound Immortal in its name. Carly.\" you said as you ended your turn. It was Carly's turn and she summoned Earthbound Immortal Aslla Piscu. A giant hummingbird rose from the ground and roared at Akiza.

I am not sure where he is. I just hope he is ok.\" \"Luna, your brother will be just fine. Believe me.\" Luna had tears fill her eyes and you wiped them away. She then leaned against your chest. You then held her in your arms to comfort her. Soon, the two of you had to call it a night and you both went home. But before Luna went inside, she kissed you on the lips and gave you a 30 second lip-lock. She winked at you and then went inside.

You asked her what it was.<br>\r\n\"This card,\" she said \"Is the reason why I'm after Yilliaster. My father took this card and now he is dead becasue of it. I've found a place that might  know what it is. Want to come with me?\"</span></div></div>",

You stared at her with lust and when Serry saw you were staring at her, she struted like it was a cat walk which made you clap and whistle making Sherry blush. You crawled over to her and sat at her feet like a loyal dog. Sherry petted you on the head. You rubbed your head against Sherry's leg and she got the neckband and leash and ptu them on you and she walked you like she was a master and you were her dog. When Sherry sat down she ordered you to lick her feet and you did. Then Sherry got up and brought out some rope and handcuffs and a rubber ball attached to some leather. She tied you up and hung you from the cieling and and put the rubber ball in your mouth and tied the leather around your head. Then she brought out a riding crop and beat you with it. The she brought out an electrocution machine with some jumper cables. You got scared but didn't show it. Sherry set it low enough that there wouldn't be any permanent damage but high enough that it could still deliver some pain. While you were being shocked Sherry put on some rubber gloves and reached down, pulled down your pants and gave you a hand job. The pain and the pleasure were so powerful that you came about a pint and passed out.</span></div></div>",

Then Itachi's monster appeared and he said \"I activate Loki's effect. By sending my hand to the graveyard, all monsters on your feild are destroyed and Loki's attack point increse by the attack points of your monsters.\" You and Sherry gasped at this. Loki had over 10,000 attack points. \"Now Loki, attack (name) directly.\" Just then Loki attacked you and your life points were gone and your body severly damaged. You could barely move when Itach rode up to you and said \"You're still too weak. You don't have enough hate (name). And you know something?

You saw three girls, each who were around your age, yet had assets belonging to someone older. One was a redhead with some rather big-for-her-age breasts. Another was a green-haired girl, who had an ass that was a bit too large for her miniskirt. Lastly was a silver-haired girl who had the front of her hair made to look like cat girls, and her lips were quite plump. You recognized them as girls from your class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" you asked frightened. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" the green-haired girl said, cupping your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're not gonna hurt you,\" the redhead said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We merely wanna make an offer,\" the silver-haired girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. You and I duel. If I win, you become our pet to do whatever we want with. If you lose, we become yours. Sound like a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it. Looking at them again, they did seem really cute. You pictured them naked with little collars around their necks. It turned you on immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you got your duel pad out and activated your Gazar. Cathy did the same while Anna and Tori got their gazars on. After the link was established, you turned your head to see Anna flashing her tits at you. Also Tori had her back turned, and was shaking her ass at you. You realized what they were trying to do, and turned your head to face Cathy, who had the front of her dress flipped up, revealing her lacy panties. Man, these girls really want you for a pet, but you won't let them get to you that easily.</span></div></div>",

You didn't know her, and, more importantly, you didn't know her deck. But the Photon Galaxy had never failed you before so why would it fail you now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy smirked as she drew her card with a flourish. \"My, what a gentleman. Too bad that politeness will be your undoing!\" She glanced down at her cards and picked one out. \"I activate the continuous spell Cat Meeting! This allows me to special summon a 'Cat' or 'Neko' monster from my hand whenever I normal summon one!\" She slid the card into a slot on her duel disk and a larger version of it appeared in front of her. She proceeded to take one of her other cards and slammed it onto her duel disk. \"Now I'll summon Stray Cat in Attack Mode! And due to Cat Meeting, I can special summon another Stray Cat in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo cats, one patterned white with black splotches and the other a mangy brown, appeared on her field, facing away from you. Their effects practically forced you out of attacking, but with only 100 ATK points each, they were about as threatening as a wet paper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy slid another card into her duel disk. \"I'll end my turn with a facedown! Your move, pet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drew your card, and gasped at your luck. <i>'Just the thing I nee for an OTK!'</i> You actually start laughing at your ridiculous luck, so much so that your 'companions' actually start complaining. \"Hey! What's so funny?!\" Cathy asks. You look up, a wicked smirk on your face. \"Oh, nothing really. Let's just say that your cats won't be the only pussies I'm gonna pound!\" You're certain that, had you made that joke to anyone else, you would've been smacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to end this duel, you grab the cards in your hand that you needed. \"First, since my field is empty, I can special summon Photon Thrasher directly from my hand!\" As the card touched your disk, a giant robot with a slight blue glow on its body appeared in front of you, wielding a giant sword. You continue, sliding a spell into your disk and slamming another monster onto the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I activate Photon Lead, letting me special summon a Level 4 or lower LIGHT-attribute monster from my hand! C'mon, Photon Crusher!\" A glowing lasso appeared on the field, looping itself around another card in your hand and pulling it to the field. Photon Crusher appeared in the ropes loop, an once the rope vanished, it swung its double-ended club in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy glared at your monsters. \"They look tough, but unfortunately for you, my Stray Cats' effects mean you can't attack!\" You smirk again. \"I'm not one yet!\" She gasps as you make another play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour monsters glow as you remove them from your duel disk. \"I sacrifice my two monsters in order to summon...\" Your monsters vanish in a flash of light, replaced by a large figure in blue and gold armor. \"Photon Caesar! And my Caesar has an effect! When he's normal summoned, I can special summon another Photon Caesar from my deck!\" The armored figure glowed white and split into two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard gasps and turned to your audience, having forgotten they existed. They both had their hands over their mouths, your impressive display having distracted them from distracting you. You laugh a bit. \"Impressive, right? An the fun still isn't over!\" They turn to you, the look in their eyes one of wonder. How could you possibly continue from an already strong opening move? Maybe like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab one of the last two cards in your hand, sliding it into your duel disk. \"Now I activate Photon Sanctuary! This spell summons two Photon Tokens to my field, but they're immediately leaving so I can summon my ace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo blue balls of electricity appeared on either side of your field, right before flying next to you and merging together. They grew and changed colors, turning into a large, red, vaguely trident shape. You grasp one of the three spikes and tug. Immediately, the shape begins spinning, a tornado kicking up from it. \"Born at the heart of a star with the power of a supernova! The monster who lights the path to victory! Come forth, Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!\" There was a blinding light, and an incredibly loud roar. When the light went down, standing in the center of your field was a giant blue dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help yourself. You began chuckling again. Cathy growled and yelled at you, something about how you still couldn't attack. You weren't listening. You were enjoying the moment. In one move, Cathy would be wide open, and then... Then, you four would have some REAL fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw your hand into the air dramatically. \"With these monsters, I build the Overlay Network! Xyz Summon!\" Your three monsters collapsed into balls of light. A giant space suddenly opened in the ceiling, raging like a black hole, that the orbs flew into. A giant red spear suddenly materialized in your hand, and you threw it into the black hole with all your might. The hole began rumbling as you began speaking again. \"Raised in the heart of the galaxy! A monster whose light burns away all impurities! Come forth, Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an explosion. On your field, where there was previously three monsters, was now one, massive, red dragon. It absolutely dwarfed everyone there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what to do next?</span></div></div>",

You pray for a miracle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I draw.\" Perfect. \"Looks like I've won Kat. I tribute your two Stray Cats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cats?\" She says stunned as her monster are released. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.

Once they had finished, you saw that Tori was wearing plain white underwear that hugged every curve of her ass, while Anna had pink panties with no bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are the collars master.\" 'Master', you could get used to that. You turn to face Kat. She had already stripped down to her black lace underwear, with a cat keyhole cut in between the cups of the bra and in the back of her panties. While her individual assests weren't as big as her friends', they were more balanced between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Kat, now all of you line up on your hands and knees.\" They obey and you click the collars on them. \"Now, what to do first.\"</span></div></div>",

It almost made you wish there were more moments like this, but then again if there was then it would make the moment less special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well I guess I'll start walking\" you sigh as you stand back up and causally slide your hands into your pockets. As you descend to hill side you spy that of a woman down the hill and it seemed like she was in distress. Naturally you rush to her aid and ask her what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've sprained my ankle\" she groans in pain, rubbing her ankle trying to sooth the pain. You examine the ankle and then ask the woman if she could walk on it but she shook her head. \"I'm sorry I must've sprained it while walking up hill. Sorry but you'll have to carry me\" the woman explains and you nod in response not hesitating for a moment. You crouch down and pick the woman up, being extra careful so that she didn't suffer any other harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly walk down the hill and after about a half hour you make it to the bottom of the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you live\" you ask the woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live a few blocks away, sorry for the trouble. I must be really heavy\" the woman apologizes sorrowfully. You quickly shake your head in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No its okay you\u2019re not heavy at all. I could carry across the entire city if I had to\" you boast ignoring the whole fact that your legs were feeling like jelly.

Hell I didn\u2019t even know what really happened until my sixteenth birthday. All I knew as that my mom died as a hero and that she saved as many as she could\u201d you explain finishing your story. You continue to walk forward, not speaking a word and neither did the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the mood changed for the better when you arrived at the woman\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the woman's house like?</span></div></div>",

The building before you was that of a large dance studio, there was a parking lot and everything. You could see some stain glass on the upper windows and you could even see inside if you looked hard enough. There was even a large sign up top which said \u201cGarden of Dance.\u201d Strange sigh but still it did catch your eye especially with all the colorful flowers painted on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s pretty big but I only live in the upper part of it. I teach dance classes all week long here. Guess you could say I live with my work\u201d the girl chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait so you must be the great T\u00e9a Gardner. My little sister once came here to learn how to dance. I think you didn\u2019t even charge anybody back then\u201d you say still a bit star struck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah back then I could give free lessons but now I have to charge everybody. Heh, you have to pay the bills somehow you know\u201d you both laugh as you walk towards the entrance of the building. You sat T\u00e9a down on a nearby bench and went to open the door, however it was locked. \u201cSilly me I forgot I locked it before I left\u201d she quickly reaches into her pocket and pulls out a key. You nod and she hands you the key and then you proceed to unlock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now all we have to do is get you to your room\u201d you say turning back to her as you walk back over to her ready to carry her again..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay there\u2019s an elevator on the first floor, so you don\u2019t have to carry me that far\u201d T\u00e9a explains and you mentally sigh. You were kind of glad that you didn\u2019t have to carry her up the stairs, after all your legs were noodles already. You didn\u2019t want to suddenly collapse and fall down the stairs. \u201cIs something wrong\u201d T\u00e9a asks snapping you out of your delusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah just thinking about something\u201d you explain scratching your head embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh about what\u201d T\u00e9a asked curiously?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-nothing\u201d you explained starting to blush which causes T\u00e9a to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are a ham\u201d T\u00e9a teases as she continues to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not! Let\u2019s just hurry up and get you into the elevator\u201d you growl turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh alright one last piggy back ride for the night\u201d T\u00e9a chuckles as you help her onto your back. You walk inside with little trouble, only stopping for a moment because you had to open the double doors. You walk inside to find the place relatively dark and eerie but since you didn\u2019t mind dark places like this you felt a little at home. It was then that you felt T\u00e9a\u2019s grip around you tighten a little bit around your chest. She seemed to be shaking a bit \u2018Was she afraid of the dark?\u2019 you wondered as you continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout five minutes later you had arrived at Tea\u2019s apartment and, after another few minutes of carrying Tea to her bedroom and running to fetch some bandages from the bathroom, you manage to wrap her wounded ankle. However just as you were about to leave Tea stops you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Tea pleads sounding a little desperate \u201c\u2026please don\u2019t go!\u201d You\u2026</span></div></div>",

You were the only person in the world to hold an Egyptian God Card in your deck. But you hardly ever had to use it. But about ten years ago, your clan was destroyed by a demon named Blackheart, who was an inhabitant of the Shadow Realm. You swore to get revenge against him no matter what. And with the help of your powers, you would do just that. One day, you were chasing Blackheart in your duel runner which was modeled after the Blue-Eyes White Dragon and were using your powers to try and send him off the bike. But no matter how hard you tried, you could not hit him. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Come on Sasuke, you will have to do much better than that.\"</span></b> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Shut up!\"</span> you said sending a massive lightning bolt his way. This time you sent it right in front of him, which sent both him and his runner off the road. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Now you're mine!\"</span> you said as you followed him off-road. You followed him down to the bottom of the ravine and you got off your runner. <span class=\"cblue\">\"It's time to end this.\"</span> you said walking towards him, creating the Chidori in your hand. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh, this is far from over.\"</span></b> <span class=\"cblue\">\"What?\"</span> you said as you stopped walking towards him. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Look!\"</span></b> he said as he created three portals that showed three diferent times. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"I have sent out my clones to duel four of the greatest female duelists in all of history. and when they are defeated, I will send them to the Shadow Realm!\"</span></b> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Blackheart! This is between you and me, leave them out of this!\"</span> <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh, I'm afraid I can't do that.\"</span></b> <span class=\"cblue\">\"And why is that?!\"</span> you said as you sent more power into your chidori. He began to laugh and said <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Because, I lured them all together so I can bring them to you!\"</span></b> he said as he snapped his fingers. You looked at the portals and the blackheart clones surrendered the duel and they created portals to your time as well. Each of them were sucked in by the force created by the portals. Two of them came flying towards you and you caught them both, even though it sent you sliding a bit. And two more came out on duel runners, who managed to hit the brakes just before they hit the wall. <span class=\"cyellow\">\"Whats going on?\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"One minute we are dueling some freak and the next we end up here.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"Listen, I can explain all of this later. Right now we have to deal with him.\"</span> you said looking at Blackheart. <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"Now now Sasuke, you and I will have our battle, but for now, I bid you farewell\"</span></b> he said as he got on his runner and rode ontop of the ocean waters. All four girls were extremely confused as to what just happened, and they figured that you were the guy to turn to. You helped two of them up and asked if they were alright. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Yeah, we're fine.\" </span><span class=\"crose\">\"Thanks for the save there.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"No problem. Now I know you all have questions, so you might want to follow me to my home.\"</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\"You seem to know what is going on, so we will go with you.\"</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\"You think you two can spare a ride for these two?\"</span> <span class=\"cred\">\"Sure. Hop on.\"</span> Two of them got on the other runners and you led them to a path that led them back to your home.</span></div></div>",
