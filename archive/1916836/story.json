One was a blonde in a white tang-<br>\r\n<br>\r\ntop and was see through, luckily she was wearing a black bra, and the other was a brunette wearing just a bra. Both were extremely sexy and both of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthem had a grade a chest. The two rambled on about something on how all the males are gone. Nick thought to himself \"What is this I'm a guy and I've <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnot dissapeared!\". Nick decided to call the news station. \"Hello? Yes. What rubbish is this that all the males re gone! I'm a male and I'm still here!\" \"Sir we <br>\r\n<br>\r\nare not making this up there are no more males in the world, look for yourself and lady please don't try to prank us again\" \"Wait I'm not kidding I'll prove to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou that I am a man here's my address 1234 Street, come down and I'll prove to you that I'm a male and your lying\" \"Okay 'sir' We'll be there soon\" Nick <br>\r\n<br>\r\nturned off the tv and got ready for the news people to come. *Ding Dong* \"Wow that was fast!\" Nick opened the door and saw the to women from the tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my this is a male!

He woke up one day and it was just that way; every single other guy on the face of the Earth has simply disappeared!  Not that that is a bad thing... All the women are left you see, and they have only James.  The girl you had a crush on in high school?  She has to fall for only you now.  The bitch at your work?  You could get all kinky with her, and she would have to take it if she wants a man.  The absolute wet dream of a women that teases you on the bus?  She will come crawling and begging to you every night just to be satisfied.  Isn't life good for James?</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBase rules:<br>\r\n1.  Obviously this is all M-F, but F-F is fine by me.<br>\r\n2.  The story doesn't have to be all about sex, but it very well can be.  Relationships are ok to have.<br>\r\n3.  There are some weird forces going on here, add a sexual deity if you want *hint*<br>\r\n4.  Along with that, expansion of all kind (basically) is welcomed, please.<br>\r\n5.  I hold right to change anything I deem necessary, probably won't though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo for whatever your heart desires.  Honestly, have fun.</td>",
