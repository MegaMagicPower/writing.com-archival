Too bad he didn't get paid a whole heck of a lot, but he supposed it was enough to at least put a roof over his head. Walking up to his apartment he was surprised to find something curious just outside the building. One was a strange looking car, the other was a man standing in front of what looked like a Police Box. As he walked by the stranger spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a Jelly baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Jelly baby,\" the stranger held up an open bag. Oliver's Mom always warned him about taking stuff from strangers, but there was something about the man. Shrugging he took one from the Bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're really good aren't they?\" the man mused.\"Great for increasing energy and health. Why don't you take the whole bag? I can always get more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Who are you, if you don't mind me asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm The Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying another word the stranger with the scarf stepped into the Police Box. Shrugging Oliver walked up the steps of his apartment and was inside before he could notice the Police Box disappear. Stepping into his apartment he checked his phone messages, ate and checked his email.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in another Reality, on another dimensional plane, on the planet Mobius, Miles \"Tails\" Power was busy finishing his latest invention. It was finally ready. After countless hours of research, development, and hard work the Matter Transmitter was completed. Tails looked at his invention with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything should be hooked up; the generator is at full power, the capacitor is charged, the coordinates are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic!\"Snapped Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but come on! Let's do this already! I wanna see if you managed to make something faster than me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been in the making for 4 months now;\" said Sally \"I think we can wait another minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" We can't rush this;\" Explained Tails \"We need to make sure everything is right! Who knows what can go wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you have me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Voice had come from NICOLE, Sally's personal handheld Computer, which Sally held upright toward a bank of computers.\"I'll be overseeing the progress as it executes; I'll be able to detect any faults and immediately stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well; everything looks ready on my end;\" Tails Finally said. \"Sally, why don't you go ahead and connect NICOLE to the console over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally walked over a work table. Setting NICOLE down, she plugged in a cable, the other end of it plugged into the computer banks.\" How does it look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little computer was silent for a moment.\" All systems operational; awaiting start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my queue.\" said Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Oliver felt was a sudden tingling sensation all over his body as though he were touching a static ball. Then came a high pitch sound that seemed to be coming from nowhere and everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Hap--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, Oliver watched in awe his apartment disappeared around him. He found himself in darkness, partials of energy swirled all round him. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Where while Oliver re-appear?*</span></div></div>",

It wasn't there a second ago. I'm getting more data now...It's a life form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you send it back where it came from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally, I don't even know yet where it came from. One thing's for sure If I have to bring in whatever it is in or it's pattern will degrade and it'll die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should let it die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked over at Sonic, not quite believing what she heard \"Sonic, we can just Kill whatever it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be a threat bigger than Egg Man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again it might not. I'm willing to take the risk. Tails, bring it in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails worked the consol sending commands to the Teleporter. Tails hadn't counted on materializing anyone in this phase of testing. The pattern caught in the matter stream was immediately sent through the pattern buffer. It was an incredibly slow process. He estimated the atomized life form would be in the pattern buffer a full sixty seconds before the rematerilization process began. Something he hoped to speed up as he made improvements to the unit. The Teleportation pad began to glow finally and a swirl of energy began to take shape. It was small, Very small, and shaped like an overlander (the comic name for Human). A moment past and the shape began to solidify and they could make out his clothing, and skin texture. </span></div></div>",

Whatever it was the thing was the length and height of two whole football fields combined! He could actually run across the thing and it would take him possibly two whole days to make it to the other side there was also a enormous flower pot on the table with a fresh bunch of flowers he had no idea what kind they were freshly watered and a coaster for glasses plus a picture one look and Oliver instantly knew where he was \"What th- hold up that is Sonic the Hedgehog,the video game character from Sega Genesis? But it can't be....\" But no doubt it certainly was there was no doubting the blue spiky hair and body and red super fast sneakers he was surrounded by a few other animal characters Oliver recognized Tails,the two-tailed fox Sonic's best friend and kid brother so to speak but the others...there was a purple walrus with a green baseball cap and a weird fox like thing in some type of palace guard's uniform looking smug,a squirrel with bright red hair in a blue vest and a girl rabbit whose legs and lower body was covered in parts of a metallic form \"Tails I have no trouble recognizing but who are these other guys?\" Oliver thought wildly as he was only familiar with the video games characters like Amy Rose,Knuckles and Cream the Rabbit he knew instantly but these people he didn't know who any of them were and so he took a closer look at his enormous surroundings everything looked primitive yet there was a computer in the far right corner of the room as he stood there pondering this the door at the left right suddenly opened up and the squirrel with the red hair and blue vest came walking in but fortunately she was too busy looking at a palm hand computer and speaking into it to take any notice of the tiny person on her table a few feet away \"Nicole please is the process ready yet?' As she took a seat in a wooden chair just a mere two feet from where Oliver was trying to hide behind the giant flower pot NICOLE was uttering a response in a female HAL computerized voice he couldn't quite make out but it didn't matter as long as he stayed hidden he thought \"She won't be able to see me I'll just have to wait until she falls asleep or something....\" But it seemed this squirrel girl whom Oliver soon learned was named Princess Sally Acorn was either stuck to her seat or else she was too engrossed in whatever she was doing with her handheld computer thing NICOLE she sat there for hours on end not even moving typing away or speaking into the device and Oliver's right foot began to fall asleep he couldn't stand it \"Darn it doesn't this squirrel ever sleep or do anything else?\" He needed to move now as his foot was killing him so taking a dare he slowly began to inch away from the pot while keeping a watchful eye on the giant Sally in front of him in case her blue eyes darted towards him inch by inch he made his way from the flower pot until he was sure he could make a run for it behind the picture frame at least until he could plan his next move as Sally put up her computer and announced to herself how tired she was as she sought to get up and head to bed </span></div></div>",

No question about it. it was the way he was seeing it that had him in awe. Everything with the exception of the floor was made of fabric  that looked to be woven out of one inch thick nylon rope. The  floor looked to be made of foam padding and it wasn't even. There were huge indentations in the floor, as something heavy with a round-ish surface had been pressed into it. And inside the indentations the color of the material was darker, almost blackened. Exactly as though it had been made bay a Giant foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver had just come to that conclusion when he felt the ground shake. But the tremors that shook the ground and were growing stronger in intensity were not random. They were in a pattern, exactly like the pattern of footsteps.

How did I shrink?! O.M.G, I was in Rouge's boots?! OH GOD NO!!\" Soon, you escaped quickly and fell on the floor and ran behind a silky bed on it's pegs. Then, Rouge said as she turned her head alarmed,  \"Hmm. I thought I heard something....oh well.\" Then Oliver thought, \"OH SHIT I FORGOT! She's a bat so she has super hearing! I'm screwed!\" But, you also realized that Rouge was in a lavender bikini as you looked at her. \"You know, I feel like wearing a bikini for the day.

There was a cool breeze and the smell of  damp soil in the air. When he felt his strength return he opened his eyes to total darkness. Was he blind? No, he was certain he wasn't. Fumbling for his keys he turned on the little LED Light he had on his Key chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white light illuminated a tunnel that was clearly not made by man. One end of the tunnel ended in blackness as did the other. The smartest thing he'd been taught was to stay in one spot when lost, but anyplace would be preferable to where he was now. Thoughts of the Movie Tremors came to mind, and he didn't want to meet up with any Graboids. Stepping over his Vomit Oliver walked forward, his body wracked with shivers from whatever the hell had happened to him. How the hell did he get here anyway? And where the Hell was here? He stumbled down the length of the tunnel, it seemed to go on forever. At one point he was walking down and then he was looking up, then he was walking right and then left. He fought back the feeling of claustrophobia and the fear that he may never get out of the tunnel, that his little light would suddenly die and he'd be trapped in the disorienting Blackness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, to his relief, he walked out into a large empty chamber. There was a source of light coming from above. The ceiling of the Chamber looked to be made, to Oliver's astonishment, Enormous Wooden Planks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I gotta get up there' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking about the Chamber he saw that it was a crater of sorts and he was at the bottom of it. The lip of the crater reached up to a crack between two planks. Not wanting to stay in that spot any longer than need be, Oliver climbed upwards. Jumping up to grab the edge of the plank he lifted himself up into the world above. And what a world he was. As unbelievable as the situation already was, he found himself in an enormous---</span></div></div>",

SHE'S NOT WEARING ANYTHING?!!\" yelled Oliver. He tried to escape but a tiny fold of the couch stopped his plans and he tripped and fell. \"Oh god no....\" he looked and Amy's ass and it came down on him hard. From what Oliver realized, he is in the middle of Amy Rose's ass crack. \"Oh no. I hope Amy can feel me....\" he moved around, trying to get her attention but, Amy took it like it was an itch or a small object that's on the couch and she didn't know it and got irritated.<br>\r\n\"Ugh,mmm...what's on my ass? I feels like something small...maybe a tiny figurine? You know? I'm going to do what I always do when I find something small near my ass or pussy...put it inside me and let it stay there!\" said Amy as she tries to grind her big ass to get rid of any feeling that is small (What I meant of feel YOU. I mean like if you or anything that can move around is with her, she won't want that feeling as she would try to get rid of you/or said thing.) then, Amy uses her left gloved hand as she lifted her ass a tiny bit and dug to where it was bothering her and as Oliver saw her huge hand at first he was relived that she may had found him but, was turning into terror as it wasn't going to pull him out, but it was pushing him up CLOSER to her asshole! (I had to find multiple pictures of his comic at g.e-hentai.org (yes THAT type of comic) in order to get the text situation right . The comic is still not done though. Apparently I discovered that when she sat down, her asshole was CLEARLY right above Oliver as he is in between her asshole and pussy [the sitting down part is not related to comic].) Oliver screamed for his life as Amy used her left gloved finger by pushing him into her asshole (by the end of this chapter I'm going to show you guys another angle in the comic). \"NO AMY DON'T!!\"  screamed Oliver.Then he was fully inside her.<br>\r\n   *Sigh* \"Finally, that was over with with small thing. I wonder where my panties went before I left in a hurry? Because I couldn't get to them in time as my darling Sonic went past my house early, so I had a quick idea as I stayed naked below my waist so I can get his \"attention\" *giggles* but THAT didn't work because he was way ahead me with his speed and my ass was BEHIND me...ooh...this is what I get if I don't eat any breakfast, my brain won't work. It will only get desperate.\" So Amy went on to find her panties so she can put them on and then eat her forgotten breakfast. So....how was OLIVER doing....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(like I promised: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://g.e-hentai.org/s/f7f078be8d/657538-4\" target=\"_blank\">http://g.e-hentai.org/s/f7f078be8d/65753...</a>)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But then, he looks around seeing the fleshy walls of Amy having it's own shine by the light of her innards from her fur and skin. \"Whoa, the walls.. they're...so shiny.\" Oliver then felt the walls and they were smooth as silky hair. \"Wow...\" said the awed Oliver. Then he had an idea, \"I'm going to test that theory that Amy just said. *pfft* Objects in her ass, yeah right.\" Then, the first thing he saw, was the one that astonished him and that was a model figurine of Modern Sonic doing the \"Sonic the Hedgehog 1\" pose. \"WHAT...THE.....HELL???\" said Oliver silently, then he saw more and more objects crowding the walls of Amy's colon but left a hole in the middle for some things to drop or enter. Oliver climbed and climbed until he saw a device and saw a logo of two tails. \"Hey... this thing is made by Tails!\" and he read the name: \"Feces Teleporter\" and then he had the idea of what the device can do and became disgusted.<br>\r\n   Then, Oliver felt the place shake a little and he climbed down from \"Tiny Toy Mountain Cave\" and what he saw made his jaw drop. It was Amy's two fingers poking inside her rectum! \"What the hell is GOING ON?!\" yelled Oliver. Then, Amy's gloved fingers slid up and down, over and over again repeatedly and going faster and then, Oliver had the idea of what's going on as the place shook violently. \"Amy is...fucking her own ASS?!\" As we go back outside, we see Amy lying on the couch with her head on a pillow and her ass up in the air with her knees on the cushions and her left hand is stretching her left asscheek and her right hand using two fingers fucking it. \"OOOHHH!! I don't want to do this but it feels SO GOOOD!!\" yelled Amy. Let's go back before it happened.<br>\r\n    After the events of Oliver entering Amy's ass, Amy went ahead to look for her forgotten panties, and she found out that, she knows that she was suppose to put her panties right where she stands every time she wakes up in the morning. She had found her panties and it was under her bed and she said \"Oh, so THAT'S where it was!\" she picked it up and slid it up, so it can hug her butt again. Then, she went on to eat her forgotten breakfast and it was a quick bowl of cereal. As soon as she finished she went to watch T.V. to forget about Sonic for the day on her couch. But then, as she was watching she started to become nervous and then started to sweat and then, she started to tap on her leg. Now, Amy had started to close her eyes and bit her lip and as she had done that, Amy's right hand moved by itself to the back of her panties and had poked her own asshole from the outside of the panties and Amy gasped each time her right gloved hand poked her own asshole. *gasp* *gasp* *gasp* \"Mmmmmm...\" So, she went into the position she is in currently and kept poking it and finally she said \"Ahhh! I can't take it anymore! I didn't want to, but I NEED it!\" and she slid out of her newly found panties and here we are now....again.<br>\r\n     Oliver kept on falling over and over again each time Amy's fingers kept on going up and down with each slide going on inside her rectum. \" I have to try to get out of here...\" said Oliver but then he had an idea and it wasn't by getting out of her ass (because it's already occupied), it was by going deeper. So, where did he make it in?</span></div></div>",

And what's your name?\" \"First, I don't know how but, I started out like this when I got here on your couch. Second, what does that mean? I bet that means \"human\" and you never saw one before? Wow, talk about luck. Also, my name is Oliver, what's yours? *I'm going to play along because I played the Sonic games and I already know who she is*\" said Oliver. \"No, I haven't at all and yeah, your right. My name is Amy; Amy Rose\" *smiles*<br>\r\n     Amy then spoke, \"Sorry that I almost crushed you with my butt. Lucky for you that I turned around as I tried to look for the T.V. remote.\" then Oliver asked \"Yeah...good thing that you mentioned that because before when I was going cower in fear that I was going to die, I noticed that you weren't wearing any panties at all WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!\" \"You SAW that?! oohh...I'm soooo embarrassed....\" said Amy as she blushes in shame, \"Just tell me why did you go pantie-less but you kept your skirt on.\" said Oliver \"Well, as I woke up I felt like it was the day that I am going to catch my future boyfriend/husband Sonic; my hero; and just as I put on my skirt, I heard a boom sound and as I looked out my window, it was Sonic leaving a fast blue streak past my house early and I knew there was no time to waste so I left without my panties and because as well, I remembered my other ones was in the laundry drying and I couldn't find a new fresh pair as I forgot where I placed it as I did set it up yesterday for when I wake up today and to get dressed and during that I thought of an \"idea\" to get Sonic's \"attention\" and I knew it would be my body. So I left without eating breakfast and as I caught up, he made the sonic boost and left without a trace and I realized how my idea was MAJORLY flawed and it was that my butt was BEHIND me and Sonic is faster than me and ahead of me, so he couldn't see it. So, I went back here sad and here we are right now.\" explained Amy \"Huh. So, that's how.\" said Oliver.<br>\r\n       \"So Oliver, how was your life before you got here?\" asked Amy, Oliver frowned and facepalmed in disappointment \"Ugh, you have NO idea. My life is so boring. Everyday is the same thing, wake up, shower, eat breakfast, go to work, go home, check my computer, watch T.V., eat dinner, go to sleep, repeat. I was begging everyday for something EXCITING or cool to happen in my life! Also, I don't even have girlfriend or even friends or A friend. Since I'm here, I don't even have a home anymore.\" said Oliver *light gasp* \"Oh, you poor thing...\" said Amy \"Um....you know Oliver, I wanna tell you something that I never told ANY of my friends about, not even my little best friend Cream the Rabbit.\" Amy then had Oliver's full attention \"I am a \"stuffer\" which means I like to stuff or put things inside my own body but it can only be small things, like a plastic figurine and it couldn't be helped.\" said Amy \"Like, if a small thing is right in front of my pussy, I put inside my pussy until it goes inside my cervix and I get a jolt of pleasure out of it. Another thing is that, when I'm sitting on something small I would stuff it deep into my asshole and plus one time I didn't tell my friend Tails about that problem but I asked for a tiny machine for my colon to send my remains to be already in my \"office\" in the bathroom. Also even if I'm itchy or not I might masturbate to either my ass or my pussy or both whether I like it or not. On other times if something small is in front of my big boobs and I don't OWN it, I put it inside deep in my tits within my breasts too. It's like I'm a locker for objects or something and to me it's either a blessing or a curse to me.\" finished Amy, \"Whoa that IS a dilemma.\" responded Oliver. \"You know, since you have nowhere to live, how about you live with me?\" asked Amy. \"Whoa really?! *HOLY CRAP! NOW I CAN HAVE ADVENTURES WITH THE SONIC CREW?! NOW MY LIFE ISN'T SO BORING NOW!* Wow thanks Amy! Now you made my not so dull after all these years!\" said Oliver, \"You know, I'm going to put my problem into GOOD use as I'm going to let you live INSIDE my body!\" responded Amy \"What?! Wouldn't that like kill me?!\" said the scared Oliver, \"No it won't because, the last time I went to the doctor, the nurse said that from the X-Ray and body scan, the inside of my body is breathable for example, naturally if something living is inside me and it's not cells they would die easily but since my body is so special, a little living thing would live in me and stay alive and plus my body has clean air and safe to walk in and by the walking thing, it is only if you were in my boobs and my milk would be safe to swim and drink with!\" smiled Amy, \"Coooool.....\" said Oliver in awe.<br>\r\n      \"So, I'm going to let you choose and it's going to be either my ass, pussy, boobs or my mouth with the stomach included and the acids would only digest non living food not living things.\" said Amy. So Oliver chose.....</span></div></div>",

Then, Amy smiles as she opens her mouth and takes out her tongue and uses it like a platform once Amy placed her head on the table. Oliver took one step on her tongue and it was soft like any other and as he took three more steps, Amy moved her head and wrapped Oliver with her pink tongue and Oliver enters his new home as Amy closes her big mouth and as Oliver got back up, he is now covered with saliva. \"Ugh, gross! Damn it Amy!\" said Oliver \"Sorry...\" said Amy's voice but then, Oliver noticed something and it was that Amy talked but her mouth or in this scenario, her teeth didn't move at all! \"Wait. How did you talk without moving your own mouth?!\" asked Oliver questioningly. \"Oh yeah! I forgot to tell you that, I can talk without doing that so I can communicate with you, Oliver. Also that, it's the only way that someone won't think I'm crazy when I'm moving my mouth trying to talking to you. I can only talk with people with my mouth if someone that is the same size like me is speaking to me. \" (XU3: SO IT'S BOTH THEN!) Oliver then said, \"Whoa, that's awesome!\" Oliver looked around and everything was dimly lit and some saliva dripped down from the roof of Amy's mouth and teeth but, her tongue was almost full of it. \"Wow Amy, your mouth is so beautiful.\" said Oliver. \"Awww, thanks!\" responded Amy \"Oh! and Oliver, if I'm talking to you, go look up at the back of my mouth and you will see my uvula moving by my control and plus I won't throw up doing it! I would only throw up if someone and even me TOUCHES it hard. I'll show you. Look up.\" Oliver looked up at Amy's uvula and it started to move while she is talking. \"See! I told you.\" *giggles* \"Whoa...\" awed Oliver. <br>\r\n        \"So, get used to your surroundings Oliver, because you are going to in there for a long time! Oh! I almost forgot about something! Hey, Oliver? Can you come closer to the near edge to my throat?\" said Amy. \"Ok, sure\" replied Oliver as he walked. He looked over and noticed that her throat is closed but, he saw the entrance to Amy's lungs. \"What? Your throat is closed!\" said Oliver. \"Yep! and it would be a way for you to enter my stomach. Which is another place you can live in like my mouth and you can go in and out of my stomach whenever you want. Just pound my stomach walls like it's a door and I would go lie down on the floor on my belly and I will let you go back to my mouth via my throat.\" said Amy. \"Okay!\" said Oliver and he lied down on her tongue. Then, Amy said something, \"Hey, Oliver. I'm going out for lunch, okay? I'm going to give you some too.\" said Amy nicely, \"Ok, Amy.\" replied Oliver. As Amy with Oliver in her mouth went out, she bought pizza in the nearest shop for 20 Rings. When they both returned, Amy took the one slice of pizza and puts it in her mouth, but she stops for a second for Oliver to take a piece of it and then hid away so Amy can eat her GIANT (to Oliver) slice. The pizza was being chewed throughout and as it was mush, Oliver rushed out of her teeth after he ate his and landed on her tongue and saw the once sliced piece of pizza into a mushed ball swallowed by Amy esophagus muscles and closed up again. \"Whoa...\" said Oliver silently. <br>\r\n            What happens now?<br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

Amy opened her mouth and her tongue came out again and, Oliver stepped on it and Amy pulled him back in and closed and stood up to go take a shower with a bath. \"Maybe I should give Oliver a little \"gift\" for keeping me company...*giggle*\" thought Amy. Once Amy stripped out of her iconic red skirt as her boobs bounced freely and her even MORE iconic panties and her ass jiggled, (come on who saw/played Sonic Adventure 1?) she opened the glass door that leads to the bathroom and turned on the water and placed her towel on a table and walked into the shower and perfect warm water was coming down fast on her sexy body. Then, she speaks to Oliver in her mouth and said \"Hey Oliver, can you come out on my hand I want to show you something....\" said Amy in an innocent voice. \"Okay, sure.\" responded Oliver. As Amy's mouth opened a little, Oliver landed on her hand and said \"Ok Amy. What do you want to show me?\" but as well he said that thousands of water drops fell on him. \"Wait. I'm in the shower?!\" thought Oliver as he looked around. \"Yep, and I want to give you, Oliver, a gift for keeping me company. What is it, you may ask? A little show.\" said Amy. Then, Amy places Oliver on a shower shelf that is in front of her belly, under the shower-head and Amy bends down to show Oliver as she rubs her big boobs and moves her left hand to her left tit. \"Mmmm...\" moaned Amy, \"you like what you see, Oliver..*breathes in pleasure*\" Oliver stood and stared there like a kid who played video games for too long as he watched Amy wet with water and being sexy and aroused. \"Well let me show you more...\" says Amy.<br>\r\n   Amy turned around and shows the ass that nearly crushed him and the same ass of how the both of them met. Then, Amy says \"Hope you like the view!\" Then, as she holds her left hand on her chest and uses her right hand (they are still gloved with the bracelets) to finger her asshole and she was loving it. \"Mmmm, mmmm, oh so good! mmmm....!\" Then, she goes for 2, to 3 and now, stuffs her whole hand inside her ass. \"OOOHHHH....IT'S FULLY INSIDE! OOHHH!\" luckily for Amy that she had made another table for her other shampoo/conditioner products behind/in front of her and she laid her head on it and kept on moaning in pleasure. \"This feels SOOOOO GOOOD! *breathes in pleasure* you like it Oliver?\" said Amy and with one final push of her arm, Amy moaned in ecstasy and takes her hand out of her ass. \"So *breathes* did you like the show..?\" asked Amy. Oliver came back to normal and said \"Whoa....that was....AMAZING....!\" *giggles* \"Glad you loved it.\" Amy then proceeds to wash her quills/hair, and her boobs and her nether-regions but she had a little bit of fun by rimming her asshole and gave her ass a little slap. She then, turned off the water and puts Oliver back in her mouth.</span></div></div>",

In Amy mouth, Oliver was just thinking over on what he just saw in the shower and he was astonished. Back outside, Amy prepares her relaxation bath with warm water and puts some bubble beads in the water and bubbles floated everywhere. Amy smiles and gets in the water and sighs in bliss. Then she had an idea but, before she could talk to Oliver she saw a forgotten figurine of herself when she was young (Classic Amy) that she made. She used to use that figurine with a Classic Sonic figurine and pretend that they are going to be the marriage of the century. But, since she is mature now she would like to forget the old her but, love the new but, she will like to remember it so, she picked it up, lifts her pussy up in the air and then stuffs the figurine deep in her pussy where she puts all the other stuff she found just like what she said earlier and also in other places as well. \"Mmmmmm....\" thought Amy. *Sigh* \"that's done.\" thought Amy again. As she finished her thought, she felt something on her ass, Amy picked it up and it revealed a bar of soap and it's size was smaller than her entire hand (not tiny but just look at the Rule 34 pic and you will know what I mean) and as she saw it, Amy wants to test how much her body CAN hold so, she stands up bends forward so she can choose what hole it should go to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one is it?

As she stopped, she went back down and she remembered that she had an idea for Oliver and she called out to him as he was still pondering in her mouth. \"Hey, Oliver?\" said Amy by using her uvula, \"Yeah?\" spoke Oliver \"I want ask you something.\" said Amy, \"Shoot.\" replied Oliver, \"Wanna swim in the tub and relax with me?\" said the pink hedgehog, \"Sure.\" finished Oliver. When Oliver walked past her teeth and through her lips, he landed on her hand and Amy slowly placed him in the water. Then, they both had fun in the tub but, Amy had ANOTHER idea and said \"Hey Oliver, want to go on a exploration adventure?\" asked Amy, \"Hell yeah, I would!\" said the excited Oliver. \"Ok, how about this? You can go into my pussy like it's an underwater adventure to a secret cave or have an adventure in my ass like it'a a cave and see what secrets it holds ok?
