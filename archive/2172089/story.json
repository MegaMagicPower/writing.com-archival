It all came flooding back to her, she'd reached out to grab that damn stolen trinket that these religious freaks were pouring some kind of unknown chakra into. Then the stupid thing blew up in her face and sent her flying back through a wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely though, she felt totally fine!

We didn't know what to do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you she'd be mad, dope.\" Sasuke scoffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was too focused on Sakura approaching him with killing intent to retort...wait...was she getting bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura cracked her knuckles menacingly, she felt pretty good right now...almost like she could take over the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait...are you getting bigger, Sakura?\" Naruto asked...unfortunately the pinkette took it VERY wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Sakura roared, thinking this blond idiot was making some crude comment about her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke's eyes widened as for some reason Sakura seemed to be towering over Naruto. He wasn't sure if it was a trick of the light...but he wasn't going to interrupt a good beatdown of the dopey blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No that's not what I meant!\" Naruto wailed as Sakura was looking....</span></div></div>",

Sasuke's eyes widened as he noticed the pinkette was steadily increasing in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'tattoo' on Sakura's forehead seemed to glow as the girl declared in a strangely booming voice: \"I want to test how strong I am now...and you both are going to help me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are?\" Sasuke and Naruto asked together with a glance at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?

Naruto was also quick to run his mouth, \"ARE YOU CRAZY, SAKURA?! YOU COULD'VE KILLED US!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura growled as she clenched her fist, \"Shut up little runt! Start fighting back!\" Sakura sure seemed to be getting full of herself. This was evident as she reared her fist back and sent it flying towards a panicking Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOVE YOU IDIOT!\" Sasuke yelled, throwing kunai at the now 30 ft woman...which incredibly bounced off of her skin! \"What the heck?\" Sasuke said in astonishment as the fist slammed into Naruto and tore through the stone floor like butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That oughta shut you up, loser!\" Sakura smirked proudly...until the dust cleared and quite the opposite happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT, LET'S GET HER!

Among them was the option of just surrendering to the girl's will...she might be more gentle with them. Of course, the girl never was fond of Naruto...but she had an obvious crush on Sasuke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Maybe I can use that to my advantage..\"</i> The Uchiha thought, cringing at the stench all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings only got worse as Sakura made it outside, the hot sun shone down upon her and as she was still walking...her feet began to sweat and of course begin to bake her prisoners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village nearby began to suffer strange quakes, the denizens of the small town began to fear it was some sort of wrath called down from the gods. Perhaps those ninja kids failed to stop the ritual? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" One of the villagers cried out and pointed, everyone of course looking in that direction. They gasped as they saw the pink haired girl from earlier....stomping towards them...only GIGANTIC! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smugly grinning girl stopped just within the borders of the town, she crossed her arms and addressed them: \"You won't have to worry about that weirdo cult anymore! We took care of it....or more to the point...I DID.\" She haughtily declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the villagers' response was immediate...they began shouting and yelling at the giantess about how she had been 'cursed' and now was a 'goddess' and touched by 'unholy power.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura scowled and rolled her eyes, \"You guys sure are a bunch of superstitious babies. Goddess, huh? Yeah, I already knew that...duh. So why don't you show some appreciation for your GODDESS who just saved your butts?\" Lifting a sandalled foot, of course the one that held the annoying Naruto within, she stomped down and shook the entire village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want some appreciation...NOW.\" Sakura demanded darkly.</span></div></div>",

She had charged at Vegeta, ready to deliver a crushing blow but the Saiyan without much difficulty, intercepted the move and hurled her down to the ground. Then with a barrage of ki blasts and a final taunt, he humiliated her with a bombardment that left her bruised, exhausted, but not yet defeated in the depth of a smoldering crater.

There was always a fail-safe though and her creator would've made sure of it. There was one last maneuver that the deranged Dr. Gero had told her about. Not even her own brother knew about it and with one good reason. It could potentially cause so much destruction and be out of control for her to use. \"Your brother has a bomb but you are too special for that. At the base of your spine...\" 18 could hear the old crackpot's voice in her memory. With her face scratched up, and her arm aching from all the fighting, 18 curled up on the floor of the shed to reach behind her back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a forceful push, she pressed into her skin. There was a small click. She reached into the flesh and screaming in agony, she lifted up the flesh where she could now feel the switch embedded into her very structure. One more click. The fighting was distant but she could still hear them and worse, she felt the dread that she had left her brother to die. How long would it take to kick in? No sooner than she wondered that, she felt her body ache, her skin felt like it was <i>stretching.</i> Android 18 yelled and felt her clothes beginning to constrict around her. In a pained gasp, she tore off her denim jacket. Her arms begin to squeeze against the sleeves until they too ripped and fell to the floor. It was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All her clothes was gone, and as she began to grow bigger, feeling her size increase and become more powerful, her wounds also felt like they were disappearing. The growth process healed her as it made her into a form that the Saiyan would have no easy time fighting. Android 18 grinned, the energy coursing through her body excited her, and at the 20ft size, she stretched upward and burst out of the shed. She had unfinished business with Vegeta.</span></div></div>",

Another intense burst of energy flowed through her. She groaned and closed her eyes, half naked and squatting over the ruins of the safe house she had been using as a sanctuary. Curse you Dr. Gero, why is it always overkill with you? Her barefeet had been the first to expand and the surge continued up her knees and lower abdomen. 18 lifted up a leg and brought it down, leaving the now much smaller remains of the wooden safe house in one of her colossal footprints.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a050ft! She could tell from the print that she had left behind, and although it should've terrified her, it also began to excite her a bit. Would she get any bigger? At least the fight was now just a couple of short paces away. Giant Android 18 looked and saw her brother spiraling around, with the smug Saiyan down on the ground using him for target practice. Her pleased grin turned into a scowl of rage. He had humiliated her and now it was time to deliver some of the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Haha! Had enough yet?\" Vegeta cackled at the beat up Android 17. The cyborg was too proud to admit defeat but it looked like it was about to be the end. And who would save him now? His sister who had run off or their wicked false father's creations that had yet to be activated?<br>\r\n\"I'll give you one last chance to surrender...\" The Saiyan smiled and held up his palm to charge it. The cyborg refused to answer. He gave him the finger and thought about flying somewhere to die when... A massive head rose up from behind the cliff side, blocking any possible escape for anyone. 17's eyes widened in a mix of terror and amazement. How could he not recognize those blonde locks of hair, covered with debris and stains of the dust clouds that the giant created with her every step?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vegeta's eyes were next to go wide with horror and for a couple of seconds, he didn't feel so smug. The giantess that had risen and stood a little too close to her brother, was completely nude and her face was pure rage. <br>\r\nShe lifted a finger to him and her mighty voice boomed: <b>\"READY FOR A REMATCH?\"</b> <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, like a colossal nuclear missile, the building-sized 18 leapt into the air and both brother and rival flew for cover as her massive bare soles came to crush them with a terrifying stomp. Vegeta hurled ki blasts and they disappeared into the wrinkles of her soles, causing no damage but he heard an audible giggle. <i>It was tickling her?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\"ENOUGH GAMES VEGETA, WE CAN DO IT FAIRLY OR I WILL JUST SQUASH YOU LIKE A BUG!\"</b><br>\r\nThe Saiyan spat in fury on the ground, he had come too close to defeat and much worse, to being stepped on to be in any proud mood. The brother, Android 17, was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<i>\"Fair?! How is this fair, you humongous bitch?!\"</i> He screamed up to her, coughing up dust. At this rate, she would level most of the mountains in the area just by flying around and taking those steps. Giant 18's eyes narrowed with fury. It wasn't the first time he had called her that word... Vegeta screamed again as she lifted herself up and charged.</span></div></div>",

Instead, the grinning blonde floated in front of him, completely nude with her body full of debris and caked dirt from tumbling around the earth. With no fanfare or build up, she reached for Vegeta, seizing him immediately, and extinguishing his charge. The Saiyan wanted to yell, fuss, or burst out but it was impossible with the clench of Android 18's long fingers which had grown slightly larger to entomb his frame against the palm of her hand. <i>Nothing but a toy for her</i>, Vegeta thought in defeat. Maybe he would be lucky enough that she would put him out of his misery soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"WHERE IS SON GOKU?\"</b> The giantess clenched her fist. Vegeta groaned in pain, even if he wanted to reveal anything, she was crushing his chest. He defiantly spit, then attempted to wiggle out of her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"WORTHLESS SAIYAN, I'LL RELEASE YOU IF YOU TELL ME!\"</b> But he wouldn't say anything, no matter how hard she squeezed her fingers together to drain him of air. Vegeta began to cackle maniacally through the giantess's grasp, eager for the sweet release. He had surprised himself with this bout of loyalty but once he went down, it was up to the other Z Fighters to save the world from the destructive giant blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"NOTHING THEN? DEATH REALLY IS TOO GOOD FOR YOU, VEGETA...\"</b> Android 18 plucked a strand from her head. She lifted her right foot up, exposing the filthy sole that was blackened with dirt, rocks, and fragments of the small structures she had stomped across. Releasing her grip slightly, Vegeta caught a fresh gasp of air and a break from the gigantic fingers. But only for a moment. Too bruised to move or fight back, he was helpless when Android 18 pressed him against her dirty foot, then used the hair strand to secure him tightly against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief scuffle and the frustration at the failed interrogation had given Android 18 a small boost in growth, as did anything that annoyed or pushed her for a fight. Vegeta, too bruised and beat to fight back, was held by the now 65ft blonde's thick, cablelike strand of hair. She smiled at him, then his view of her distant beautiful face disappeared as she flipped her foot back and took a stomp onto the ground. The air shot out of his lungs and Vegeta was in unimaginable, excruciating pain once again that day. Except now that he was an improvised insole for the giantess, he was humiliated beyond belief. <b>BOOM!</b> He was lifted up and she brought her foot down. He knew that worst of all, he wouldn't even die, at least not right away. </span></div></div>",

Her preferred test subject however, had become fed up with her attempts to experiment on her. Sucy had tried to slip some of her potion into Akko's own food, but the girl had become too cautious to leave her an easy opportunity. This time however, it would only be Akko's fault for eating something that wasn't hers. After sprinkling some of her potion onto the pizza slice, Sucy quickly made her way out of the room she shared with Akko and Lotte, knowing full well Akko's class had just ended and she should be returning shortly. As she stepped out into the hallway, she heard someone call her name from behind. She turned around to see Diana approaching. \"Have you seen Akko?\" the popular witch asked her. \"I let her borrow my boots but I need them back immediately or I'm going to be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucy looked down to see Diana was in fact barefoot. \"She should be back soon,\" Sucy answered. \"Why don't you just wait here for a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I will if I must,\" Diana replied, \"but if she isn't and I end up having to go to class barefoot, I may end up strangling her later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly wouldn't fault you for it,\" Sucy responded in her usual deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana then entered the room and took a seat on Akko's bed, groaning to herself. After they'd been able to avert a global catastrophe by stopping a possessed missile, she and Akko had been on much better terms than before. Diana figured it would be no big deal to let Akko borrow her boots for a day while her own were being repaired, but she should've known better. She wasn't sure how much trouble she'd be in if she showed up to class barefoot as opposed to out-of-uniform shoes, but now she didn't even have enough time to go back and grab a different pair of footwear. At least her midnight blue-painted toenails looked good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana knew she only had about 30 more seconds until she had to head to class, and she was about to give up. She'd skipped breakfast today, and she wasn't sure whose slice of pizza that was sitting on the desk. Deciding she didn't care, she grabbed it as she turned to leave and took a large bite. Just as she'd finished eating all of it, she heard someone else enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akko's just down the hall,\" Sucy declared upon returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! And she'd better have my boots!\" Diana responded. \"Wait a minute... Why do I suddenly feel so strange?\" she asked as the room around her seemed to be contracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucy realized the pizza slice she'd left on the desk was no longer there. She hadn't planned on using Diana as her test subject, but in the end it didn't make much of a difference. Either way she'd find out what effects her new formula were going to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sucy noticed Diana had become</b></span></div></div>",

He also blushed as he remembered Mei\u2019s bust pressing on him in front of Uraraka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidoriya slid the door open, \u201cHey Mr. Power Loa-AHhhHH!\u201d He yelled out comically as he saw what was akin to a gigantic cannon with a pointed glowing tip aiming at him...before he was then zapped and felt like he was being electrocuted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared and the machine seemingly powered down. Hatsume emerged from behind the enormous thing, \u201cHeeeey! You got in the way of my baby\u2019s test run!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh...sorry, Mei...but I came here to ask-\u201d Izuku barely opened his mouth before the prodigy inventor was off and running. \u201cIsn\u2019t she gorgeous!? She\u2019ll be equipped with over a hundred different quirk types to be zapped into people! Can you imagine if people were able to wield TWO quirks at once?! Hehehehehee! But for a test run I could only put in one quirk right now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...what? So...what did you just uh...zap me with? I mean...which quirk?\u201d Izuku was almost afraid to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's the fun part, I was thinking of many sorts of Quirks to use like Todoroki's or Bakugou's, but I think it was wise to simply dial it down to Mount. Lady's quirk of Gigantification!\u201d She enthusiastically told him much to his surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMount Lady!? Wouldn't I grow out of this room?\u201d He asked nervously to which she gained a thoughtful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes! But it doesn't seem to be working like I intended, do you feel different? Do you feel yourself pumping with energy?\u201d Mei asked Izuku excitedly as he backed up from her invading his personal space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly but could you please give me some room?\u201d He requested of her as she somewhat obliged him, \u201cThough I wonder if its slow to activate, that could be it, I knew my baby wouldn't just not work.\u201d She mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...thanks for uh...that...but I\u2019ve gotta head back to class now!\u201d Midoriya quickly exited the room, the reason for his going to Hatsume in the first place completely eradicated from his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept having panicky thoughts of outgrowing his clothes or causing the entire roof of U.A. to collapse...it was quite scary for the young hero to be. However, he at least had the comfort in knowing it was quite early in the morning so it wasn\u2019t like everyone was here yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately he was quite looking where he was going..and bumped right into Ochaco Uraraka..sending them both falling to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaaah!\u201d Both students cried out as they landed in a heap. \u201cOh, Uraraka! I\u2019m so sorry are you hurt!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...I\u2019m totally fine! Don\u2019t worry!\u201d Uraraka cheerfully replied even though she was inwardly blushing as Izuku had landed riiight on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a moment to realize that her breasts were squishing against his chest as he blushed up a storm as he stuttered,\u201dS-sorry about that!\u201d He said hastily getting off from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough unknown to both, a faint static jumped from Izuku's body and into Uraraka's with such subtly, \u201cIts fine, honestly!\u201d She reassured the boy as she got back up to her feet along with Izuku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what were you doing that looked like you were in a hurry?\u201d She inquired from him, knowing that he doesn't normally act like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well you see, I was trying to get some upgrades to my costume to help better my Shoot Style but then Mei Hatsume accidentally blast me with some of Quirk giving device.\u201d Deku explained to her what had transpired earlier on as she was surprised and also confused by the concept, a machine that gives Quirks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird...so it\u2019s a machine that lets a person have TWO quirks at the same time?\u201d Uraraka asked, this was quite interesting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess...but I think it\u2019s nowhere near ready yet...it doesn\u2019t even seem to work.\u201d Midoriya said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even get to ask her about my costume upgrades.\u201d He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOchako and Izuku went into the classroom and sat down in their seats. Jiro and Kaminari were already in there and of course Jiro was teasing Kaminari about how his quirk made him temporarily dumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the duo...an invisible spark of energy entered Jiro and Kaminari from Midoriya\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon people began to filter into the classroom of 1-A..and the students chatted amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class was looking a bit more vibrant as they talked amongst themselves considering its a few more minutes until class actually starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Midoriya got into some mess with Hatsume with a quirk giving machine?\u201d Jiro asked Uraraka curiously after she had explained to her about what was the rush with him and why he came into the room in such a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I don't even know if whatever she did worked on him or something.\u201d She mulled over the fact before she simply shrugged, whatever it was it probably wasn't anything to get investigative over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unknown to the ones that were afflicted by the static that actually carried the Quirk that was transmitted to them like some sort of disease, it started to activate itself in a slow manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the day, the affected students of Class 1-A and to no one\u2019s knowledge the cause of this whole \u2018infection\u2019 Mei Hatsume...were feeling rather\u2026.uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange feeling, to know something is off and perhaps your clothes are fitting a bit more snug than before...but unable to put your finger on what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the others weren\u2019t...as they weren\u2019t really privy to the knowledge they\u2019d been infected by Midoriya\u2019s newly acquired \u2018disease\u2019. For Midoriya he was too focused on his studies to notice much of a difference in clothing fitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the school day was over, and everyone of course headed back to the Heights Alliance dorm on U.A.\u2019s campus. It was there that once those \u2018infected\u2019 started to get changed into more casual wear...they noticed how tight everything was...especially their shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki and Jiro were seated in their own respective rooms and were having a tough time removing their shoes and socks. Same went for Midoriya and Uraraka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGr..grrrgh!\u201d Jiro grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrrrrraaa\u2026.!\u201d Denki yelled, causing some folks out in the hallway to assume he was having trouble going to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidoriya grit his teeth as he tugged and pulled at the sweat ridden footwear and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time before they managed to pop off their smaller shoes with with a groan of relief, though soon after they took it off, they crinkle their noses at the slight foot odor coming from their feet, though to them it probably wasn\u2019t much, but to others, it was quite...unpleasant.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now I feel like its slightly constricting.\u201d She noted on what just happened, looking over herself, though she blushed a little at the fact her breasts were pushing a bit against the tight shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me, how did this happen?\u201d Denki asked her, trying to not stare at her chest, which she caught him doing, \u201cWell\u2026\u201d She began with a slight glare at him trying to sneak a peek, \u201cWhat Uraraka said was that something was going on with Izuku, so I guess what happened to him is happening to all of us.\u201d She guessed, not entirely sure of what happened but it seemed a likely cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Uraraka\u2019s room, she had just flopped onto the bed with a wide relaxed smile on her face and a groan of relief...her still steaming school shoes and knee-socks lay on the floor at the foot of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat...is\u2026.going on\u2026?\u201d She huffed to herself as she stared at the ceiling, sweat having beaded on her forehead from the effort it took to unleash her plump feet from those abnormally tight confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka was currently in a pair of shorts and a loose fitting tank top as she was sprawled out on her bed huffing and puffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidoriya likewise in his own room sighed in sweet release as he tossed his now balled up and wet socks into the hamper. His feet emitted a foul odor just like the rest..though some could say  since he was \u2018infected\u2019 long prior to the others...his was more potent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was thinking to himself of how will he tell the others about how he was hit by a Quirk giving device that turned people practically into Mount Lady for crying out loud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unknown to him and everyone else affected by it they might actually end up significantly bigger than the recently minted Pro Hero, not that they would know until later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku then straighten up as he gained a determined look on his face, whatever that might happen to him he still has his dream of being a hero, he shouldn't let this slow him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides since she can return to normal size I bet I can do the same as well.\u201d He theorized as he nodded to himself in agreement of his assessment, he tried to focus on trying to return to normal size, only to realize after a while it didn't really work as he thought it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku sighed as he flexed his toes in slight annoyance, he guess he'll have to deal with tight clothes until Mei figures out how to fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough it was dark out, and the U.A. students were milling around the dorms..being teenagers they aren\u2019t exactly predisposed to going to bed early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro and Uraraka were hanging out in the latter\u2019s room getting to know each other better..unknown to them (at least pretending to not know at least), Denki and Mineta were listening outside the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my angels\u2026.what secrets do you share with one another...in the quiet of the night?\u201d Mineta moaned pervertedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove over, I wanna listen.\u201d Denki hissed in hushed tones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why do you think our clothes were all tight?\u201d Uraraka asked Jiro as they both were seated on the girl\u2019s bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno...but it was almost like we weren\u2019t fitting them the same way we did when we came in to school\u2026.but that\u2019s impossible...growth spurts don\u2019t work like that.\u201d Jiro said thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue, both Jiro and Uraraka began to feel a tingling sensation throughout their bodies...from their heads all the way down to their bare and still quite sticky and odorous toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same went for Denki who suddenly felt like his whole body was getting a surge of power...and to Mineta\u2019s horror his pal and fellow perv\u2019s body was starting to crush him against the door as the electric user began to experience a growth spurt along with Jiro and Uraraka.<br>\r\nOne thing was for sure...that door Denki was pressing against wasn\u2019t going to hold him pushing up against it much longer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that the door couldn't take anymore and went flying off its hinges as Mineta and Denki was flung right in front of the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, I wasn't expecting a growth spurt\u2026\u201d Denki groaned in annoyance as the Mineta lifted his head off from the floor to then be hit by the noxious odor of their sweaty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? You decided to now act all perverted on us?\u201d Jiro questioned them in irritation, with Uraraka glaring at then the same as they shuddered in comedic horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow ladies let's not act in such a rash manner.\u201d Mineta said in a meek sort of tone as he then see Jiro then lift her foot over his face as the sweat lightly dripped off of her sole as she then stepped on him, forcing the boy to inhale her rather odorous foot odor, making him yell in terror at the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki tried to crawl backwards out of where the door was when his attempt was stopped by Uraraka slamming her foot next to his head, actually making the things on the shelves and dressers to rattle from the force, \u201cAnd where do you think you're going?\u201d She asked him sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenki cringed as the close proximity of Uraraka's large foot to his head... giving him an experience in her potent foot stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAck! Come on girls, we just shot up to six feet! Don't we have more impor-\u201d Kaminari tried to reason, but found Uraraka's sole cut him off as it was placed on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiss it and show us how sorry you are.\u201d She stated dangerously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro smirked wickedly at little Mineta at her own feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering that he was the same small size as he always was, Jiro's admittedly large feet was practically half his size as she grinded her sole onto his head, saturating it with her sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you think barging in to us growing girls is funny isn\u2019t it?\u201d She mocked him as she watch the boy squirm ineffectually to try and get away from the foul smelling odor, it\u2019s one thing to loot panties and the like, but to be forced to smell her feet is something else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka was giggling to herself as she squeezed Kaminari\u2019s nose between her toes only to then release it to make the boy be forced to inhale between them as he coughed from the pungent smell coming from them, \u201cGeez Uraraka I didn\u2019t think your feet stink that bad!\u201d He cried out as she grinned at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither did I, I guess I\u2019m full of surprises.\u201d She said in a smug tone, though inwardly she was laughing at the fun she was having with this sort of degrading punishment, though to be fair the thing she was affected by also seem to increase her sweat output to a certain above average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mineta, Jiro planted her sole against his diminutive face and grinded her sour sweat into his nostrils. \u201cNot what you thought it\u2019d be like, huh?!\u201d She snapped with a glare at the grape-headed perv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka and Jiro finally plopped down on the bed with two girlish sighs, leaving their feet propped up on their heels to display their odorous soles and waft their toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019know\u2026since you apparently grew too, Kaminari...you maybe can join in.\u201d Jiro said with a slight blush as she twirled one of her earlobes around her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr I can go back to rubbing my feet all over your face!\u201d Uraraka teased and flexed her big toe at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t nearly the difficult choice Mineta had hoped his pal would find it to be. \u201cDeal!\u201d Kaminari practically blurted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s see what you got...wonder if your feet will be outshined by us girls.\u201d Uraraka teased, whatever had effected the group..had made them rather frisky and obviously sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what!? No way! You can\u2019t do this to me, buddy!\u201d Mineta objected as Kaminari towered over him even moreso than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sorry man, but I'm not really interested in getting stomped on so take one for the team.\u201d He told him with a apologetic smile as he lifted his large foot over Mineta's face and wiggled his toes at him almost teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he then abruptly stomped down on him as Mineta yelped from the foot pressing down on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't feel apologetic!\u201d Mineta retorted comically as the foot odor that wafted from the Electricity Quirk User was just as awful as the girls\u2019 were, \u201cWell duh, I'm not down there am I?\u201d He asked in a joking tone as he rubbed his foot across his smaller body like a rag with his sweat from his soles draining onto the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd coincidentally enough, generated enough electricity to then begin to zap the smaller pervert with some non-lethal static electricity.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The promised reward is admin privileges and in game omnipotence within the new fantasy game entitled: Goddess' Wrath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Rika dives into the game, she discovers herself in her original Lisbeth avatar from SAO...only at 100 ft. tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the mischievous type, she's sure to have a LOT of fun as a giant goddess with unlimited power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Sinon's Therapy: Prior to meeting Kirito and the Death Gun fiasco, Asada Shino's therapist recommends her client a stress relief VRMMO. This VRMMO was designed by psychology experts and Asada's avatar Sinon from GGO would be able to download directly to it. This stress relief sounds strange, but it's found to be quite effective. Sinon finds herself in what appears to be a tiny model city, at an enormous height!

The glasses wearing girl was a far cry in appearance from her Gun Gale Online avatar: Sinon. Sinon was badass sniper with cyan hair...and while technically they were the same person...Asada felt more free to express herself and go wild when she was in game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that's why she felt her heart flutter at the proposed 'therapy' VRMMO sessions prepared for her that would incorporate Sinon as her avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands clenched on her legs as she recalled being continuously bullied by her classmates over her very real fear of guns. She even trembled and had a near panic attack when one of the bitches aimed a finger-gun at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down....\" She quietly said to herself as she cast a glance over at her headset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck it...she decided...what harm could it do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after placing the headset upon herself and starting up the fulldive technology, she found herself standing as Sinon...only she was in the middle of a city that greatly resembled a real life Tokyo...and a dropdown menu in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this...?\" She mumbled in confusion as she scrolled through a list of heights ranging from 50ft. to 100 ft. and onward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling curious, she pressed her slender finger to the words '100ft.'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tingling filled her body and she let out a gasp as she realized she was growing bigger and bigger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, she saw the street she was standing on getting further away, along with cars and even buildings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally stopped growing she was exactly 100ft tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around in shock, a sinister grin formed on Sinon's face. \"Well...I gotta say this is going to be one hell of a therapy session!\" Her voice rattled windows along with the tiny lifelike npcs' eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the menus, she saw an option for odd things like sweat and odor, and things to increase the tiny NPCs lifelike qualities and even an option to spawn military resistance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling her sockless toes in her boots, Sinon felt they were slick with sweat and grinned deviously. She took the cursor and cranked up the sweat meter along with the odor one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately she felt her armpits and feet dampen like she'd been baking in the hot sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching a skyscraper with screaming office folk inside, she tapped her finger on the glass and grinned wickedly inside. \"Oho...you runts are SOOOO screwed.\" She sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinon lifted her boot clad foot and stomped it hard down on a busy street, demolishing cars and causing a crater to form in the shape of her boot. \"Hah! AHAHAHAHA!\" She roared with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wielded unlimited power here! And she was going to damn sure enjoy exploiting it!</span></div></div>",

Sinon smiled to herself, a satisfied look on her face. She was sceptical at first but now... now she's all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking closer to the fleeing crowd she brought her foot down. She couldn't see it but she had a feeling she just squished someone under her boot. Normally killing someone would be a major problem, but thats the beauty of a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she saw a small Npc running away. Looked to be an average man, nothing really special about him. Smiling gladly, thinking he will make a good first target. Sinon reached down and yanked the man between her two digital fingers. She stood up and saw him struggling in between her grip. He looked so frighten, it was borderline adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo NPC, do you have an actual name or are you just an extra running around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go please\u201d The man said simply. It didn't sound like an actual conversation starter, more just extra fluff the non important characters say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes it less fun, then again i don't really need a name for what I'm about to do to you\u201d Sinon said with a now devilish grin. She went into her menu with her free hand, looking for her equipment and her attire. Since everything has transferred over to this game from her Gun Gale Online profile, she's got all her stuff still. Including her favourite sniper. But that wasn't what she was interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving down she unequipped her jacket. Leaving her in nothing but her inner clothes. The Npc didn't know what was happening, until it was far to late. Sinon moved and pushed the Npc deep into her skin, more specifically her clean shaven armpit. Raising her arm as she pushed him far in. She saw the Npc get sweatier and sweatier as she rubbed him around. Thank god for the sweat function, makes this so much funner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother good touch is hearing the Npc scream. Very satisfying. She removed her hand quickly and slammed her arm down, trapping the man between her upper arm and her body. With her free hand she equipped the jacket. Meaning the man was trapped in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinon likes having him in there, and will get him out to see the effect the sweat had, but after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied smile she looked around even more, seeing some other Npcs staring at her. Most with stunned looked. However that changed when she looked at them, almost like they just went on alert they started fleeing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinon laughed at they're pathetic movements, thinking that these people have no idea how screwed they were. Might as well have a little fun with them. Plus all the functions at her command, she can do some real creative stuff. With the man still trapped in her armpit, she chased after the crowd.

She just defeated Cinder at Haven Academy and allowed her neglected daughter to take the relic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears were still running down her face, she made a lot of choices, she still believed that Salem could not be beaten. But the things her daughter said made her think what if she kept fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Summer would still be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she wouldn't have left Taiyang<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe she wouldn't have left her daughter wonder why she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts made her eyes leak out the spring maiden's power, the power that was never hers, the power she stole from a scared girl! Yang must have felt ashamed for having a coward like her for a mother! Summer wouldn't look at her if she was alive! And what would Tai think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left her family behind not for her tribe but because she was scared. And she valued strength but she ran away from the people she valued most. \"Aaaaah!\" She wailed as her maiden powers created lightning around her. And then something else happened as she screamed in anguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started growing, the towering trees around her seemed to shrink as her body grew until the trees only reached her knees. She stopped screaming and calmed down and looked at her new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, just happened?\" She asked herself looking down at the trees that once towered over her. \"I've grown but how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked around to some more and looked down to see a pack of Ursa's only they were small, almost as small as her high heel boots. Instinctively she rose one of her giant feet and stomped down on a couple of the Ursa, the rest of the pack ran trying to get away from the giant Spring Maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as the pack run she looked at trees that were at her knees and the sight of the running Ursa. She would estimate she was roughly 50 ft tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her hands and formed ice with her Spring Maiden powers. That must be it, her sudden growth spurt must have been caused from her Maiden powers, and anger at herself. How else could she have grown?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. With her new size she could change things, she could go back to fighting Salem. She could try to rekindle her relationship with Taiyang, and maybe start a relationship with Yang. She can keep herself and her family safe from whatever might threaten them, from Salem and otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile formed on her lips, with this new size and power there's nothing she could be afraid of. And who knows maybe she can grow even bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for she'll decide what to do first. She could<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Go after Salem. (She could meet some of her associates and find out Cinder survived. She'll likely torture and interrogate her for information and make her a tiny slave for her.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Go find Team RWBY (She could join her daughter's party, and be a real mother to Yang, whether she likes it or not. Her new size will likely deny any rejections even from Ozpin or her brother.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Go to Taiyang( She could try to rekindle their relationship, try to convince him that she can make up for her mistakes.

The air's nice and the sun is pretty bright.\", Sora smiled taking in the pleasant atmosphere, he might be lost but the unfamiliar world did have beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden glare of bright light caught the spiky haired boy's attention as he looked off. On a podium seem to be a display, a stone slab with a blue crystal sheet. Walking closer, Sora focused on the bright material it seem to pulse some kinda of energy as the light reflected off it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure why but Sora reached his hand out, feeling the energy wisp against his hand.

They'd been allowed to take a vacation week away from Overwatch, and they'd traveled back to Busan, South Korea. They were staying at a swanky hotel on the beach, but it wasn't merely a leisurely trip, however. Winston had given them a special assignment. He'd supposedly invented a special type of sunscreen for long outdoor missions that was 100% water and sweat-proof and could last for days. Hana and Brigitte then volunteered to be the first test subjects if it meant they could spend a week together at the beach.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we'll just try and keep a low-profile this time,\" Hana replied as she removed her footwear as well. She then looked around for a spot in the sand that wasn't too close to anyone else to set their towels and beach bags down. Once she'd found one, she reached inside the bag and pulled out the bottle of formula that Winston had given her.<br>\r\n\"This stuff had better work,\" She said, \"If we get sunburned that monkey's going to owe us big time!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, seriously!\" Brigitte replied, \"but I have faith. Winston's a pretty smart guy.\"<br>\r\n\"True,\" Hana said, \"Just make sure you do my back real good, k Babe?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, Hon!\" Brigitte reassured her.<br>\r\nLittle did the two young women know as they rubbed the lotion onto their skin, that it had been severely tampered with. Hammond, Winston's former animal-experiment counterpart from the Horizon Lunar Colony, had sneaked into his lab several days ago. The hamster then proceeded to investigate what the ape had been working on, but being the careless type, didn't put back all of the chemicals where he'd found them. The mix-up had left the two ladies with a different formula that Winston himself had never intended to give them.<br>\r\n\"There, all done,\" Brigitte said as she finished rubbing the lotion onto her lover's back. \"Ready to do mine?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Hana replied as she rubbed the chemical onto the young Swedish woman's back as well.<br>\r\n\"Alright, that should do it,\" Hana said, \"now we can relax!\"<br>\r\n\"Totally!\" Brigitte responded. \"Talk about an easy mission!\" she said as she leaned in and gave Hana a kiss on the cheek. \"I just hope Reinhardt can survive without me for a week.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm more worried about your dad trying to mess with my mech while I'm away. He always bugs me about it but you're the only one I trust to help me work on it,\" Hana replied.<br>\r\n\"Haha, oh I'm sure it'll be fine, Hon,\" Brigitte said, \"my dad's no idiot... well not really anyway.\"<br>\r\nHana chuckled. \"Thanks Babe, that's very reassuring.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, I... feel kinda funny,\" Brigitte suddenly told her.<br>\r\n\"Really? Is everything...\" Hana started to ask but couldn't finish as she just stood still with her jaw hanging open.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Hon?\" Brigitte asked before also realizing something strange was happening. \"Hey, what the hell's going on?!\" she exclaimed. \"Why does it look like everything's shrinking?!\"<br>\r\nThe landscape around them wasn't shrinking, however. The two girls were in fact growing in size due to a side effect of the formula they'd been given.<br>\r\n<b>They began to grow...</b></span></div></div>",

I won!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw this...\" Dark Pit tossed the controller roughly on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a sore loser! You did 2nd! That's not so bad.\" Pit tried to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Pit hmphed and turned away from his other half as he flopped back on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of stomachs growling met their ears...Pit chuckled. \"I uh..I'm kinda hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up.\" Dark Pit grumbled, only for the sound of his own stomach to meet Pit's ears as the dark angel blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza?\" Pit suggested. \"Fine...just none of those gross fishes on it.\" Dark Pit warned.</span></div></div>",

Oh if only he knew in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pods flew aimlessly through the night sky as it streaked over the horizon unbeknownst to anyone that were out for the night or sleeping, not knowing the future dangers that these three pods could cause indirectly to these masses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night just so happened to be when a certain Ben Tennyson and Kevin Levin were staying out late and causing trouble. Ben and Kevin had strolled into a gas station quick stop. \u201cCan I help you boys find something?\u201d The clerk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s stomach growled as Kevin exited the store at a brisk pace. \u201cWait for me!\u201d Been called as he ran after. The two boys walked a bit before reaching the Tennyson home. \u201cCatch!\u201d Kevin tossed a soda and honeybun into Ben\u2019s hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...did you swipe these? Smooth!\u201d Ben declared as Kevin grinned smugly. \u201cJust use that soda to burp on your lame cousin for me alright?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grinned mischievously as he nodded in understanding, \u201cYou got it Kevin, where are you staying at anyways?\u201d He asked him with a tilt of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy waved off his concerns as he nonchalantly responded, \u201cI gotten myself a nifty tent and all the good stuff that comes with it to rest for the night, as long as I got a good food source, I\u2019ll be fine, besides any animal comes by I\u2019ll just zap them.\u201d He said with a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan, just be careful okay?\u201d Ben advised as he walked to his door and opened it slightly so as to not disturb his parents when they\u2019re sleeping in a bit early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou worry too much what's the worst that could happen?\u201d Kevin asked rhetorically with a shrug as he began to walk away from Ben and to the direction of where Ben presumed his sleeping spot would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went inside and closed the door behind him as he took off his shoes and went up the stairs to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to a certain scientist\u2019s miscalculation, two of the canisters landed outside of Ben and Gwen\u2019s windows, which were open due to the sticky summer heat this night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canisters were the length of a can of potato chips, but slightly thicker. On cue, they began emitting a colorless, odorless gas.. that of course flowed into the two preteen\u2019s windows as they slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the size of the containers, they hadn't made much noise upon impacting the ground. This meant no one was any the wiser of what was going to transpire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey unknowingly breathed in the gas as the genetic modification went into their bloodstream and modified their genetic patterns, making them remarkably stronger,faster and more efficient than any other human being, maybe a bit too well, their effects will be known soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canisters depleted their contents as quickly as they came, before shutting off and closing the ports where the gas came from its work done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the visible effects if there was any, it was highly unnoticeable to any other person save for its secondary effects, which they will find out the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s parents had gone on a business trip so Max was housesitting for them...as well as watching Ben and Gwen. Thankfully he had his own things to attend to so he whipped up breakfast for the two cousins. Gwen and Ben were now sitting at the table with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stayed out really late again didn't you?\u201d Gwen asked her cuz disapprovingly. Ben was clearly sleepy...and grumpy to boot. Though for some reason he was more irritated at Gwen\u2019s question than even that could explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's none of your business! Kevins cool!\u201d Ben practically shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen glared, she too was feeling more irritable at Ben\u2019s childishness. \u201cI knew you were hanging out with that guy again!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gripped his fork and skewered some sausage...not noticing his fork stabbing through the plate. When he stuffed the meat into his mouth and bit down, he heard a crunch and spat out the top of his fork which he'd somehow bitten off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck? These forks suck!\u201d Ben said with disdain as he dropped the bitten fork on the table, Gwen narrowed her eyes slightly at the fact that her cousin just bit clean through a fork with no sign of flinching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could at least treat the silverware correctly.\u201d She said to him with a slightly haughty tone as Ben glared at her for implying he knows nothing of how to handle his forks and junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays you, I bet your fork is as cheap as mine.\u201d He retorted as Gwen scoffed and replied, \u201cThese are metal forks you dingus, they don't break that easily.\u201d She said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProve it then.\u201d Ben stated as he folded his arms impatiently waiting for her to try and prove him wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d She decided as she picked up the fork she was using and placed her thumb on the front end and pressed down, much to her surprise instead of encountering resistance it simply bent back from her putting force into it like clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cousins were interrupted when they heard a loud splintering of wood and a voice outside the front door mumbled \u201cOops..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Gwen stood up from the table...and as they scooted their chairs back they both tumbled on to the floor from the back legs snapping off. Looking up from the floor they saw Kevin letting himself in\u2026.while holding the now completely ripped off knob in one hand..and a weird canister in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo Ben, Ben\u2019s cousin. This weird tube thing landed outside my tent and I get sprayed by some gas..now I'm super strong!\u201d Kevin declared proudly as he gestured to the damaged front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, really!?\u201d Ben said wide eyed as he looked back at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one way to find out how tough we really are...let's go to the woods.\u201d Kevin said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen frowned, \u201cSo what are you gonna do, beat each other up?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like...whack each other with trees.\u201d Kev said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen facepalmed as she followed them outside.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let me see how to enjoy it.\u201d She said as she hopped off of the rock she was sitting on and bent down and lift it up, cracking the ground a bit as the boulder the size of a person was in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I think I see where this i-\u201d Kevin was about to say before getting hit in the face by the aforementioned boulder that came at him with a speed of a car, sending him flying through rows of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked in awe at the path of destruction that Gwen casually brought to the forest, \u201cOkay you might have a point about this being a little fun.\u201d Gwen admitted as she looked at her hand with a sly grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heard the sound of the rock moving as Kevin moved the Boulder away a bit dirty from the dust and splinters but no worse for wear, \u201cSee now you\u2019re getting it, maybe we should go and stop a few bank robberies or something to see how good this superhero business is.\u201d He suggested as he dusted himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, really?\u201d Gwen blinked in surprise. \u201cWhat?

Shoot them!\u201d The robber stubbornly ordered the rest as they opened fire on Ben but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, still cold.\u201d Ben said with a sigh, ignoring the bullets bouncing off of him when in actuality the bullets crumpled against his body into a flat circle from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked to them and grinned before he sucked in a deep breath and then suddenly unleashed a burp that rippled throughout the bank causing some of the robbers to be sent flying back from the shockwave as the windows shattered from the force of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah check me out! Super burping skills are a go!\u201d Ben praised himself as Gwen and Kevin chuckled in amusement at his antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hostages soon ran out to the police as the SWAT team rushed in to find the humiliated and now partially deaf robbers whimpering on the floor. There was no sign of the mystery heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin, Gwen and Ben were back at the Tennyson house, laughing and hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever thought your gross habits would come in handy!\u201d Gwen laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't make me super burp YOU too.\u201d Ben smugly threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys...can ya come in here!?\u201d Kevin's voice yelled from Ben\u2019s room. Gwen and Ben shrugged and stood up only to hit their heads on the ceiling together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw.\u201d Ben said rubbing his head from the impact on the ceiling as Gwen looked strangely at him, \u201cYou realize that doesn't hurt right?\u201d She asked blandly as the plaster and crack from the ceiling showed that they were perfectly fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a sense of habit okay?\u201d He said slightly embarrassed about the fact as she shook her head with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets just see what's wrong with Kevin.\u201d Gwen decided, Ben nodded as he walked to the door with her behind him, noting their footsteps are much heavier now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened it only to come face to well, pit, \u201cWait Kevin is that you?\u201d Ben asked surprised and Gwen fanned the air slightly with a light grimace before she smirked a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it looks like someone needs a shower.\u201d She joked as he did indeed reek from the days of sleeping in the wilderness for days on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh bite me, could you help me out here? I was crashing on your couch before this started to happen.\u201d Kevin explained to them as he shifted his body a bit as the two heard furniture being moved and stuff falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what grab your hand and pull you out?\u201d Gwen questioned him as he replied back, \u201cDuh, I bet your living room got more space for me to stretch out.\u201d He said rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright...uh..can ya reach your hand out?\u201d Ben said, he was used to his own body odor, and in a lesser sense Kevin\u2019s..but he hadn\u2019t really experienced being up close with Kevin\u2019s armpit before..much less when Kevin was ten feet tall! \u201cYeah I think so...lemme just-\u201d Kevin grunted and they heard a crunch. Ben winced, \u201cPlease tell me that wasn\u2019t my console\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy you another one!\u201d Kevin said defensively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith what?!\u201d Gwen demanded. \u201cLook...can we just...talk about this later?\u201d Kevin grunted uncomfortably as he reached his hand out. \u201cAlright...it\u2019s a lot more spacious in the living room anyway.\u201d Gwen said as she grabbed Kevin\u2019s hand. Kevin couldn\u2019t help himself and said: \u201cOooho..we holdin\u2019 hands already?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shut up or I\u2019ll leave you in there to stink up Ben\u2019s room.\u201d Gwen glared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeey!\u201d Ben whined as he grabbed Kevin\u2019s wrist. \u201cOne..\u201d Gwen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo..\u201d Ben grounded himself.<br>\r\n\u201cThree!\u201d Kevin bellowed as the doorframe began to creak and strain and on the sides the walls cracked a bit as Kevin finally came flying out on top of the equally big Tennysons. \u201cUgh...get off\u2019a me! You BOTH reek!\u201d Gwen pushed Kevin and Ben off of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, Ben, Kevin and Gwen were sitting on the sagging couch. \u201cSo...looks like we\u2019re gonna be invincible giants now\u2026\u201d Ben said, somewhat excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, and we thought we\u2019d have it made BEFORE.\u201d Kevin said cockily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Kevin, what exactly did you mean by buying Ben a new console?\u201d Gwen asked in a stern voice with her arms folded, Ben was curious as well at what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! So I may have swindle a bit of cash from the bank we just saved.\u201d He said showing her the hastily stuffed in money in his large hand all of them showing hundreds of dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKevin I thought we were just saving the bank from robbers not rob them blind.\u201d Ben said slightly disappointed in his lack of self restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides they\u2019re gonna find out that the missing money went somewhere and they\u2019ll find us eventually.\u201d She added in her two cents with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBah you guys are too cautious besides what are they gonna do arrest us? They\u2019d only be able to cuff our fingers at this point, plus we are invincible to them.\u201d Kevin replied back, while it was dishonest to rob them he does have a point, there was little they can do against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen relented and sighed, \u201cFine you can keep the money, not like they\u2019ll do anything or even know we were there.\u201d She said as Kevin grinned and teasingly punched her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee now ya gettin it.\u201d He said as Gwen rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d Ben asked them as Kevin shrugged as he gingerly picked up the remote for the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't know about you guys but I feel like watching some TV and airing out my feet if you don't mind.\u201d He answered them and turned on the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, boy... I'll open a window.\u201d Gwen groaned and walked over to the living room window and gently lifted it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin grinned smugly as Ben looked at the dark haired troublemaker\u2019s boots..he had experience in foot odor, it being one of his primary resources for tormenting or grossing out Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever strangely enough he\u2019d never seen nor experienced Kevin's feet...first time for everything he guessed.</span></div></div>",

Kevin freed his sockless foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh much better.\u201d He said sighing in pleasure as he wiggled his thick toes from the freedom of his boots as the pungent foot odor leaked from them which thanks to the windows aired it out some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan Kevin I didn't think your feet would stink that bad.\u201d Ben said fanning the air to get the smell out from him to little effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been travelling as long as I have throughout the United States with no access to good bathrooms and clothes you\u2019d smell like this too, not that I\u2019m complaining.\u201d He said as he flexed his toes for emphasis, wafting his smell into the room as the News channel was on as he kicked up his feet on the table in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonder what are they talking about now?\u201d Gwen wondered as they paid attention to what was being said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably that bank robbery we busted.\u201d Kevin said with a smile as he put his boots next to the table as he gives it time to air out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news anchor was talking about how the hostages told of three mysterious children who saved them with strange powers. \u201cGood thing the goons took care of the camera system...or we\u2019d be dealing with a LOT of weird publicity right now.\u201d Gwen sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, plus it wouldn\u2019t be as fun to get the drop on people who mess with us if EVERYONE knew we were super powerful.\u201d Ben smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of that\u2026.I was thinking if you wanted to head down to the arcade, Ben?\u201d Kevin smirked knowingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure! But those jerks from the other day are probably still-....\u201d A sudden mischievous grin formed on Ben\u2019s face as he and Kevin shared a dark laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I missing something here?\u201d Gwen butted in. \u201cJust wait here..we\u2019ll be back later.\u201d Kevin stuffed his still ripe feet back into his boots and stood up, Ben followed him as they went to the door. \u201cJust try not to break the-..\u201d  she was interrupted by a loud crash and the sound of the door tearing off it\u2019s hinges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy bad!\u201d Ben called over his shoulder as he lifted up the door and gently placed it back in it\u2019s frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...doofuses.\u201d Gwen groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arcade was down the street thankfully, in an area that not a lot of prying eyes were seen...and since the three older teens had basically taken over the place and bullied anyone into coming around during \u2018their\u2019 hours..it was quite deserted..except for Ben and Kevin\u2019s targets of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, the leader of the trio of bullies, felt a thick finger jabbing into his back. \u201cNice game skills...for a runt.\u201d Ben\u2019s voice said from behind him \u201cOh..you\u2019re gonna get it, Tennyson\u2026.\u201d Chris whirled around..only to see Kevin had his two buddies and fellow bullies in headlocks of sorts, both boys faces buried in his armpits as he had his arms wrapped around their necks. Ben cracked his knuckles and grinned deviously. \u201cMight wanna start begging and apologizing now..\u201d Ben warned darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stumbled back from the sight of Ben and Kevin as he fell on his ass in fear of them, \u201cB-Ben what happened to you?\u201d He asked him nervously as the ten year old mini-giant grinned mischievously at the boy in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you like to know? I got big, bigger than you obviously, now for some payback.\u201d He said with a sneer on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m big, I could do stuff like this for instance.\u201d He said forebodingly as Chris wondered what he meant before he saw him walk to a random arcade machine and put his hand on it and squeeze, he was treated to the unpleasant noise of metal and plastic crumpling under Ben\u2019s grip as he looked at him with a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don't hurt me I\u2019ll do anything please!\u201d He begged pathetically, eyes wide with terror, \u201cI dunno if you should refuse Ben, he did say \u2018anything'.\u201d Kevin said as the boy\u2019s two stooges were struggling to break free from his ironclad grip to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right about that, so if you don't want me to hurt you, all ya gotta do is simple, take off my shoes.\u201d Ben said to him as Chris looked confused, \u201cThat's it?\u201d He asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, after you do it I\u2019ll tell you what to do next.\u201d Ben said as his toes wiggled inside his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn your hands and knees, crawl like the bug you are!\u201d Kevin chimed in with a wink at Ben. Ben smirked as he watched the older boy crawl before him up to his sneakers. The boy jumped as Ben took a seat on top of the now collapsed arcade machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris whimpered as his shaking hands fumbled with Ben\u2019s shoelaces, but eventually he got them untied. Ben narrowed his eyes menacingly as he felt the shoes being pulled off, he let out a sigh as his reeking and obviously well worn socks on his feet were hit by the cool ac in the arcade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin snickered as he heard his prisoners gag into his pits, Gwen was right\u2026.but in his opinion he certainly didn't need a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s socks were littered with holes that gave a preview of his plump pinkish boy sole. Chris cringed and gagged a bit at the cheesy funk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what now?\u201d He asked fearfully as he shivered as the sight of Ben\u2019s feet as he wiggled his toes in anticipation of what he will ask him to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s grinning face told him that what was gonna happen next is not gonna be a fun time.</span></div></div>",

Now the other one!\u201d Ben said, domineeringly stomping his other foot down and cracking the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin smirked, he'd finally released his hold on the two other teens...only to twist up two arcade machines like tinfoil and restrain them to the floor with them. Now he stood over them, from their perspective on the floor he was very big indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin sniffed the air as he heard Ben sigh and turned to see the boy Chris looking green in the face before both of Ben\u2019s now bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you gonna do with us!?\u201d One of the two bullies wailed from the floor before Kevin. Chris was being commanded by Ben to lay down faceup on the floor, Ben wanted a footstool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m gonna do? Well that's obvious, I\u2019m gonna use you for entertainment until Ben is done with his fun.\u201d Kevin said with his hands on his hips as he loomed over both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick question, how good are ya at breathing?\u201d He asked them curiously as the two bullies looked at each other before answering nervously, \u201cPretty good?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorks for me.\u201d He replied with a grin as he walked a bit closer to them, \u201cMy pits are so lonely without something to keep them company so your faces will do just fine.\u201d He stated before he placed his hands on each side of them before he shoved his pits into their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full unbridled smell poured into their nostrils as the sweat dripped onto their faces as they coughed and choked at the nasty odor that plagued their senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, come on you losers, can't handle a smell of a actual tough guy?\u201d Kevin taunted them as he grounded his pits into their faces, marking them with his horrendous armpit stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was grinding his reeking soles into Chris\u2019 helpless face, a smug grin on his own the whole time. \u201cYeah, revenge is sweet. Who knew you guys were such babies?\u201d Ben mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, you're all such wimpy losers it almost is too pathetic to keep this up!\u201d Kevin increased the weight he was putting on their faces with his pits and said \u201cNaaaah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKevin..I think we're getting bigger!\u201d Ben reported excitedly. Indeed, both the pit and feet hostages felt the rank areas start to become more vast and heavy on their poor sweat stained faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-whats going on, stop it! Please!\u201d Chris pleased desperately from beneath Ben\u2019s expanding soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah! Your stink...it's getting too much!!\u201d The suffocating boys said through Kevin's pit skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBest ditch the rags before we get some unnecessary attention.\u201d Kevin said groaning in slight pleasure at the growth as he slowly surged upwards in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww but I think we should trash their place before we leave.\u201d Ben said as he covered Chris\u2019 face with his immense sole before he passed out from the smell, \u201cCertainly fun for us right?\u201d He rhetorically asked him before slightly pushing him away as he expanded in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin smirked in agreement before he freed the barely breathing bullies, \u201cGet your boss and scram knowing who runs things around here.\u201d He said sneering at them before they got up hastily and ran away, picking up Chris on their shoulders before running away screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you bet Gwen is growing too? I just hope the neighbors don't call in the police for disturbance, last thing she wants is cops hounding her.\u201d Ben mused to which Kevin shrugged, \u201cProbably but that's on them if they want to pick a fight with her.\u201d He said chuckling in amusement as they continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Gwen, she was currently struggling to make her way through the hallway...and she was starting to lose her patience with how cramped she was. \u201cUgh...I\u2019m sorry Grandpa Max and aunt and uncle Tennyson...but this is the only way I can..breathe!\u201d With that, the redhead reared back her white slip-on clad foot, and crashed it through the wall in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen knocked through the rest of the wall... she'd made quite the mess but at least she had more room and wasn't stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe notoriously nosy neighbors were already calling the police. Ben and Kevin were just smashing through the arcade wall, when they saw two cop cars speeding by. \u201cUh Oh.. that'll be Gwen.\u201d Ben said as he wiggled his moistening toes in his just recovered and slightly now tight shoes and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, she can handle herself...there's the loser\u2019s car. I wanna step on it with these rank feet, gonna take my boots off now.\u201d Kevin said with a lick of his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo for it then.\u201d Ben said with a grin on his face as he stood back and watched as Kevin began to do his thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin put his hands on his boot and pulled them off as he groaned in satisfaction as he wiggled his freed toes in joy before doing the same for the other boot as he grunted and tugged off the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the boots off Ben could smell the sweat and stink coming off of them as he scrunched his nose slightly, \u201cQuite the smell.\u201d Ben commented smiling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know right? Now down to business.\u201d Kevin said as he stomped down the street to where he last saw the car of the bully and in moments he found it, a nice shiny sedan sitting in park along with some other cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think its time to give this car a makeover.\u201d He said smirking as he lifted his bare foot over the car as he wiggled his toes and pressed down onto the hood, hearing it crumple a bit, his grin widened as he forced it down as the lights came on from emergency alarm coming on as the metal deformed and twisted under him slowly crushing the front of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah turn that thing into the scrapheap!\u201d Ben goaded him on as he pressed down with a force of a hydraulic press as the alarm abruptly ended when Kevin crushed the entire front hood of the car easily as the rest lifted off the ground from the weight being balanced on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, serves him right, now to trash the rest of it.\u201d Kevin declared, not that he can't lie that stomping on stuff with his bare feet felt really good to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then decided to finish the rest of the car by stepping into the uncrushed portion and simply standing on top of it, grinning wildly as he felt it compressing itself underneath him as he wiggled his toes in pleasure, curling over the side of it and denting the metal as the windows fractured and cracked from the pressure like a slow compression tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat looks rather fun to do Kevin.\u201d Ben said folding his arms with a smirk on his face, the boy chuckled as he replied, \u201cIt feels awesome crushing these tin cans with my large feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just think we about 16 ft tall imagine if we\u2019re 50 ft or something? We could stomp them whole with our sweaty feet.\u201d Ben said at the quite frankly, rather arousing imagery of stomping around the city and terrorizing people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't forget the special surprises inside these cars when they\u2019re loaded with people inside too, I bet it\u2019d be even more fun if there was some in there too.\u201d Kevin added in with a slight lustful sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden screaming met their ears, and a mustached bald man came out shouting at them in Italian. Kevin and Ben looked at each other in confusion. \u201cUhh...you sure this is Chris's car?\u201d Ben asked his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin scratched his greasy hair and stepped off of the car. \u201cChris!?\u201d The man started swearing in Italian, \u201cHe told us to do this.\u201d Kevin lied, winking at Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy that little #*$&amp;@!! I loan him my car and he gets two overgrown children to..\u201d The man, who they guessed was Chris\u2019 grandpa growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin and Ben wandered off while the.man went to presumably strangle his grandson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that just happened..\u201d Ben joked as they approached the Tennyson home. \u201cHey ain't that your grandpa with Gwen on your front lawn?\u201d Kevin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh..\u201d Ben gulped as Max sternly waved them over. \u201cWell...good luck!\u201d Kevin started to leave until..\u201dThat means BOTH of you, boys.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww why I gotta be in this?\u201d Kevin complained as Gwen glared at him, \u201cBecause this involves ALL of us Kevin.\u201d She replied before looking at his bare feet and asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to your boots?\u201d She questioned him as he waved her off, \u201cTook them off somewhere, I\u2019ll get them later.\u201d He nonchalantly answered her, noting that there is a big hole in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there goes my house.\u201d Ben said in a deadpanned tone as he looked to see that the police was here as well, documenting the scene in addition to several armed vehicles as big as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, aren't those the S.E.C.T. guys?\u201d Ben stated as he saw the icon on those vehicles as Gwen nodded, \u201cThey\u2019ve been here since I burst out of the house.\u201d She explained to them.</span></div></div>",

Did they use needles?\u201d Kevin asked her, she shrugged at the question, \u201cThey certainly tried, the few broken needles told them that it's fruitless.\u201d Gwen said, maybe a bit prideful in her body\u2019s invulnerability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is what I\u2019m asking in how did this happen to you kids.\u201d Max wondered out loud as he adopted a thinking pose to try and figure out what was the cause, they were exposed to something but what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin stooped down to Max, \u201cWell with me there was this weird can that landed outside my tent..sprayed me with some gas and I got super strong. We just recently hit these growth spurts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the S.E.C.T. guys came over carrying two of the cans in plastic bags. \u201cThat's them.\u201d Kevin said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must've sprayed through your windows, it was hot last night.\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large S.E.C.T. truck pulled up with Kevin's boots loaded in the back, a pair of scientists wearing gas masks were inspecting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there's my boots.\u201d He said happily as Gwen interjected, \u201cCould you pay attention for a little bit and tell us if it said anything of interest?\u201d She asked him as he shook his head in negative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing obvious that's for sure then again I felt pretty fantastic with having super strength and coming to your house.\u201d He said scratching his head embarrassed a little bit from missing some crucial details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA SECT scientist written down some notes as he informed them coming from Kevin\u2019s boots, \u201cThat explains I suppose the extra sweat coming from your feet, must be a small side effect, not very harmful but this data doesn't make sense, from the sweat it says you are in peak performance, even above it.\u201d He said writing down more notes from this observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin looked at his feet to quizzically wiggle his sweaty toes, \u2018Extra sweaty huh?\u2019 He thought to himself as he allowed a small prideful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if there's a pod that came from somewhere wouldn't there be a sort of I don't know, launch coordinates? Could find the source?\u201d Gwen suggested to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and thank the guy!\u201d Ben blurted causing Kevin to high five him.<br>\r\nGwen rolled her eyes, though she had to admit her new position of power sent shivers of pleasure down her spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! You guys aren't taking this--... hold on...are you three getting bigger?\u201d Max said as his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, Gwen and Kevin began to notice those SECT trucks weren't looking so big now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah we are? Awesome!\u201d Ben said in glee as he Kevin and Gwen started to sprout up in size, the scientists and guards ran away to a safer distance as Gwen stood up with them as they expanded outwards and upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin wiggled his bigger and sweatier toes in pleasure as he sighed at the sensation that was going through him as was Ben as he commented, \u201cWe just keep going up eh Gwen?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen couldnt help but crack a smile at the poor attempt at humor but for some reason it felt right, \u201cCouldn't agree more with you Ben.\u201d She said with a smirk on her face as she saw her shoes growing more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, might get those guys to make new boots for me, these are too small for me.\u201d Kevin joked as he stomped his foot near the truck holding them, showing that his feet went past the toe section of them by a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they stopped they were around a size of 35 ft tall! Max gazed up in awe of his two grandkids and the troublemaker. \u201cAlright, we DEFINITELY need to find out how to reverse this.\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin scoffed, \u201cYeah right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs much as I don't wanna agree with b.o boy over here...he's got a point.\u201d Gwen smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed and pointed at Kevin for Gwen's nickname for him. Kevin retaliated by grabbing Ben in a headlock and giving him a noogie while Ben held his breath of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon being released, Ben smiled at grandpa Max. \u201cWe're unstoppable! We're gonna go have some fun! Later grandpa and SECT dorks!\u201d Ben waved as he and the other giants stomped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin had retrieved his boots, he'd elected to skewer his meaty toes through the front so they wouldn't be cramped so now the only part of his feet showing were his toes wiggling through the five individual holes each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou making a fashion statement, stinky?\u201d Gwen teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, you can say that, no way I ain't losing these boots, besides now people get a nice preview of my stink.\u201d Kevin said with a grin on his face, flexing his toes to waft his foot odor into the noses of the nervous SECT task force that was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I say let's bounce for now, anywhere of you guys want to go?\u201d Ben asked as he put his hands behind his head as they walked off, ignoring the people they left behind calling for them to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot too sure, then again there isn't much of a place to see in Bellwood, unless you want to visit school again?\u201d Gwen asked with a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it for a moment and the idea was rather appealing to him as he flashed her a mischievous smile ready to cause some real trouble for some people, one that Kevin was intrigued by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGonna trash the school?\u201d Kevin asked him curiously, Ben nodded in confirmation as Gwen giggled a bit at what is gonna happen, safe to say she was wanting to see how powerful they all are at this new size and how frankly unstoppable they will be later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bellwood elementary building was located separate from the high school, the trio supposed they could terrorize the older kids later.. something Kevin looked forward to since he'd had trouble with punks of a higher age who he knew went there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to it still being summer but close to the new school year's start, the faculty there were a few teachers and of course the principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Ben, these were some of his most hated authority figures who had given him a hard time during his attendance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school's windows vibrated with the footsteps of the trio. As they approached, Kevin spoke up. \u201cI think I'll let you solo this one, Ben. I ain't a student here, would be less personal for me.\u201d Kevin smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded, \u201cI'll jump in later, you get the spotlight for now.\u201d Gwen smiled at her cousin.</span></div></div>",

Enjoying the view of your favorite student?\u201d Ben sarcastically asked them with a devious smile on his face as he stomped closer to the school, seeing the faculty at the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw his feet standing right in front of them as he bent over to get a closer look at them, they backed away as his large green eyes looked upon them with amusement before he continued talking, \u201cI say the curriculum is pretty lacking if you asked me, too much work and not enough enjoyment from yours truly, so I\u2019d say\u2026\u201d He left off forebodingly as he stood back up and reared his fist back, before he then punched into the school\u2019s roof easily, considering that the school itself was about 1 floor with a basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSchool\u2019s cancelled permanently!\u201d He declared as he pulled back his fist, seeing the chunk of debris and dust that had showered the classroom, Ben chuckled in amusement before he had a wonderful idea in his head, one that would potentially traumatize the school faculty that he knows is in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a great idea that I\u2019m sure you teachers are gonna love.\u201d He said as he bent down and began to undo the laces of his shoes and pried them off with some effort considering they didn\u2019t grow properly with him when he was at the Arcade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, he popped off his shoes and allowed their reeking odor to leak out in front of them, going into the ventilation systems and slowly contaminating the air of the school, \u201cAh that feels nice.\u201d He moaned as he wiggled his toes in freedom, fanning the smell into the air and making it worse for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen of course hadn't been able to fit his bigger feet back into those rancid well worn socks of his, a fact which had disappointed him back at the arcade. However, upon smelling his just freed feet, he smirked at how the soaked insides of his sneakers had increased his potency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of gagging and swears made him chuckle mischievously, dropping the shoe with a mighty clunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrying off the other shoe soon after, Ben placed with his meaty feet down on the ground, wiggling his plump toes in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roofless school was cast in the shadow of Ben's bare foot, he grinned smugly and spread his pudgy toes as rancid sock lint and drops of murky sweat rained down onto the huddled, scared faculty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBenjamin Tennyson! Stop this immediately or else..!\u201d The principal tried to come up with a sufficient threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr else what? You\u2019ll suspend me from the school I don\u2019t even want to go to?\u201d He retorted back at him with a smirk of superiority over these people thinking they can tell him what to do, well no more on that front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his sweaty odorous foot down on top of the faculty as they tried to get away from it but unfortunately since the debris from him punching a hole in the roof and ceiling blocked the exit, making any chance of escape impossible and inhaling his giant foot all the more a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, you people are like little mice scurrying around, but its time for me to put my foot down on you people, starting with the good ol principal!\u201d He declared as he quickly aimed his foot right onto the man, covering most of his body with total ease as the man struggled under his warm foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, you make a nice insole Principal.\u201d Ben said in a low voice as his breathing quickened a little bit, riding on the highs of dominance as he wiggled his head-sized toes in comfort and making the life for his victim miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease let me go Tennyson I\u2019ll make you pass with all 100s! Please just let me go!\u201d He begged for his life as he was forced to inhale the pungent sweat and toejam that had accumulated between his toes and Ben was relishing in the suffering he was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, bargaining with me? You must be pretty desperate! But nah, grades don't really count for me anymore since as ya can tell\u2026.\u201d Ben leaned down and looked the teachers in the eyes and bellowed \u201cI HIT A GROWTH SPURT!!\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis roaring declaration caused the teachers\u2019 ears to ring and at least one of them to go deaf in one ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up, Ben lifted his rank foot off of the blubbering principal only for the man to come with it, adhered to Ben\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s homeroom teacher was well accustomed to the Tennyson boy's mischief, her name was Ms. Crabapple...and this had to be the biggest trouble Ben had ever caused for the school, pun intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully she wasn't too worried about being a revenge target like the notoriously cranky and strict principal who had a habit of chewing Ben and his friends out and passing out detentions like candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, given Ben's power high, that could change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think this is yours.\u201d He said teasingly lowering his foot with the stuck Principal who had been knocked unconscious by the fright and potent cheesy smells of his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other remaining faculty members quickly acted to extract him from Ben\u2019s sole as quick as possible lest the close proximity to the smelly foot take its toll on them as well. With a wet pop, they got him out of there as they rested him on a still standing desk as Ms.Crabapple looked up at Ben nervously as he seem to recognize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh is that you Ms.Crabapple? You were one of my favorite cool teachers, I did get pretty big didn't I?\u201d He said with an rather arrogant look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, that you did Ben but please you can't treat us like this.\u201d She pleaded to him, Ben rolled his eyes at her being overly dramatic, \u201cThe Principal was an annoying guy, not like you, so I\u2019m willing to cut a little something with ya.\u201d He said dropping a rather tantalizing deal on the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh? R-really? That's nice of you...um...thank you for saying I was your favorite by the way.\u201d She was starting to feel more at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled in a rather reassuring way as he explained, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get to tell everyone what you saw here! So I'm letting you go!\" He said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure...thank you Ben. Are you sure this'll be ok?\" The teacher said, grateful that she was on the titan's good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh, we\u2019re huge and frankly invulnerable, even to each other, and we're getting bigger by the hour.\u201d Ben informed her with a knowing smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...alright then..\u201d She said relenting and allowing Ben to pick her up with ease as the other teachers looked shocked that she gave in to his proposal just like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen held her gently in his cupped hand and brought her to his widely grinning face. She had to admit, he was every bit the childish kid she'd known...even as a mighty giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wait, you're gonna have lots to tell!\u201d Ben assured her before turning his attention back down to the rest of the teachers. \u201cWhat are YOU looking at, runts!? Kiss my toes!!\u201d Ben ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen closed his eyes and let out a relaxed sigh as he felt their kisses and knew he was in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were forced to kiss his sweaty plump toes each as big or bigger than their heads as they were forced to breathe in his awful foot odor as they dry heaved from the odor and even tasting the sweat as it sometimes drains through their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow since you\u2019re on board the train that has no breaks, I think you should get a front row seat to see the destruction of this school.\u201d He said winking at her before calling over to the two other giant/ess sitting a bit away from him as they talked to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Gwen! Kevin! You mind keeping an eye on my teacher?\u201d He asked them pointing to the woman with his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked confused before Gwen shrugged and said, \u201cSure I can watch her for you.\u201d She agreed and got up from her spot and walked over to her cousin, before he placed her carefully in her hand as she walked back to her spot with Ms.Crabapple in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that's outta the way, I think you guys did enough groveling for now and since you were so cooperative.\u201d He said smirking as he drew his foot back, as his heel broke a hole in the wall, allowing them to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScram since I can't really squish you people without having to clean the mess, but I can however do this\u2026\u201d He said with a sneer as he drove his thick foot through the school wall as the building shook from the impact, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoohoo! School Demolition is live!\u201d He declared as he swept his dirtied foot left and right, causing parts of the classrooms and halls to be totaled as he began his onslaught on the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrabapple's eye twitched annoyedly \u201cThere goes my job\u2026\u201d <br>\r\nGwen giggled, \u201cGuess you should start looking for new employment.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin snorted, \u201cYeah, I could always use an armpit scratcher.\u201d He smirked menacingly and reached for the now terrified teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant Ben's shoe flew over, hit him in the face and knocked him to the ground. \u201cGet a different tiny to scratch your gross pits!!\u201d Ben roared, now standing in smoky ruins with one shoe on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin rubbed the spot where he got hit more out of habit than any real pain as he picked up the thrown shoe and tossed it back to him to catch.</span></div></div>",

Anyhow, see you later, teach!\" Ben snickered as Gwen placed Crabapple on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly ran away, casting glances over her shoulder at her student and his two accomplices. \"I have a feeling things are going to change even more around here...\" She mumbled as she got in her car and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..what now?\" Gwen asked the two boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to have my fun smashing some place important, sticking to the man right?\u201d Kevin joked as he and Gwen got up and walked to Ben who was fitting back on his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?

Rest and then come terrorize the amusement park tomorrow?\u201d Gwen asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure why not?\u201d Ben said his eyes alight with the prospect of going to an amusement park at this new size of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin saw from the corner of his eyes a fleeing teacher as he quickly bent down and snatched him up as he chuckled in amusement, \u201cNow I don't think this guy is off limits right?\u201d He asked Ben waving the Gym Teacher in front of him as the man screamed in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smirked as he sat his rump down on top of the rubble and stretched as he tried to force back a yawn. \u201cNah, do whatever ya want.

However, the carnies and guests paid it no mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blaring rock music and sounds of the rides were all that could be heard,so they assumed it was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ticket booth guy soon was met by the sight of three gigantic shoe clad feet, one of which had ten meaty toes poking out of boots. Gazing up, he saw three kids who were grinning smugly down at him in his puny admission booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose on the ferris wheel got a bird's eye view of these 'guests\u2019.

Now I believe your toe spaces need filled.\u201d Gwen giggled before crawling over to his feet and snatching up the rest of Kevin's foot slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, time to spread these sexy toes wiiide open!\u201d Kevin licked his lips and did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smushed them, one by one into the grime filled spaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake em squirm, babe.\u201d Kevin closed his eyes in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the last one in his toe crevice as he closed them and let their feeble struggling do the rest of the work in entertaining him and Gwen, they was surrounded by grime and sweat, the place like a sauna in how hot it was to them by his body heat and the sun shining down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you feel them just wiggling down there?\u201d Gwen asked him with a smirk on her face seeing his large thick toes flexed in pleasure of the sensation of their prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know it.\u201d He said to her before he saw her wink at him and then went to his feet, she subtly licked her lips before she licked up and down his sweaty meaty sole as she grinned, hearing him moan in pleasure at the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis toes curled in joy as the people in between them was crushed and compacted between them adding to whatever build up was going on in there, \u201cOh man that felt good Gwen, keep it up!\u201d He requested of her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both Gwen and Kevin felt a tingling sensation before they rocketed up to 80 ft in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course made them even happier...and sweatier of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, your feet are so huuge and POWERFUL.\u201d Gwen said, planting a kiss on Kevin\u2019s now glistening sole as it leaked sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanna suck your toes and eat your DELICIOUS grime.\u201d Gwen said lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo right ahead, toejam buffet is always open. Got some mashed tinies in there too.\u201d Kevin winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed she did, Gwen sniffed in between his toes much to both of their pleasure, he placed his hand subtly on his crotch and groped it softly as Gwen then began her foot worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth over the toes and sucked on them, enjoying the enriching taste of his sweat and toejam as he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah...suck on my big toes.\u201d He said lustfully and sighed, feeling her tongue licking in between getting in all the nice tangy toejam and the tinies that were crushed against his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out his toes as she licked his thick soles with gusto as they moaned pleasurably.</span></div></div>",

Frankly she was already great but who could pass up a chance to be even greater?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Toph, what will it be? Do you want the vial that will give you power beyond imagining?\u201d She asked her in a suspenseful tone to her with a wry grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, how much is it?\u201d She asked her curiously, since every pawn shop has a price for something these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c10 Coins.\u201d The shopkeeper replied blandly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d She agreed to these terms, taking 10 gold coins out of her pocket and placed it on the table as she grinned at the possibilities she might do with these new powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks kid, here ya go.\u201d She told her as she handed her the green vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph swiped it and uncorked it immediately, \u201cWait!\u201d The woman halted her from bringing the liquid up to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaat? You got your money!\u201d Toph snapped before making a show of chugging the whole vial before belching at the shopkeeper. \u201cYou can keep this to tell people you helped the most powerful Earth-Bender!\u201d Toph dropped the vial onto the counter and walked away laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper was stunned and couldn\u2019t help but feel as if she\u2019d just unleashed something terrible upon the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph marched through the streets of Gaoling, head held high and ego being inflated as her mind was filled with thoughts of being \u2018Queen of Earthbending\u2019 and things of that nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t notice the heavy footprints she was beginning to leave on the ground as she inched up in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as one could tell, Toph was one that was a bit short for her age, as the people walking down the roads looked a bit curious at the fact that she was leaving foot shaped indents in the dirt with her feet, it seems like whatever was in that vial, she was not only growing in size but in strength as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever they wrote it off as just being the trick of the light or something considering that any inches she gained it wouldn\u2019t be enough to be noticed as easy especially as she was moving down the road and as they say, out of sight, out of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Heh, I wonder how much I can do with these enhanced powers, maybe I can test them out at that Earth Rumble underground tournament, heard it was 6 this time.\u2019 She thought to herself, they seem to hold it every month so plenty of time to get in and have some fun with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph hitched a ride on a wagon, earning a few stares when the wagon groaned under her slightly increased weight, back to the Bei Fong estate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking back in and donning her formal attire (couldn\u2019t have her parents finding out about the whole \u2018Blind Bandit\u2019 thing after all), Toph wandered out into the garden, already knowing her mother was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething strange happened then, it was almost as if Toph was suddenly able to make out more detail through her feet\u2019s sensitivity on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother: Poppy Bei Fong, patted the seat next to her to indicate Toph to sit beside her. However, Poppy\u2019s eyes slightly widened, and Toph could somehow sense this. \u201cToph, have you gotten taller?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yes mother, I must\u2019ve been going through some puberty lately.\u201d She told her politely, not wanting to give away that she went anywhere this entire day, that would be one heck of an explanation to give them, and the extra security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful Toph, you\u2019ll soon grow up to be a beautiful woman, I should ask your teacher to be wary of any boys going near you.\u201d She said in a light teasing tone to which Toph blushed at the suggestion, that would be embarrassing to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that mom I can take care of them.\u201d She implored her to not do that, it\u2019s a bit too much considering how she\u2019s already being pigeon-holed already to basic Earthbending techniques when she knows a lot more than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Toph. You shouldn\u2019t trouble yourself with them, boys will be boys after all. Either way, I was merely joking.\u201d Poppy chuckled. Toph breathed a quiet sigh of relief, dodged a bullet there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEarth Rumble Tournament is this weekend...I can\u2019t have myself being doted on or followed, or the Blind Bandit\u2019s career is over.\u201d Toph thought to herself, whatever these new powers of hers were, this was sure to be fun testing them out on challengers at the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was Thursday, the Earth Rumble Underground Tournament was held Friday through Saturday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was for sure, by Friday night...The Blind Bandit was sure to make a ruckus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next afternoon, the Earth Rumble Tournament was sold out, snacks were being bought as people filtered into the arena. </span></div></div>",

The tournament is sold out!\u201d Xin Fu was thrown into a panic...that is until the floor began to vibrate from a series of stomps coming up behind the promoter and host of Earth Rumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook with a rhythm similar to footsteps as he turned around to see and then had to look up to the sneering face of Toph whom had grew to about eight feet tall, far from the little girl she used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down little man, wouldn\u2019t want you to waste your money on all these people showing up for me now would you?\u201d She rhetorically asked him, now Xin Fu was no average sized man but his head coming to level with her chest made him feel quite intimidated by her as she walked past him and to the area where they were holding the other contestants, leaving the stupefied man behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, looks like the new and improved Blind Bandit has made it to Earth Rumble Six! Let\u2019s hear it for her!\u201d He hollered out to the crowd as they cheered out her name making Toph grin in anticipation of the coming matches as she sensed her opponents\u2019 heart rates going up at seeing her towering over most of the opposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the growth persisting in the background, it would make the competitors lives harder than the other unlucky sap pitted against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first opponent Toph would face would be a burly man calling himself The Boulder. Toph gave a wicked smirk at the man who only came up below her chin. She could sense his fear..and it pumped her up even more to know that her mere presence was causing such anxiety in challengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe B-Boulder doesn\u2019t find it satisfying to be facing a mere child! No matter how humongous she may be!\u201d The Boulder tried to sound intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph merely scoffed and sneered at The Boulder as if he were a mere insect in her way. \u201cThe Boulder? Y\u2019sure about that? You look more like The Pebble from up here!\u201d She burst into mocking laughter, along with some of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boulder clenched his fists and teeth at the mocking laughter from the crowds and his opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gong was rung, and the match was set to begin. The Boulder gave a battle cry and summoned two walls of rock on either side of Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Boulder will be fine with pummeling you!\u201d The objects began to smash together on either side of a yawning Toph..who merely put her hands out to her sides and shattered the oncoming projectiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking at the shocked Boulder\u2019s face, Toph didn\u2019t notice herself getting a bit bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both didn't notice it, but Toph\u2019s feet slowly grew wider and covered more of the stone tiles on the arena floor as the cracks slowly edged out from there, it was a snail's pace practically but something that would be noticed more later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of Earthbending was that? My hands just shattered your rock wall Pebble.\u201d She taunted at the man as she cracked her knuckles and with a shift of her right foot forward, the the 4 floor tiles in front of her rose up by a foot and sent straight towards The Boulder like a stone wave at rather fast speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to put up a barrier before they hit but only barely and the force of it sent him flying back from the impact. \u201cWhat a wuss! I barely put any effort into that.\u201d Toph mocked his attempt at defense while inside she was beaming with excitement, she really didn't put much into it and here he was sprawled out across the floor, she couldn't wait to see just what else she can do with her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph grinned as she began to stomp across the arena tiles toward the winded Boulder. As the rather pudgy man attempted to wobble to his feet, the quakes she was making caused him to flop onto his back once more. Toph pinned him to the floor with a wide and ever slowly expanding foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boulder wheezed as the mischievous girl ground her sole into his belly, the crowd was enthralled by this display of dominance and were chanting \u2018Blind Bandit!\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing his hand on the floor, Boulder sent a hurl of rocks toward Toph to get her off of him. Toph smirked and hopped backwards, lifting one foot and letting the rocks impact her wide sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dust cleared, Boulder had staggered to his feet and saw Toph holding her foot up, sole facing him and toes wiggling tauntingly...sprinkling toe grime and the rocks which had been reduced to rubble onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re outta luck Pebble.\u201d She said mocking his efforts before she walked back over to the man on the floor as she lifted her foot over him and stepped on his face, just enough to cause him some pain but not to completely smash it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis screaming was muffled by the sole and the crowd\u2019s cheering Toph on for her display of violence and humiliation, after this night was over, The Boulder would be pretty humbled after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could smell nothing but the sweat and musky foot odor that was propagated by the rather intense lighting from above, he flailed around and struggled as much as he could before he exhausted himself and inhaled even more of her foot odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can always tap out you know, there\u2019s no shame to being beaten by a blind girl\u2019s foot alone.\u201d Toph taunted him and lifted her foot off of him to see his sweat covered face wrapped in abject terror and disgust from the odor he had faced. It was time to cut losses and fold them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tapped the ground three times before the gong sound signalling that the match was over for him as Toph squatted next to him and said, \u201cYou know, doing what you did is pretty much the smartest thing a person can do, thanks for doing that Pebble.\u201d She said before standing up and punted him over to the edge of the arena for the medics to take him to the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd roared in approval and chanted her stage-name, Toph held her hands up in victory and worked the crowd up more.</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t know what the brat had done to make herself get so big and strong, but what he DID know was that she was gonna make him a LOT of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor quaked as Blind Bandit marched proudly backstage, smirking as she passed the other competitors and made sure to put in a bit of extra \u2018oomph\u2019 into her footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it just me...or is she looking even b-bigger?\u201d She heard one of the quivering soon-to-be opponents whisper. She made sure she stomped REALLY hard when she passed him, he squealed like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing, kid! I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re getting so big, but it\u2019s gonna make you absolutely famous!\u201d Xin Fu said, his eyes practically turning into dollar signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph felt her ego swell even more...she really would be the biggest and baddest Earth Bender in the world if this kept up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, she might not even NEED Xin Fu for that...but she\u2019ll see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, if you say so, just keep them matches coming and I might stay a bit longer.\u201d She told him, wanting to make it clear that she can simply take her business and fans elsewhere if there\u2019s no fun to be had in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course kid, whatever you want, just keep up the good work!\u201d He said laughing a little as the others grew pale with fear, so they were reduced to being a punching bag for a girl that practically towers over them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear.\u201d Toph said chuckling before turning to the other competitors, \u201cAlright you little girls, I  think if you\u2019d like your time to be a pleasant one here, I\u2019d expect you to do your best, no lackluster fighting or else, got it?\u201d She told them with a stomp of her foot for emphasis, making the others jump slightly in place from the force of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded frantically not wanting to get on her bad side, \u201cGood.\u201d She said grinning haughtily with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next fight was coming up in a few moments, Toph sat sprawled out on a bench all to herself, \u2018eyeing\u2019 up her competition menacingly. She enjoyed the fear she could produce in them, in a cruel way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing one foot over her knee, sole facing the lineup of soon opponents on their chairs, Toph playfully wiggled her plump toes and scrunched her sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the group couldn\u2019t swear to it...but did her feet look bigger? They didn\u2019t focus on it too much, as the rank foot odor she was wafting at them was shaking them to their core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph closed her eyes and sighed in relaxation, she was really enjoying putting the fear into these losers. And not to mention the fact that she could faintly feel herself growing more and more powerful if she focused really hard, it probably might be uncontrollable but she has no problems with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other competitors were practically quaking in their boots from the power she had over them, they don't know why but they were filled with a sense of dread seeing her Amazon sized body despite having the same proportions as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bench creaked with every shifting movement she made as the smell wafted through the air, \u201cYou people quaking already from just my foot odor? Man you guys are some babies, that still won't save you from getting out of these matches since it looks like each of you gotta have some private time with them.\u201d Toph taunted them with a mocking laugh, wiggling her toes at them, as her heels stuck out slightly over the edge of her bench even while laying down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed before Xin Fu returned, by that time Toph had grown a bit more and her feet were hanging off the end of the bench and in front of the closest competitors face. Toph of course was aware of this and took pleasure in wafting her toes at him, causing him to turn a bit green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her body ever slowly increasing in size, her sweat output had been ramped up, seemingly a side effect\u2026.but quite the amusing one in Toph\u2019s opinion. Xin Fu pointed to the cringing young man, \u201cRockslide! You\u2019re up against Blind Bandit!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph could hear the so called Rockslide whimpering a bit as he stood up to walk out onto the arena, Toph leaped from the bench and caused a mini-earthquake which staggered her next opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there smirking down at him with her hands on her hips and patted him on the head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry...I won\u2019t hurt ya TOO bad.\u201d She stomped out onto the arena, laughing uproariously as the sounds of the crowd cheering met their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next three matches went by one after another and all ending in the same relative fashion. Toph mocked her opponent and depending upon the person they were either already terrified of her or were stubbornly brave. The latter ones she took extra care to break down until they were a defeated, cowering mess at her less than clean feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no question in Xin Fu or any of the remaining competitors minds: Toph WAS indeed growing bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the fact that this was a tournament, there was an hour intervention before the latter half of the tournament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph by this time had grown to 12 ft. in height and was loving every second of it. Her soles had left wet imprints all over the arena tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently the Blind Bandit was seated in the room which she currently took up a lot of space in, eating from a bag of chips and drinking a soda. She was using a couple of former competitors who had forfeited as footstools, a fitting punishment for their cowardice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey groaned in exertion from trying to hold up her large feet on their backs, hands and knees buckling slightly from trying to keep up the appendages that was as big as a torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, did you guys see that last match where I spent minutes just destroying all of his rocks and walls by walking through it?\u201d She asked them with a smirk as she ate her chips, she knows they probably was watching that last one but she wanted to rub it in the guy that was holding up her left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other losers were busy fanning her and catering to snack resupply when she finishes inhaling the bag of chips practically, the next bunch of competitors felt sorry for the losers and for themselves since they too will inevitably fall to this mountain of a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on after the break the footstools were practically pressed against the ground as her incrementally increasing weight was making it harder and harder to hold up as she sneered and got up. \u201cWhat wimps.\u201d She commented on how they were breathing for air as she told the others, \u201cSee you guys in the ring.\u201d She taunted them and went away, the ground shaking slightly with her footsteps.</span></div></div>",

Um...no pun intended.\u201d Xin Fu nervously added on to his praises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph now loomed over the man at a whopping 17 ft. She had fought and grown long into the night. It was now far past any reasonable kid's bedtime, but Toph was full of energy and adrenaline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she wasn't exactly an ordinary child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reply to his praise, Toph grinned smugly, this guy was completely under her thumb. She'd get anything she wanted from him provided she keeps cash coming in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA desire to have everyone at her whims had begun to sprout within her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you like to be the face of Earth Rumble? We could triple your pay and perks! You'd be a star, a BIG star!!\u201d Xin Fu made the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll be sure to get in some major cash for ya.\u201d Toph said looking down at the man at her feet, from what she can sense she was nearly the size of an average house, as tall as one anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll see what we can work out tomorrow, see you here.\u201d He told her as he walked home with his new earnings, this kid could be a real cash cow for him in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph nodded as she walked off into the night, with everyone sleeping around these times not many were up tonight to see her walking about, though some were wondering why the ground was shaking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the dilemma of her being sighted by her parents as a 17ft tall Earthbender and counting, they\u2019d just try and keep her all locked up like some monster. \u201cBah they don't know what is best for me, I\u2019m tough, I can do this all by myself.\u201d She muttered to herself as she walked about the place leaving trails of footprints in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at this ridiculous hour of the night, Toph could tell there had been an improvement in her senses. She couldn\u2019t see through her eyes, but her sense of chi had seemingly been pumped up to where she could sense details and features of people via their chi pathways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soles of her feet were now able to tell her more about her surroundings than ever before, making being huge even more enjoyable than it might otherwise have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood next to a building with her hands on her hips, grinning at the place which she was able to peer into the windows of with no trouble at all. It was certainly fun being big! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer enormous ears picked up a sound coming from a nearby alleyway, someone was being mugged!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph grinned smugly, time to have some MORE fun! She stomped around the side of the building and \u2018saw\u2019 the scene. A thug had cornered a kid and was holding a knife, threatening the sniffling little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph could \u2018see\u2019 that this boy had obviously been in the audience at the tournament, and could make out details of a shirt he was wearing that said: \u2018Blind Bandit\u2019 on it and held an action figure of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cXin Fu must\u2019ve really went all in on the merch\u2026\u201d Toph thought before cracking her knuckles and gaining the thug and his victim\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy\u2019s bright eyes went wide and he gasped, \u201cIt\u2019s really you! The Blind Bandit! You\u2019re in for it now ya big bully!\u201d He stuck his tongue out at the mugger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe heck are you talking about?\u201d He demanded incredulously before he heard Toph clear her throat and turned around before whatever threat he had in store died in his mouth as he saw the 17 ft tall and counting girl standing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you!?\u201d He questioned as he dropped the knife unconsciously, not that it would do him any good against skin that tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe person that\u2019s gonna beat the crap out of you in ten seconds unless you get outta here and away from the kid.\u201d She warned him tapping her foot and making the ground shake slightly from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further prompting, the would be robber ran for his life running between her legs and having to briefly deal with the ridiculous musk emitting from her sweaty feet and coughing in the process, until he made his way down the street screaming in fear all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, serves him right.\u201d Toph said with hands on her hips, smirking, before her lips drew to a straight line as she looked down at the kid and kneeled down, \u201cYou alright kid?\u201d She asked him in concern, hoping the idiot didn't rough him up too badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks to you Blind Bandit! You\u2019re so awesome! Thanks for saving me!\u201d The innocent boy said, clearly star-struck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph grinned widely, \u201cYeah, no biggie. I gotta look out for the fans, ya know?\u201d She answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy scurried away, waving goodbye as he parted ways with his hero. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see when you fight next! I hope you get even BIGGER!\u201d The boy said over his shoulder, causing Toph to smirk and answer: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, kid! I will!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, Toph could already feel herself growing a bit more as power coursed through her body. \u201cYeah...that\u2019s not gonna be a problem. Not like finding a place to stay\u2026\u201d Toph mumbled thoughtfully to herself.</span></div></div>",

Lemme in or I\u2019ll bust the door down! It wouldn\u2019t be a problem for your BIGGEST money maker!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXin Fu opened the door and found himself staring at Toph\u2019s legs and her colossal feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had grown AGAIN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck? Blind Bandit how did you know where I lived?\u201d He asked incredulously, he knows that she can sense things through the earth but to be able to track him from this distance, that was a bit scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy earth sensing abilities have been getting better and better, now I can practically track down specific heartbeats, cool right?\u201d She asked him rhetorically as she got on her hands and knees so he can get a look at her face, suffice to say, Toph was about 20ft tall by the time she got to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that doesn't answer the question of why you are here to begin with.\u201d Xin Fu questioned Toph, who smiled a bit at his question, \u201cWell if I\u2019m being honest, the place where I was at is getting too small for me, so I\u2019m crashing in with you.\u201d She told him with no room for argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what? You\u2019re not living here period, go find your own house to crash in.\u201d He rebuked her statement and stupidly decided to close the door to her face, which was in a sense a bad move to make considering she likes having a little challenge every now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph chuckled deeply, so that was how he wanted to play was it? A sudden quake rocked the entire house and sent Xin Fu sprawling onto his back in front of the slammed door. Toph had merely just flopped onto her rump, imagine what damage she could do if she was actually doing something...well violent? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXin Fu didn\u2019t know what had just happened, but he could imagine that Toph wasn\u2019t exactly pleased with how he\u2019d rudely rejected her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he\u2019d started to think he\u2019d been too harsh and most likely hurt her feelings...Toph reared back her stinky and increasingly sweaty barefoot and slammed it through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump young foot reduced the door to splinters and Xin Fu was promptly given a face full of soft, squishy yet firm sole that stunk to high heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was thrown back from the force of it as he was unfortunate to take a whole lungful of the foot odor and perspiration of sweat that was on the sole, before he tumbled back and hit the base of the beginning of the staircase, it was the small mercies that he had a large central living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I bet that knock got through to you huh? So what were you saying now?\u201d She asked in a taunting tone as she wiggled her toes at him as if to dare him to say otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay you can stay where ever you want just please don't trash anymore of my house!\u201d He pleaded with her. It was a few seconds before the foot soon receded through the entrance it had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad we can work something out, now it might be a tight squeeze for me.\u201d Toph said before she got onto her hands and knees and started to crawl in through the hole she made, tearing up and gouging a bigger hole in the wall in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXin Fu clenched his hands on the sides of his scalp in horror as he watched her grunt and squeeze her rump through the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-be careful-!\u201d Xin Fu started to exclaim, only for the hole to be made even wider as she jerked her lower half through and into his living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew, that\u2019s better!\u201d She flopped on her backside and looked around, surprised she had a lot more space than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo uh...how are you going to get OUT?\u201d Xin Fu inquired.<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, little fella! You\u2019ll get compensated for all of this damage\u2026.and the rest of it when I get bigger.\u201d Toph grinned slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-bigger?! No no no no! You\u2019re going to outgrow the house or something! Make it stop!\u201d Xin Fu demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph merely scoffed and flexed her plump toes at him, sending him into a hacking fit. \u201cI don\u2019t think I asked YOUR opinion...and besides, I\u2019m your BIG star remember? If you want..I can just take my talents elsewhere.\u201d She turned up her nose at him haughtily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait, hold on! I just uh...don\u2019t want you destroying my house is all. Please don\u2019t leave\u2026\u201d Xin Fu begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph grinned smugly, \u201cThen I suggest you put all that cash I got you to good use and build ME a nice palace or mansion or something. After all, I\u2019m gonna be the Earthbending Queen. I appreciate you letting me stay here and all but\u2026.it\u2019s a little cramped.\u201d Toph joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEarthbending Queen?\u201d Xin Fu raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d Toph relaxed back with her hands behind her head, her upper half reaching into the dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s kinda chilly with that draft coming in, go get me some blankets and pillows! And make me some food...I\u2019m starving after my tournament victory!\u201d Toph demanded, he heard her stomach growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXin Fu growled slightly but stifled any scathing response to her ordering him around like some maid, he went to the kitchen to go grab some food from the fridge that apparently he now has to go and overstock to give Toph a new supply of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the very least the comfort that it's only until he finds a construction crew that can build a big enough palace to hold her in was a small one, but it was something that can make him put up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph chuckled as she \u2018saw\u2019 him walk to the kitchen, it was awesome using her size to just boss him around like some sort of queen, though at the rate she was getting more power and size queen might soon not be enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Heh, this is so cool, and to think its STILL not done growing, maybe I\u2019ll just be growing forever.\u2019 She thought to herself arrogantly, imagining armies of Firebenders or whatever just throwing themselves in droves as her massive feet just stomp them into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was soon that he brought back a bag full of food for her to eat as he placed it beside her. \u201cThank you, now go get my blankets and pillows!\u201d She ordered him to do so as he then ran up the stairs to go get what she demanded, she then chuckled and placed her hands behind her head and relaxed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-About Two Weeks later\u2026-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXin Fu was run ragged by Toph in the following weeks. Her demands and attitude had gotten totally out of hand, getting worse with each growth spurt as her ego swelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t help that his house had to undergo extensive (and expensive) repairs thanks to Toph literally outgrowing it. Not that the self-proclaimed Earthbending Queen cared, she was too full of herself and her new power to bother with petty things like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the Blind Bandit, her increasing size gave her quite the following, even more fans than before! Her exploits had reached all throughout the Earth Kingdom, and the Earth Rumble had been moved to a bigger arena both for seating purposes and the fact that Toph was having trouble fitting on the arena floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was riding high on a wave of cash flow and the sheer power afforded her thanks to her increasing size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had now reached 35ft in height and it seemed nothing could stop her now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was the day that Toph was coming to inspect her palace\u2019s finished work. Xin Fu hoped it was to her liking and she\u2019d finally have a place to stay that WASN\u2019T his devastated house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook, signalling the titan of a girl\u2019s approach. People in the streets moved out of her way, both not to be crushed and to flee from the terrible foot odor and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shaked as Toph came into view of the palace, she gotten even stronger with her sensory abilities and able to pick out the finer details in the area as she stepped towards the area and whistled in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow guys, didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to get it done so soon.\u201d She praised them though she suppose that Xin Fu wanted her to get out of the house as soon as possible, which meant from the massive earnings to speed up the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe construction lead worker came up to her as she then told Toph, \u201cYeah, didn\u2019t think so too, but I bet your client didn\u2019t want to handle you for much longer.\u201d She said chuckling a bit as well as Toph, \u201cHmm, so how is it inside?\u201d She wondered looking over the place, it felt big enough from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it should be good enough to last you for awhile, I could give you a tour to show you.\u201d She offered to Toph looking over the construction paper and the deed to the palace that she should probably find someone to sign in her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I can\u2019t wait to see my Earth Queen throne!\u201d Toph declared excitedly. The construction head paled then as she questioned: \u201cT-throne, ma\u2019am?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph could sense the woman\u2019s anxiety and narrowed her eyes menacingly at her. \u201cUh, yeah. I\u2019m the Earthbending Queen after all!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, of course! Xin Fu must\u2019ve neglected to mention that! But we DID include one, an extravagant and comfortable one! Complete with footstool!\u201d The woman fearfully said upon looking at the plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood call and just a heads up? I\u2019m growing again.\u201d Toph grinned smugly as she felt the oncoming growth spurt...as well as her sweat glands getting fired up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blind Bandit wiped sweat from her brow as she shot up to 40 ft and stood with her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019d better still have LOTS of room in there!\u201d Toph boomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes of course, my Queen!\u201d The woman at Toph\u2019s gargantuan toes exclaimed. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just take a look around for myself, you\u2019re a bit too tiny to keep up with me!\u201d Toph roared with taunting laughter as she stepped directly over the woman and the workers, holding her sole over their heads for a moment before approaching the entrance to her palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe construction lead designer watched as the girl walked into her new home as she sighed tired and muttered to herself, \u201cKids these days\u2026\u201d She said dropping her shoulders and walking away to a cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph walked through the living area of her palace, since she isn't that gaudy for attempts of narcissistic viewing of statues, she thinks having 2 statues of her awesome self in the Living Room and Bed room should do. Her footsteps made light thumps in the ground but fortunately the floor work was sturdy enough to not leave behind footprints all over the place, unless she felt like it anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully my powers get good enough for me to see color, I hope they didn't go overboard with gold and white or whatever.\u201d She wondered at the idea, in actuality it was actually a more greenish silver that was used for painting the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut credits where credit worth due the place felt like she was normal sized maybe even a bit less, the wonders of what lighting a fire under Xin Fu\u2019s butt could do for her. \u201cAnd to think I\u2019ll just get more powerful down the line, maybe I can get rid of those stupid Fire Nation people.\u201d She mused.<br>\r\nToph flopped into her enormous throne with a sigh, propping her plump and incredibly sweaty and reeking feet onto the green cushioned footstool before her. \u201cThis is the life\u2026\u201d She groaned and relaxed back.</span></div></div>",

She had gotten so powerful that when she decided to have her way with Gaoling one bored afternoon, the people could do nothing but attempt to play along with her in what she called \u2018Tophzilla\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blind Bandit had kept her career going, she was famous throughout the entire Earth Kingdom as being an undefeated champion who took pleasure in tormenting and humiliating her opponents...and anyone else really. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expansive shadow befell a row of buildings as the townspeople screamed and ran around in a panic. They heard her rumbling voice mock them: \u201cWell well, what have we here? A bunch of puny bugs!\u201d Her voice rattled the windows of nearby buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose closest to her feet were now doubled over with their hands clutched over their mouth and noses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Toph wasn\u2019t a fan of baths, as everyone knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph could hear their gagging and it made her laugh to know her mere foot odor had such power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fled as fast as they could away from Toph to safety, the people was wondering when she would eventually get around to flexing her power over everyone in this town, at first it was rather minor bullying in the form of disrupting traffic and what not, but eventually it went to a downward spiral from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph chuckled at them running away from her as she called out to them, \u201cHey where you guys think you\u2019re going?\u201d She then started to leisurely chase after them as she kicked over an abandoned cart absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised a foot over a house and grinned in anticipation, she was waiting for quite a bit to try this out. Toph then stomped down on the structure as it seem to explode in a cloud of wood and concrete, \u201cMan this is some awesome stuff.\u201d She said grinning with a slight blush on her face from the rush of trivially destroying property, she flexed her toes in the middle of the debris and lifted up her foot from it and continued on her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of people were hiding in a building that only came up to Toph\u2019s shins, it wasn\u2019t exactly a large structure. Toph smirked as she could sense the trembling group who thought they could hide from her. Toph crossed her arms and pretended like she couldn\u2019t find them, \u201cOh no! I can\u2019t find them! Where could they have gone?\u201d She proceeded to flop her butt down on a building across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe casually looked up at the sky and pressed her plump dirtied toes against the windows, causing them to fog up and crack a little. \u201cSigh\u2026.I guess I\u2019ll just have to give up!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph\u2019s toes were causing spiderwebs of cracks to appear in the windows, she pretended to just notice them screaming. \u201cDid I hear something..?\u201d She asked no one in particular..just as her toes increased the pressure she was putting on the building and smashed through the front wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay! We\u2019ll come out!\u201d The man yelled up at the gargantuan bully. Toph grinned slyly and stood up, \u201cHuh? Did someone say something?\u201d She casually raised her foot, and of course pretended not to notice the man...as she promptly stepped on him and pinned him beneath her wide sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other people inside the damaged building screamed in horror, thinking she\u2019d just killed the poor man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she lifted up her foot from the man it was revealed that she simply forced him into the ground, like literally into the ground in an outline of him, Toph is many things, and a Troll is one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, you should\u2019ve seen the looks on your faces when you thought I stepped on him.\u201d She said laughing from her own prank, she was able to make rather quick displays of Earthbending at this size that it was barely perceivable to others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat being said, don't think that you\u2019re not in danger.\u201d She reminded them as she flexed her toes for emphasis, spreading her pungent odor at the crowd that was in front of a building in the square to which they coughed and choked in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization that they are still in danger of having their noses rotted to nothing from her feet made sure to kick the crowd back into high gear in fleeing from her as she sneered at them and moved on after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph made sure to really put the extra force into her stomps, rattling buildings and in some cases causing plaster to fall from ceilings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph roared with mocking laughter as she sent the townsfolk into a panic. This was great! She could do whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted to WHOEVER she wanted! She was unstoppable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuahahahaha! Look out puny mortals! The Earthbending Queen has ARRIVED!\u201d Toph bellowed as she lifted her foul smelling foot and smashed it down onto a local shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor shopkeeper had never seen anything like it, a gigantic foot crashing through his ceiling that obliterated his entire livelihood like it was made out of paper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph peeked inside and stuck her tongue out, \u201cSucks for you!\u201d she snarked before continuing on her reign of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the local law enforcement decided to step in..as foolish as that was to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop your attack, giant girl! We are to escort you back to your parent\u2019s estate!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly at the threat they made to try and take her back to her Parents, ever since she had to kinda break the news to her parents, they were at first tried to used their authority over her only to be rebuked by the garden getting a bit of a redecorating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah that's not gonna happen pal, run along or else.\u201d She threatened them in return as she stomped closer to them towering over the Earth Kingdom police with her slowly increasing body and glared at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you won't come willingly then we have to take you by force.\u201d The leader of the squad of Earthbenders declared though he was a bit hesitant to try to take on this giant girl, he was bound by duty to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man by all means go ahead and try.\u201d Toph invited him to do so with a challenging smile on her face knowing that it would only end with them beaten to a pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well! Restrain her!\u201d The other two Earthbenders formed large chains made of rock from the ground which wrapped around Toph. Toph burst into laughter as she merely broke free like they were made of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that supposed to be?!\u201d Toph mocked as she lifted her foot and flexed her toes, wafting rotten foot odor down upon the now gagging  Earthbenders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t have anything to say?\u201d Toph sneered and stomped her foot down, thankfully the Earthbenders jumped out of the way in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earthbenders had hopped onto rooftops which barely came up to Toph\u2019s torso.<br>\r\nShe scowled as a prison made of Earth formed around her like a cage. The Earthbenders added layer after layer of thick rock bars to it in an attempt to prevent her from escaping so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph scoffed and reared her fist back, smashing through the side of the cage and grabbing a screaming Earthbender in her fist.</span></div></div>",

A grand attempt at holding me, nothing can stop me don't you get it?\u201d She boasted arrogantly and threw him at a building making him skid off the rooftops in pain from the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph then raised her foot and stomped down hard on the ground, causing a large crack to travel up from where she impacted and to the cage where it seem to explode outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee how pointless it is, just go home and let a girl have her fun.\u201d She told them to which they answered back with a large blunt Rock spike to jut out of the ground and strike her in the stomach rather hard, making her stagger a bit and tripped on a house behind her, as she fell back and smashed it underneath her body, sending up a lot of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining Earthbenders walked to the site while one of them asked out loud, \u201cDid we get her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir answer was a low growl which turned into a roar of anger. \u201cRrrrrAAGH! You\u2019re really ticking me off!\u201d As the smoke cleared, the Earthbenders would see the tomboyish Blind Bandit had increased in height and was STILL growing thanks to her rage. She stood there, at close to 55ft in height, glowering down at her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just lost your chance to get outta this.\u201d She said dangerously as she utilized her enhanced Earthbending skills to send pillars smashing into their backs, most likely causing more damage than intended to their bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her foot up, she let them impact her sole and in an instant smashed this foot down, pinning them beneath mountains of stinky foot flesh as she ground them into the dirt. \u201cYou\u2019d better start kissing up if ya wanna survive!\u201d Toph roared with a sinister grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey groaned in pain as Toph grinded her foot onto their bodies, causing them copious amounts of pain. But still they resisted her attempts at dominance by not giving in to her demands, at least for a little while longer while their bones were feeling the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at the entrance of Gaoling, a familiar trio was standing there looking for the girl that was in Aang\u2019s vision of whom would teach him about Earthbending, though in another timeline it would had been easy though with its own set of issues, this one might be a bit harder to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara looked concerned by the smoke billowing from multiple building in the distance as she wondered, \u201cI hope this is the right place, had the Fire Nation attacked this town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know about you but I think this place kinda smells a bit don't you think?\u201d Sokka commented, fanning his nose from faint disgust, \u201cCome on guys, the least we can do is just search.\u201d Aang told them helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any other reason to argue with that logic, they started to make their way into the town and where they saw civilians hiding and fleeing for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...guys? Who is that?\u201d Sokka fearfully pointed upward to a green clad giant figure with black hair who seemed to be the cause of the chaos and destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way...that\u2019s the girl I saw in my vision!\u201d Aang declared as he rushed off towards the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAang! Wait!\u201d Katara yelled after the free-spirited Avatar. Aang pinched his nose as he approached Toph\u2019s meaty heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo THAT\u2019S where that stink is coming from!\u201d Aang commented, unfortunately gaining Toph\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What do you want? Can\u2019t ya see I\u2019m busy, kid?\u201d Toph snapped and stomped her foot which didn\u2019t have the two Earthbenders beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang seemed undaunted, \u201cHeey! I\u2019m the Avatar, can you teach me Earthbending?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph\u2019s eyebrow twitched, whoever this kid was...he couldn\u2019t take a hint. And what was this about being the Avatar? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeat it, shrimp!\u201d Toph roared before going back to tormenting the two Earthbenders beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the nearby civilians managed to hear his designation as he called out to him, \u201cHey Avatar, do you mind helping us take care of this giant girl? She\u2019s trashing the town!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang raised an eyebrow, that doesn't quite sound like a proper teacher at all, but nonetheless, it's his duty to help those in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright I\u2019m on it.\u201d He said as he took out his air glider and flew on it upwards to her shoulder to get her attention, \u201cUm, excuse me, do you mind leaving those people alone?\u201d He asked her hoping to defuse the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? How\u2019d you get up here? Ugh, like a fly.\u201d Toph complained as she raised a hand to swat him like a fly to which he quickly jumped off of to avoid getting hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon! This isn\u2019t nice!\u201d Aang scolded as he flipped upward and landed on her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph grit her teeth at this annoyance, \u201cGrrrgh! Go away!\u201d Toph reached up and ended up bonking herself on the head due to Aang moving out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheesh...he\u2019s fast\u2026\u201d Toph admitted in her thoughts, she sensed him on the ground with a clothespin on his nose and her eye twitched in annoyance as she lifted her foot which didn\u2019t have the Earth Benders beneath it. \u201cI\u2019ll stomp you! Avatar or not!\u201d She slammed her foot down on top of\u2026.Sokka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooooo!\u201d Aang and Katara yelled, however Sokka\u2019s extremely green tinted face was poking out from the giantess\u2019 toes and he choked out: \u201cD-don\u2019t worry...I\u2019m not dead...though I wish I was.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph blushed, this guy she\u2019d accidentally stomped in place of that annoying Avatar wannabe...was kinda cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there, you look pretty nice little guy, why don't you ditch those annoying pests and come hang out with me?\u201d She asked him with a grin on her face, getting a good read on his body really told a lot of what she had under her foot, maybe he\u2019d make a good foot servant/boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, that\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d Katara sternly reprimanded her as she waterbent water from a nearby pond and threw it at her and on impact it froze on her arm as she hissed in slight pain from the harsh cold on it and stepped off of the pinned Sokka and the Earthbenders as Toph broke off the ice of it with an annoyed growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease we just want to talk to you!\u201d Aang spoke up as his plea was rebuked by the giant Toph as she lifted her foot over the two Benders as the boy went and threw Katara out of the way and evaded the stomp as it kicked up some dust in the process.</span></div></div>",

Waaait! Let\u2019s talk about this!\u201d Aang cupped his hands over his mouth and yelled at the titan of a girl..who if he didn\u2019t know any better...was growing?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing to talk about!\u201d Toph snapped and reared her foot back a little bit, preparing to plow it through the building Aang was standing on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Aang got an idea...but he didn\u2019t think Sokka would like it very much. \u201cWhat about a trade? You be my Earthbending teacher and come with us and stop destroying this place...and um\u2026.you\u2019ll get all the access to Sokka you want!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph\u2019s foot stopped inches away from the building, Aang fanned the air slightly..but was glad to see what he\u2019d said was obviously being considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou travel with us, you can play with Sokka whenever and however long you like!\u201d Katara jumped in, much to Sokka\u2019s dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?! N-No way! How can you guys-!?\u201d Sokka started to protest...before Toph replied with a grin: \u201cDeal.\u201d and turned around to walk in the direction of her palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna talk so bad...fine...you\u2019ve earned yourself an audience with the Earthbending Queen.\u201d Toph declared smugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You\u2019re a queen of Earthbending?!\u201d Aang asked in childlike amazement as they started to follow behind her at street level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it's more of a self proclaimed title but as you can see, I am getting to really mean that title, I\u2019m the strongest person you\u2019d ever meet.\u201d She bragged about her power and size as the civilians cowered in her presence but was confused by the Avatar being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they make their way to the palace which like Toph herself, towered over everything in range as they gaped in awe of the structure, they wondered how long it took to make that sort of thing, it was like a place fit for the Earth King or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara though was curious about something else though, \u201cYou said you\u2019re getting to claim that title for real, what do you mean by that?\u201d She inquired as Toph smirked as she liked talking about her awesome powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you asked, ya see, I was a shrimp like you guys, and even worse vision skills, but after buying that vial from that lady in a store, it's been great, slowly getting bigger and stronger is the best thing ever.\u201d She said to her with a light chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them went up to the massive front double-doors which were green and gold befitting Toph\u2019s stylistic choices. Toph pushed them open with both hands effortlessly, grinning smugly at this display of strength she just showed for her \u2018guests\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka, Katara and Aang\u2019s mouths dropped, and then dropped even furthur upon seeing the enormous throne room of the self titled Earthbending Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was luxuriously decorated with green and gold, the throne with the green carpet leading to it from the doorway was clearly dirtied with sweaty footprints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must use this place a lot\u2026\u201d Katara commented with a slight fanning of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph smirked as she sensed that the girl smelt her \u2018mark of territory\u2019 all over the place. \u201cYup, so..you punies wanted an audience with the great and powerful Toph...ya gotta come up to the base of the throne and show your respect first. Kneel and thank me and all that.\u201d She snickered and flopped herself casually onto the cushioned throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped her fingers and draped herself across the armrests so that her feet were hanging from the side of the throne. With a mere finger snap, tiny normal sized servants came scuttling out of nowhere and propped a pillow behind her head as she rested her cheek against her fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother set of servants scurried out and climbed up on a table next to her head, they were carrying a tray of grapes and Toph opened her mouth to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing it\u2019d be a great time as any to talk to the giant Earthbender, Aang then spoke to her, \u201cSo I was wondering, do you mind coming with us to help me learn to Earthbend since I\u2019m the Avatar and all.\u201d He informed her politely as the others kneeled before her to try and stay on her good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd abandon my pretty sweet Palace in the process?\u201d She questioned them with a raised eyebrow as she ate several bunches of grapes since she\u2019s big enough to swallow each individual one whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink of it this way Toph, if you travel with us, you could spread your greatness to the world instead of in time as you grow.\u201d Katara proposed to her to which she was intrigued by the notion of getting out of town, besides, beating up the same dudes that was at every Earth Rumble was getting boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I still get your brother?\u201d She asked her pointedly as Sokka widen his eyes in fear as he comically shook his head \u2018no' to Katara but they were pressed for time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d She said to which he pathetically moaned in defeat at being Toph\u2019s boytoy practically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we got ourselves a deal.\u201d She said with a grin on her face at the idea of travelling all over the place, leaving her mark wherever she goes.</span></div></div>",

It was afternoon time now, and the group was making camp in a forest on their way to the Earth kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooo..when do we start my training?\u201d Aang inquired of Toph, who was seated and relaxing against a large rock wall she\u2019d created. \u201cWhenever I feel like it\u2026\u201d Toph answered back casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang pouted but left her be, not wanting to incur the wrath of the giantess which they clearly needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph opened one eye and glanced down beside her, she saw Sokka sitting there next to her titanic form as he was peeling potatoes for tonight\u2019s stew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo uh...what\u2019s it like?\u201d Sokka asked her. \u201cWhat\u2019s what like?\u201d Toph raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou know...being all big and unstoppable.\u201d Sokka said as he turned toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you know, I can do whatever I want and answer to nobody, plus the fact that I keep getting bigger and stronger is the icing on the cake.\u201d She told him with a grin on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds awesome but...what if you get TOO big?\u201d Sokka said with a thoughtful expression. \u201cLike...you might outgrow the entire country...or the planet.\u201d Sokka snorted suddenly with slight laughter, \u201cI just had an image in my head of you crushing the world between your toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph laughed as well, her laughter nearly damaging his eardrums from how loud it was as she then said, \u201cYeah, I might actually enjoy that, who knows, I might be able to breathe in space or whatever with this stuff I drank.\u201d She snickered in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could imagine like the whole world like my personal playground where I can stomp wherever and do whatever I want with nobody to stop me not even little Twinkle Toes over there.\u201d She reasoned as at the rate she was gaining strength and size, it was a matter of time before she outstripped him in strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded in understanding as he sweated slightly nervous about that likely scenario, hopefully it might not come to pass, unless she\u2019s like, unaging or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...I\u2019m kinda afraid to ask but what are you gonna do once we get to Ba Sing Se? With the uh...Earth King and all that being there.\u201d Sokka asked with a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph grinned deviously, \u201cI\u2019m gonna overthrow him, duh.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud spit take was heard behind the wall, and Katara came charging in. \u201cWhat!? You can\u2019t do that!!\u201d Katara shouted at Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph merely rolled her eyes \u201cAnd who\u2019s gonna stop me? I\u2019m too big and strong for anyone to tell ME what to do.\u201d Toph declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a job to do! We can\u2019t have you staging a coup against the Earth Kingdom on a whim!\u201d Katara yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatara, calm down. It might not be so bad...if she has control over the Earth Kingdom and it\u2019s resources...we\u2019d have a whole kingdom to back us up against the Fire Nation.\u201d Sokka tried to reason with his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, how cute! Looks like Sokka agrees with me!\u201d Toph stuck her tongue out at Katara. \u201cGet lost, Sugar Queen! If you want me to train Twinkle Toes then you\u2019re gonna have to accept that I\u2019m the boss.\u201d Toph wafted her toes tauntingly at Katara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara was about to retort back before Aang placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder, \u201cIt's alright Katara, besides she\u2019s just here to come with us and do her own thing in return for teaching me Earthbending.\u201d He told her trying to calm her fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, alright then, I\u2019ll trust in your judgement Aang.\u201d She said to him with slightly unsure eyes and a wary smile but she could trust in his words and allow Toph her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee now was that so hard? Just think of it like a small management change, the original goal hasn't changed but I\u2019m just calling the shots now.\u201d Toph said adding her two cents to the discussion as she folded her arms and looked at Aang with a challenging smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich reminds me, you ready to learn some real Earthbending skills?\u201d She asked him as he grinned and nodded eagerly in preparation to learn as much as he can to earthbend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Toph merely wiggled her big toe and a rock pillar knocked Aang into the sky from below. \u201cWaaaaaah!\u201d Aang yelled as she wiggled her pinky toe and another pillar sprung up where he landed and knocked him back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was falling over onto the ground laughing, causing Toph to laugh along with him and somewhat hurt his eardrums with her booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep dodging, Twinkle-Toes!\u201d Toph ordered as she flexed all her digits at once and a flurry of pillars chased Aang around the area like earthen serpents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang was smacked around by the pillars that she erected out of the ground to hit him, they were coming in rather quickly and made it difficult to tell which direction they were coming from in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember Aang, to be a Earthbender you have to be aware of the movements in the earth!\u201d She instructed him as she continued her assault on the Avatar.</span></div></div>",

Toph nodded and waited a few moments before smirking down at Sokka and putting a silent finger to her lips.

Dinner\u2019s read-AANG LOOK OUT!\u201d Katara shrieked as she came upon the scene. Aang was startled out of his concentration, luckily Toph leaped to her feet and smashed the rock into bits with one swift kick..saving Aang at the last second. She landed on her odorous and dirtied bare feet with a mighty THUMP...right in front of Katara...whom she sternly glared down at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit Katara you ruined the lesson I was trying to teach Aang!\u201d Toph chided her annoyed at her interruption, for the moment she could feel that his heart rate was calm and ready to defend against the rock until she yelled and broke his concentration and fear from the fast approaching object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean trying to turn him into a smear on the ground?\u201d She asked her skeptically to Toph whom scoffed at the idea of letting Aang be hurt, who did she think she was a novice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Katara, while your fancy little Waterbending and his Airbending can allow for some lapse in control and it doesn't do too much damage, this does, a little bit of trust in the giant Earthbender would be appreciated, got it?\u201d She asked her with a stomp for emphasis, making the ground tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara narrowed her eyes in reluctance before she sighed and nodded in defeat, \u201cFine, I\u2019m sorry Toph, I guess I\u2019m not use to how people train with Earthbending.\u201d She told her as she nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally I\u2019d suggest taking it slow, but if I\u2019m guessing from how urgently you wanted to get me of all people to train him, then you\u2019re on a time table right?\u201d She asked Katara curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara sighed and nodded, \u201cAang said it had to be you who teaches him..because he had some sort of vision of you in a swamp.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Toph could respond, the ground began to vibrate. \u201cO-okay what\u2019s that?!\u201d Sokka yelped fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething big is headed this way\u2026.\u201d Toph declared and turned towards where she could tell the quakes were originating from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s some kind of...tank.\u201d Toph said as she could sense it along with a trio of females within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething big? Looks like this is a job for you!\u201d Aang said cheerfully to Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph grinned as she cracked her knuckles in anticipation and looked in the direction of the tank that was coming to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m already on it.\u201d She said as she started to walk towards the disturbance she was feeling, brushing through the trees that was about waist high to her that was near the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook from her footsteps as Katara looked on in slight concern for her safety, while she was pretty big, she was unsure if whatever that was coming would be difficult for her to handle at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let's see if she can do her job of \u2018Strongest Earthbender\u2019 eh guys?\u201d Sokka asked rhetorically as the others nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trees cracked in two against her legs and lower body, she had a smug grin on her face as she felt the fallen tree trunks being smashed beneath her powerful soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could sense the features of the large armored vehicle barrelling towards her and the presence of three powerful girls within. The tank came to a halt before the edge of the forest, just as Toph stomped out in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA haughty voice declared from a speaker on the tank, \u201cYou are interfering with a Fire Nation matter\u2026.move it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think so little girl, I know exactly why you\u2019re here, you\u2019re after Aang aren't you?\u201d She asked rhetorically with her hands on her hips, she knows well why they are here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you continue to interfere with our pursuit peasant, then you will face a costly consequence.\u201d The voice retorted in an arrogant tone as Toph\u2019s eyebrow twitched in annoyance, \u2018Peasant'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I hope you don't mind if I do this then.\u201d She said stepping towards the vehicle as the ground shake from her footsteps. Toph then started to bend over to lift up the train, though it was a bit heavier than what she was used to from the front.</span></div></div>",

Go grab some new bindings for my Fire-Ant sandals!\" Toph's voice boomed down to Aang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang comically stood up and saluted, rushing to their supplies to obtain new bindings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on! Don't just waste all our materials just so you can torment those assassins!\" Katara scolded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph rolled her eyes and yawned in a disinterested way, \"Nah...I'll give it back when I'm done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara's eye twitched in annoyance, \"We won't be able to use it when its all wet and stinks of your feet!\" She shrieked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, not my problem.\" Toph shrugged before turning to Sokka and smiling: \"Yo, Sokka...tell me how puny these bugs look on my soles! Praise your queen!\" She said in a bossy tone.</span></div></div>",

She grew so much that her legs were entirely off the bed, her giant legs hanging over the side. Korra in a matter of moments hit her feet on the wall, then hit her head on the opposite as well. The impact cracked the wall as she kept pushing through it. Only being able to hold her for so long, the walls bursted open as she kept growing and growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unaware Korra shifted slightly in her sleep, getting into more a sitting position as she was uncomfortable. This time her head hit the ceiling as she grew. Busting through it just as easy as she did the wall. Korra kept growing and growing until finally she busted through the roof of the place, still asleep and unaware of the events that transpired, but the family wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin was training with his family. He believed that the morning is always the perfect time to work. Although his children didn't agree, Jinora of course didn't mind by Ikki and Meelo did. Tenzin was teaching them about expert air bending techniques when they heard a bang from their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four airbenders saw what looked like Korra\u2019s face, resting on the roof. But it was absolutely massive. They couldn't see the rest of her body but they assume that it must be equally big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah\u201d Meelo said, being the first one to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that Korra! She\u2019s so big\u201d Ikki said amazed at the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThats, thats not possible\u201d Jinora added, she's heard of many things but giants were no one of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin could see her face, she was sleeping currently. Of course that girl wouldn't even wake up when something like this happens. \u201cYou all go to the house and check if your mother is okay\u201d Tenzin ordered \u201cIm going to wake up that girl\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the children listened and ran to the house, making sure to stay a safe distance from Korra. Tenzin ran as well, Airbending his way up to Korra. He landed right in front of her face, on the piece of the roof thats not broken. He looked down and just like he suspected she was fully grown. Still in her sleepwear so this must of happened in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm sorry Korra, but I'm afraid its time for you to wake up\u201d Tenzin said. Then without warning he gave a hurricane of air right to her face. This woke Korra up instantly as she stood up, collapsing more of the house as Tenzin looked up in awe. She's double the height of their home, maybe even more. Tenzin on the roof was level with her knees<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTenzin, why did you do that! I told you i don't like waking up with that!\u201d Korra said remember all the times Tenzin woke her up that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you open your eyes, you'd understand why\u201d Korra then opened her eyes just like Tenzin said. Not gazing at her room but the city. She looked down as she couldn't believe it. Tiny Island, Tiny Home, Tiny Tenzin.<br>\r\n\u2028She was giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say next?</span></div></div>",

And I feel like I can run for miles, I can definitely help more with the whole Avatar business.\" She said with a smile stepping over him to get out of the rubble, giving him a view of her large bare sole, her foot was big enough to cover a whole Satomobile with little effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" He questioned cautiously, knowing that Korra isn't one to be cooped up in one place for too long if she has the energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot stomped onto the ground as the place shook slightly from her weight, \"Well Tenzin, been doing a little bit of thinking about this whole thing.\" She told him as she went to the courtyard proper as she looked at him with a mischevious smile, that could never be good.</span></div></div>",

We need to keep you contained on this island until we have more of an understanding of whats happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding, I'm just exploring. Don't get all grumpy Tenzin on me\u201d Korra joked, turning around to Tenzin following her. Smiling wickedly as she got a cheeky idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKorra, please. You'll frighten them\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm the Avatar, they'll adore em. guruntee it\u201d Korra said as Tenzin did not think that for a second. \u201cAnd since your probably gonna follow me, ive got to stop you. Get ready\u201d Korra said to the tiny Tenzin. Then to his surprise he saw a big ball of spit coming for him. Acting quickly he dodged it as it hit the ground. But Korra was planning for this, She bended it slightly, making it attack Tenzin and hold his body. Then with utter skill she froze it on him. Holding him there as he struggled, head still exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Im a giant and i can Bend. Talk about a win win\u201d Korra said happy \u201cAnd Tenzin don't worry, that will Thaw out in a couple of hours. But Until then I'm gonna have fun. Ill be back later\u201d And with that Korra left. Ignoring the protests from Tenzin behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to the edge of her island and spotted her Polar Bear Dog Naga. Getting down on one knee she petted it \u201cIm sorry girl, looks like your out of the business. For today at least. Rest up, okay\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaga did just that as Korra stood back up. \u201cHm... i wonder\u201d Korra said getting an idea. Lifting her foot up high she slammed it down onto the earth, shuttering the ground and grass under it. But that wasn't her intention. her intention was to make a walking path all the way from the island to the mainland. And it worked! No only is it a path, but the ground was big enough for her to stand on easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confirmed her theory. her bending is more powerful too, just like her! She wouldn't be able to make a bridge like that unless she was in the Avatar State. Smiling happily she started walking over, ready to be the big girl in the city.<br>\r\n\u2028For the people at the shore line, to say they were surprised would be an understatement. Seeing the Avatar not only make an earth bridge across the water but also be giant sent some people into shock. Most people ran from her as soon as they saw she was coming, while some stayed. Knowing that the Avatar wouldn't hurt them intentionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra got closer and closer and saw the tiny people. All of them staring at her in shock. She saw the buildings around her as well and although she wasn't taller then the tallest ones, she was bigger then most of them. Stepping off the dirt in her bedtime underwear she stepped onto the street and smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was gonna be good.</span></div></div>",

Korra\u2019s giant face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami sat up, and rubbed her eyes. Complete disbelief. That was Korra! her giant brown finger banging onto the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBang!.

You know once i figure out how to Glassbend or something.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2028Asami got out of bed, still in her crimson pyjamas walked up to the window.

But that was more of a spiritual Totem then anything else. Maybe some left over spirit energy never left and did this to you. Maybe-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami was cut off, feeling Korra\u2019s strong hands grip her. She gets pulled right through the window and up to Korra\u2019s face, who was now standing loud and proud.

We need to find a way to shrin-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow your just like Tenzin.\u201d Korra cut her off again, feeling like she has the height allowed to do that. \u201cIll figure out how to go back down.

But hey, how bad could just letting Korra have fun be. \u201c(Sigh) Fine, can you put me down at least\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra did put her down. Right onto her shoulder.

Kind of rude but if she's being honest its growing on her. She looks behind her and sees her steps, most of them cracking the ground underneath. If only she had this power before, she could literally just stop Amon and his forces with her foot. No bending needed. Craning down she looked into a window of one of the buildings. Everything looked so small, like a child\u2019s dollhouse. No people were in there to her disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKorra, what exactly are you planning on doing? I mean are you just gonna walk around?\u201d Asami asked wanting to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right, i really should do something more, oh... i just stepped on another Satomobile\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKorra, those are expensive!\u201d Asami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts not my fault, they're like bugs. Bounds to step on a few\u201d Korra said \u201cAnyway, what do you think we should do? Maybe go for a swim, that would be fun but were in our sleepwear, not our swimwear. Oh i know, watch this\u201d Korra then placed Asami onto an opposite building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a huge smile she brought her hand and grabbed the building she was just looking through. She then tore off the roof as she held it up. \u201cWow, easier then i thought\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKorra, thats someones home!\u201d Asami said as Korra juggled it in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo! Korra this isn't you. Your height is making you not think straight. please just-\u201d Asami didn't finished as she watch Korra drop the building onto the ground. Reaching for Asami with her fingers. Not being as gentle as she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsami your kind of being sour right now. I just want to have fun, and your here barking in my ear\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKorra-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I'm not finished, i thought you would enjoy this and have fun but obviously not. I think i need to put you in time out for now\u201d Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTimeout\u201d Asami repeated, terrified. Korra only smiled bringing her hand to her chest and slipped Asami in. Asami couldn't do nothing as she was slipped right in her big brown breasts. Going right into the cleavage as she could do nothing to stop. Korra made sure Asami wouldn't be able to move, making sure her breasts held her perfectly. Pulling her hand away she could feel Asami stuck and unable to get out, but that didn't stop her from trying to wiggle out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you feel so good in there Asami! Don worry its only for a little while. Until I'm done with my fun\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats the problem Asami has, when will the fun be over? Hours, Days, When?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra taking her attention away turned back to the building. She then brought her hand in and started grabbing the small furniture of the home. Holding the tiny tables and the tiny chairs. Dropping them onto the floor once she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, she's had her fun by herself. Now its about time to find some smaller people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! If anyones hiding, i want them to come out now!\u201d Korra echoed giving the order.

Korra smiles as she knows exactly what she's gonna do, she's gonna tell everyone to bow and pamper her giant feet. Just a bit of fun for her, but it would be a lot more fun if she found more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope your having fun in there little lady\u201d A mysterious voice answered from the top of the building. Korra looked up to see the chief of the metal bending police Lin Beifong. From this size the intimidating woman wasn't so intimidating. \u201cBecause those people your trapping I'm sure are terrified beyond belief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra pulls her arms out of the building and stands tall, being taller then Lin even when she's standing on the building. \u201cDon't tell me your gonna scold too.

So you can just leave unless you want to join them?\u201d Korra said with a smug smile, something Lin absolutely hated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrap her!\u201d Lin yelled.

Flying by her like some sort of annoying fly. Korra sees her and tries grabbing Lin with her free hand. But Lin was too skilled to be caught. Korra saw what Lin was trying to do, wrap her up in metal to prevent her from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious! Your really think your gonna get me with that\u201d Korra laughed. She stopped laughing the point where she saw about ten more Metal benders on the building. They all swang at her the same time trying the same method. Korra tried to get them off her but felt her arms held back. She looked down to see her arms crossed against her chest, with a couple of metal wires holding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cgeez, you guys work fast\u201d Korra said as then felt her legs strapped together as well. Until finally she was nothing but a pillar of a giant. unable to move her arms or legs, the metal benders retreated. Getting the hanging friend and standing on top of the nearby buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKorra, your here by under arrest\u201d Lin said to her \u201cFor destruction of property, kidnapping Miss Sato and harassing the city dwellers\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...you cant arrest me!

This is frankly too perfect. More impotent as they retreated, they didn't bother grabbing the civilians who Korra stopped with her bending. They could only watch with fear at the towering Korra.

Looking at the people though there was something odd about them. They looked smaller?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait Korra looked the same size, but compared to the city she grew twice as big.

Something that was much harder in concept then in execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a lot of failure and a lot of prodding, Asami begged her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, just one more try\u201d Korra said as she brought her finger down, only to poke Asami right in the breast. This was suppose to be friendly banter between the girls, however when the finger hit Asami she gave out a sexual \u201cYelp\u201d. Something Korra noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat... what was that Asami?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou poked me in the tit! Of course i would shout in pain\u201d Asami answered back as Korra felt like she was hiding something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouted but it wasn't in pain, it was in something else. Wasn't it\u201d Korra said with a massive Sly smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201ci... i don't what your talking about\u201d Asami said looking away, Korra instead of asking again simply poked her in the other breast. Getting a similar sound once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, just like i thought\u201d Korra said as she sat up \u201cYour getting turned on right now, aren't you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! Korra No!\u201d Asami shouted in surprise, How could Korra even say something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Asami, i don't blame you. I mean think about it. You were just in the great, biggest cleavage in the entire world and you've been spending time with the greatest looking Avatar there has ever been\u201d Korra said complementing herself while stating her point \u201cIf anything it wold be even weirder if you weren't turned on\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami disagreed massively as Korra rolled her eyeballs. She then looked down at the small people trapped, they were watching this whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you guys, am i turning you all on as well?\u201d Korra asked.  It took a while but all of them said yes, whether it was the truth of just out of pure fear of what would happen if they disagree is still a mystery. \u201cSee they all admitted it, now its your turn Asami\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami was blushing beyond anything right now. What is Korra even talking about. She's disgusted by all this carnage... or was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndoubtably Korra is hot, but Asami sees her as a friend. Well at least she did till she was put in her friend\u2019s cleavage and was toyed with like a toy. Getting both of her own breasts poked.<br>\r\n\u2028What does Asami say?</span></div></div>",

Standing to her full height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThats a great idea, have a little lover swim!.

Crashing property underneath her. Asami still doesn't like whats happening, but at least she's confessed to Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around she noticed something \u201cHey Korra, did you grow again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah i almost forgot, i grew twice my height.

Im not the Avatar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not, but your the Avatar\u2019s lover. So maybe that has something to do with it\u201d Korra answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami couldn't find a way to dispute as both of them arrive at the beach. In a much shorter time due to Korra\u2019s doubled height. Looking around she shouldn't be surprised no one was around. Walking on the sand, she leaned down dropping Asami onto the ground. Asami stepped back away from Korra\u2019s huge feet as she looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cant swim in this though. Hold on i got a plan\u201d Korra then reached down and grabbed a street lamp. Ripping it from the ground as she broke at it. Making it more resemble a makeshift shiv rather then anything else. She then cut her under wear, Making it resemble much more of a Bikini. She cut it to the point where more of her skin was revealed. The only hidden parts were her nipples as well as her two downstair holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami could only stare up in amazement from the size of Korra. She looked so good in the Bikini and this size only complimented it. Now in good clothes, she ran out into the water. Creating massive waves as she runs out, not too far as she only ran to the point where it was at her knees. Sitting down she looked back to Asami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! I want to see you swim to me\u201d Korra said seductevly. Asami taking off her clothes to have her bra and panties underneath, Running out she started swimming to her big girlfriend.

Reaching down she grabbed Asami and placed her onto her shoulder. Korra then started to move to the Ship, with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Smile that the people on the ship could see. They were just touring Republic City and now they're dealing with a Giant Avatar. Within seconds she arrives right in front of the ship. Grabbing the front of the ship with her left hand, making sure its not going anywhere! The ship jerked for a second as all of the smaller people almost tripped. They stared up at the giantess, ready to see what she's going to do<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain comes out of the ship, wanting to know what they hit. When he saw the Giant Avatar he only had one reaction \u201cBy the Beard of the moon!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt ease Captain\u201d Korra said to him \u201cWere just gonna play with your boat.

I imagine not all of them can handle playing with you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra wanted to say no but Asami interrupted \u201cOk thats only fair, but they're has to be some people up here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain first time noticing the woman on Korra\u2019s shoulder thanked her. He then started to organise the ship. Letting the children, the fragile and the cowards down in the brig. He also sent a couple man down there to watch. Right now the only people left were the ones ready to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, lets have some fun\u201d Korra said as she grabbed Asami from her shoulder, with very much care she deposited her on the deck. They're everyone was shocked at seeing the woman. When she was on the Avatars shoulder most of them just assumed she was their height. But no! She was an Amazon!. At least Ten foot tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami was also amazed. People she would of been looking up at before didn't even come equal to her breasts. She was probably stronger then a lot of them as well. And all eyes were on her! Most didn't even care about Korra who was holding the boat hostage, but instead her. The thought was... Invigorating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how is it Asami. Now you know why i had so much fun huh. It just feels so good to be the tallest one and the stronger one!

She had two people working on her feet, a young couple apparently. The boy working on the left and the girl working on the right. She had her eyes closed and her arms behind her head, she was so relaxed she could barely tell she was bigger. She also noticed the boys eyes were on her, not surprisingly. At this size she was so amazing and gorgeous to look at, but honestly she would rather have the girl staring at her too. Instead she was just glaring at her boyfriend who was currently in the doghouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the boat laid Korra\u2019s massive feet, which required everyone else still up top to work on. About twenty people on each one, Korra was just relaxing. She made herself a small Earth bed from the ground. It wasn't the most comfortable, but the Foot massage did make it better, but thats not all she did... because she wanted to have fun with them while they were massaging her feet. Grabbing a small group of young adults. She dropped them on her vast stomach, telling to give her a belly massage as well. Unlike the people on the boat, Korra could see these people clearly and loved seeing them working.<br>\r\n\u2028After about 15 minutes... Asami and Korra was satisfied. Asami got up and walked over near her girlfriends feet. All the people looking at the Amazon, wanting to know what she will do. Moving closer she decided to have some fun <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now i want you all to clean her feet... with you tongue\u201d Asami said as everyone looked at her, only to then turn back to the feet, sticking their tongue outs and licking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra giggled as she felt this \u201cAsami, what are you doing down there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust getting more personal with them\u201d Asami yelled back as she spotted someone who caught her interest \u201cHey you, come here\u201d She said pointing to a forty year old woman.

Thanking her she didn't waste anytime running downstairs and away from the two giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, your just letting her go\u201d Korra said to Asami, Asami just simply nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, i had my fun.

It was bluff, meaning that maybe their lives aren't actually in danger. \u201cSo what are you going to? You know id be okay if you want to massage my feet to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra said that with a sly smile, but Asami didn't really feel like doing it. Rather she would just be okay with watching the boat population work on her girlfriends feet. Getting right behind them with her hands on her hips, she commanded the people to work even harder, not to upset or her girlfriend. Most people caught onto this threat and worked even harder, making Korra more satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever they're was one man who didn't want to. He was very well in shape, and honestly kind of a stud, but he was barely working on Korra\u2019s giant feet. Something that annoyed Asami to no end. Walking closer without any warning she grabbed his arm and pushed him further into Korra\u2019s wall of a foot.

With a big smile on her face she calls out to Korra \u201cYep, pick me up and we can do something else\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra reached down and grabbed her girlfriend, scaring the rest of the crowd. Putting her on her shoulder, Korra left the boat alone. As soon as the girls left, the boat turned around and headed for open oceans. Not even bothering to pick up the people overboard. Frankly they just want to get away from Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra walked back to the deserted beach, laying down on the sand as she placed Asami right on her boobs. Asami laying down in a similar fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, i could get used to this\u201d Korra admitted, the past few hours have been great. After everything she's gone through it was a much needed break. \u201cToo bad i have to stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop, why?\u201d Asami asked Korra<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell i told Tenzin i would only do this for a little while. He seemed pretty panicked about everything, so i imagine when i go back to the island, he's gonna try to figure out how to make me go back to being a regular size\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know why he would\u201d Asami answered back \u201cI mean, sure your a lot more destructive at this size, but your no doubt the most powerful avatar in history. You shouldn't have to shrink back\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am aren't i\u201d Korra said smiling to herself, the most powerful Avatar. Thats one hell of a title. \u201cI also haven't actually hurt anyone, so if they say I'm dangerous to people well... thats just not true\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not to people, but you've destroyed a lot of property.\u201d Asami countered with a curve on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well i also did when i was normal size so thats unavoidable\u201d Korra answered back to her girlfriend. \u201cAnyway, what do you want to do next? There is still a lot of city we haven't played with\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat to do... what to do... well your the giantess. I think that should be your call\u201d Asami said. Korra sat up, sending Asami down to her lap. Right over her crotch. Korra smirked down at her girlfriend. That would be a fun thing to do, having some... inappropriate time with her smaller girlfriend. Then again she knows Lin\u2019s around. Maybe it would be smarter to track her down first, knowing that Lin will try to take her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, what would be fun for Asami and herself, is finding a certain fire bender.

Grabbing her giant sized panties, she lowered them down. Right down her legs and right onto the ground. It was stretched beyond belief underneath as it acted like an emergency trampoline just in case Asami fell. But that wasn't what the young entrepreneur was focused on. No it was the giant, vast, moist and sexy vagina of Korra. Until today Asami didn't think a Vagina could be so sexy. Batting for the other team before today<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing her two hands in Korra hooked in fingers on the top and the bottom. Pulling them apart as Asami could see straight into it. \u201cI think I'm gonna have to make some room for you, if you were normal sized you would fit no problem, but your not normal size. Your a big sexy Amazon\u201d Korra said down to her girlfriend, smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThats true, but I'm still nothing compared to a big sexy Giantess\u201d Asami said back smiling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you said you wanted it... so here you go. Have fun\u201d Korra said as she saw Asami walk closer. Asami put her hands on the rim, right next to the giant fingers. Korra could feel the touch and was hit with a wave of ecstasy. It got even worse when she felt Asami\u2019s little lips right on top. Worshiping it and caressing it. It was like back on the boat when she felt the people lick her feet, but a million times better. Korra winced as she was getting restless, Asami\u2019s just teasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact Asami wasn't, Asami was into this so much, she didn't even factor what Korra was thinking. She loved every part and okay with this. Moving forward she started to hump the rim herself, Since Asami wasn't as naked the clothes held her back. But that didn't her from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsami!\u201d Korra shouted, eyes closed and filled with pleasure \u201cGet inside me! I need you inside me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra didn't even lower her voice, everyone in the area would be able to hear her. Some probably watching whats happening in shock, some with probably pleasure. Pleasure that she's about to feel. Getting her erect body off her girlfriends rim, she plunged her arms in. Not holding back as Korra let out a huge orgasmic noise. This time not only being heard in the block, but probably the district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she asked Beast Boy and Cyborg to keep her occupied while she looked around her room so she can come up with the perfect gift for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps Raven would like more books?\" She looked around her shelf. \"Oh, if only it is the easy to know what friend Raven likes.\" She shook her head though, she won't give up until she knew what to get her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully she looked the books but one of them tilted and landed on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" She rubbed her head and looked down to see an open page book with a weird sentence, likely a spell. \"What is this?\" She bent down and picked up and instictively read the book aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ezis Worg.\" She tilted her head. \"This is different from the magic friend Raven does.\" She then started vibrating. \"Huh?\" She dropped the book feeling funny she held her stomach. \"Am I getting, the bellyaches? Perhaps too much of the mustard? Ow!\" Her head hit the cieling and she rubbed her head. She looks around seeing the room around her look small, like she was in a children's playhouse. \"What am I grow ah!\" She started growing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs Beastboy as a cheetah and Cyborg are running from multiple balls of their dirty laundry wrapped in black magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come one Raven it was a joke! Ah!\" Cyborg ducked as a ball of socks missed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I don't like jokes.\" Raven said covered in sticklines from one of their stank balls when she was heading to her room. She was surrounded by multiple stank balls she made from their rooms that they never clean. The lounge started to shake. \"Ah!\" She fell over dropping all the stank balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg and Beastboy fall over and trip too. \"Oof!\" Beastboy turned back to normal and fell next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earthquake?\" Cyborg asked trying to stand up only to see giant two purple boot clad feet grow from the ceiling. And continue to grow through the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven recognizes the purple outfit and skin of the growing individual. \"Starfire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin on top of the tower was struggling to stay standing as he felt these odd tremors he then fell over as a big ball of red hair? Grow out of the roof he was standing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Robin yelled in panic mode on the soft furry thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin is that you?\" A familiar and loud voice spoke from the hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's eyes widened as he looked down to see two  giant beautiful green eyes. \"Starfire how-how did this happen?\" He said actually startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire  giggled nervously as she had a small Robin sitting on her head. \"Um I can explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Oh wait ohh\" She started expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet fell from the clouds and landed on the ground growing into the size of busses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Fire looked around she was around 60 ft tall. Everything looked toy size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe Ha Ha Ha!\" Black Fire rose one foot and stomped it down in causing an earthquake with her enormous size combined with her super strength. \"Listen earthlings I am now your new Goddess! And to prove it I will make the titans my prisonors! Hahahaha!\"  And she'll make Star Fire her slave, the little bitch needs to pay for kicking her out of her planet HER throne. She'll pay it back with this planet, after she takes care of the titans she'll turn the Titans tower into her new throne while her sister rubs her feet and that cute boy Robin will be her love slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles thinking of the idea of Star's boyfriend as her plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glowed purple looking down at the humans scurrying around like bugs.

Mordred was bored so his attention was focused on his GameBoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much further, mother? My feet hurt...\" The eternally youthful blond Mordred complained brattishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan sighed, her son could be such a bother sometimes...no matter, he would soon learn some respect once they had the Amulet of Kings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came upon a coffin that held the deceased King who was buried with the Amulet. Morgan wasted no time blasting it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred rushed forward and yanked the amulet off the skeleton within's neck, caring not that the head clattered to the floor...after all..he was no stranger to brutality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amulet began to glow with energy...His powers grew to impossible heights, in an instant the Justice League and all adult authority were erased from existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred also was imbued with the knowledge that his precious mother had plotted to betray him once she got her hands on this trinket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMordred...what did you do?\u201d Morgan demanded of her son, who merely smirked and said in a pompous tone: \u201cI have no need for costumed heroes who would oppose my rule! Adults are not welcome in my world! However, do not fret mother...despite your treachery I still care for you...and only you I would suffice to say...so you will be spared...however you may not enjoy the conditions.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mere snap of his fingers, Morgan began to dwindle and undergo an extremely painful transformation as her body twisted and was reshaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe became a golden ring, her spirit trapped within...and her son towering above looking quite accomplished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down a colossal, slender hand..he brought her up to his mirth filled eyes. \u201cYou still retain all your senses while your being is trapped within this shape. You did at one point hold my best interests at heart...so I shall keep you close...but...you are not to go on my finger...this is a punishment after all.\u201d Mordred chuckled darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan banged her fists against the glass of the ring to no effect as her magic was currently suppressed by her son, yelling faintly to release her from this prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused by her attempts at resistance, he placed the ring in his pocket or rather...was about to, \u201cAs a matter of fact, I think I have the perfect spot for you.\u201d He decided as he took a seat on his throne and made the ring float in the air as he then raised up his leg and started to pull his shoe off of his right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan began to bang on the glass faster in realization of what he was planning to do, grew weary and nervous of what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think perhaps instead of a regular ring, you'll make for a perfect toe ring mother.\u201d Mordred taunted her as he pulled off the purple shoe as he wiggled his freed toes in relief, and also to tease his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan clutched her nose and throat, it was a burning acidic stench...he was right...her senses DID work in this strange void of a ring-dimension. Mordred chuckled darkly as he used his magic to slowly float her down to his third toe on his newly unleashed foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say I\u2019m quite impressed...I\u2019ve worked up quite an aroma from our travels, so try to appreciate it dearest mother.\u201d He leered at the ring wickedly as he felt it slip onto his toe...Morgan felt and smelled everything...the sticky sweat...the awful stench...a truly kingly smell befitting one so powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped his purple shoe back on without a second thought, the cool golden ring felt good on his toe. \u201cOhoho...this is where the fun truly begins!\u201d Spreading his arms out, a wickedly dark magic force spread throughout the building\u2026.and it transformed into a gigantic gothic looking castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...I perhaps made it too big.\u201d Mordred said thoughtfully as he looked at his giant surroundings...he was a mere speck on a throne thousands of times too big for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly gained a sly grin, \u201cThis is easily fixed.\u201d He instantly began to shoot up in height until he was perfectly comfortable and fitting his purple clad rump in the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Morgan...or unluckily\u2026.the ring grew with her...but her spirit within remained the same size...making the stench and sweat even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe complete and utter situation she found herself in...began to psychologically break her. She was a prisoner for eternity of a monster she had created and nurtured throughout millenia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time...her mind would finally give in and she would see her son as the god he truly was\u2026.completely broken and subservient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that's done, I think I'll take a lay of my lands.\u201d He said, getting an idea to look at the adult-less world that is now his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up to his feet and flexing his toes inside the shoe feeling the ring as Mordred chuckled and walked out across the throne room and through the large doors to see the sight of the outside world.</span></div></div>",

People looked out their windows, juvenile delinquents who were smoking on rooftops that merely came up to Mordred\u2019s waist were now looking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of them had been shocked that all the adults in the world suddenly vanished, even moreso when a gigantic castle appeared...but given that most of the kids were...well...kids\u2026.they thought it was pretty awesome...despite the chaos in the city right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the center of it all, Mordred cleared his throat and declared himself: \u201cGreetings my people! I am the reason all the adults have vanished from the planet! I am your new king...Mordred! No adult shall EVER interrupt our fun ever again!\u201d Mordred declared with his booming voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids below talked among themselves before cheering his name: \u201cKing Mordred!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned smugly and drank it all in, his ego swelling to even greater heights. \u201cWe shall have a celebration! Do what you please!\u201d Mordred boomed as with a mere wave of his hand, an extremely long and spacious table that one one end was big enough for Mordred (whom sat in an ornate chair at the head of the table) and on one end was the right size with enough chairs to accommodate every child and teen in the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred sat down in his gargantuan seat and nodded, \u201cFeast to your heart's content! We are free!\u201d He tore off a turkey leg and began chowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the kids started to get in to the fact that they were being ruled by Mordred as they started to dig in to their meals and talked amongst themselves about these events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I might just get use to this whole no adults thing.\u201d One of them mused with a smirk on his face, no rules or anything is the best that could ever happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but on the other hand, what about all those crashes and stuff?\u201d Another one retorted at him, he was scared half to death when he dodged a bus that sailed into a department store and blew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe does have a point, and what about the things that need adults to maintain?\u201d A girl questioned the delinquent as he waved off her concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh who cares? King Mordred will take care of it I'm sure of it.\u201d He said in defense of how will they address these newfound problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect, I will.\u201d Mordred boomed down at the tiny kids. He looked at the dark raven haired young boy and raised an eyebrow, \u201cHold on a moment...don\u2019t I know you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBilly Batson...I\u2019m uh...Captain Marvel..we had a few run ins in the past...but the Justice League never would accept me as a member so I kinda went my own way.\u201d Billy said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred scoffed, \u201cPerhaps you are not such a goody two-shoes after all. I like that you\u2019ve seen the light, as it were.\u201d Mordred smirked as he reached down suddenly and plucked Billy up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey! What are you-!?\u201d Billy yelled as he wriggled around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh calm down, I am not going to harm you..on the contrary...you will be my second in command\u2026.I\u2019m going to grant you some of my power...you will control size..both of yourself and others. You\u2019d like that wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Mordred smirked as he placed the boy down on the ground before his dining chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, Billy! You GOTTA say yes!\u201d One of the other kids said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the girl who first noticed Mordred..felt her heart throb as she looked up at the impressive mountain of a boy king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it, Batson...you\u2019d be even more powerful than normal...you would be able to tower over everyone...do anything with them you wished...you could re-enact a scene from a kaiju film with no repercussions...I would see to that. I currently have my disobedient mother adorning one of my toes...as a ring.\u201d Mordred bragged to his former foe.</span></div></div>",

It glowed with purple energy which flowed into Billy\u2019s body painlessly and left a dull tingling sensation on his skin.<br>\r\nSuddenly Billy started to feel it...he was getting bigger! Mordred rested his cheek against his fist and grinned smugly as Billy grew before him with an excited childlike look on his face. He could practically see all traces of \u2018honorable hero\u2019 evaporating within his eyes...he had his first taste of true power..and he was hooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was a height to match Mordred, the king snapped his fingers and a chair inscribed with a \u2018B\u2019 on it appeared next to his own. \u201cWelcome your new second in command: Billy!\u201d Mordred said with flair, cheers erupting from the kids at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, thanks for the intro\u2026\u201d Billy chuckled as he flopped down in his chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the least I could do...we are on the same side now after all.\u201d Mordred said, for once addressing Billy as an equal...a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly felt himself feeling less and less like he would ever betray this guy to do some lame hero junk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred was now his friend...and you don\u2019t screw over friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this...but...you\u2019re pretty cool.\u201d Billy said with a mouthful of triple jumbo cheeseburger...crudely spewing burger chunks and mustard from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thank you Billy, it would serve well to have someone around my size to communicate with.\u201d He told him honestly as he looked over the masses of kids assembled before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I think after we finish our feast, we can have some fun causing some destruction to this city.\u201d Mordred mused to himself as he looked over the buildings and stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I thought all the adults were gone though?\u201d Billy questioned him in curiosity, putting down the burger, he did want to show some courtesy to his benefactor after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh that is true Billy the adults are gone.\u201d Mordred agreed with a knowing smile on his face before elaborating seeing the confused look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat isn't to say we can't make our own military might to fight and test our might against.\u201d He told him with a grin of excitement on his face as Billy shared the same grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I'm getting it, this is going to be fun, though it might be a bit hard to see with all this smoke.\u201d He pointed out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred nodded in agreement, it'd be a pain to see the enemy if there is smoke clogging up the view, \u201cAlright, done.\u201d He said and snapped his fingers, and a wave of purple energy spread throughout the city to disperse the smoke from the various wreckage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa...is there ANYTHING you can\u2019t do?\u201d Billy asked half joking...half serious.

All this praise and acknowledgment was going to make Mordred\u2019s ego grow bigger than even he himself currently was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the feast finished, and the table was replaced with rows upon rows of what appeared to be movie theater seats. Everyone was \u2018magicked\u2019 up a bucket of popcorn and large soda of their favorite type. \u201cNow, let\u2019s give them a show.\u201d Billy smirked and cracked his knuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred nodded, glad to have someone of his size who he could have fun alongside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly waved his hand, and on the horizon...a copy of the full might of the U.S. military appeared. Tanks were rolling down the ruined streets, snipers on rooftops, soldiers on foot, and of course fighter jets flying overhead in formation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I should go barefoot...they should be honored to get to see my royal feet...and smell them...before I crush them into nothing!\u201d Mordred bragged, getting applause and cheers from his \u2018audience\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly smirked cockily, \u201cI ain\u2019t changed my socks in a long time\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! How typical, socks? I never wear such things!\u201d Mordred scoffed...this was beginning to sound like a competition!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning down, he whispered to his shoe that contained his \u2018ring foot\u2019. \u201cYou are in luck, dear mother...you will get some air...though I doubt the quality shall improve...since you are stuck on one of my enormous and quite smelly toes!\u201d Mordred yanked off his purple shoes, unleashing his quite soft and cared for feet...that also emitted practical centuries of foot odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly had taken off his sneakers, and begun yanking off his crusty old socks. Mordred smirked, \u201cYou can\u2019t compete with this smell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays you!\u201d He retorted teasingly back at him as he then finally took off his socks with a light grunt and placed it next to his sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiggled his toes pleasantly as he felt the cold pavement beneath his bare soles as Billy smiled at the feeling, \u201cThis feels pretty cool with the earth beneath my feet.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred chuckled in amusement at the statement as he sniffed the air and smirked at the smell coming from Billy's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call that a smell? It smells like you barely dirty them!\u201d Mordred taunted him as he raised his leg at him and wiggled his toes at him, wafting the odor into Billy's face, making him huff in annoyance at the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know about what you do in the old days but with these socks my smell outdoes yours.\u201d He boasted back with a teasing smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll see, there's a bit of a nice group of subjects to test our smell on aren't there?\u201d Mordred told him pointing to the military that was coming to attack them, \u201cYou got a point, I'll show you that my feet smell the worst.\u201d Billy said not backing down from the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then walked towards the group of infantryman that were firing at them ineffectually, their bullets not even piercing their skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a weak military.\u201d Mordred mused with a smirk as he stepped on a few with his foot, crushing them under his bare foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly, not to be outdone, raised his foot above a tank and flexed his toes. He slowly eased his foot down upon the war machine and began applying pressure. \u201cHeh, I feel like Godzilla...awesome.\u201d Billy chuckled as the tank began to buckle with more weight applied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, we are bigger than that lizard.\u201d Mordred scoffed haughtily as he wiggled his toes at some of the soldiers...who clutched their throats and began keeling over..much to the bratty king\u2019s amusement. \u201cPathetic! Do you see how futile your efforts are, insects? You cannot handle MY foot smell!\u201d He declared proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly pouted and grabbed a passing helicopter, sneering in at the passengers as the sniper shot at him...bullets bouncing off of his face. \u201cStupid bugs.\u201d He opened his mouth and quite literally took a bite out of the front of the chopper...taking the pilot and half the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re STILL hungry?\u201d Mordred asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly swallowed the metal and the pilot, letting out a crude belch. \u201cNah, but giants eat people...so\u2026\u201d He waved the chomped in half vehicle along with the terrified sniper at Mordred..offering the former villain the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant king stroked his chin thoughtfully, that is what giant monsters do don't they? And the metal and blades on this vehicle won't damage his throat thanks to his new powers so might as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well I'll try out this idea of yours.\u201d Mordred said agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly nodded, grinning as he tossed the bitten helicopter to Mordred who angled his mouth to catch it with his teeth, as he bit down on the wreckage and started to eat the thing, swallowing it without any complaint.</span></div></div>",

He didn't seem very unfamiliar with his abilities he reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to transform into my adult form...it\u2019s kind of a downer.\u201d Billy sighed. Mordred smirked, \u201cNot anymore you don\u2019t.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly looked confused at the boy king, Mordred merely gestured to him in response as if to say: \u2018Try it out.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly looked up at the sky, took a deep breath and said: \u201cSHAZAM!\u201d A golden lightning bolt was called down from the heavens, striking him and enveloping him in an aura of gold...before vanishing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatson looked down at himself..he couldn\u2019t believe it! He was still...himself! But the power coursing through him was as if he had transformed into the hero form!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u2026.this is...awesome!\u201d Billy thundered and tossed a lightning bolt at a building..which crumbled into nothingness upon impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred chuckled, \u201cI didn\u2019t give you a share of the power for nothing, Billy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...thanks, man. Now let\u2019s get to that foot stink contest! Right guys?\u201d Billy said over his shoulder to their audience...getting an eruption of cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith themselves being reinvigorated from the crowd of kids cheering them on to cause more destruction, they set out to deal out more damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanks rolled down the street as they took aim and fired their tank shell munitions at them as it exploded across their bodies, though to little effect, making Billy chuckle in amusement at their attempts at hurting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you, I want to see more of your abilities.\u201d Mordred allowed him to make the first move as Billy smirked and took a leap into the air and aimed his feet at the group of tanks that were starting to roll back from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too slow for them considering the speeds he was approaching at them, they could only see the bare soles of his feet coming at them as they got decimated by the force of his landing, creating a crater in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lone tank was at the back and therefore not as harmed when it tried to flee away from the rampage before the vehicle was caught by Billy holding it in place with his toes, \u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d He asked them hauntingly as the smell started to waft into the cockpit of the vehicle, the operators inside cough and choked at the smell as it went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred nodded in approval, \u201cYour king thinks you have what it takes\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly looked up and raised an eyebrow in confusion, \u201cHuh? To do what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred snickered, \u201cEventually gain as much foot smell power as your king!\u201d He roared with childish laughter as Billy pouted and gouged a hole in the tank with his toenail..allowing more of his foot fumes to siphon in and slowly suffocate the people within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! My foot stink killed them! Top that!\u201d Billy said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred scoffed haughtily, \u201cThat is nothing! My foot odor is so much that it is considered a POISON!\u201d Grabbing a duo of snipers from a nearby roof, Mordred sat his rump down and spread his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey screamed and struggled in his grip but was unable to break out of the impossible hold over them, he then inserted them in between his toes, his size was big enough that they could fit inside the crevice with room to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snipers that were placed there started to cry out in horror of the rancid odor that pervaded their senses as the smell went into their nose and practically burned their lungs out from the inside as a matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a waiting of about a few minutes, Mordred could feel their movements slow down and then finally stop as he looked to see that they were twitching from the sensory overload, though they don't seem to be moving other than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, he smiled teasingly at Billy who looked impressed by the rather unorthodox method of execution, \u201cYou were saying something about needing socks again?\u201d He asked him in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...forget it.\u201d Billy said sheepishly, causing Mordred to grin smugly. \u201cIndeed\u2026let\u2019s continue to show this so called \u2018military\u2019 who\u2019s boss.\u201d Mordred stood up and promptly kicked a tank over, plopping his foot on the underside that was now facing upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGouging a hole in it just like Billy had done, he merely rested his toes over the newly made hole...enjoying the screams and gagging that came from within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked down at his mother who adorned his toe on his right foot, \u201cEnjoying yourself, Mother? I do hope you\u2019ll learn to appreciate me...and my royal feet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa she\u2019s still conscious and able to smell and stuff? That\u2019s so mean!\u201d Billy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, but I wouldn't call it necessarily mean, its just to make her know her place, but alas, her will is rather hard to break, its only a matter of time before she cease her resistance.\u201d Mordred said haughtily, flexing his toes idly, causing the vehicle to creak from the pressure.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo based on what I think I understand, you're older than you look.\u201d Billy noted curiously, \u201cOf course, the joys of eternal youth and eternal life as they say.\u201d Mordred said amusedly as he walked off to cause some more terror among the military they created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that's food for thought, I do like to be a kid forever though.\u201d Billy said with a chuckle as he joined him in turn in destroying the army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of armed forces were hauled up in a courtyard area as they began to try to fortify their positions to stand a better chance against them, not that it would help but it's the thought that counts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl around fifteen in appearance, but in truth was far older than that, suddenly emerged from the shadows of the church. A soldier spotted her, and approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn't be here...its dangerous.\u201d He said sternly. The tough looking girl smirked and blew her long dark hair out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe for you\u2026\u201d She snarked, eyes starting to glow a wicked looking red. <br>\r\nAs Mordred was stomping around, he heard screams and gunfire..but strangely enough it wasn\u2019t aimed at Billy or himself. Turning a corner he saw a birdcage of sorts containing scared looking soldiers of varying rank. \u201cPsst...down here.\u201d A female voice said, Mordred looked down and felt his heart throb at the sight of a very attractive goth girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth went dry, this had never happened to him before...mostly because he was always around his own mother...and his mother only. This thought made him clench his toes around the ring, smearing sweat into his mother\u2019s form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...h-hello\u2026\u201d Mordred said, a far cry from the confident and cocky boy he usually was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026.I found these dorks plotting something and hiding like wimps...I figured I\u2019d give you a gift since you\u2019re the new king. Besides, I needed an excuse to get to meet you so we can talk.\u201d She had her hand on her hip, looking confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly peeked around the corner and saw the scene, getting the idea of things right away...he decided to just go off somewhere else and leave them to it...quietly hoping he\u2019d get his own hot babe soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwirling a lock of her hair between her fingers she suddenly became rather nervous. This boy was many times bigger than her, and she didn\u2019t want to risk angering him or something. So she just came out and said it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred at that moment was reminded of a few films he\u2019d seen, and the words came out of both parties mouths before they knew it: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you go out with me?\u201d They said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit of a awkward moment between them, \u201cSure..if you want to.\u201d Mordred said to her a bit shyly, here he was getting all flustered by someone that barely reached the height of his toes, it was a new experience to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm..I'd love to! But uh, where will we go?\u201d She asked him, he rattled his rather ancient mind in what place could he take this girl for a date, before he blurted out, \u201cHow about Camelot?\u201d He suggested, before the girl giggled at the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do know that Camelot doesn't exist in this period right? But...we could try Britain.\u201d She said with a nervous smile on her face, unsure if that would help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately it did, \u201cWhy yes! Great Britain, silly me, confusing Camelot for Great Britain...so when do you wish to go?\u201d He inquired from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about in a few hours? You can control the time of day right?\u201d She wondered as he nodded in understanding, \u201cOf course I can, I am all powerful after all.\u201d He said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I'll see you later then.\u201d She told him as she was about to turn and walk away when Mordred softly said, \u201cWait!\u201d She turned around back to him with a raised eyebrow with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must know your name fair maiden, I haven't caught it before.\u201d He implored her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right I forgot...I'm Siren, at least that's what my friends call me.\u201d She told him politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I must say, your name fits perfectly.\u201d Mordred said before he blushed in embarrassment from the rather cliche line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, maybe Billy might have some tips for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred walked back to his castle, picking up his purple shoes and placing them back on his feet, his mind too preoccupied to hear the distant screaming from the ring dimension. The kids had apparently started to mull around a bit after the show had started to quiet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around for Billy and couldn\u2019t see him, he spotted a young boy eating some of the sweet desserts still left out. \u201cWhere did Batson go?\u201d He inquired to the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid nodded and pointed to the castle, \u201cHe went to the castle, your majesty!\u201d He said politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred nodded his thanks, feeling his ego inflate more at the way he was addressed by even average kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the front doors, he entered in to see Billy seated on a throne next to his own, he\u2019d placed his sneakers and socks back on...wouldn\u2019t want to spoil his foot odor when not in use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re back...so how did it go?\u201d Billy asked with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I think it went well...we\u2019ve arranged to go to Britain on a\u2026.date.\u201d Mordred explained shyly as he sat in his own throne next to Billy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh..look at youuu\u2026\u201d Billy teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSigh\u2026.what do I do? I\u2019ve seen a few films and read some books but...I doubt that will be of much use.\u201d Mordred sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, I\u2019ll help you out.\u201d Billy patted his king and friend on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will? You are a fine friend Billy.\u201d Mordred praised him as Billy smiled at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, now lets see if I can help with your financing.\u201d He declared as he indicated to Mordred to take a seat on the ground as he did the same sitting cross legged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let's start with bringing up things you like so we can see if the girl likes your interests.\u201d Billy started off as he nods in agreement and started to list things off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's see\u2026I enjoy playing video games like you mortals do, I like ruling over collective mass of subjects, destroying my enemies and torturing those I don't like with my foot odor, having supreme powers over the universe a-\u201d He said about to continue before Billy interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I think I got the gist of it, I don't think popping a boner on your first date is the proper way to go if she is nervous and stuff.\u201d He told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what you want me to do lie? A true king doesn't lie to his subjects, it'd make Siren think I'm not being honest.\u201d He retorted back at him slightly indignant of the notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine we can think of another thing, maybe she digs those of the intellectual kind.\u201d Billy mused on what could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am rather knowledgeable on all sorts of magic, so maybe we can discuss our magic capabilities?\u201d He wondered in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah that can work find some common ground, if it all comes to worse, just be yourself, that always work.\u201d He reminded him to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026.what shall I wear?\u201d Mordred said thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine as is.\u201d A voice said, causing Mordred to look up at Billy, who appeared just as confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly skipping into view before the two young colossi was the tiny form of Siren. \u201cHiiiii.\u201d She said with a wave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh\u2026.w-when did you-...\u201d Mordred appeared flustered, \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d Mordred\u2019s face flushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm...since you started talking with each other.\u201d She grinned, meaning she heard him list off his interests...as well as Billy\u2019s crack about him popping a boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred hid his scarlet face as Billy smirked before Siren spoke up: <br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry about trying to impress me so much, your majesty. I think you\u2019re really awesome...cute too. I love a big powerful guy...especially one who\u2019s got feet like yours.\u201d She winked, which caused Mordred to perk up and uncover his face, both boys were in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait...really?\u201d Mordred and Billy said at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem a lot bigger up close like this.\u201d Siren giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed nervously at the statement, he was not use to this feeling, but perhaps in time he will get use to it, \u201cWell, I am pretty huge, I could grow you if you want.\u201d He proposed to her as she giggled a bit at the idea but shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, no thanks, at least, not for the moment, I kinda like this perspective.\u201d She said honestly as Billy then asked her a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to sound rude or anything, but I thought you were getting ready for the date?\u201d He asked her as she nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I was, just wanted to check in and see how our majesty is doing with getting ready for the date, what with the military disappearing and all that.\u201d She said in a teasing tone.</span></div></div>",

You're her type! Feet and all!\u201d Billy laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred felt his nerves easing and he slipped back into pompous brat mode: \u201cOf course! I am quite a catch after all...though I believe you mortals refer to that she is as a foot fetishist. I am quite fortunate to have a bride and queen who appreciates my royal feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can imagine, so what are you going to do with her when you get there?\u201d Billy asked leaning forward a bit with a sly smile on his face, Mordred blushed and shuffled back a bit to get some space as he responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else is there to do? We're simply going to dine in the finest restaurants and gaze at the famous landmarks.\u201d He told him folding his arms indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure you will.\u201d He said chuckling as he started to get up and stretch his arms, making his way out through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going off to now Batson?\u201d Mordred questioned him as he replied to his inquiry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGonna go check out the orphanage, see if there's anyone there and meet up with some friends.\u201d He informed him as he left, closing the doors, Mordred scoffed as he got up from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBah, what would he know, it's just a simple date after all, I'm a king and so making this date a grand experience for Siren should be easy.\u201d He mused to himself, deciding to freshen himself up a bit for this occasion, it is common courtesy after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Billy was concentrating on teleporting to his hometown of Fawcett City, PA. In an instant he found himself towering over the buildings..conveniently he appeared to even be in front of the orphanage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh...well that was easy.\u201d Billy scratched his dark hair and leaned down to peek into the orphanage windows. Needless to say the place was deserted, save for one kid who was furiously texting on his phone as he sat on his bed with a pair of crutches leaning against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, Billy felt his phone buzzing in the pocket of his red hoodie...and at that moment the boy inside the building looked up to see a colossal blue eye staring into his window. \u201cWaaAAAah!\u201d Freddy Freeman yelled and went to grab his crutches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, Freddy! It\u2019s me!\u201d Billy said, trying to calm his best friend down. Freddy probably didn\u2019t recognize his voice due to the sheer volume and his own terror. Billy sighed and plowed his fingers through the window...and of course the wall itself with no effort in order to scoop up his best buddy into his hand along with his crutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up his palm he saw the panicky boy still screaming...until Billy finally said: \u201cDude, look at me. It\u2019s Billy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy stopped screaming and looked up into the familiar face\u2026.only a LOT bigger. \u201cB-Billy? What the-.....you\u2019re HUGE! Y-You\u2019re a giant now?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! I didn't think it was possible myself, but I met this guy that grew me and sent away all the adults.\u201d He told his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? I didn't realize, all I noticed was that the people in charge of the place suddenly vanished and all the news and shows stopped suddenly.\u201d Freddy explained to the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...see, hopefully there was no problems.\u201d Billy said in relief as he sat down in the middle of the street, getting himself comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the moment, what are we going to do to fix this?\u201d He asked him only to see the hesitant look from Billy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBilly, are you going to let this just go on? A kids-only world is highly unworkable, not to mention the kids with parents are soon going to be miserable.\u201d He pointed out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Billy awkwardly brought up, \u201cYou know Mordred could provide for everyone, how about a week or two tops to enjoy this?\u201d He proposed as he saw Freddy look at him and sigh in resignation, this is going to take a while isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan he fix my legs? I'd like to see the point of this whole thing.\u201d He said putting out his stipulations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly frowned, \u201cYou know I can do that right? He gave me some of his power...I don\u2019t need to transform anymore to be badass!\u201d the giant declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy raised an eyebrow, \u201cWell...can you fix my-\u201d Suddenly an aura of healing light enveloped little Freddie...he felt his leg beginning to gain feeling again...and soon he was able to stand up in Billy\u2019s palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You\u2026.you healed me.\u201d Freddy looked up into Billy\u2019s blue eyes, and he began to have tears in his eyes as he hugged Billy\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re the best friend I could ever have!! Thank you!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly blushed and patted Freddy\u2019s head, \u201cNo biggie, little guy\u2026.all a days work in the job of a giant like me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n=Meanwhile=<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred stepped out of the enormous bubble bath filled tub he\u2019d manifested. He toweled off and with a snap of his fingers he was dry. He stood there in all his kingly nude glory and smirked down at his large bare feet. The appendages were encased in a magical barrier,ensuring they didn\u2019t let the clean water touch them...in fact...the ring that was his mother still adorned his toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barrier had an extra feature as well, it was as if he\u2019d encased his feet in the presence of an electric heater. He grinned wickedly as he saw the sweat beads forming one after another on his feet...it was all for her of course...Siren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted his feet to truly blow her away...she loved them...he wanted to make sure she REALLY loved them..and him of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother\u2019s suffering was a mere afterthought..though she truly was suffering. <br>\r\nWith a snap of his fingers and a spray of fresh cologne, he was clad in a majestic purple suit and tie. His feet were encased within a pair of loafers..sockless of course, the barrier was dispersed now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning a mirror, he grinned as his reflection smugly. \u201cAlright, I can do this...this isn\u2019t so hard. \u2018Just be yourself\u2019.\u201d He said to his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny knocking was heard from the front entrance of the castle, it was time to get this thing started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking briskly to the door, he opened it and saw before his feet stood Siren...she was even more breathtaking than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo uh..how do I look?\u201d She asked, clearly not used to dressing up so fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look...amazing.\u201d He said honestly, a slight blush on his face,while Siren giggled, she wore a black dress with a shorts and stockings with heels on, with her face touched up a tad bit with eyeshadow and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks your majesty it means a lot to me.\u201d She said grinning from the compliment given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me Mordred, I do not mind it Siren.\u201d He gently implored her to do so, while it was great to be addressed like that by his subjects, it felt wrong to have her talk to him as if she was the same status as them, even if they were smaller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, alright Mordred, I'll do that just for you.\u201d She said teasingly, watching his blush get deeper in tone as she giggled at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat after a moment, trying to regain a handle on the situation, \u201cAhem, so as I was about to say, shall we be off?\u201d He asked her as he got into one knee and placed his hand on the ground for her to step on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, it'll be lots of fun, don't worry too much about it.\u201d She reassured him as she got on to the hand, the surface making it a bit awkward for her to stay steady on these heels but she managed to stabilize herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred gingerly lifted her up off the ground as he stood up fully as he then thought to a location in Britain, 'Now where to...ah of course, London!\u2019 He thought in inspiration as he smiled knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold onto my hand Siren, off we go.\u201d He told her as with a simple mental thought, they blinked out of the area and near instantly transported themselves across the globe in seconds, in a moment, they are now in Europe in London.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiren\u2019s eyes widened, she\u2019d been clutching on to Mordred\u2019s finger for support, squeezing her eyes shut...until she opened them and gasped at the scene. It was beautiful...and it was clear that Mordred\u2019s influence had spread to other countries as well..given how the streets were filled with children looting and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026.amazing...and everyone looks so happy.\u201d She said in awe. Mordred smirked. \u201cSo um...where did you want to go first?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiren smiled up at him, \u201cI want to see how tall you are compared to Big Ben!\u201d She giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred chuckled, \u201cAlright, we can talk along the way.\u201d He got an idea, and slowly lifted her up until he deposited her on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026.I like being this close to your cute face.\u201d She said as she snuggled up against his cheek. \u201cMy handsome king\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour compliments are appreciated my fair maiden, so let us be on our way then?\u201d He asked her smoothly though internally he was trying hard not to squee at the sensation of her cuddling against his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm, you lead the way.\u201d She said as she watched Mordred started to move forward towards Big Ben, the kids looking up at him as they muttered to themselves in awe and fascination about him and who was on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like some are staring.\u201d Siren teased him with a light chuckle of amusement as he smirked at the bunch of kids staring at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet them do so, it is not like they can resist looking upon their king and soon to be queen.\u201d He said trying to play it off as nothing, though he was mentally patting himself on the back.</span></div></div>",

Mordred smirked devilishly, getting what she was implying. With a mere thought, he grew to 320 ft...he didn\u2019t want to overdo it and lose his future queen after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, so THIS is supposed to be some form of landmark? Bah!\u201d With a swipe of his hand, he knocked the clocktower in half...sending the upper half crashing down onto the buildings below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiren was now having a laughing fit on his shoulder, Mordred smirked in accomplishment...she was enjoying herself after all! And for that matter he was too! He joined her laughter, making his way down the streets...the earth quaking beneath his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, they came upon a romantic scene, a beautiful lake with kids going around in paddle boats...teenagers and the like on dates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo um...about your feet...you don\u2019t mind me liking them?\u201d Siren said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her in a warm manner as he sat down by the river side, placing Siren down next to him as gingerly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't mind at all, none can resist my foot odor smell, though I don't mind of you like them and play with them.\u201d He said to her honestly as he idly flexed his toes in his loafers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? This is great!\u201d She said in praise of her new boyfriend as Mordred smiled at her, her enthusiasm is rather palpable for him, which isn't a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I got them all nice and sweaty for you, do you want to see them?\u201d He asked with a nervous blush on his face, unsure if that sounded right for his tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiren smiled widely and nodded, clearly enthusiastic. \u201cAbsolutely! I\u2019d love it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred grinned and reached down to his loafers, he wiggled his toes and chuckled as he felt how sticky and slick with sweat they were within the shoes. \u201cYou are in for a treat, my queen.\u201d Mordred said with a lick of his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiren giggled and was bouncing up and down excitedly in her heels. His heels were exposed, and already the overwhelmingly powerful and pungent smell of his feet was starting to effect those around him. He pulled off the rest of the shoes with a grunt, followed by a sigh of extreme relief as his feet were now bare...wiggling his plump toes as they spread their funk into the atmosphere and caused those around and even in the paddleboats to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Siren didn\u2019t flee, in fact she was standing right before his towering soles, taking deep inhales. \u201cYour feet are so BIG and AMAZING! Just like you. Their smell is pure power manifested! You are the King of this entire PLANET!\u201d She gushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred blushed from the praise but she wasn't wrong per say, but it did feel good to be acknowledge in that regard, \u201cThank you for your kind words.\u201d He said to her warmingly.</span></div></div>",

At least they\u2019d BETTER praise you...or else!\u201d She giggled, Mordred wiggled his toes on cue...knowing what she was getting at. Siren breathed in the heavily pungent aroma that was flung out at her, she sighed blissfully which made Mordred grin. \u201cYou really are one of a kind, aren\u2019t you? Not many can withstand being so close to my feet...much less breathing it in and not dying.\u201d Mordred stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...since this is a date and all...we could play a bit.\u201d Siren wiggled her eyebrows, Mordred flushed red as a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what do you mean?\u201d Mordred\u2019s nervousness returning..thinking she was rushing things a bit with...that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meaaan we can sort of..roleplay where I\u2019m your puny queen worshiping your feet...it can be good practice for when we rule together and have fun!\u201d Siren giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh! \u2026.That sounds fun.\u201d Mordred calmed down, embarrassed that his mind went to such dirty thoughts. Siren giggled, \u201cAlright\u2026.prop em\u2019 up! Show off those soles!\u201d She said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordred blushed from how forward she was with her enthusiasm, it was rather cute as a matter of fact, \u201cAs you wish my maiden.\u201d He said to her, as he then did as she requested of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He raised up his feet and propped them up on his heels, showing the vast sweaty and odorous soles as he flexed his toes at the sight of her swooning at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy king what mighty and large feet you have!\u201d She yelled excitedly as Mordred found himself with a slightly haughty smile at how she was taking in their size, even if it was for Roleplay, he can appreciate such a thing for some fun with his queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiggled and flexed his toes as he wafted his foot odor into the air, that was sure to chase away any kid nearby that wasn't Siren, \u201cAs your king Siren, I demand you get to rub my feet.\u201d He ordered her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curtsied and replied \u201cIt would be an honor, your majesty!\u201d She went up close to the soles and was in stunned awe for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this fed into the giant brat's egotistical enjoyment of this game. He wiggled his toes playfully. \u201cImpressive aren't they? I am quite proud of this smell.\u201d He said in a pompous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're so much bigger than me.. than  anyone!\u201d She placed her hands upon the soft milky white soles\u2026causing their titanic owner to shiver in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you finding my foot odor, little queen?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's wonderful, and so ravishingly strong.\u201d She praised him, Mordred smiled at this, as her stroking his ego was just as great as the genuine admiration and love for his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my fair maiden, there's more to come from in due time, these will be the biggest pair of feet you'll get to see.\u201d He bragged as he wiggled his toes at her, making her laugh a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, I can't wait to see how much more we can experience in your world, so shall we continue your rub my king?\u201d Siren asked teasingly rubbing his sole making him shudder in pleasure from her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course...my queen.\u201d He said to her, it was strange for him in all fairness, he never would had expected to find love and rule the world all in one day, and it was due to such fortunate circumstances that brought them together, perhaps...it will be alright after all with her by his side and that is all that matters in the end.</span></div></div>",

Other than me of course.\" Billy thought as he approached the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking around the corner, he saw a young boy with dark hair and wearing a leather jacket and a t-shirt with the immediately recognizable 'S' logo of Superman on it.

It's working!\" He cheered before his head hit the ceiling with a clunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Hey...it ain't stopping! ...Not that I'm complaining!\" Superboy snickered as Billy smiled in accomplishment...looks like they've got a new recruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling cracked as Superboy continued to grow, \"Hey uh...you might wanna stop...\" Billy advised as he dodged a falling chunk of ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It ain't like I'm doing it on purpose! ...How do I stop any-OW!-way?\" Superboy's head got hit by another chunk of the building as he soon was bursting through the top of the LexCorp tower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly had the foresight to teleport outside as the building collapsed around the colossal clone. \"Whoa...I'm huge! BADASS!\" Superboy bellowed enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting bigger! Just focus and try to stop!\" Billy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Superboy was a satisfying 150 ft in height, he concentrated and the growth slowed to a stop. \"Wow...thanks for that! Where are you?\" Superboy's voice boomed and rattled windows all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here!\" Billy flew up in front of Superboy's eyes. \"Whoa-ho! You're sooo small!\" Superboy said in a somewhat smug tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly sighed, \"Y'know...me and Mordred usually have fun using our feet to torment little runts with our sweat and smell.\"</span></div></div>",

Well I can say I like the sound of that sort of thing.\" Superboy said with a smirk on his face, folding his arms, since he just got out he hasn't been on the upkeep with showers, though he's kinda sure he doesn't necessarily sweat since Kryptonians don't apparently, then again with magic anything is possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the general idea, we can also summon up imaginary armies to fight as we want to, and how tough we can make them if we're bored.\" Billy said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperboy knelt down to get a closer look at Billy as he replied, \"Sounds like fun, so...what do we do now?\" He asked him as the other boy thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you are like me I guess we should take you to Mordred to tell him about you, I dont think he's one for surprises after all, or on the other hand we could have some fun with your powers see if you would like to get the chance.\" He proposed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....\" Superboy considered the possibilities as he did want to see who his other friend is, but he also want to act like a giant with something, decisions...decisions...</span></div></div>",
