No girl is out of your league if you talk to her right.  Kim and I get along great, she's just busy that's all.\"  Eric shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames noticed the sky was getting dark quite fast, and felt a few rain drops hitting his scruffy brown hair.  He thought it was sunny a few minutes ago\u2026 but he thought nothing of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then shook his head, \"But dude she's gorgeous, don't you get it?  I hardly ever see you two together, and guys are gonna get the idea that she's single.  She won't have any trouble finding a new boyfriend if she thinks you're not there for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand, that's just how she is.  Kim's the captain of the volleyball team and a million other after school clubs.  That's just how it is dating such a popular girl.\"  Eric then paused and turned to James, \"But hey you're one to talk.  When's the last time you and Lauren went out on a date?  Like a real date, not counting eating lunch in the cafeteria and then going home and playing video games with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Lauren's different, we've got a good thing going.  She gets me and I get her.  I know she doesn't need fancy dinners or anything like that to like me.\"  James said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric said, \"I don't know\u2026  you should treat her every now and then.  I don't think you understand girls as much as you think you do.  Girls have needs just like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was about to retort when he noticed the rain had gotten much heavier in the last few minutes.  The storm had blown in from seemingly nowhere.  The two guys decided to hurry their pace, until there was a flash of light just ahead.  What looked like a giant bolt from the sky fell down at hypersonic speeds, impacting just feet away from James.  The impact knocked both him and Eric to the ground, and when they finally looked up, James saw a crater in the grass, which left a hole exposing the soil underneath.  James brushed the dirt off his clothes and stood up to get a better look.  There didn't seem to be anything other than the crater of dirt around, so he walked up to it and got a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James what are you doing?!  Do you wanna get struck by lightning or something?  Get down on the ground!\"  Eric yelled out to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, that wasn't lightning.  Something fell, like I don\u2019t know, a meteorite or something.  Lightning doesn't make a crater like this.\"  James said as he peered into the small crater in the grass, which had already started filling up with rainwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?  You're a geologist now?\"  Eric snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames ignored his friend and started clearing the water out of the hole, sloshing his hands around in the mud.  He was sure he'd seen a glint of something inside a second ago, and then\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!  There it is\u2026\"  James said quietly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something solid on his finger, as he fished out a tiny metallic object.  He thought it would be hot, but it appeared to be made of a dark metallic substance that was already cool to the touch.  Once he brushed the mud off of it, he realized it was a ring.  As he held it in his hand, he suddenly felt a jolt and his mind was overwhelmed by a flood of information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring spoke to him directly into his mind, \"Hello human.  You're wondering what I am.  In your language I can be described as a Trait Swapping Alchemical Ring, but my true name has no translation.  The wearer of such a ring will be granted the ability to alter the beings around them at will, both in body and mind.  It's not my place to tell you what to do with me, so good luck, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen James recovered, he realized he now knew the basic capabilities of the ring, and what it supposedly could do.  He wasn't sure if he really believed it, or if that was all just some hallucination.  Regardless, he decided it would be best to inspect it in private.  He quickly hid the ring in his pocket and turned back to Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had been watching him curiously, but hadn't seen what he found.  \"You done over there?  Can we go before we're soaked even more?  Did you find your valuable meteorite?\"  Eric asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na just a big muddy hole in the ground is all.\"  James said, and joined back up with his friend as they hurried back home to get out of the rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends parted ways and went to their respective homes which were only one street away from each other.  James finally got in the front door of his house and\u2026</span></div></div>",

He wanted to try the ring out but he didn't want to go outside with it until he knew it could do what it 'said' it could do.  He had to try it out on someone but only his mom, Heather and his annoying younger sister Audrey were home.  He didn't want to swap between the two of them.  He didn't know what to swap between them that he could tell and that wouldn't cause too much trouble if either of them noticed the swap.  He decided to swap one of them with himself so he could tell there was a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was approaching five o'clock by the time James was ready.  He left his room to see what is mom and sister were up to.  His mom was making dinner and he didn't want to disturb her.  His sister was sitting on the couch waiting for her show to come on.  Audrey always watched the lamest shows, it would be better if she would watch something good like COPS or whatever was on ESPN.  James decided to swap his watching preferences with Audrey.  He was sure that he could convince himself how lame what she was and maybe when he swapped back she would want to watch something good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I sit here?\" James asked Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you must, but iCarly is coming on and I am going to watch it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll watch anything you want,\" James said with a snicker.  Then he made the switch.  iCarly had just started. James watched it for a while waiting for something to happen.  He didn't know why he had hated this show so much, it was fun and upbeat.  The main character was a girl but she did like computers.  In a couple of minutes, Audrey decided to change the channel.  She put on 'COPS.\"  It was then that James realized that his experiment totally worked.  He decided to go to his room to celebrate.  On the way to his room James caught sight of the hair on his arms and it totally disgusted him.  He didn't know why he would let his body grow so hairy it was totally icky.  Maybe he should take a shower and shave it off.  He might do that, but first there was some celebrating to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

As she walked away, James swapped back their preferences. She shook her head, but kept walking to the kitchen. The thoughts about iCarly were still there, faded but there. It was an interesting show, and he could see why Audrey enjoyed it. Not that he did anymore, but he could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sat down beside his sister, his mom sitting across from them. Their dad wasn't home yet, but it wasn't unusual. He worked late sometimes, and really any time he didn't have to hear about how wonderful his brother was or see him give some gift to his sister was a good day. His mom at least didn't seem to mind him - though she still did more things with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his sister and mother made small talk about this days, James thought about the ring still on his finger. He could make any number of changes, but he had to be careful. Twenty minutes and he still was thinking iCarly and really anything Audrey liked to watch was still interesting. He didn't want to make any major change, but with great risk came great rewards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping something physical may be less dangerous then a personality trait like preferences. He glanced at his mother and then his sister. It would be so easy to swap something from either of them. Maybe a piece of clothing, or a body part, or their hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr he could swap something between the two of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes, he still was intrigued by iCarly, and maybe wanted to watch it with his little sister later. Right now, he wanted to try something else from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was braided in an odd style, like something that Daenerys wore. She made it look so simple and with her auburn hair. The braids wrapped over one another, and still left a large fall of hair on her back. She had been so proud when she finally got managed to complete the braid - much to her friends envy. They all tried, and some succeeded, but that only sparked Audrey to try newer things. Today was one of her simpler braids, and it still looked great. Why not try it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was enough to make the switch with a blink of an eye. One second his sister was tossing her braid over her shoulder, and the next, he felt the weight pulling on his skull. He never had long hair before, and he wanted to take a look in the mirror. Right now, his sister wore his messy short hair cut, and still looked like a cute girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get you to the salon,\" his mom said to Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't,\" Audrey said, rolling her eyes. \"Its fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little work and you'd be great. You're brother takes great care of his hair, why can't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames paused as he was bringing a broccoli stalk to his mouth. He hadn't expected to get her grooming habits, but he had memories of braiding his hair, taking care of her - his hair and spending the time growing it out. \"Mom, leave her alone. If she wants to, she'll go with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its just something that all of us could do.\" His mom turned back to Audrey. \"Just think about it, okay? I think it would be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey shrugged her shoulders and made eye contact with him. He gave her a smile, not really knowing what to say right now. \"Maybe. Let me think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefinitely the weirdest conversation he ever had. But fun. Maybe this change wouldn't be so bad. He wanted to keep it a little longer and see what other things changed.  The rest of dinner was uneventful, and even his father showing up as they were clearing the dishes brought no surprises.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James took the stairs two at a time, his hair brushing against his back. He went straight to the bathroom that he and his sister shared. He slipped in, closed the door behind him, and stared at the image before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's hair reached the center of his back, much like it did to her. It was soft, softer than his ever was, and he spent a few minutes just touching it. The hair changed his face as well. His face looked longer, and skin looked a little darker with the lighter hair. He wasn't sure, but his face felt smoother as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"this is amazing,\" he whispered. he couldn't believe how normal it looked and felt to have long hair. His fingers slowly began to break the braids. With it completely loose, his hair reached a little further back than he expected. There was no difference in style or feel to his hair, but he wanted to brush it out all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stepped out of the bathroom, Audrey stood there, staring up at him. She looked younger with his short, almost crew cut, and more of a boy than before. \"You think it would help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" James asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I know its not much, but I like my hair like this,\" she said. She ran a hand over her hair. \"Its me, but the other girls....sometimes...\" This wasn't the Audrey he knew. She was fearless, wading into crowds and taking them over. Now, she looked smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't know why he did it. They weren't close before, but maybe that was because the change in preferences for television shows, except he wasn't that heartless. Despite not liking her sometimes, Audrey still was his sister. He wrapped her in a hug and pulled her against him. He thought about switching their hair back to ease the guilt, but he still wanted to see how the played out. He wanted to know what Lauren thought of his hair. \"You can be whoever you want to. And if you want short hair, that's fine. You can grow it out, or they can style it, or you can do nothing. just be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood their for a little bit longer. It was more interaction than they normally had in the month, but it felt good to connect with his sister. \"I'm going to get changed for bed. Maybe we can watch some iCarly or something when I'm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? you're not just saying that?\" He kind of was, but also wasn't. The preferences still stuck a little. He knew that the show wasn't what he would have preferred, but he did want to cheer her up a bit. He could manage to sit through one episode for his little sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" James shook his head, sending his hair flying a bit. \"I need to brush my hair anyway. Might as well spend some time with you.\" Audrey squealed and hugged him tightly before letting him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...maybe I will go with, next time you and Mom go to the salon,\" Audrey said, a nervous smile on her face. She hurried into the bathroom and shut the door, leaving James standing in the middle of the hallway with his auburn hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell can hair change all that?\" He shook his head and headed to his room to get ready for bed. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the night was kind of slow. He sat down with Audrey, watching iCarly, and he surprisingly wasn't bored. Maybe it was the soothing movements of brushing his hair that kept him there. Maybe it was fantasizing about what he could swap with everyone at school. Or maybe it was just realizing his sister wasn't quite as bad as he thought and didn't have awful taste in shows. It wasn't great, but she enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom even approved, which again, was weird, but welcome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, his Dad ignored them in favor of reading some thing on his tablet. He did say goodnight to Audrey, and after a moment hesitation him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll because he swapped hair with his sister. Well, maybe not all, but definitely most of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sat on his bed, staring at the mirror above his dresser. in front of it, were several ties, a few bows, and even cutesy hair clips. All things he knew Audrey had before, and they were now his. Before he changed for bed, he pulled his hair up into a topknot in a series of movements he never knew before. His fingers nimbly tied off his hair, away from his neck and ready for bed. He'd seen his sister wearing it in a similar fashion hundreds of mornings before, so it stood to reason that he would wear it that way too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off his shirt, James stared at his hairless chest for a moment before tossing his shirt into his hamper. He didn't notice the lack of hair underneath his armpits, and thought nothing of his hairless arms. Taking off his pants, he didn't even notice his hairless legs either. And if he bothered to check, he would have not noticed the spare auburn hair around his crotch. When he switched hair with Audrey, he switched all of her hair. Even his eyebrows were shaped like hers. Not that he noticed or even cared at the moment. The longer he wore her hair, the longer it would take for him to forget that it was ever hers in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis night was kind of fitful, his sleep punctured by nightmares of swaps going horrifically wrong and fantasies of everything he could be with swaps. From a Fabio with auburn hair flowing in the wind with muscles to punch out the Rock, to a red-headed vixen with a large bust and an amazing ass, everything he could be and maybe wanted to be. With the ring, he could do that. And more. All with red-hair of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sat up before his mother pounded on his door. He got up nearly half an hour earlier than he normally did, and without thinking about it, headed straight to the bathroom. He picked up Audrey's morning habits, showering to clean his long hair and slowly began to blow draw it out. The mixture of hair products helped keep his hair soft and smooth, easy to brush. Instead of taking the five to ten minutes he normally did, he now spent the better part of forty minutes in the bathroom cleaning his near hairless body and drying his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames passed Audrey in the hallway, who smirked at him as he walked by with a towel around his waist and a towel around his head with his hair. At least she got to enjoy sleeping in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed, James stared at the mirror again for several minutes. His mind played over what he could do with his hair, how he could braid it, let it hang, or even just put it up in a ponytail. There was not quite countless possibilities, but definitely an infinite more than he had before. He kept it simply today: a high ponytail just below the crown of his head. His hair swung behind him as he hopped down the stairs to great his mom and sister. His dad left for the day already, and again, one less surprising thing about all this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that could change. Swap something about him with someone who cared for their family. Or swap how his dad saw him. Maybe get spoiled like his sister or praised like his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" his mom said. \"Do you want breakfast?\" She motioned toward the table where Audrey sat. She was dressed exactly the same, with nothing spectacular about her hair. It was utterly plain, like his had been the day before.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted to get out of there before he made any more swaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it was a nice day out, so he could walk to school His hair swung slightly as he walked, flickin his neck on some odds steps. It wasn't a long walk to school, and he was planning on meeting up with Lauren. He wanted to know what she thought of his hair, and maybe get a few tips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, a group of kids were standing waiting for the bus. He stopped to give them a look. Three boys and two girls stood in a line. The boys were all wearing jeans and some type of t-shirt. He couldn't really tell, but that didn't matter too much. One of the girls was wearing a light colored dress with black mary janes and the other was wearing a jean skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take much, by the time he was passed them, girls were no wearing jeans and two of the boys were in the skirt and dresses. No one thought any different, but the boys stopped messing around with a puddle of mud while one of the girls jumped right into them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay?\" James turned, his ponytail flipped to smack him in the face. Lauren was standing with a large smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said, returning the smile. \"Everything's great.\" She wrapped him in a hug, and gave him a quick kiss on the lips before stepping back. \"May be going to the salon this weekend with my mom and Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Audrey's going with?\" And she doesn't find the hair weird. Okay, so the swapping was definitely dangerous. \"That's great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so,\" James said, not really knowing how it would be play out, but he didn't feel too bad. Maybe it would make his sister easier to deal instead of the spoiled princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked about nothing the rest of the way to school. As more students gathered to head to class, James spotted more and more swaps to make, felt that tenuous grip on his control slipping away. Even if people didn't notice, he would, and that would be enough to have some fun. Plus, why not get hte body he wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'll keep the hair though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No where nearly as bad as the football players. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe football players, particularly the quarterback, fulfilled the bingo card for every single bad trope about high school. Jackson lead the group and decided who to bully. Not the most creative guy in the world, so maybe it was time to make another trait swap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid spotted the perfect target to swap traits: Tracey Holt was a freshman. She was kind, but very solitary. He knew Lauren talked to her sometimes, and that Tracey had friends, but she wasn't popular. Far from it in fact. A quiet band kid who just wanted to get through high school.

Anything.

Part of that was her natural charm, but the other part was she grew early. She did not have the largest breasts in the school, but it was a close. Her blonde hair hung just below her shoulders with a trim, fit athletic body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything,\" David said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her breasts,\" Lauren said. \"But what does that - what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke, David made the swap. Lauren's chest began to grow, straining her shirt as Chelsey's shrunk. There was not much change for the cheerleader. None of the girls noticed, and Chelsey looked less like a stripper, though Lauren kind of did now. \"I learned I could do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? These ..but mine...how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure about everything, but I learned I could swap traits and body parts between people - as long as I can see them.\" David said.

She almost started hopping, but kept still against his body. David flipped his auburn hair back over his shoulder and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but we can figure out that later,\" David said, smiling at the light in her eyes. \"We've got class.\"</span></div></div>",

They looked enormous on her, and he wondered if the rest of the world saw anything different or if they always thought she had them. None of he other students were acting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed off to gym. Despite being a senior, he still had to take the class. He wasn't in bad shape, but definitely not the most athletic or fittest person there. Maybe he could use the swapping ability to reduce that deficiency.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped into the locker room and quickly changed. Your gaze never lingers in the locker room. Ever. This wasn't the place for him to swap and he didn't want to chance fucking this up. Again. He nearly did with the tv preferences, and didn't want to mess anything up like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames tied his hair into a messy bun. Nothing fancy, but nothing to get in the way of gym. He didn't want his hair to get too sweaty, so hopeful wouldn't have to wash his hair after gym. It meant a longer shower, and he didn't want to spend any more time in there than he had to - much like all of gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James!\" He spotted his friend standing about, waiting for the gym teacher, Ms Anders, to arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough,\" Jack said. Jack was a few inches taller than him, but definitely built for sports. He played basketball, and while not a starter, was good enough to play throughout a game. Maybe he'd switch with him. Or another atheltic. He watched some of the girls stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't cheerleaders, but they were fit. Softball players the lot of them. He wondered what it would be like to have those skills. There were a few gymnasts as well, but he never was interested in that. Softball was basically baseball, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJame was not the star athlete in his family - that was reserved for his older brother. Still getting a bit of that skill wouldn't be a bad thing. Now he just had to decide - basketball or softball? And how? the simplest way would be to swap skills, but there was no way his body was trained for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe contemplated the problem as he lined up. His friends kept talking around him as Ms Anders took attendance and then sent them off on a run. It was hard to talk to anyone and run at the same time, so it gave him a chance to think of which sport he wanted to play, or at least be good at. </span></div></div>",

But eventually he did and then as promised he went down to watch iCarly with his sister Audrey.  James could remember liking it, but it wasn't as much fun now that he was actually watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched a little while and then talked during a commercials.  This was the first time they talked in a while.  Since he had Audrey's hair be felt closer to her.  Also, for the first time James took an interest in what Audrey liked.  This brought them closer together.  James discovered that she was nicer than he would allow himself to believe before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe joined the program already in progress.  Carly was wearing these silly goggles so she couldn't see and she was helping a boy Freddie who had broken his leg into his bed.  He wasn't sure what was happening.  Audrey did seem to be enjoying herself though.  Then on the screen one thing lead to another and Carly kissed Freddie.  Then what was obviously his mother came into the room.  Audrey had really gotten into this, but James just couldn't get into it.  He wished he did for Audrey's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a commercial came around, Audrey's phone played its tune indicating a call.  From what James could hear, it was Audrey's best friend Ellie.  She was also watching iCarly and called Audrey to talk about what they just saw.  iCarly had been on for years and this was just a repeat (as all the iCarlys) but it was new to them.  Audrey was so excited about what they just saw and was speaking excitedly with Ellie.  For a moment, James wished he could be so excited about something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen James came up with an idea, maybe he could swap preferences with Ellie who was on the phone and then he could enjoy the show with Audrey.  That would be fun.  He wasn't sure if it would work, but he would try to swap his TV preferences with Ellie over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard it, \"...the commercial is about over.  I'll call back when it's over.\"  Audrey was about to hang up the phone.  James didn't have time to set everything and so he swapped quickly.  He only meant to swap Ellie's TV preferences, but instead swapped all of her preferences.  Not just for TV, but everything else.    How Ellie felt about a thing, James felt about it.  If she liked it, he liked it.  If she hated it, he hated it.  He now had all the preferences of a thirteen year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

This obviously was caused by his preference swap with his little sister. It had obviously affected more than their taste in TV shows. James concentrated on his ring as he clasped a fist... and reversed the swap with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, that's better.\" James nodded, smiling as he inspected the hair on his arms again. And more importantly, not he knew the ring worked, he could maybe give it a real try out. The only 'guinea pigs' available were still only his mother and his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back downstairs, he decided to try something else involving Audrey. But what?? James wracked his brain thinking of what else he could swap between himself and his sister. \"Clothes maybe?\" Nah, perhaps not. Audrey was wearing her favorite, skin tight blue leggings and a pastel-colored spaghetti-strap top. \"Oooh, maybe just underwear.\" James thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that moment of thought was all that was needed. James felt a suddenly tightening on his 'junk' and he took a peek down his jeans at the cotten panties he now had on, Audrey's panties. \"Holy crap!\" He blurted out. That meant that Audrey must now have had on James' boxer shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww man, this is so cool.\" James thought, as he raised his hand to inspect the ring on his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, he wondered whether he should keep swapping things with Audrey, move on to his mom, or just wait until tomorrow to start using it again. He definitely needed a bigger 'test pool'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he enters the living room, he notices a very large bulge protruding from her skirt. He decides to start up a conversation. \"Hey Audrey what's new?\" he asks casually. \"Not much, just trying to watch TV, which is hard because your standing in front of the screen\" she replies, saying the second half of that sentence in a rather nasty tone. \"Woah!\" he responds. \"Just trying to talk to you, you don't have to be such a douche\".

He responds with a straight face, \"Oh yeah, because guys definitely find a girl with a dick attractive!\". Aubrey then gets really angry. \"Do you want to fight!?!?\" She half-screams.

Your a whimp!\" she says. \"Even your 5 foot tall, 13 year old sister is more manly than you. That's why he gave me a dick and not you\". \"Whatever!\" he says, and walk back up the stairs to your room. \"That's right! You better run you sissy!\" She screams from downstairs.

He had never hit his sister in his life and never would.  James wondered if she would do anything for real if things were different.  He wanted to see how things would b if he was the small one.  He wanted to provoke her.  He wasn't too worried, because with the ring, he could fix things anyway so he could do what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he did was swap his height with Audrey.  He shrunk quickly to five foot even and presumably Audrey was now his five foot nine.  He looked at himself in the mirror, he still looked like himself except he was shorter, but he definitely still had the muscle tone of a man...or at least of an older teen.  That was the next thing he swapped, all of a sudden all his strength and muscle tone was gone.  His shoulders were now narrow and his arms thin.  He tried to make a muscle but his arms looked weak and pathetic.  The same was true about his legs too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he swapped his clothing with Audrey.  James found himself now wearing Audrey's skin tight blue leggings and a pastel-colored spaghetti-strap top.  He liked the girliness of the top, but even though the leggings were definitely for a girl, he wanted to wear a skirt instead.  He liked the idea of wearing a skirt when insisting he wasn't a wimp or even when he was fighting with Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to go into Audrey's room to look for a skirt when something occurred to him.  He looked into his own closet and found that all his clothes had been swapped with Audrey, not just what he was wearing.  He found a knee length skirt and after pulling off his leggings and throwing them to the floor he put the skirt on.  He looked at himself in the mirror again and decided that what he needed was tights or knee length girl socks to go with the skirt.  They would have to be white of course.  He was leaning toward tights, but in the end chose the knee length socks instead.  Finally he found some sandals and put them on too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally looking in the mirror again all dressed in his sister's clothes he thought he did look like a sissy or a wimp as Audrey had stated.  His body was clearly his own, except it was shorter and much thinner, but it was definitely him.  He debated on making his body look even more girly or putting on some make-up, but decided against it.  But there was one thing he could do, he wanted to wear some dangling earrings.  He didn't know why but he thought it completed the look.  He found what he was looking for, but then realized his ears weren't pierced.  Then a moment later his ears were pierced and he put them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe posed in the mirror trying to even look more like a sissy, but it was more of a caricature than a real look.  Since he wanted a natural look, he then swapped all of Audrey's mannerisms and posture with his own.  This actually worked.  He was standing there and his girly look was now totally authentic, at least in his opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was ready to confront his sister now.  But before he did, James set up his iPhone to record what happened.  He thought it would be fun to see it later.  He could watch it and laugh when he had returned to normal.  James found a place to set up the camera and started to record.  He hoped that everything could be seen by the camera and would stay in focus.  He wasn't sure if it would, but he used his best judgment.  He wanted to provoke a fight with his little sister who was now much taller and stronger than he was.  He made one final change before confronting her, he swapped their fighting abilities.  James wanted to be the one not only moving like a girl but also fighting like one when the shit hit the fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

James didn't really care though, and instead focus on the rest of her body that was not yet swapped. Almost immediately he felt his form shift a bit, and long auburn hair come into view. His height didn't change as he already swapped that though he could definitely feel like he fill out his clothes better, especially in the chest and butt area. he put his hand up towards his chest and felt boobs. Small, but they're there. Giving a squeeze, James got a nice pleasurable feeling a moaned slightly in Audrey's voice. It wasn't a sound she would usually make as it was much more mature and sexual than anything she would probably make. James moved away from Audrey's room, then just remembered the camera he placed earlier. Walking in a girly way that he wasn't aware of but fit perfectly to Audrey's body, he picked up the camera and stopped the recording for the moment. As he was going back to his room though, he walked into his mom. Quickly, he made sure that Heather would once again be unaware. \"Sorry Mom.\" He apologize after he had made sure his mom still didn't see anything wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its alright James, Audrey didn't hurt you earlier did she?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she didn't but she did call me a sissy earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww don't worry, you're just a late bloomer.

Looking at the reflection of Audrey's body, James thought about what to do now.

He set a trap and she fell into it as he wanted.  She shouldn't have to pay.  Besides James thought, he didn't want to stay this small forever and if he swap back would it be him who was now grounded.  It didn't make any sense that the little sister would be grounded for picking on her big brother.  Not that anything in relationship with the TSAR made sense, nor did it have to.  James were still the boy even though he has a vagina and was wearing girl's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames decided to talk to his mother to lift Audrey's grounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" he said, \"I wish you wouldn't punish Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she was picking on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it was a game.  It was my fault.  She didn't mean anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was your fault?  What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was your fault then maybe I should ground you instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No don't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tell me what is going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me or it will be you who will be grounded for ummmm.... two months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't know what to do.  He didn't want to be grounded so he used the TSAR and took all of his mom's authority.  She couldn't ground him anymore.  She couldn't ground anyone.  That was up to him now.  Of course with the authority also came a little bit of responsibility too, but he didn't think of that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to 'unground' Audrey,\" James told his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine do what you want,\" she said it wasn't her concern anymore.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first thing he noticed was that he didn't have anywhere near as much pubic hair has he had before.  .  He did have some, but not much.   He was tempted to touch himself but thought that maybe that wasn't a good idea.  He would be touching his sister's pussy and that didn't seem right.  He didn't think of it as his pussy, at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames snapped his panties back in place when he realized that it didn't fit right.  It was true that it was flat in front and that is how it should be.  But he didn't have the hips and butt of a girl.  His hips were narrow and his butt was flat like a guy even though he didn't have a dick.  It wasn't that Audrey had the most curvaceous body, she was only thirteen, but she was starting to develop.  Maybe he should swap hips and butt with someone who has something more developed like his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should swap her hips and ass to make my panties fit right,\" he thought.  He had already done the big thing, his dick was gone, so what did it matter if he got a girl's hips and butt.  He also wasn't sure if he got all of Audrey's genitals.  He saw his pussy, but was that it, or did he have a uterus and all the rest.  Could James get pregnant now?  He didn't know <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" he thought, \"am a a virgin?\"  Before all this started, James wasn't a virgin.  He wasn't a stud with dozen's of girls he had bedded, but he wasn't a virgin either.  Lauren wasn't his first girlfriend and he had had some experience, but now that he had Audrey's thirteen year old pussy was he a virgin again?  He hoped so, he didn't like tot think that his little sister was having sex.  Only Audrey knew if she was a virgin.  He could swap sexual knowledge with her then he would know.  He was pretty sure, but there was always a chance.  Audrey said she had a boyfriend and he knew how horny thirteen year old boys were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames tried not to think of that.  He wanted to make a swap just to divert his attention.  But his curiosity grew.  What does he do?</span></div></div>",

James suddenly found that he was shrinking, as his hips became wider, his but became more firm, and he could see long auburn hair cascading down his shoulders. He could even feel his facial features changing as they were becoming more feminine! Soon after, James looked in the mirror and saw Audrey looking back at him! \"Wow! I even sound like her!\" James says in a high voice. Like when the ring swapped his undergarments with Audrey when the sibling's genitals were swapped, his entire wardrobe consisted of Aubrey's clothes now. He was wearing a purple tank top, a red mini skirt, the pink panties the accompanied him after the first swap, and a purple pair a 2-inch heels that matched your shirt.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James decided to see how his sister was taking all this.  He wanted to know if she really looked like him.  If she did, did she know anything was wrong.  It might be 'easy' to ignore that she had a penis, it was tucked into her pants.  But she had his entire body now, how could she not notice a complete change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames found Audrey in the living room watching iCarly on the TV.  \"What do you want?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking up something fast James said, \"Audrey, do you know when Mom is coming back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I don't think it'll be too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey didn't seem to notice anything wrong with herself or with James.  She responded to her name and was doing the usual things that Audrey would be doing.  This got James to wondering, did everyone think that he was still James or was it only Audrey?  He needed a test.  James decided to find out.  He needed a sure way of knowing.  He decided to visit Sam's house.  Sam was his friend.  But that wasn't the reason he picked Sam for a visit, Sam had a younger sister named Gayle who was Audrey's friend.  If they thought he was Audrey then that would be the reason to visit them.  Of course, he did have Audrey's body and was wearing her clothes so iti would be risky.  What would they think if they thought he was James but was wearing Audrey's clothes.  This was just a test, he couldn't stay long.  He hoped it wouldn't turn out to be very embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm going out, if she asks tell her I'll be back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Audrey said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames opened the door and started the three block walk to Sam's house.  Once James got outside, he started to feel self-conscious.  He had Audrey's body which was fine, but it was Audrey's clothing that was freaking him out.  He still thought of himself as a man and he didn't like wearing a skirt in public.  He also was wearing 2-inch heels for the first time.  Shoes that were even more apparent since his skirt was only about knee length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought that everyone was staring at him.  How often does a boy walk down the street in broad daylight wearing girls clothing especially a skirt..  He was conscious of everything including the breeze on his legs which he thought was strange, but in truth was the same breeze he felt when he wore shorts.  His long hair annoyed him and he constantly kept pushing it away from his face.  When he saw someone on the street, he tried to put his hand in front of his face so they couldn't see who it was.  If they got too close he turned away.  Regardless he tried to avoid direct eye contact.  He was a nervous wreck.  It took only about a half a block from his house before he lost his nerve and turned to return home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped in his tracks.  He hid behind a big tree trying to avoid everyone as he thought.  If he saw someone coming, he would circle the tree to prevent them from seeing him well.  He didn't want anyone to get a good look at him.  He tried to reason that no one was really doing anything odd.  Probably everyone thought that he was a little girl taking a walk and that what he wore was perfectly normal.  Of course they could be thinking that he was a guy too and that what he was wearing was also perfectly normal.  But he was afraid that everything thought he was a faggot walking down the street in drag.  This seemed to be the least likely option, but it was the one that most terrified him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cat and mouse game that only he was playing since no one in fact gave him a second look, lasted about fifteen minutes.  Time both stopped and flew by at the same time as people walked by him on the street.  When no one was coming, time flew as he tried to convince himself to go on.  But it seemed to slow to a crawl as cars passed him.  It really slowed as pedestrians approached.  He kept the tree between him and them as best he could.  When he thought the coast was clear, he would hurry from tree to tree.  His heels a constant reminder of what he was doing.  Not only that, but they slowed him down.  He couldn't run in heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he had gotten reasonably' close to Sam's house he had totally lost his nerve.  he couldn't let anyone he knew see him like this.  He turned and returned to his house.  But much like how he had gotten this far, he kept hiding behind trees and such.  This meant that his walk that should have taken maybe five minutes had actually taken over half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen James had returned home his mother was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey,\" Heather (his mom) said,\"have you notice any thing wrong with James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James is acting odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he says that he is you.  At first I thought he was just joking, but now I am not so sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Just like when he was outside, he didn't want to feel paranoid about rather or not people will think something was wrong. And so he wished that there was a way that for people to not be aware without him manually swap things around. The TSAR on his, well, Audrey's finger suddenly felt like it was growing in size, and Jame quickly looked down at his hand. The ring had appeared to split into two rings, and just like when he first picked up the TSAR he felt a jolt, with a small flood of information entering his mind. <i>\"This ring is the Trait Swapee Awareness Regulator, which unlike Trait Swapping Alchemical Ring, will simply affect anyone that sees you into believing nothing is wrong\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's cool.\" James looked at the second ring, then looked back at his mom, who seemed dazed for a moment. Must be the awareness regulator doing its work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really mom?\" James asked his mother, wondering if the awareness regulator really worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! James! I swear I was just talking to Audrey... I must be going crazy.\" Heather said, a bit confused. Funny enough she was technically talking to Audrey, Audrey's body anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying something about me and Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... No, must just have been my imagination honey, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay mom.\" James decided to put the awareness regulator to the test further, swapping Audrey's boob's for his mom's larger ones. He smiled to himself as he saw his mom's chest deflate while feeling his own chest expand outwards. James look for Audrey, looking down at the purple tank top now displaying impressive cleavage. He went back to the living room, but did not find her. He then went to the next most likely place where Audrey would be, her room. He knocked on her door then opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Audrey.\" James said, finding his old body laying on the bed looking frustrated at her pink phone. It was pretty funny seeing himself mess around with Audrey's stuff in Audrey's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want James?\" Audrey replied annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see anything different about me?\" Audrey looked at James for a moment then back to her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even in the chest area?\" James pushed up his new boobs with his hands, them feeling huge in his small hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did your boobs get bigger again?\" Audrey rolled her eyes. James meanwhile highfived himself inside his head, as the awareness regulator does infact works as he hadn't done anything else to Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem annoyed, what's wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw tell your big brother.\" James kept himself from laughing as he went to sit by Audrey. He felt like messing with her a bit more, the fact that the big brother had the body of the little sister and vice versa made it more entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said its none of your business!\" Audrey sat up, looking down at James. James then had the idea to hug Audrey, making sure his boobs smooshed up against his former body's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to help you, mom said you were acting odd.\" Jame wondered if the converstion Audrey probably had with mom still happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She thought I was you.\" Audrey said reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? but we look so different.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I'm much taller and stronger, I don't know why she thought I was you...\" Audrey shuffled a bit, a bit unconfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm a guy with a vagina and boobs, who knows how she mixed us up.\" James continued, smiling and keeping hard to not laugh at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Audrey tried to get James to stop hugging her. Jame let go of her, and saw she was blushing a bit. He wondered why until he saw his former body's crotch had risen a bit and Audrey was trying hard to hide it. James decided to tease his former body a bit more since it was so entertaining. He pulled on the hem of his tank top and fanned his boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its getting kind of hot isn't it.\" James said. He could see that somehow his body's hormones still affected Audrey as she looked away, clearly blushing and clearly having a bulge in \"her\" pants.</span></div></div>",

It looks like you are a little excited.  I could help you out you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, GET OUT OF HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it looks like you need my help.

He wasn't going to do anything, but things had gotten out of hand.  James didn't know what to do.  Audrey was going to tell mom and he couldn't explain such a thing no matter who he looked like.  James had to do something and he had to do it quick, there was only seconds to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing he could think of was to swap lives with mom.  Then he could control things.  So just as Audrey was blurting out, \"James was going to touch my privates\"  James and Heather switched places.    James still had Audrey's body but now he was 'Mom'.

I'm sure he is sorry.

James was probably blowing off steam because you hit him before.\" James explained to Audrey.  \"Look, I'll tell you what.  I'll lift your prior grounding and you and James go to your own rooms and then we'll forget this whole thing ever happened.\"  Audrey was happy that her grounding was lifted and she knew that nothing really happened.  Besides she felt a little guilty about having a hard-on while her brother was around.  She trudged off to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen James told his mother, \"You too young man.\"  Heather went to James' room and James was left alone in his parent's bedroom.

But then it hit him, if he was wearing panties, does that mean his drawers were only filled with panties or this was the only one?  He went over to the drawer that should contain his boxers and briefs and looked in.  Sure enough it was full of panties.  There were more panties in there than he had ever had briefs.  They were in dozens of styles and colors.  He remembered he had only about about a dozen of his own underwear.  There wasn't much variety, they were all white and mostly boxers which he preferred but he also had a few pairs of briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his room, he found Audrey in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, can I ask you a big favor?\" he asked sheepishly.  He knew this conversation would be odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want,\" Audrey said with a mock exasperated sound in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, can I borrow a pair of your boxers?\"  James made sure to say boxers instead of underwear.  He wanted to be clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want to borrow a pair of my boxers? Are you going to wear them?  Are you a fag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all the other boys wear boxers.  I want to see how they feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't wear my underwear.  That is just like so totally gay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wear your pretty panties and I'll wear my boxers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the other boys wear boxers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make it any less gay.  Do you want to wear my skirt too?  How about my dress.  I have a great pair of strappy sandals with a heel mom just bought me.  Do you want to wear them too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but this is different.  None of the other boys in my class wear panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I want to dress like they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then borrow their underwear.  You can't wear my clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are wearing boys boxers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what.  They fit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you wearing panties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never have.  That would be totally weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't the other girls wear panties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they do.  They're girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a girl you should wear panties too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I shouldn't.  I wear boxers.\"  Audrey was getting mad.  She pushed passed James and went to find her mother.  But before she left she said, \"I'm getting mom, don't touch my underwear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames followed her out.  \"Mom, James is acting all faggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey don't use a word like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he wants to wear my boxers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants to what?\" James mother Heather said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants to wear my boxers,\" Audrey repeated<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather looked at James.  \"It was a joke, it was a joke,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't very funny,\" Heather replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's no big deal, I wasn't going to do it.  I just wanted to see what Audrey would say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say you are a fuckin queer,\" Audrey shouted at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mom,\" Audrey apologized to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you should apologize to your sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think you are a fa...\" Heather gave Audrey a look before she finished her sentence.  Continuing Audrey said, \"a fairy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just a joke,\" James tried to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much left to be said, James and Audrey returned to their room.  On the way, \"Next time I'll call your bluff and make you wear my boxers.  Then you can fly away like the fairy you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen James returned to his room.  He thought about what happened.  Audrey acted like wearing boxers was the normal thing for her.  Even though she knew that boys wear boxers and girls wear panties.  His mother thought the same thing.  James realized that no matter how screwed up he could make things, everyone would think things are perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames would wait until tomorrow and then use the ring some more.</span></div></div>",

James kicked things off with another swap, and this time Audrey's denim skirt was swapped with James' jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth items of clothing automatically resized to fit, and now James smirked at Audrey as he looked at her across the table. \"Don't start on me again!\" Audrey snapped, warning her big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice jeans.\" James complimented his sister, glancing under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you want to wear those too?\" Audrey rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most jeans are pretty much unisex.

James decided to swap Audrey's legs with his own.  Soon his legs looked a lot prettier (not to mention thinner and smoother under his skirt.)  But James didn't feel any different.

It felt like it always had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bathroom he looked at his legs, they were obviously the legs of a girl.  They were smooth and thin.  Audrey was only thirteen, she hadn't developed any real curves on her legs or most anyplace else.  James took his hand down to touch his legs, they felt smooth to the touch on his hands, but didn't feel any different from his legs point of view.  Then something occurred to him and he looked at his crotch.  The familiar bulge could be seen under his skirt.  But he had to touch it with his hands to make sure.  \"Everything is normal down there,\" he thought.  When he was finished, he left the bathroom, and headed towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was still mad and said spitefully, \"my don't you look pretty.\" She wanted to add fairy boy but she restrained herself since her mom was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames swapped his voice with Audrey's and then responding with irony in Audrey's own voice, \"You took the words out of my mouth.\"  James smiled to himself and left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Nobody questioned anything, despite his mis-matched appearance.

He couldn't help but smile as he approached the three girls. Megan was the prettiest by far, long dark brown hair, her breasts were already a C-cup at age 13, she was 5' tall and dressed in a dark denim jacket, yellow top, a pair of black leggings and some white hi-top sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStood next to Megan, was Mariah, a Hispanic girl, also thirteen years of age and 5' tall. Her full ass was typical of a Latina even at such a young age. Her breasts were a small B-cup and her dusty blonde hair was cascading around her shoulders. Mariah wore a sky-blue cardigan, a white t-shirt, a black mini skirt and some basic flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally there was 5' 1\" tall Rachel and her solid B-cups, stood opposite the other two. Rachel was the least 'peppy' of the three, but still popular among her friends. Her dark hair was secured in a ponytail and she stood texting on her phone. Rachel also had her nose pierced and was wearing a black Nike jacket with a pink t-shirt underneath, a pair of denim shorts and some block-heeled ankle boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but can we call on her?\" Marianne then called over to James, who kept chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that just yet.

We haven't gone out on a date yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriah asked question after question, but James didn't have any answers.  He certainly couldn't tell her about the TSAR and that he was just asking her out on a date because he wanted to see what would happen after he changed things.  James couldn't ask a thirteen year old out before.  Not even if he wanted to.  This date was just a test.  James wanted her to stop but she wouldn't.  So James used the TSAR.  Suddenly, Miriah wasn't with him.  She was on the football field.  She was one of the players.  Actually she was the player who played opposite Kevin who has most of Miriah's real body.  The boy who had been swapped with Miriah didn't know why he was here.  Not only wasn't he in the game, he didn't care about football anymore.  His mother soon joined him from the stands and then they left together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" James said to Megan who was still standing next to him.  \"Let's go the the stands and watch Miriah play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found too empty seats to watch.  Megan cheered her friend on wildly.  James did too but he did so for other reasons.  James knew what was going on and how everything had changed.  Miriah and Kevin were actually equally matched.  Miriah with her little boy body was fast and wiry.  Kevin was bigger and stronger, but he didn't have the proper attire, especially footwear to play well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look like they are having a lot of fun.  Do you wish you were playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll leave that to the little boys...and to Miriah of course,\" Megan said truthfully. </span></div></div>",

As he cheered, his newly stolen boobs jiggled on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the boy sat next to him, now possessing Megan's flat-chested 13-year old body, looked around puzzled. His chesnut-haired visage was a picture as his mother shouted him over. \"Toby, come on sweetie, we have to get home now.\" She said. Clearly none of the little boys had a reason to be there anymore if they weren't playing football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled briefly as he saw Megan's former ass wiggling in the boy's leggings as he walked away. <i>He's not keeping that...</i> James thought, swapping the boy's new bum with his own. As Megan's former bum expanded under his denim skirt, her hips accompanied it, making him that much more feminine. Little Toby quickly disappeared from the area with his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there were yells or joy and James looked back to see the ball in the back of the net. \"In your face Miriah!\" Megan teased her friend after getting a goal past her.

But the bulge in his skirt was proof that he remained male where it counted. \"Sweet!\" James chirped in Audrey's voice as he gave his boobs a quick squeeze with Mariah's former hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Mariah's skin tone wasn't that much darker than Megan's or Audrey's, so James thought he looked okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Megan scored another goal, Mariah's little shoulders slumped as her friend did a little mocking dance in front of her. \"You're being cruuuushed!\" Megan chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames just continued smirking as he watched his two new friends interacting.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He thought he should be represented down on the field.  So he decided to swap something.  There was very little left of him so he swapped his penis with one of the boys on Mariah's team.  With the dick of a seven-year-old it was hardly noticeable inside his small skirt.  It also wasn't hard anymore as the testosterone in his system dropped to pre-pubescent levels.  James started to root for the little boy who had his dick to play better.  After all even though his friends Megan and Miriah were on the field, and he was close to them, he wasn't closer to anything else than his own dick.  The only problem was that he didn't know the name of the boy with his penis.  It didn't matter too much he could root for him anyway.</span></div></div>",

His computer,. some of his furniture, his books and other things.  In the drawers he finds a mixture of his clothing and his former sister Audrey's clothing: his tops and his sister's bottoms although everything is in his size.  Looking in the closet he also knew which were his things and which we his new sister Alice's things.  Then something hit him.  None of the dresses in the closet were his, although he did own several skirts.  James guessed that that made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames surmised that he was sharing a room with Alice instead of Rachel's brothers since he had taken her place in the family.  He didn't remember exactly which options he chose to swap with Rachel, but the TSAR changed reality such that he was sharing a room with a female.  Maybe he should swap something else and 'move' into the room with his new brothers.  James decided it would be more fun not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before James could complete that thought, Alice came into their room.  She greeted him warmly and re returned the favor.  Alice was hot.  James hadn't see her before.  Well he had seen her around the neighborhood, but he didn't know that Alice was the big sister of Audrey's friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames decided to see what would happen if he changed his clothes in front of Alice.  He wanted to get naked in front of her to see her reaction.  Actually he wanted her to change her clothes in front of him, but he couldn't make her do that.  He couldn't make her do anything.  He could only swap traits.  James pealed off his shirt, revealing his bra and threw it to the ground and then he unzipped his skirt and let it drop to the floor revealing his panties.  Then he kicked off his shoes and unfastened his bra.  he was only in his panties now.  He was about to take those off too revealing his penis when he heard Alice say, \"What the fuck are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm changing,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you are changing.  Stop throwing you junk on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your things in the hamper.,  That is why we have one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his old life, James always threw his clothes on the floor.  His mother picked them up.  She made his bed too.  But Alice wouldn't stand for it in her 'spotless' room.  She didn't care that she shared a room with her brother.  She didn't care that he was mostly naked in front of her.  She didn't care that his penis would clearly be seen under his panties.  Nor that it was becoming semi-erect all she cared about was that her brother was making a mess in their room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He saw Jennifer's car in the driveway.  It had been over a half hour and they hadn't left yet.  This made James mad so he decided to make another swap.  Claire who was in bed with Jennifer having another of her many orgasms found herself fully clothed again in Scott's male club attire.  She would find that just like Joanne her entire wardrobe was male.  Scott who was now sitting in the front seat was exposed.  His panties that he was wearing was pulled down to mid-thigh and his bra was hanging on by a strap.  He dress and shoes were thrown haphazardly in the back of the car.  His makeup was also a mess although he could fix it if he liked since his purse filled with makeup and other items was also lying on the floor under the backseat of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen James got back to his house, he swapped the ownership of the car back to Scott.  Scott mostly naked was now sitting in front of the steering wheel.  \"Scott, you probably should put on some clothes before driving home.  At the very least you should pull up your panties.  You look a mess.\"  Then he got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce James got into his house, he decided that he didn't like Alice's friends very much.  He then swapped friends again back with Alice.  He was now back to being friends with Megan, Miriah and of course his former sister Audrey.  Besides James was curious how Megan's date with Rachel went.</span></div></div>",

His sister and her friends were in the seventh grade.  James had made a mistake.  But he didn't know if he should fix it.  If he did then two students would be displaced instead of one.  James knew that even if he was in his friend's grade level didn't mean he would be in all of their classes.  This was actually impossible since even Megan, Miriah and Audrey weren't in the same classes all the time.  But he decided that if he was going to go to middle school he should share at least some of the classes with his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames rushed into school, he needed someone to swap with.  Looking through the windows on the classroom doors James found Megan sitting in one.  Another student was about to head into the room (he was a little late) and James swapped classes with the boy.  The boy hurried off to his now sixth grade class.  James entered the room.  Inside James' bookbag, his stuff changed again to reflect his new class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames entered the classroom, it was the lab for one of his science classes.  Since he was late and Megan had already partnered up, he was partnered with the class geek who was known to love eating the erasers on the top of her pencils and had this loud obnoxious laugh what she used even when the 'jokes' her not funny.  Even though the girl was wearing a dress dress and some makeup she was still a fashion disaster.  One of the boys laughed at who James got stuck with.  He soon found himself with a desire to eat his own eraser and was wearing a very ugly dress.  James' partner was now wearing a tee shirt and jeans although her hair was a bit butch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next</span></div></div>",

He felt bloated like all his clothing had become two sizes too small.  His boobs didn't only feel bloated but they felt tender too.  His mood had soured.  he didn't want to be in school anymore, he could picture himself back at home wearing over sized pajamas lying down and eating chocolate.  Maybe taking a nap.  But he didn't only want something sweet like chocolate, he wanted something salty too.  Maybe chocolate covered pretzels would be great.  James realized what he needed even more than chocolate was a Mydol.  Bella had taken one, but he had all of Belle's symptoms but none of the medication she took.  He knew that if he took a Mydol he would relieve not just the bloating, but also the cramps and a little headache that he now had.  James didn't know how women stood all this pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was now an expert on putting in a pad and he could do it in only a few seconds.  He knew that he would have to use the wings to wrap the pad around his underwear.  For a moment he wondered if he should swap out his male briefs with a woman's panties, but he didn't know what type of panties the women/girls around him wore.  It would be worse if he found himself wearing a thong while on his period.  But even more important for him was where was he going to get a Mydol?  Should he get it as part of an exchange or should he just ask a girl for one?  Maybe he should see the nurse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

James was set on going not to the boys toilets, but to the school nurse Melanie Shaw, 31. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he clicked through the hallway in his heels, James looked down, he noticed a spot of blood was visible on the dress he had \"borrowed\" from Alice earlier. \"Crap!\" He grumbled, as his cramps made him wince. Suddenly being a girl wasn't that great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the nurse's office, he knocked twice on the door. \"Come in.\" Melanie called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames too a deep breath, looking down at his clubbing outfit, then rolling his eyes and walking into the room. \"Oh, hi James, can I help you?\" Melanie smiled. She instantly noticed that 'look' of a student who was on their period. Not to mention the spot of blood that was clearly visible on his dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have a Mydol please?\" James asked immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Do you have a pad?\" Melanie asked in a concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames just nodded. \"Yes.\" He mumbled, producing it from his pocket with one hand while he held his tummy with the other. \"Can I put it on here?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, go behind the screen.\" Melanie nodded, pointing off to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took Nurse Shaw as the type of woman who wouldn't wear a thong garment, not to work anyway. And so he quickly swapped his briefs with her basic cotton panties. Then he quickly went behind the screen to apply his pad. It wasn't soon enough to avoid getting a spot of blood on his new underwear unfortunately. After he was done, he cleaned his hands with a hand gel on Melanie's desk and took a Mydol off her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His pad had been put into place and that was good, but he still felt bloated.  His boobs still felt sore.  He still had a small headache and he was still in a foul mood.  James never knew girls felt like this.  He promised himself that when everything was put back to normal he would be nicer to girls, at least when they were on their period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames decided it would be easier to stay in the nurses off than go back to class.  So he swapped Melanie's profession with his.  Melanie was now the student and James was the school nurse.  When the change occurred the TSAR swapped their clothing too.  James was now dressed in the nurse's white nursing dress and white tights which was the required uniform of the nursing staff in James' district schools.  Strangely enough, James had lost his panties and pad in the exchange.  He realized what had happened in an instant and swapped them back too.  He was now wearing exactly what Melanie had been wearing when he entered her office, except now he was wearing a pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well off with you back to class,\" James said to Melanie although Melanie didn't know why she was in the nurses office to begin with.  Melanie wasn't on her period today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing James,\" Melanie said.  Then she walked back to James' class where Ms. Jakins was still teaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was still crazing something sweet and something salty.  But there wasn't any snack food in the nurse's office.  James wanted to get something, but he didn't really know the layout of the school.  He was sure there was a candy machine and a soda machine somewhere but he didn't know exactly where.  He was sure there had to be something in the cafeteria, but he also wasn't sure whether to use the teacher's cafe or the student's cafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly James knew exactly where he was going, and the cafeteria awaited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male teacher meanwhile got lost trying to make his way to his next class, there by keeping his students waiting. Not that they were complaining about it, since the lesson was Mathematics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later James pushed open the door to the cafeteria and walked inside. The scent of food immediately got his taste buds watering and his tummy rumbling. His hormones were all over the place right no, and he had to wonder whether this is what pregnant women felt like too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning James.\" Another teached greeted him as she sipped her coffee. From his new knowledge, James now also knew all the teachers in school, including the one in front of him. Mrs Hallatt, the Social Studies teacher. She was pretty, blonde, had a nice figure and personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" James reponded simply, before making a beeline for the counter to get himself something to eat.

He thought he could handle this being a woman thing fine.  Now that the Mydol was working his male ego was reasserting itself.  He thought he could handle anything that womanhood brought to him.  To assure himself of this he decided to change.  He swapped height and weight with a much short and heavier than he was.  Even though his boobs didn't change, he was shrunk to five foot two and his weight rose to 175 pounds.  Most of his weight fell to his hips, butt and stomach giving him a classic pear shape.  His clothes adjusted accordingly.  With short legs and massive thighs and butt, James waddled back to the nurse's office.  In reality he knew he shouldn't have stayed away so long.  As the nurse, he knew an emergency could happen at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to his office, James realized something strange.  James knew he had the breasts and vagina of a woman.  He certainly now had the shape of a woman too, but everyone still thought of him as a man.  James decided that didn't make sense so the next woman/girl who passed him, he would swap her smooth skin with his own and her designation as a female.  By the time he had returned to his office he was as much a female as anyone else.</span></div></div>",

Obviously between his legs he was a girl and except for childbirth was as close as one could be since no man, not even a transsexual had a real period.  He also had all the aches and pains and bloating that went with it.  His legs, hips, butt and bust were feminine in a girlish sort of way.  His skin was now soft and smooth like any girls.  Changing his height and weight made him smaller than most girls at the school and gave him much larger hips and butt than most of the girls too.  He supposed that he was really a girl now.

The dresser drawers were his also.  When he looked inside the drawers he found his own clothes there though.  But looking at his clothes he decided he didn't like them.  Like his room he didn't have to put up with anything he didn't like anymore, so he swapped his clothing with Audrey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the clothes he was wearing was too tight.  They were actually painfully tight.  The shirt was stretched to it's limits and his pants had split at the seems.  He turned around and saw himself in the mirror.

What he did instead was swap the sizes of his clothing with his sister.    This relieved the pressure.  The clothing he now were were ruined, as the pants still were split at the seems and his shirt was still stretched.  But at least now they were in his own size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to the drawers to find something to change into.

The clothes he was wearing now was torn and desperately stretched out.   Looking into his top drawer he found a pretty pair of striped panties and a matching bra.  Then he found a pair of leggings and a nice top to go with it.  Finally he got some anklet socks to complete his outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off his clothing and pulled the cute panties up his legs.  They looked nice on him he thought.  Then he was about to put on his bra when he realized something was wrong.  The bra was his size, 34 with no cups and it matched his panties, but why did he need to wear a bra?  he didn't have any breasts, what was the point?  It was at this point he realized something was wrong with him.  He was a man without breasts, why would he want to wear a bra.  There wasn't any point.  But despite the lack of need he still wanted to wear it.  It was at this point that he realized something was wrong.  He must have swapped more than his entertainment preferences with Audrey.  That is the only thing that made sense.  He looked around his room again.  Everything looked great.  He liked the new posters on the wall and the color the walls were painted.  But should he like them?  He decided he shouldn't.  He was a boy, why would he want a poster of rows of different colored 'hearts' on his wall?  It was something he new a girl would probably like, but he wasn't a girl, why did he like them?  But he also knew he did like stuff like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He decided that he needed to swap everything back. However, in the back of his mind, James really liked all of these new interests and wanted to keep them. Focusing on the swaps, from favorite TV show to clothes and decor, James knew it worked when he saw his old clothes on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking on Audrey, she was back to watching iCarly and in her original clothes. James felt like things were back to normal except he still liked iCarly and still wanted a new wardrobe and room decor. Maybe he just overreacted and he just suddenly wanted to have stuff similar to his little sister? Sitting next Audrey on the couch, James started watching iCarly with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is new. I thought you didn't like iCarly?\" Audrey asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I actually watched it for a bit and found that I actually really like it!\" He remarked with a bit of enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You're serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a lot of fun actually and uh... I wanna some help with something but it can wait once its over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" The show came and went, it was fun. The two got into an enthused conversation about the episode before eventually turning to James again. \"So? What did you want to talk about?\" Audrey asked intrigued from the latest events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I was thinking about getting some new clothes and decor for myself and wanted it to be something like your stuff, so I was wondering if you could help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was....</span></div></div>",

Guess I must have been pretty obvious. Audrey must be pretty sharp to have noticed it before I did.' James thought as he got into the car to drive him and Audrey to the mall. As soon as they entered Audrey giddily led him by the wrist, making a beeline to her favorite clothing store: the Pink Mink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store had a variety of clothing for young women, definitely a place that Audrey was at home in. She lead him down the aisles, picking out dresses, skirts, blouses, shorts, the occasional denim jeans, and so on. She went in depth on her reasoning why she chose the clothes that she did, sometimes trading discussion with James who diligently listened to his little sister's advice. She favored picking lighter colors or pastels to better compliment the lighter tones in his hair. After amassing a sizable pile of outfits, the two made their ways to the changing room. James was left alone to his own devices, searching for a outfit to start with. Eventually, he decided a white polka dot dress with a lace knit blazer and, after a moment's consideration, white tights to hide his hairy legs. Taking a look in the mirror, seeing himself in the outfit just felt right. Parting the curtain to show Audrey she gave an initial thumbs up before handing him box with a pair of black faux leather Olina pumps and a package of panties. \"Your boxers are going to cause some problems, but you look really cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right? Thanks Audrey!\" After changing into the panties and slipping into the pumps, the rest of the selection similarly earned high praise from the both of them. They soon paid for the outfits getting some more panties and shoes. James readily choosing to stay in his new dress, netting a few queer looks that the siblings payed not mind to. However, as James left upon noting Audrey's much longer hair switched his hair with blonde's working the counter. Now, excluding his height, they did seem like a pair of sisters, James conversely, seeming like the younger of the two with Audrey taking the lead.</span></div></div>",

The ring channeled and solidified the new feelings of admiration and comfort James felt as a result of Audrey helping and supporting him today. Following Audrey's lead to better learn about his new feminine interests, fashion sense and even things he wasn't even aware of was becoming natural to him. He now respected her outgoing personality and opinions and as soon the ring made adjustments to his behavior to better facilitate that admiration. It sowed seeds of self-doubt and weakened his assertiveness, making him more likely to seek a second opinion from Audrey, while also amplifying his attentiveness to make him cognizant of his surroundings and people, so he would be able to listen carefully to what he was told and to have him help out as well. James now kept at a better, more even pace with Audrey as she showed him around to her favorite shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey herself was also affected by the dynamic shift. The ring made Audrey more confident and willing to offer advice to James about whatever she knew and give her opinion to him. Audrey began to feel responsible for James' well-being and happiness and thus started developing both a nurturing and protective side to her. The shift in the sibling dynamic dulled the more bratty and selfish aspects of her personality, making her more friendly and cooperative while still maintaining her self-confidence and desire for the spotlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey showed James to the beauty salon, giving advice on how to take care of his body hair and how to keep his hair looking amazing. The woman working there gave strange looks before the ring normalized the sight and happily gave James' blonde hair a touch-up and his body a thorough waxing. It was painful sure, but Audrey hasn't steered him wrong and wasn't about to start doubting her. His now hairless legs felt nice and it made the white tights much more comfortable to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their trip to the mall wrapping up, James and Audrey went home.</span></div></div>",

And I guess her favorite show isn't so bad either, I just never gave it a chance.\"  James said to himself in his room, as he fiddled with the ring in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there, he was reminded of the itchy feeling he felt all over his body as he was reminded of the hair on his arms and legs.  It never used to bother him before, but maybe these clothes needed to be washed, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames decided to throw his clothes in the laundry in case they were the cause of it, and decided to jump in the shower real quick regardless.  He had been fishing around in mud earlier so he needed to get clean.  James and his sister shared a bathroom connecting both of their bedrooms, so when he got in the shower and ran the water, he noticed his sister's bottle of scented body soap next to the tub.  He was about to leave it alone, when he realized that his own soap was nearly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug James opened the bottle and smelled the contents.  \"Wow this stuff smells great!  No wonder she likes using it.  I'm sure she won't mind just this once\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames washed the grime off his body from the muddy water earlier, and was once again reminded of the disgusting hair that covered his arms, legs, and even between his legs\u2026  He wasn't a really hairy guy, but it was especially noticeable under the shower water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know\u2026 I bet Lauren might like it if I shave.  She told me she's glad I can't grow a very good beard yet\u2026 maybe she likes it smooth\u2026\"  James muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was settled.  The hair would grow back again, and at least this way he might see if his girlfriend liked this.  <i>Come on I mean\u2026 if she can shave her legs, who's to say I can't?</i>  He justified to himself.  He reached over to the sink and grabbed his razor and shaving gel.  It would be the first time he's ever tried using it on anything like leg hair, and the blade was almost good as new since his facial hair grew extremely slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\u2026 let's just do this.  At least if it turns out weird I can just wear pants for a month\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he proceeded to shave his legs in the shower.  As he did so, he found that it actually felt quite nice.  Once the hair was gone on one leg, it felt baby smooth, and he actually rubbed his hand down his leg, marveling at how unbelievably smooth it felt now.  He hadn't had skin that smooth since he was a kid\u2026  He quickly proceeded to shave the other leg, and in his excitement, decided to just go all the way and shave everything below the neck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was nervous at first, but by the end of it, he was quite pleased with the results, and hoped his girlfriend liked his new look.  By this time he realized the hot water was starting to get cool, and his mom would probably start yelling at him to get out, dinner would be ready soon.  He needed to shampoo his hair still, which he'd grown out to the bottom of his ears, in a teenage guy style.  He didn't even think as he rushed to shampoo, and grabbed Audrey's shampoo and conditioner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out of the shower smelling rather flowery and girly, but he didn't even notice.  His hair was softer than ever, after using his sister's specialty hair products.  She always begged mom to buy the best stuff for her, and their mom always spoiled her.  James was suddenly jealous that his parents went out of their way to get Audrey such nice things, when he got the cheap discount crap that smelled like nothing at all.</span></div></div>",

A tinge of jealousy welled from with inside him and he decided that he was the older one and should have some of those things. He swapped ownership of some of Audrey's bath products with his own.  Besides he was almost all out anyway, let her get some new stuff he reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower, James decided he should get some homework done.  But before starting he took a moment to look at his new ring.  It was a nice ring he thought, but it would be better if it was a bracelet.  The ring enlarged and shifted itself to his wrist as a thin bracelet.  But a thin bracelet like that didn't look good on his wrist it was too girly to ever look good on a man's wrist.  He changed it to a chain which looked better but was still too girly to look good on him.  He made the links in the chain bigger and bigger until he found the size he liked.  The ring now looked like a bracelet with links in that boardline area between a girls bracelet and something a man might wear.  He liked it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to back to work he took out his homework.  Instead of the cursive he usually wrote in he decided to write in script.  He let the letters flow from on letter to the other in a smooth style that he liked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter homework was over, he noticed his notebook was a bit plain.  Ideas went through his head about how to decorate his book.  At first he thought that stickers would look good on the cover of his notebooks.  But what stickers?  He didn't know.  He thought that girl on iCarly was cute, but maybe not that.  He'd go and buy some stickers at the 99 cent store when he had a chance.  But what he could do was put hearts all over the pages of his notebook.  He thought the pages would look so good with J &amp; L written in cute hearts.  Soon he would skip the J &amp; L and just put hearts or maybe stars.  He wished it was earlier so he could go to the 99 cents store and buy the stickers.  But it was too late, dinner would be ready soon, plus it was still raining anyway.</span></div></div>",

Dinner!\"  His mother called from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was starving and quickly stopped drawing hearts and little J&amp;L's, and put his notebook away.  There would be plenty of time to decorate that later, but for now he was starving.  He hurried downstairs and smelled the delicious food.  Without realizing it, he sat down next to his mother, in the seat that Audrey always took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh James?  That's Audrey's seat isn't it?\"  Heather, his mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Audrey sat down in James's usual seat next to Nick, her father, \"It's fine mom, I like sitting over here by dad anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir father seemed pleased that his daughter was being so friendly, but he didn't say a word as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather paused for a second, before continuing, \"Oh ok\u2026  sure.  Well tonight we're having some spicy roast chicken and noodles, and yes Audrey I know you don't like spicy foods, so I went easy on yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stopped to admire how lucky he was to have a mom that cooked decent meals, and cared about preparing them just right for each of her kids.  He wondered where she found the time to work as a teacher, being busy all the time, and then come home and cook a full dinner at night.  <i>She must have learned some really quick recipes at one point, was that her secret?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout realizing it, James had just swapped all of his mother's cooking knowledge for his own.  He knew exactly how to prepare all of the things she usually made, but since he wasn't dwelling on it, he didn't notice the new knowledge.  At the moment it just seemed silly of him to wonder these things now, because he knew exactly what recipe she used to make a quick dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mom, it smells great.\" James said as he took a bite.  His eyes went wide, \"Whoa!  Jesus!  Mom you went waay overboard on the spiciness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took a huge drink of water to cool his mouth down, and his mother looked very concerned.  \"I didn't put any more than usual\u2026\" Heather said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know mine's incredibly plain\u2026  Mind if I try some of James's?\"  Audrey asked.  Without waiting for a response, Audrey stole a bite off James's plate, and she seemed to like it.  \"Oh I don't know what James's freaking about\u2026 this is great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, James and Audrey traded dinners, and he found that the non-spicy plate was much more bearable to him.  He thought nothing of it, but wondered if maybe mom messed up her recipe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know mom, maybe tomorrow I can help you out?  I've got some recipes of my own I want to try out\u2026\"  James offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey laughed, \"You?  Cook?  James you couldn't cook to save your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut their mom shook her head and smiled, \"I'm sure James knows a lot more than I do I'm sure.  I'm honestly not even sure how I managed to pull this meal off, luck I guess.  I'd love if you helped me out James, we don't do enough Mother/Son bonding\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly their father chimed in, \"Son are you sure about this?  You never expressed interest in cooking before, though I guess your mother could teach you if you want.  It's a skill you're going to need to learn when you go off to college\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames rolled his eyes, \"Oh don't worry about me, daddy, if anything I'll teach her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather and Nick looked at each other strangely when James called him \"daddy.\"  He hasn't called his father that since he was a young kid, and he was definitely acting strange earlier too.  They said nothing to each other, but they knew what the other was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick simply smiled, \"Alright then Jimmy, I look forward to seeing what you can come up with tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called his son \"Jimmy\" a name he hadn't used for his son since his son was old enough to call him \"daddy\".  He did this on purpose hoping his son was just playing a joke on him, but James didn't laugh, he didn't even seem fazed by being called his childhood nickname.  Normally he insisted people call him James\u2026</span></div></div>",

They got to talking and Lauren said that she was going to look at Prom Dresses tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prom dresses already, but the prom is more than four months away,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that silly, but it takes time to find the right dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But four months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its not only picking out the right dress, but you also have to wait for it to arrive and then you have to have it altered.

You can never start too early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to go help me pick out the dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen asked, the idea seemed like a lot of fun.  It wasn't gay to just look at dresses.  He wasn't going to try them on.  Besides seeing Lauren in beautiful dresses sounded like a great idea.  There was one problem.  He didn't know anything about dresses and he didn't want to seem like a fool.  \"Yes, let's go.\"  James said impulsively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames did want to go, it did sound like a lot of fun, but his male ego which would have made him hesitate also made him not back out.  \"Yeah, I'd love to see you in all those pretty things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the two arranged a time.  When James got off the phone he realized that he had to learn about dresses in a hurry so he went to talk to his mom.  He explained what had happened and asked her for some pointers.  James' mom liked Lauren and wanted to help both Lauren and her son so she tried to teach James the rudiments of dresses.  James decided it would be best to just swap all of his mother's knowledge about dresses with his own.

What James didn't realize however, was that in order to get all of her knowledge on dresses, he also acquired peripheral knowledge on all sorts of feminine clothing.  His mind was flooded with knowledge and he wondered if Lauren would find it kinky if he cross-dressed.  He still had no problem wearing men's clothing, but there was now the itch in the back of his mind that made him curious\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That settles it I have to go with Lauren for sure now, and make sure she gets the most adorable dress there!  And then maybe after prom\u2026\"   He said to himself as he was going to bed that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to sleep dreaming about all of the new kinds of feminine clothes he now knew about thanks to his mother's knowledge.

For the first time he was starting to suspect that the ring was messing with his head a little bit, but he couldn't pinpoint it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only for today\u2026  I'll swap back after the shopping trip.\"  James told himself.  \"This thing is messing with me too much\u2026  Maybe I need to hold off on the mental swaps for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames got ready for his shopping date with Lauren, and found that he was many times more excited than he'd normally be.  With his knew knowledge and desires, he finally understood why his mom always got a kick out of clothes shopping.  Lauren was different however.  She wasn't the kind of girl to spend all her money on clothes and shoes.  She probably owned a small handful of dresses for formal occasions, and the rest of the time she didn't bother with them.  He liked Lauren for that reason, she was easier to relate to than most girls.  But now he knew he could show her a thing or two about shopping\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided to meet up at the mall and work their way to the dress shop to start looking.  When he finally saw Lauren at the entrance, they greeted each other with a loving embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James hey!  I'm so glad you agreed to come!  This is really not like you, you know?  What made you change your mind?\"  Lauren asked, giving him a quick peck on the cheek and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey as long as I get to see my beautiful girlfriend while she tries on cute dresses, that's a win-win for both of us right?\"  James grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm well that might be hard.  It's not like they allow guys into the dressing room.\"  Lauren said, seeming sad that his plan wouldn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026 I didn't think of that.  You'll have to come out and show me then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For every single one?  James that would take all day!  I've gotta try on dozens before I decide which one!  If only you could sneak in somehow\u2026  I promise I won't tell.\" Lauren said with a wink, she was obviously joking, but James took her seriously...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When they finally arrived at the clothing store, James was shocked to see that they weren't the only ones shopping for prom dresses this early.  Several of the other girls from school were there with their friends, but Lauren seemed to be the only one who brought her boyfriend.  The other girls were free to go into the changing rooms with each other and try on as many as they like, as the clerks helped them out by occasionally bringing more dresses for them to try, and taking the ones they didn't like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well James I guess you're gonna have to wait out here.  I think I'll get started with this one, it's gorgeous.\"  Lauren said holding up a blue strapless mini-dress that showed off quite a bit of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames thought it would surely look sexy on any girl, including Lauren, but he also preferred if she wore something a bit more modest.  The only guy Lauren needed to attract was him, and he already found her attractive as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\u2026 why don't we start with something else, like this floor length one?  It's a little more tasteful right?  And try these shoes on while you're at it!\"  James said as he held up a pair of white heels that matched the dress he'd recommended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren nodded, \"Good choice actually\u2026 I don't usually wear these kinds of shoes but they would go great with the dress, how'd you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the strappy style of these shoes is perfect for peeking your legs out from behind the split skirt on this dress.  And of course the colors contrast just right.\"  James said as though he was somehow an expert on prom dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was curious for a second, why he knew so much, but shrugged it off.  She took the dress and hurried off to get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile James was waiting, he was dying looking at all the beautiful gowns and dresses of all shapes and sizes.  He had no idea where he got this urge to try them all on, but he knew of course he would never fit in them.  Of course he was unaware that he had acquired his mother's love of wearing dresses when he got all her knowledge on them.  It made him wish he could get away with wearing one.  That was when he looked down at the ring on his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames walked over to the clerk who was carefully hanging up the dresses that girls had rejected.  She was a tall and slender blonde who looked like she was in her mid-twenties.  He couldn't help but notice how attractive she was, even with the polo shirt store uniform that she was currently wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss\u2026\" James nervously approached the clerk.<br>\r\n\"Oh hi.\u2026can I help you?\"  She asked, seemingly judging him straight away.  She was used to getting flirted with by guys in the store, and was automatically paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to bother you, but my girlfriend is here trying on prom dresses today.  Does that usually take quite a while?\"  He asked, trying to fish for information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde laughed, \"Oh yeah, you're gonna be here all day.  Better find a seat and get comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames awkwardly laughed back, \"Yeah\u2026  Must be rough for you though, you gotta be here for hours while these girls get to play dress up?  Must be killing your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, \"Oh yeah, you know I just started my shift actually, so it's going to be a long day for me too\u2026  Anyways I gotta get back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the girl turned back around to continue hanging dresses, James knew he had what he was looking for.  This girl wasn't going anywhere for hours, and he could use her to get inside the changing room and surprise Lauren.  Of course he'd have to make Lauren believe that it was him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squeezed his hand, feeling the ring between his fingers, and focused on swapping some of the girl's physical attributes, making sure she was unaware of the changes.  He started with her physique, and slender feminine shape.  He found himself slimming in some places, except for his hips which mostly stayed where they were.  His shoulders narrowed and his waist pinched inwards slightly.  Ever since he'd shaved his legs the other day, he'd wished he was a bit more slender and light.  And now that he wished he could wear a dress, he needed the body to fit in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he swapped the girl's hair.  It was long and blonde with beautiful curls, almost like a disney princess or something.  Audrey's personality, which influenced his decision, was in love with the hairstyle, and he decided to temporarily make it his own as long as he was planning on going undercover.  His hair grew down to his shoulder blades and twisted and curled into spirals on each side of his head, with carefully trimmed bangs up top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw himself in a mirror and thought he looked adorable\u2026 but the clothes had to go.  He would never sneak in looking like this.  He couldn't take the girl's work uniform, because she needed that.  What he could do however, was steal one of the many outfits on display.  He found a modest and simple dress that he knew was not for prom but simply for everyday wearing, and swapped it with his shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he was wearing a sleeveless knee length dark purple dress that showed off his smooth shaved legs, but hid his lack of cleavage.  He grabbed his old clothing off the rack and stuffed it in a shopping bag so no one could see what he was carrying.  He did the same with a pair of cute ballet flats that he spotted, and soon they were on his feet as well, and he stuffed his old male shoes in the bag.</span></div></div>",

He was glad he caught it before he got into trouble.  He wasn't sure what type of trouble he could get in, but when you aren't thinking right anything could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames decided to wait for Lauren, but after a while he got bored.  So he phoned Lauren.  \"Look I have nothing to do here and they won't let me inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they won't let you in, its the woman's changing room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought you would come out and show me the dresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you could come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried that already it didn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?

He used the ring to swap the purple dress he was wearing with a short satin silver dress with matching heels. Yes, he was sure he'd look a little silly running around the mall in an obvious prom dress, but he was perfectly prepared to punish anyone who dared make fun of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon leaving the store, James knew he should be worried. He could barely muster up any feelings for his girlfriend, though he knew they should be there. He realized he might be making some unintentional mental changes too himself. In fact, looking down at his now fully female body, he knew that being a woman should have made him feel awkward. Instead, it actually felt right and natural. The thought about going back to his own body seemed a little weird and gross now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his thoughts were elsewhere, he felt someone bang into him. It was just some teenage punk not looking where he was going. Of course, instead of being forgiving, James was just angry. Still being very close to the dress store, the male punk now walked away in a tight black minidress while his own ripped jeans and flannel shirt adorned a mannequin inside the dress shop. James smiled seeing the punk struggle to walk in 6 inch heels.</span></div></div>",

He looked around as he passed people.  He would think, \"how would these two look in each other's clothes.\"  James decided that swapping people's outer clothes would be noticed by everyone.  But what if he just swapped their underwear.  An older woman's full coverage support bra was swapped with another woman's push up bra.  The old woman's sagging breasts looked silly under her blouse supported by the pull-up bra which didn't support much at all.  Whereas the younger woman looked even worse when the bright white tops and straps of her support bra showed over the top of her low necked strapless blouse.  That was perfect, neither knew anything was wrong and people might talk but no one would think that it was odd enough to confront the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames next swapped the underwear of several couples.  It was true that he couldn't see the exact changes but he didn't care.  He swapped the underwear of two women, and of a woman and her young daughter.  Then the underwear of  several mixed couples as he passed them.  He didn't care if the people were together or if they just happened to be passing each other.  But soon James became frustrated that he couldn't see the results of his swaps so he decided to do a more obvious (at least to him) swap.</span></div></div>",

He didn't have much to say he just wanted to talk to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames liked talking to Lauren, but he rarely called her unless he had something he wanted to tell her.  But this time he didn't really have anything to say.  He actually had a lot to say but he didn't want to tell her about the ring so he just called to say \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren got on the phone and they got to talking.  In a lot of respects they had more common interests.  Some of the things that she used to talk about that James would simply humor her about by saying yeah, and sure seemed to be interesting now that he paid more attention to what she was talking about.  In the end, Lauren had convinced James (for the first time) to take her to an art exhibit.  James for the first time thought it would be really fun to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the phone call, James went down to talk to his father.  \"Dad,\" he said.  \"I have a date with Lauren on Saturday, can I borrow the car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Audrey and I are going to the game on Saturday.

He didn't think anything of it though, and simply shrugged and went about his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day went by fairly normally.  He managed to go an entire day without accidentally changing himself, or feeling tempted to test out the ring.  He was just so excited about his date tomorrow that he could think of nothing else.  Normally he wouldn't be this excited, but the idea of an art exhibit just sounded so fun recently.  He'd had one of the most interesting chats with Lauren on the phone than he's had in a long time, and he was happy that their relationship had been sparked once again by something he had no idea was so cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were finally looking up for James, and when Saturday came around, he was thrilled to be going out with Lauren.  He had been wearing the ring for a few days now, and nearly forgot it was in the form of the gender neutral bracelet/chain on his wrist.  The thing had a habit of slipping his mind it seemed.  He was reminded of it when he drove to Lauren's house to pick her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey James!  Your dad let you borrow the car huh?  Moving up in the world!\"  She teased, and got in the passenger seat.  \"Oh hey, is that a bracelet?  Looks cute on you, nice that you're trying new things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I can't stop wearing it, it's like a good luck charm almost.  Things have been going well, and I hope our date today goes even better.\"  He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of new things\u2026  I'm still surprised you finally agreed to come with me.  I always knew you'd like it if you just checked it out.  You're gonna love it trust me.\"  Lauren said with a cute smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the windows rolled down, Lauren's jet black hair was fluttering from the wind, and James had to remind himself to keep his eyes on the road, and not get distracted by the beautiful sight sitting there gazing out the window.  Lauren was a Korean girl born and raised in this town, and she'd been dating James for 3 years of their high school life.  They'd been together longer than most high school couples, and at this point knew almost everything about each other.  She didn't look like a model, or was even considered by most people to be beautiful.  She dressed plainly and rarely wore makeup, but James saw her through a filter.  He saw the girl he loved, and the subtle nuances like how she composed herself, and the serene expressions on her face made him melt into her arms every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if he had been in his right mind, he might have noticed that he wasn't normally such a romantic.  These thoughts were more akin to a 13 year old girl describing her first crush, like a fairy tale romance.  But today he was completely giddy to be with Lauren, and wanted to spend as much time with her as possible.  It was like he was experiencing dating her for the first time, even though they'd been on countless before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey James, you going to park?  We're here!\"  Lauren said, as James had kept circling the parking lot for a minute as he daydreamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right\u2026\"  He said as he snapped out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got inside, James was like a little kid again, gazing at all the amazing things.  Normally he would have found this dull and uninteresting.  But today he looked at the sculptures and paintings, and modern art, and was fascinated by how creative the people who made them must have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are into this huh James?\"  Lauren chuckled, not even believing her eyes.  She was happy at least that her boyfriend was enjoying himself.  But it was definitely out of character for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's look at the classic paintings next ok?\"  James said excitedly, as he hurried down to the next hall with youthful energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren finally caught up with him and saw James staring at detailed paintings of horses running through a field, a beautiful French lady with a parasol kissing a man in a garden, and even some of the more action packed ones like a heroic commander leading troops on horseback in some historic battle.  With Audrey's 13 year old girl preferences, James found himself loving all of these.  He thought the horses looked so majestic and wished he could ride one with Lauren on their next date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw the painting of the French couple and wished he had a relationship as romantic as that.  He and Lauren were close but they never did anything lovey dovey.  He also found the woman's dress in the painting to be gorgeous and amazingly well detailed.  He imagined if the dress were real, if Lauren would want to wear it for him?  She never wore dresses or skirts though, so he knew she'd never agree\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James sat and admired Lauren as she painted a beautiful rendition of one of the paintings on display.  She had always had an interest in art but she never had this kind of real talent before.  It used to be limited to drawings of anime characters in her sketchbook, and dreams of becoming a better artist someday.  But James felt that he'd just done her a favor and saved her years of art school debt by giving her the talent she needed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful Lauren, looks even better than the original I'd say.\"  James smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?  I mean\u2026 I just finished what that guy was working on and it's just a copy.  I didn't really do anything special\u2026\"  Lauren said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just a copy.  You put your own talent into it, and I think it's incredible.\"  James said with another quick sweet kiss and then pulled her in close, leaning his head on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked down, and then she seemed to get an idea and grinned.  She had a funny look in her eyes as she gave him a seductive glance.  James knew that look and blushed.  Lauren said, \"I think we've had enough of the museum today right?  Do you \u2026 wanna come back to my place?  I could pick up some paint supplies and do a picture of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked nervous, this was more than he expected from today.  \"R-really?  Why would you want to paint me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren giggled, he was being so coy today and she loved it.  It was like a new little game for them in her mind.  \"So I could keep it for myself\u2026 you wouldn't have any clothes on of course\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no clothes?  Wow\u2026\"  James was getting extremely embarrassed now.  This was all moving so fast!  He now had the relationship experience of a 13 year old girl, and he was feeling like this was his first time ever with someone he crushed on.  The years of dating Lauren seemed irrelevant now, it was like all new experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clothes\u2026  And it's only fair that I don't wear any either, if you aren't.\"  Lauren whispered breathlessly as she kissed James tenderly on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved the way he was blushing and acting so shy.  She wasn't used to being the forward one, but was enjoying herself already.  With both of them completely in the mood for a good time, they decided to leave the exhibit early, and hurried over to Lauren's house.  She had wanted to go to the art store to pick up painting supplies, but James insisted that they go straight home.  She expected that he just wanted to skip the painting and go straight to the sex, which she was fine with, but she was shocked to see her bedroom was now stocked with canvas and paints and everything she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!  Where did this all come from?!\"  Lauren gasped as she looked through all the new supplies stacked up in her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all for you.\"  James smiled, taking credit for them.  In truth he had used the remote to swap ownership of all of the man's painting supplies to Lauren, but he had left her aware so she would have this joy of discovering it.  That man wouldn't be needing it anymore anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing how did\u2026 oh never mind now we can actually do this!  Oh I can't wait\u2026\"  Lauren sounded giddy as she began setting up her new easel.</span></div></div>",

Part of his personality was still similar to his 13 year old sister, and if she had been in a situation like this, it would be incredibly inappropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sexy, don't have to sit there in your clothes all day.\" Lauren winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026 I don't think I want to do this anymore.  Can't I keep my clothes on?\"  James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes on?  James what's gotten into you today.  I thought you were being all coy and shy as one of your new kinky roleplaying exercises, but we're past that now.  You can drop the act.  I wanna see my boyfriend naked\u2026\"  Lauren pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked around anxiously for something that might help\u2026  Then he spotted Lauren's sketchbook on her desk, and grabbed it.  Flipping through the pages he noticed one that caught his eye.  It was a anime style sketch of a girl in a fantastic flowing dress, the kind of dress that Lauren would never wear.  But her characters in her art always wore fantastical clothing, it was like an escape for her.  James saw it and pointed it out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about instead of painting me, you could do a painted version of this girl.  She's so pretty.  I would really like to see her in full color paint.\"  James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled.  This was the first time James has noticed that particular sketch.  It was one she drew when she was younger and didn't know how to draw as well (even though she's only been able to paint for about an hour now, but she doesn't know that).  She remembers this sketch fondly, as it was her favorite as a 13 year old.  Her favorite anime character that she wished she could draw better\u2026  And now she can!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god James you're a genius.  I completely forgot about this character\u2026\"  Lauren almost had tears coming to her eyes as she thought about the old memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll draw her?  Really?\"  James looked up, but then remembered what Lauren had wanted, and felt bad for denying her it.  He wondered why he was suddenly so shy around his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  But I'm going to need you to model her pose for me.\"  Lauren winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!  You want me to pose like that?  I don't know how to pose like a girl\u2026\"  James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren burst into laughter, \"Haha\u2026 oh man\u2026 Ok I'll show you how it's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren stood up and got in the middle of the room.  She stood with her legs together in a demure looking pose, with one foot cocked up behind her resting on her toe.  And then one arm was out giving the peace sign, and her other arm was on her hip.  She gave a cute wink and flashed a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames put his head in his hands, \"That looks adorable but I don't think I can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames got up and tried but he got it all wrong.  He just didn't have the ability to carry his body so femininely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no\u2026 James look at me and do exactly\u2026 No your smile needs to be more genuine\u2026 James!\"  Lauren said as she nearly gave up in frustration.  He was a terrible model to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was sad that he was letting her down so much, but he realized he could solve this with a swap!  He focused on swapping Lauren's feminine posture and manner of carrying herself with his own.  Suddenly he stood up straighter and naturally fell into a feminine stance.   He tried the pose again, and this time mimicked exactly how Lauren did it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow you got it!  Hold still while I sketch the outline.  Oh this is perfect, can you do another pose but put your legs farther apart?\"  Lauren asked while she quickly outlined the pose.  \"Hmm it's still not quite right.  It's not your fault, it's the pose.  OH, of course!  She's supposed to be wearing high heels, so I need you to stand on your toes\u2026 or I don't know, get a pair of my shoes from the closet.  I do have a couple pairs of heels somewhere in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shoes?!  Lauren\u2026 come on.  You know they wouldn't even fit me even if I wanted to wear them.\"  James complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you too masculine to wear a pair of girly shoes?  But I guess you're right about them not fitting, my feet are tiny compared to yours...\"  Lauren said.</span></div></div>",

They fit perfectly now.  Lauren couldn't help but to notice the painted toes that James now had because he swapped his feet with hers including the polish on her toes.

When she saw him in a dress and saw his legs were bare there was no doubt.  Lauren told him that the dress didn't fit right because he didn't have anything in the front.  So she put him in a bra and stuffed it with socks.  Then she had him wear control top tights to smooth his bulge in front.  Once all this was done she got to painting him.  But she didn't paint him as an anime  character, but as he truly looked at this moment.  When she was done she showed him the painting saying, \"Pretty as a picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James was amazed when he saw the finished painting.  It looked similar to the anime character from the drawing, but it was painted in a more realistic style.  In fact, he realized it was actually a painting of him dressed in drag!  Lauren had embellished it by making the character's body more feminine and adding long flowing hair like the original character had, and she also changed the dress to be closer to the original character.  However, the pose, the face, everything else somewhat resembled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I love it Lauren!  This is amazing!\"  James loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken Lauren quite some time to complete it, and he'd just about forgotten that all this time he was wearing his girlfriend's dress and heels and even a stuffed bra.  He felt embarrassed as he remembered what he looked like.  But the teen girl personality that he'd acquired from his sister loved to dress up in fancy outfits, so this conflicted with his male personality.  As he pondered this, Lauren finally brought up the elephant in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So James\u2026 how long have you been doing this?\"  Lauren asked, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing what?\"  He was legitimately confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cross dressing\u2026  You pull it off so well.  I could tell something was different when I noticed your cute little toes were painted and you had even shaved your legs!  I never noticed this before, is it recent?  Don't worry I'm not judging\u2026\"  She put her hand on James's arm, trying to put him at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I've never cross dressed honest.  I actually shaved my legs for the first time last night.  I like how smooth it feels and\u2026 I was hoping you'd like it too.\"  And then he realized the painted toenails were not something he intended to swap with Lauren, but now she believed those feet were his!  \"And the toenails uh\u2026 well I lost a bet to Audrey and she painted these for me.  I don't even like this color.\"  He lied.  If he was honest, he loved the color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was not convinced.  \"Well whatever the story behind that is, you were a great model.  I never knew you were into this kind of thing, letting me dress you up all girly.  Don't tell me it was a dare to let me put makeup on you and stuff your bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026 I guess I have no excuse there.  I was just trying to be a good model for you.  And plus I was curious how I would look after all the effort you put in to make me look this way.  But\u2026 please never let this leave this room.\"  James begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren grinned and leaned up close and started to French kiss him.  \"It's our secret don't worry.  I think it's pretty sexy to be honest\u2026 I've never seen this side of you.  I feel like you're always the dominant one in the relationship, but today you've been\u2026 I don't know, submissive?  But I won't tell anyone you make such a cute girl.  If I didn't know better I'd think you were a natural.  Of course you couldn't pass in public, not like this.  You'd need a lot more work before that is possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook his head, \"I don't want that though.  People would look at me like a freak anyways.  I can't wear makeup or clothes like this in public, it would just be humiliating.  I'm fine with it just being with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw\u2026  You sure you don't want to try and pass for a woman in public?  It could be a fun challenge.  It's not easy of course but I'd help you.\"  Lauren offered, giving him a few kisses on the neck.</span></div></div>",

James stood hidden where he could see her, but she couldn't see him.  Once he found her he used the TSAR to make some swaps.  The most important swap was to swap the masculine features of his face with Mrs. Tam's feminine ones.  First he removed all hint of stubble he had on his face.  He didn't have much, and much of the rest was hidden behind the foundation that Lauren put on his face, but what was there is now on Mrs. Tam's face instead of his.  The next swap he did was to smooth the shape of his face.  He want to remove the angularity of his male face with the fluidity of her face.  He considered swapping her skin too.  But James was only 18 and his skin wasn't as rough as it would be in a few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was done with his face so now it was time to change his body somewhat.  He had to remove his Adam's apple.  He didn't think anyone would notice, but just to be sure.  Next he swapped his shoulders.  Broad shoulders were a definite give away even though the dress he was wearing wasn't sleeveless.  He considered swapping their chests, but the stuffed bra was good enough for his purposes and he wanted to swap as little as possible.  His legs were already smooth and the dress already gave him the illusion of hips.  But James couldn't resist and took Mrs. Tam's butt.  He wanted it to wiggle as he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finished, he returned to Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom gave me some pointers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that, you really look like a woman now.  Well not quite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hair will never do, here let me try something.\"  Lauren brush his hair out and then put it under a hat which hid most of it.  \"There that's better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a minute just a couple of more things.  By which she meant some jewelry.  Clip on earrings and a nice necklace.  \"Wow, no would know know your not a woman now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" James said and he smiled prettily in front of the mirror.  \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked out of the house on their adventure.  No one would have ever guessed that James wasn't a real woman.  It was Lauren who they would have doubts about since she didn't move like a woman anymore.  James had already borrowed her mannerisms when this all started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you ant to go,\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren thought that James looked so much like a woman she wanted to take him where men weren't allowed.

His hair had been brushed out just long enough to reach past his ears, and Lauren had managed to make it look like he was a girl with a pixie style haircut, wearing a simple but cute hat to cover up most of it.  He was wearing one of Lauren's few dresses in her closet, which she normally saved for special dates, and a pair of her high heeled sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was having very little trouble wearing high heels, as he learned that when he swapped Lauren's feminine mannerisms and posture, he gained her ability to walk in heels.  She wasn't an expert in them before, but she was competent enough to wear them when she needed to.  Now that competence was James's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked down the street, James realized he was turning a few heads, especially since he hadn't realized he was swaying his butt as he walked in the heels.  No one was paying attention to Lauren compared to the much taller and cute looking 'girl' walking with her.  You see, Laura had lost her ability to move like a woman, and it was a good thing she wasn't wearing heels or she would have been stumbling all over the place.  The height difference between James in heels and Lauren in flats was closer to a whole foot now, and Lauren was just not attracting any attention whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren\u2026 there's a lot of guys giving me looks\u2026\"  James whispered as he slightly leaned down to her level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren rolled her eyes, \"Maybe we made you too convincing.  Just make sure not to talk to people, your voice still sounds pretty male\u2026  Unless you think you can pull off a girl's voice that doesn't sound too fake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's this?\"  James said quietly, trying to speak in falsetto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh\u2026 I suppose it might fool the casual observer, but they'd still give you funny looks.  Best to just leave the talking to me.\"  Lauren smiled as she opened the door for James, who was clicking along in his heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like somehow the roles were reversed, and James was acting more like the girl on this 'date' they were having.  She didn't feel very feminine today, but she couldn't put her finger on why.  She had no idea that James had taken her feminine mannerisms, as well as her small feet.  In fact, her feet were now quite disproportionate for her body\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the mall, and Lauren's first stop was the women's restroom.  James hesitated before entering, but Lauren pulled him inside.  She checked to make sure it wasn't busy first, and there was only one other woman in the stalls, so the coast was mostly clear.  She went up to the mirror and got a makeup kit out of her purse, and touched up her lips and eyeliner.  Lauren usually wore her makeup in a very natural looking style, but it still kept effort to maintain.  She wanted to teach James that even a 'natural' makeup style was a lot of work, even though it didn't look like much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed him the kit, and smiled.  \"Go on 'Jamie', you don't need my help do you?  You're a grown woman!\"  Lauren teased.</span></div></div>",

She would probably call security or something, he was doomed!  Everyone would know he was a cross dresser!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, the woman stared at his face for a second, before shrugging and going to the sink next to him to wash her hands.  She didn't seem to notice anything.  James looked back to his face in the mirror, and realized it definitely looked feminine enough to pass as a woman.  He'd taken Lauren's mother's feminine facial features, which had slightly altered his face in ways to make it look much more girlish.  And that combined with the makeup, and the entire outfit that he was wearing, was enough to fool most people.  Even if the woman had noticed his bra was stuffed with socks, she might just assume he was a flat chested girl and feel sorry for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman washed her hands and straightened herself out, James panicked and realized that he should probably be doing something other than standing there.  So he grabbed Lauren's makeup purse and started lightly applying mascara, so the woman would not think he was being suspicious.  Finally she left and he let out all the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie\u2026 don't stress out so much.  She didn't suspect a thing.  Also you did pretty good that was your first time putting on mascara right?  I think you're a natural\u2026\"  Lauren smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on it isn't that hard\u2026 I just watched you do it.\"  James said, trying to put on a quiet falsetto again.  \"So where are we going to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\u2026 I was thinking we could find you an outfit of your own to wear.  I don't want you stretching out my dress any more than you already have!  But you know I want to support you if this is what you want.\"  Lauren reassured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This really doesn't bother you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026 and if I'm honest\u2026 it's kind of a turn on.  Here you are completely emasculating yourself in public, and in front of me.  That takes a tremendous amount of balls, that I've never met a guy willing to do that.  Let's go buy you a dress of your own so I can rip it off you when we get home\u2026\"  Lauren smiled, and kissed him on the neck softly.</span></div></div>",

But then he realized that he could pass now, but he had borrowed so much.  Since he had 'borrowed' that means he would have to give it back.  James tried to remember exactly what he borrowed from each person.  Well he knew he had Lauren's mannerisms, that was for sure.  Every time he looked at Lauren's awkward way of walking (well for a woman) he was reminded of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he also borrowed some things from Lauren's mother.  Touching his smooth face he remembered that he borrowed her 'lack of beard.'  that was for sure.  But did he also borrow her smooth skin, he wasn't sure.  Did he borrow her ability to put on makeup?  Lauren did say he was a natural at putting on mascara.  Maybe he did, but he couldn't really remember.  Was there something else???  He gave himself a quick once over and noticed his small shoulders, yes shoulders were swapped.  Looking at the skirt of his dress he saw it naturally flared out, he checked his waist and hips with his hands, they seemed perfectly fine to him.  OK, he got it swap back, stubble, smooth skin, possibly makeup skills and shoulders with Lauren's mother.  and mannerisms with Lauren.  Did he swap with anyone else?  Maybe Audrey but he thought he had swapped everything back with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way when he returned to normal a dress would look ridiculous on him.  \"I don't know,\" he said, \"this had been fun, but I don't want to do it all the time.  And no reason to waste money on a dress...I can borrow yours.\" \"And other things while I'm at it,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can look anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, we can look, but I'm not buying anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

He had told himself he didn't want a dress because he'd never be able to wear it without looking ridiculous after the swap.  But now he wasn't sure\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren led him through the racks of dresses as they examined all the choices.  She seemed quite unfamiliar with most of these, not being a particularly avid dress wearer herself.  James realized he was actually wearing one of the few dresses his girlfriend owned, and he didn't want to ruin it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jamie, look at this black one!  It would hug your 'curves' pretty well don't you think?  I gotta be honest though, I never knew you had such a good butt for dresses!  How come I never noticed that ass before\u2026\"  Lauren complimented him.  Though at this point he didn't really feel complimented, only embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be such a baby.  You're doing fine.  But seriously\u2026 I wanna see you in this dress.  It's the same size I wear, so if you can fit in the one you're wearing now, you should be ok.  Will you please try it on?\"  Lauren asked with sad puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames couldn't turn that look down, and caved immediately, \"Alright\u2026 I guess I am pretty curious how it looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took the black silk dress into a changing room, and started to disrobe.  He carefully removed Lauren's dress, which was a tight fit, careful not to tear any of the seams.  That was when he realized he was still wearing her high heels.  He had completely forgotten after all the excitement.  He had been walking in them with all the grace Lauren normally had, because he had her feminine movement.  He slipped out of them and stepped into the black dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had it on, he noticed how comfortable it was.  It was slightly looser than Lauren's dress, and the padded bra he was wearing managed to do a great job holding the dress in place.  When he stepped back into the high heels, he looked at himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, not bad actually!  If I didn't know any better\u2026  Oh well I guess I'd better show Lauren how it looks.\"  James said as he collected her old dress and brought it out with him on a hanger.</span></div></div>",

You are going to need it in there when you change back.

The skirt of the full dress bellowed out before wrapping around him as he came to a complete stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful, now I want you to try on this dress.\" Lauren said as she handed him back his dress and another one from off the racks.  She fetched it as James was changing.  James didn't know that she had actually fetched three dresses for him to try.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you tried one, not try this too, and this time leave the other dresses in the changing room...No one is going to steal it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames did as he was told and carefully took off the last dress and put on the next one.  This dress was a tight fitting bodycom dress that was designed to show off his butt.  Lauren picked it up particularly to see how his rear would look in it.  It was surprising to her that she never realized that he had a full round butt before.  She wondered why she had never noticed.  Maybe he had stuffed something into his underwear just like they had stuffed something into his bra to make it look fuller.  She couldn't get over how much like a woman's butt he seemed to have.  It was a bit saggy though.  That clinched it, he must have stuffed something in there and that was what was sagging.  His butt should be tight since he was young and of course a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, James came out wearing the new dress.  It was very tight but also very stretchy and it did highlight his butt quite nicely.  James once again twirled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't twirl, turn around slowly in this dress.\"  When James did, Lauren admired his butt.  \"You have a great ass, have I ever told you that?\"  Lauren didn't want to tell him that his butt was sagging (like an older woman's).  James blushed a bit but didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, \"OK, are you done, can I get back into 'my old clothes'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I have another dress for you.  This dress also had a full and poofy skirt, but it was very short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time when James had returned wearing the new dress and turned around as before Lauren had a strange look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have worn some pantyhose.  Your legs would look so much better with pantyhose..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you tell me,\": James joked, \"why didn't you tell me before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It slipped my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know we are here for you to buy a dress not for me to model dresses for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we now?  I thought this was your idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames couldn't remember whose idea it was.  He was posing for a painting.  He remembered that.  Why did they come here?  He couldn't remember.  Wait, he remembered now, they didn't come out to try on dresses, they came out to just see if he could pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway I have another dress for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that is enough, I am tired and my feet ache.\"  Wearing heels for a long time was murder on even natural women's feet.  \"I need to sit down\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, OK, take my seat.  You are such a little baby girl some times,\" Lauren said adding the word 'girl' on purpose.  Then she smiled and they both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She would have noticed that her feet were too big for them, if James hadn't swapped their shoe sizes at the last second.  The heels grew to fit Lauren's larger male feet, and the flats shrunk down to James's small feminine feet size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren put the heels on and picked up the dress she had wanted James to try next.  When she started walking, she nearly tripped and fell on her face.  That was when James remembered the feminine movement he'd taken from her, and decided to give it back now.  Immediately his own posture changed and he found himself sitting with his legs no longer crossed but spread open a little bit, even wearing a dress which was not a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad! I got it don't worry!\"  Lauren called out as she recovered and continued walking along just fine now.  She had her old mannerisms and movement patterns back, and was now able to walk competently in high heels.  She hadn't ever been an expert before, but at least now she could walk in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile James waits for her to get back from the changing room\u2026</span></div></div>",

Not that there wasn't some cute dresses in the juniors department but not any that Lauren selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to look around for himself.

But on James, his height combined with Mrs. Tams larger butt, it almost looked like a mini dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress itself was white and pink with hearts and flower designs on it, and the skirt flared a little just at the ends with a pink trim.

She was still wearing the high heels from before, but had changed back into her casual outfit of jeans and a t-shirt once they got home from the mall.

She then shook her butt out of her tight jeans and threw them on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to wear though\u2026 can I wear your stuff?\"  James asked carefully.  He liked the look of Lauren's clothing, and it seemed more interesting than his old male clothes at this point.  He had already worn dresses today, so wearing women's jeans would be a cinch, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren didn't mind, and a few minutes later they were now dressed again.  James had been forced to resize Lauren's outfit to fit his body, since she was quite a petite girl, but Lauren was completely unaware of this.  She was so fixated on the frilly pink dress that she now wore, which James had been nice enough to size down to fit her smaller body.  She seemed to love it, but when James saw her wearing it, he couldn't help but cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez Lauren\u2026 no wonder you were telling me it looked bad.  That is definitely something a little girl would wear.  I'm sorry but it just doesn't look that good.\"  James said.  He was now wearing her casual clothing, but resized to his male body, it didn't look that unusual at all.</span></div></div>",

They waited outside a local nightclub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we here?\" Lauren whined. Nightclubs weren't really her thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't be here long.\" James explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw a woman walking with her friend. She wore a black leather minidress and tall heels. James realized she'd be perfect. He wished he had the guts to wear something so sexy and revealing. He could totally give that fashion sense to Lauren. Then he realized it would be even better to give it to himself. He could swap Lauren's fashion sense with the woman's more modestly dressed friend, who wore ballet flats, and a satin dress with lace sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it soon wasn't enough for James to just have the fashion sense of that woman. Once he had it, he wanted that leather dress. So he swapped his and Lauren's clothes with the two women.

But then again with his new (formerly Lauren's) fashion sense he didn't like to wear dresses at all.  That was it he decided, it wasn't that he didn't like what she was wearing it was that he didn't like any dresses at all.  Lauren had awful fashion sense for a girl.  But James had a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to not swap his fashion sense back with Lauren's but to copy what is now Lauren's (his old) fashion sense back to himself and let Lauren's awful fashion sense fade away to nothing.  Then they would both enjoy pretty dresses like the one that Lauren was wearing now.  James had never tried this before and he didn't know if it could be undone since in the end no one would have Lauren's old fashion sense.  James concentrated on bringing  Lauren's fashion sense (as she had it now) back to James without sending anything back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it worked and James was in love with what Lauren was wearing now.  He loved the pretty heart in the middle all done up in pastel purple and pink flowers on a white bodice.  He loved the little bows on top and the cute ruffles on the skirt.  It was just darling, he wished he was wearing it, especially with the white tights underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at what he was wearing, he was fine with that too.  It was jeans and a blouse an outfit that worked for girls of all ages.  He would have preferred if the jeans had a decal of a heart on the pockets but it was fine.  James didn't know that he (and Lauren)  had the fashion sense of an eight year old girl.  He had somehow received it while looking for dresses in the girls department.  It was an inadvertent switch with a little girl who was also looking at some dresses.  But regardless James was happy that both Lauren and himself now had identical tastes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James was so excited about his new discovery he had to tell someone.  The truth was he was afraid to use the TSAR alone.  Originally he was going to take the TSAR to the mall and swap some of the people there.  That sounded like a lot of fun, but he wasn't sure what would happen.  He was sure that it would work, the TSAR did 'speak' to him, but he didn't want to get into trouble.  He was so excited that he didn't really worry about screwing with other people's lives.  Before he would go out and have a little fun he thought he should test it out on someone and the person to test it out on was Eric.  Besides he would turn Eric back and then the two of them would go to the mall together.  Eric had been his best friend since grammar school and James was sure that he would be cool with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric came over and James invited him into his room.  Soon James was showing Eric the TSAR and explaining how it worked as best he understood it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're shitting me,\" was Eric's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"I am not.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Have you tested it yet?\"<br>\r\nJames: \"No, that is why I invited you here.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"What?\"<br>\r\nJames: \"I thought I could test it on you.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"No fuckin way buddy.\"<br>\r\nJames: \"You have been admiring my mom's boobs, how would you like having them?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Hell NO!!!  Make that FUCK NO!!!\"<br>\r\nJames: \"Well you don't think it'll work anyway.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"I don't care, I don't want your mom's tits.  Not even for a second.\"<br>\r\nJames: \"How about Audrey's tits??? They are smaller.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"I don't want anyone's tits.  No like that I mean.\"<br>\r\nJames: \"OK, maybe something small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric realized that James must be trying to fool him decided to go along with the gag.  Signing Eric said, \"OK, something small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"HMMM, something small, lets see how about my mom's hair?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Her hair?  What if something went wrong?\"<br>\r\nJames: \"Well then I suppose you could have your hair cut and no one would notice.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Your mom's hair is RED!\"<br>\r\nJames: \"And you cut your hair so short, you might as well be bald.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"\"Fuck you, I like it short.\"<br>\r\nJames: \"\"Well there is short and there is what you have.\"  Soon a playful fight broke out among the friends which broke the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, OK, if you must,\" Eric said with resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames closed his eyes and concentrated on Eric's hair and that of his mom and then willed them to swap hair.  When he opened his eyes and saw nothing had happened he was very disappointed and shouted \"SHIT!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See I told you it wouldn't work,\" Eric stated with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we aren't close enough.  Maybe we have to be in the same room for this to work?\"  James didn't think there was such a restriction but he didn't want to give up on his dream of a trait swap ring whether it was alchemical or brought by aliens or even some ancient Asian secret.  Humoring him, Eric followed James down to the kitchen where Heather, James' Mom was cooking dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames concentrated again although since they were both in the same room he didn't close his eyes this time.  It still didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather: \"It's too late for a snack boys, dinner will be ready soon.   Eric are you staying over?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"I don't think so Mrs. Barrett.\"<br>\r\nHeather: \"Well you are more than welcome to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys left the room and headed back to James room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are lucky that this didn't work or I would have given you my moms boobs...and her vagina too,\"  James said.  James was lying but he didn't mind ribbing his friend since he knew the ring was a fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, they are your mom's boobs you should have them to keep them in the family,\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames thought about having his mom's boobs for a second and then all of a sudden he had them.  They were suddenly on his chest and pushing out his shirt.  Then he mentally felt inside his pants and screamed \"WHAT THE FUCK?!?\"</span></div></div>",

Somehow he had grown his mother's breasts on his chest.  As a teenage guy he knew very little about breast sizes, and guessed his Mom wore something like a DD cup bra.  The fleshy weights attached to his chest bobbled around with every movement, completely unrestrained under his t-shirt.  What was once a loose shirt was now strained by his bust, ballooning the shirt outwards so it didn't touch his belly at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James are you ok\u2026 you have\u2026\"  Eric said, staring at his best friend's new breasts in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames continued to stay silent.  Breasts weren't the only thing James found different about himself.  When he was running up the stairs, and his large breasts were bouncing around in his T-shirt, he noticed something was missing.  He was terrified to confirm it when Eric was in the room, cause he'd never live this down, but he could swear he could no longer feel anything between his legs.  The usual 'baggage' that he carried around down there didn't feel like it was there.  Had he swapped his mother's vagina onto himself as well?  He was both terrified and curious at the same time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James!  Snap out of it man!  What the fuck happened?\"  Eric yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026 I guess it worked.  These breasts are mine now!\"  James said, a smile forming on his face as he realized the implications of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames hefted a heavy breast in each hand, putting them on display to Eric, who looked at him in disgust.  Eric said, \"Dude those are your mom's!  Yeah I get it they're boobs, and they're on you, but this is just ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sighed, trying to push the thoughts of what was no longer between his legs, out of his head, \"You don't find this even the slightest bit exciting?  I've got my own pair of tits now that I can play with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rolled his eyes, \"Yeah real exciting\u2026 Well, I'm more interested in the fact that the ring can do this...  That shit about the ring was true then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded, \"Yeah I wonder why it didn't work at first.  Maybe I didn't think it properly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what?  You going to give these back to your mom?  She's probably freaking out right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No don't you remember?  The ring can make sure people are unaware the change is not normal.  She's probably completely oblivious right now.\"  James smirked, and then played with one of his now sensitive nipples poking through his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James do you really have to\u2026  Whatever.  So she's unaware then\u2026 but what about your sister?  And when your dad gets home from work\u2026 he's going to wonder why his wife is flat chested.\"  Eric pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you see, the ring said I can even affect the awareness of multiple people at a time, like the entire room.\"  James said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N\u2026 no.  I don't think I\u2026 shit.\"  James said as stood up and started pacing the room.  \"Mom's making dinner and Audrey's in the room just next door\u2026  Shit they're going to find out\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he paced, he confirmed his original suspicions, there was a definite gap between his legs that shouldn't be there, and he wasn't about to tell Eric.  Right now he was more worried about what he'd do about his mother's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just switch them back?\"  Eric suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could\u2026 what if I made Audrey unaware of them?  Then I could keep them until dad got home, and make him unaware too\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even know how to do that?  You only just got this thing!  It's safer to just reverse it the way you got here!\" Eric insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know just let me think\u2026  How would I do it?  I mean I could uh\u2026  switch Audrey's knowledge of the owner of these breasts to me, from mom.  Can I even do that?  I think the ring said I could\u2026 but\u2026\"  James continued to think out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James just-\"  Eric started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door clicked, and his sister burst in the room.  \"Mom said dinner's ready, what are you two dorks babbling about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't seem to be aware yet, and hadn't set eyes on James's chest, so there might be still time\u2026</span></div></div>",

He felt his mammaries rapidly dwindling away and his shirt flattened against his chest as it returned to it's normal proportions. And just in time to, for Audrey looked at James again and this time noticed his disheveled shirt. \"Tuck your shirt in bro, I don't wanna see your hairy belly.\" She spat in typical fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry to offend sis.\" James responded, lifting his shirt so that all his torso was visible to Audrey. She grimaced and averted her eyes... after a second or two. \"Eww!\" She said, but she at that age where she was always trying to see boys' torsos, or 'other things'. Except her brother's 'things' of course. His torso was fine though. She left the room, and that left James and Eric staring at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude...

You're gonna have to be careful how you use that thing.\" He advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded, but said nothing. He still had his mom's vagina between his legs, a fact that Eric was unaware of. And the whole incident of growing his mom's breasts had excited him a little. He could feel a slight moistness 'down below'. He fidgeted a little, but not so much as to attract Eric's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should lay off using this again for now.\" James eventually mumbled, as he held up his hand and studied the ring on his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally I'd be for having fun with it. But... seeing you with boobs... kinda ruined it for me.\" Eric admitted, smirking at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They felt good.\" James responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rolled his eyes. \"I'm sure they did. But dude... your mom's?\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know, it's a little weird. Hey maybe I'll take Audrey's instead, I could hide them a lot better.\" He then joked.

Every time he thought about it, he started to get a little bit aroused, and reminded himself that he couldn't let Eric find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he thought about his mom's vagina, he realized just how attractive his mom was for her age.  A 40 year old woman was his type, and it was his mom after all.  But he had to admit that she had a killer body like she was still in her late 20's!  James couldn't help but think about how she always insisted on doing yoga at home, and wearing those ridiculous yoga pants that showed off every single curve.  He didn't want to admit it, but his mom had amazing legs and an ass that his girlfriend Lauren often got jealous of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he fantasized, he didn't realize the TSAR on his finger had activated.  His legs briefly tingled as they reshaped into a toned feminine form, and his butt grew to juicy proportions.  He lost a small amount of height by gaining his mother's legs, but it wasn't enough that Eric would notice... hopefully.  James hadn't even realized the changes had happened himself, until he shifted in his seat, and noticed it felt like he was sitting on a pillow.  Then he realized that his entire lower half except for his feet had become his mother's!  His jeans had even re-sized to accommodate the larger rear end, but otherwise were still his normal male jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was snapped out of his trance by his mother calling him to come to dinner, and then Eric punching his arm to snap him out of his daze.  \"Dude your mom just called you.  Are you even awake?  You aren't even trying to beat me are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah sorry... Just distracted.  You wanna stay for dinner by the way?  My mom usually makes good stuff.\"  James offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shrugged, \"If she's alright with that, sure.  You know I like your mom's cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guys paused their game and head downstairs.

The lightbulb went on in Eric's head. \"He's got his mom's butt!\" He said to himself, deciding whether to pretend not to notice or to ask James what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... wait up. What is it with your mom's parts that you find so fascinating??\" Eric asked, puling James back by his arm and then gesturing down to his full backside and shapelier legs fitted snug in his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you wouldn't notice.\" James chuckled innocently. \"And anyway, it was an unintentional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumbass!! Of course I'd notice my best friend has his own mother's tushie and legs.\" Eric groaned, rolling his eyes.

He cleared his head and then followed James downstairs and into the kitchen, where Heather with her skinnier hips, boyish ass and long hairy legs was putting the meal out on the plates. Eric grimaced at her a moment, but failed to notice the slight bulge she had as well, the tell tale sign of the teenage penis she now sported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames kicked Eric under the table when he saw him staring at his mom, then they all sat down to eat.

It was then however, due to the tighter pants he was wearing, that Eric noticed James' flat crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... what the fuck!! Where's your dick?\" Eric asked, panicked as though it was his own that had gone missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked down, then shrugged as if nothing was drastically changed or important. \"Oh, my mom has it.\" He answered Eric, whose eyes nearly bugged out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" Eric blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smirked. \"Dude seriously... chill out okay. I'm fine with having a pussy.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric grimaced. \"But it's your mom's pussy.

And when Eric gave up trying to convince him to swap back for now, James went ahead and swapped his feet with his mom too. He felt them shrinking in his girly sneakers, which also shrank to accomodate his new feet. He now had his mom's body from the waist down, and he was wearing his little sister's resized clothing, and it was really turning him on to be truthful. He felt himself getting increasingly wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were having their heated discussion, Audrey passed them at the top of the stairs, and she sneered at her brother. She remained oblivious of her wardrobe change. \"Are you two arguing?\" She asked, obviously somewhat amused about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just... guy talk.\" James replied. That was a lie, but oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys are stupid!\" Audrey exclaimed bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... piss off will you.\" James snapped at his sister, who continued annoying him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His torso and neck have also become his mother's. \"No!\" James rushes to his phone to call Eric. But before he turned it on he could see his reflection. He had his mother's mouth.

He lost control of it, and now he looked almost entirely like his own mother!  He stood there looking at the ring, and then back at his reflection in the mirror, and back at the ring, for several minutes.  All that remained of his old body was his face, and hair, minus his lips which were clearly his mothers, including the coat of lip gloss she usually wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached his hand out for the ring, but he was once again reminded by his slender feminine hands, and hairless skin of his arms.  He pulled his hand back to his side, and winced as he felt his mother's large breasts jiggle freely inside his shirt.  He was still wearing a resized version of his little sister's clothing, which was just a purple t shirt and jeans.  The outfit seemed to fit his new body just fine, but it was clear to him that these breasts needed a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook all of these thoughts from his head and tried to focus on what to do.  \"So why the hell did I lose control?  Why did it just start changing everything?\"  He asked himself in his mother's feminine voice, as he sat down on the bed, crossing his legs instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just said to myself, I love having mom's parts.  I said it wasn't weird, and then suddenly it all started changing.  I mean, I did love having mom's parts, but I didn't want to go this far...  I wanted to reverse it when I was done having my fun...\"  James continued to speak in his mother's voice, still trying to get used to how it sounded coming out of him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it stands right now, if I go outside, the world will see me as a freak I bet...  But I managed to make my family unaware of the swap at least, so they shouldn't notice the difference.  But if want to leave the house...  People will see my face and wonder.  I'll have to learn to use the ring better so I can fix this.  Then I can reverse the change, or... at least make sure people don't freak out when they see me, until I can figure out how to control this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided, he finally picked up the ring off the dresser and slipped it onto his slender finger, watching as it seemed to shrink to fit perfectly around.

I can't let my life be ruined because of something as stupid as this!\" James said, degeneratively. \"But can I safely go out like this?\" James' train of thought took a weird direction. 'Of course not. Especially not with hair so rough and dull.' James thought. 'Audrey's hair has smooth, silky texture I bet. I wonder what shampoo she uses?' James' hair tingled a bit, all loose ends were fixed and it became post-hair salon condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What was that!?\" James said, running his mother's hands through his hair. Granted, his mother's skin was smooth and soft, but James could feel that his hair wasn't so dingy like a normal guy's. It was as if it had been worked on in a salon or with women's shampoo. \"Did I do this? I guess I was thinking about it but... not intentionally.\" James pondered, sweating and still just as freaked out as before. 'This feels better but these clothes have got to go.' James thought again. 'Mom's clothes would be best for now.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The casual preteen clothes James was wearing instantly vanished. A black lacy bra appeared, supporting his mother's large breasts. A corresponding black thong appeared around James' hips. A plain black pair of flip flops appeared on his dainty feet. James now also donned a white tank top showing a lot of cleavage and a pair of his mom's jean shorts; a really short pair. \"Ah, much better. I look amazing now.\" James' said. \"Wait, no, this doesn't solve any of my problems.\" James was more frustrated than scared now. He clenched his fists and very lightly punched his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What's wrong with me now!\" Jame's mumbled in his mother's voice. The ring did a final change to James for the time being. 'No, there's nothing wrong with me now. I look like a normal woman. I can go outside now.' James thought. This very unexpected positive thought gave James a much needed confidence boost. \"Yes, I look normal now.\" James said, looking down and approving of the attire his mother's body had on. \"This should give me enough cover to go to Eric's house without arousing suspicion.\" James pulled the ring off again, to prevent any uneeded swaps outside, and placed it in a pocket in his mom's jean shorts. But was this confidence boost finally enough to get James out to seek help from Eric? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the last mental change, James now seemed to be perfectly fine with his new appearance.  He knew this wasn't his body, but he seemed to have swapped his mother's comfortability with her female body.  Now it seemed like no big deal to be wearing short shorts and a cleavage revealing tank top, since he knew he looked like a woman now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took one last look in the mirror, and noticed that he still had his own face, but with his mother's mouth, and his salon treated hair, he could easily pass for female, given the rest of his body.  His hair had already been medium length shaggy hair for a boy, but now that it was smooth and soft, it had been straightened out to look almost like a feminine bob style.  He found himself smiling at how nice it looked, despite the fact that he knew he should be terrified.  He cocked his wide hips to one side and flicked some short bangs out of his eyes, and gave a rather dorky smile that somehow looked cute on a woman like himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, yeah, this should work.  Just... no more putting the ring on until I know how to control it.  That thing is dangerous!\" James told himself as he patted his shorts pocket, to feel that the ring was still inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, James confidently left his room, passing by his mother on the way out.  She now had his male body from the neck down, and had his mouth and voice, but her long red hair was still as feminine as ever somehow.  Then he saw his sister down the hall, whose hair had turned shaggy and unkempt, but she seemed perfectly unaware.  He was lucky that the TSAR apparently wanted no one in the house to be aware of the changes, but he suspected that only his family was affected by the mental changes.  His friends would probably not recognize him like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, I'm gonna go out for a bit, gonna go hang out with Eric.\"  James casually told his mother, nearly forgetting what he currently looked and sounded like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she seemed unfazed, replying in his voice.  \"Alright just don't be out too late, have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his family completely unaware, James wasted no time in heading out the door and walking a few streets down his neighborhood towards Eric's house.  Once he started walking, it completely skipped his mind that he was feeling sensations he wasn't used to, like his breasts bouncing side to side in his black lace bra, and his hips swaying as he walked.  He knew that this wasn't his body, but the sensation didn't even occur to him as out of the ordinary.  He was comfortable with this feminine body as though he'd grown up with it, despite knowing the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he arrived at Eric's house and rang the doorbell.  He subconsciously adjusted his tank top and bra which had shifted during the walk, and then the door opened, answered by...</span></div></div>",

I need to talk to you.\" Eric sighed and gestured for James to come in. Luckily Eric's parents were out so the house was empty, aside from Eric and James of course. Eric went to the kitchen to get James a glass of water; who plopped his feminine behind in a chair in Eric's living room. Eric returned with a glass of water and handed it to James. \"So James, I see you still haven't listened to what I said. In fact, you seem to have gone in the opposite direction.\" Eric said, referring to James being mostly his mother. \"Eric look-\" James started to say before Eric cut him off. \"We've been friends for a long time James. Why is that now you decide to sever our friendship.\" Eric says, raising his voice. \"I mean, just look at you! You're 90% your own mother. I told you to stop and you blatantly ignored me. Is that what a friend does?!\" James was appalled that Eric wouldn't let him speak, so he whistled to get Eric to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yes Eric. I was rude and a jerk, which I know is a gross understatement, but I need you to listen.\" Eric stayed quiet as James continued talking. \"I didn't mean to end up like this, but the TSAR went out of control. If I didn't stop it, you'd think I was my mother.\"James yelled. \"James, what do you mean it 'went out of control'?\" Eric asked. James reached into his pocket to get out the ring, though this action caused his huge boobs to jiggle. Slamming it down on the coffee table, he slid it towards Eric. \"It was after you left,\" James started retelling what happened. \"I was power hungry and didn't mind having my mom's parts. Whatever way the TSAR interpreted that thought caused it to start swapping the rest of me with my mom. I pulled it off before it could finish.\" Eric was shocked, although did show a little sign of curiosity. But he decided to consul James instead. \"Couldn't you just swap yourself back to normal?\" Eric pointed out. James shook his head. \"I don't think it's that simple. When I put the ring on again, it started swapping me in a way in which I'd be comfortable being my own mother. Heck, even now I'm accepting being like this because of the ring.\" James said. Eric brought his hand to his chin and thought for a second before proposing an idea. \"It may be too dangerous to wear that ring within the same building as your mom. It seems as though it wants to swap you two fully, heck most likely permanently.\" James just had a blank face. \"But this ring only works when you're in the same building as the target. So are you suggesting I stay as I am now?\" James asked. Eric nodded. \"Would it be better to fully be your mom?! And besides, it's not too hard to deal with. You can just change anyone's awareness.\" Eric brought up a good point. The TSAR would most likely make it impossible for James to swap back with his mother. \"Look, James, I'm sorry for snapping before, but trust me as a friend, I really think that's the best course of action for you.\" Eric says in a serious tone.</span></div></div>",

But did that really solve the problem, or just cause more of one? It's not as if Heather would care she mostly has her son's body (in fact, she thought she was normal, but would other people notice something's off about her?) James' eyes opened wide at the thought. \"Eric, that solves the problem for me, but not my mom.\" James pointed out. \"How do you mean?\" Eric asked. \"Look Eric, I have the ring and can use it to change people's awareness of me. But my mom; she has nothing. She'll go outside and be called a freak!\" James yelled, while Eric was just realizing this. \"Shit, dude. You're right! But what can we do?\" Eric asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     James just shook his head, and put the ring back on. \"This ring caused this, I just wish it could do something to help my mom.\" Meanwhile, Heather was doing the dishes, finding it very easy to hold onto things with her large hands. 'Next time, I'll get James to do the dishes, wherever that boy is.' Heather thought. Suddenly, a ring appeared on her left ring finger. Heather noticed this but immediately remembered that it's a ring she always wears. Nothing out of the ordinary. Of course, it actually isn't just a normal ring. It too is called TSAR, but for thia ring that means: Trait Swapee Awareness Regulator. It creates a special field around the wearer that affects anyone that looks at them. Those who have the wearer in the field of vision see nothing wrong with them, despite whatever changes may have occurred. Heather looked at the ring closely. \"Boy, I wish this ring was blue.\" she said as she returned her attention to the dishes. When she wasn't looking the ring turned blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Back at Eric's house, James had taken his TSAR off again and put it back in his pocket. \"Eric, I do agree with what you came up with and I think it's a great idea, but I still don't know about mom. What should I do?\" James asked. Eric was at a loss of words. There wasn't much he could do in this situation. \"Well, let's take some time to think. But we should go outside and test my idea first.\" he said. James nodded and got off the chair, causing his breasts and ass to jiggle. \"Jesus christ...\" James muttered as he and Eric began to walk outside. But Eric stopped them. \"Wait, put the ring back on first!\" he said. James promptly did so, surprised that he almost forgot. Perhaps he was more comfortable with having his mom's body than he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Eric decided they'd head back to James' house to see what they could do about Heather. There wasn't too many people that they passed but James made sure that he changed the awareness of anyone that he saw. 'I wish there was an easier way to do this.' James thought. His TSAR responded to this by making another Trait Swapee Awareness Regulator appear on James' left ring finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Once they finally arrived at Jame's house, Eric took a deep breath. He looked around to see if the coast clear; luckily it was. James opened the door and led Eric inside making sure to take off the original TSAR first and putting it in his pocket. They walked towards James' room but just so happened to pass by the kitchen where Heather was still cleaning up. Eric looked so he could see James' mother with her son's body.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Eric saw Heather in the kitchen, he barely recognized her.  He definitely noticed that everything about her was wrong.  She had a male body, but was dressed from head to toe in her own daughter's clothing, resized to fit James's old body.  She was having a conversation with her husband, and no one but Eric seemed to notice that she had James's voice.  in fact, the only thing that Heather had left was her face, and long red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shook his head and hurried after James who was waiting in his room.  He found James sitting on the edge of his bed, bending over to pick up the TV remote off the floor.  In the process, Eric got a perfect view of his best friend's cleavage, as he could see right down James's tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus man, have some decency, that's your mom's body you have still.\"  Eric sighed and remained standing, while closing the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked up confused, his softer styled hair falling in his eyes, and he brushed it aside with slender fingers.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Your cleavage dude.  That tank top shows it off quite a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled with his mother's mouth, and said with a feminine voice, \"I know right?  It's a pretty cute top.  I mean...  well my mom has good taste in clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric still found it weird that James was taking this transformation so well, as though he was completely unfazed by being physically female.  He decided to drop it for now, and figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever... listen, I'm still a bit weirded out by this whole thing.  Somehow you managed to make it here without a single person in the neighborhood batting an eye.  Your family seems oblivious, and everyone we walked by as well, except me.  Why is it that nobody seems to...\"  Eric stopped mid rant, as he noticed something shiny and black around one of James's fingers.  \"What the... I thought I told you to take off the ring when we got here?  You don't want to accidentally change anything do you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was once again lost, \"What...?  I did take it off I swear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames checked his right hand where he usually wore the TSAR, and sure enough it wasn't there, but when he saw his left hand, there appeared to be a ring.  However it looked slightly different.  \"Eric... I don't think this is the same ring.  Here look, the TSAR is still in my pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into his shorts pocket and pulled out the original TSAR, showing Eric that he wasn't kidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what the fuck is that then?  Is it one of your mom's rings?  It looks ... really similar to the TSAR.  You should probably take that one off too, let me see it.\"  Eric suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was starting to freak out a bit now, and nodded in agreement.  He didn't remember this ring being there when he swapped with his mother's clothing earlier.  He slipped off the second ring, and took a good look at it.  It was polished black metal, similar to the TSAR, with no symbols or writing on it.  It just looked inconspicuous.  And yet it gave him an eerie feeling.  He handed it over to Eric.</span></div></div>",

Which just so happens to land in James' cleavage. \"God dammit, Eric.\" James says, reaching a slender hand into his cleavage to retrieve the ring. His breasts sway and jiggle as he fishes for the ring. \"I'm sorry James, but that ring hurt me.\" Eric replies, blushing and turning his head to avoid the \"show\" in front of him. \"Hurt you? What do you mean?\" James asked, smiling that he finally managed to pull the ring out from between his breasts. \"It sorta felt like I got poked by a pin.\" Eric examines his hand. \"Doesn't look like it left an injury though.\" James puts the ring back on his left hand and adjusts his bra and tank top again. \"That's good to hear, Eric. But this just can't be a coincidence.\" James says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Eric looked puzzled and gestured for James to keep going. \"Look Eric, remember back when I first tried the TSAR on you. It didn't work.... Tell me, what were you thinking at the time?\" Eric scratched his head while trying to remember. \"Well, I didn't even believe that it would work. And now that I brought that up, I still can't believe what has happened today.' he says with a smirk. \"That must be it!\" James interjects. \"I believed that the ring would work and so far it has for me. So Eric, pardon me as I am about to sound like a Disney film, but you just gotta believe in the ring and it will work on you.\" Eric just shakes his head, dismissing James' advice. \"No James. I don't think I ever want to do that.\" Eric says with a sigh. James looks confused. \"James, just listen to me,\" Eric continues. \"after seeing what that ring has done so far to you physically and to my fragile psyche, I don't ever want to use that ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       James stares but could see that Eric has a point. Suddenly, Eric's tone gets very serious. \" And James, if you ever find a way promise me that you will never use the ring on me. I mean it.\" James nods his head and smiles. Eric smiles as well and prepares a fist bump. \"Well Eric, you got a deal.\" James says. There is a silence between them before Eric turns towards the door. \"I best be heading home before my parents do.\" Eric says. \"You, uh, you have a good day James.\"  \"Oh, I will.\" James says, grabbing his breasts. \"I definitely will.\" Eric smiles and shakes his head, then leaves. This left James alone. Alone, of course, with a sexy body with plenty of new sensations that he has yet to discover.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that things were somewhat patched up with Eric, and Eric was finally gone, James wondered what he would do next.  He inspected the new ring on his left hand, and wondered what exactly it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well so far I haven't been changing while wearing it, and there aren't any voices telling me what this one does...  Maybe it's just another TSAR?</i>  James thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to focus on using the new ring, if possible.  He made sure the original TSAR was safely placed on his desk before focusing on his mother in the other room, and seeing if he could switch hair colors with her.  Nothing seemed to happen, so it didn't seem like it had the powers of the TSAR.  But he knew there was something else about it...  He could tell it had some power that was emanating from it, but there was no way of knowing its true ability just yet.  He  had no idea that its job was to automatically adjust the perception of people around him, so that no  matter what changes he made to himself, people would not find it unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, James forgot about the new ring, and found his hands wandering towards his chest.  The sensation of his large breasts confined inside a lacy black bra behind a white tank top, didn't feel alien to him.  But it certainly felt good.  He let out a quiet feminine moan as he squashed his breasts together, reaching around to pull his tank top over his head.  Without even trying, he easily unclasped his bra, and let his breasts be free to the world, or at least his bedroom.  He never really asked his mother what cup size she wore, but when he looked at the label inside the black bra, he realized it was a DD cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he thought about how beautiful his body looked naked, happy that it was his body and that he felt so comfortable this way.  The one thing that bothered him however, was that his body was now 40 years old.  It was a thought that kept hanging in the back of his mind, and something that he'd likely inherited from his mother's confidence in her body.  Despite being in great shape, she still feared getting old, and dreaded her body losing its youth.  Now James began to feel that way as well.  <i>I mean, these girls look full and sexy now, but in a few years, who knows how much they'll be sagging.</i>  He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnhh,\" another slight moan escaped his lip glossed mouth as James's finger found its way to his nipple.  He sat down at his computer, and began to gently cup his breast in one hand, occasionally tickling a nipple as he quickly began browsing for porn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... where is it... I know just the video for this!\"  He whispered in a breathy aroused voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to feel a tingling sensation between his legs, as he browsed through videos, and tweaked his nipple in the other hand.  His mother's vagina, which was now his own, was beginning to get wetter by the second, as he imagined what it would be like to have a girl licking his nipple and kissing him all over his sensitive body.  His thoughts wandered to his girlfriend Lauren for a moment, and wondered what she would think of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there it is!\"  James said quietly, as he opened a video of two naked girls embracing each other and making out on a bed.  One was a beautiful brunette with short hair, which he could identify with now.  And the other was a shorter Asian girl who he pretended might be his girlfriend Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls began to moan and scream as they pleasured themselves on video, and James found himself imitating them.  His shorts were already around his ankles, and he had one hand down his lace panties, inching his fingers towards his vagina.  Before long, he began fingering himself, while teasing his breasts with the other hand.  The pace quickened with the video, as the girls on screen finally came to climax together.  It was one of his favorite videos to watch, but it became even more arousing now that he could identify with one of the girls on screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James finally approached his first female orgasm...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   James was really deep in pleasure. His fingers moving in and out of his vagina sent such hot feelings throughout his mom's body. His body shook with every thrust. James also continued to work on his breasts; sucking his nipples and moving his tongue over them. The porn video ended but James had yet to climax. It wasn't until his womanly fingers hit a certain spot in his vagina that really hit him with pleasure. \"Oh god, that's mom's, uh I mean my g-spot.\" James managed to say between his heavy breathes. That was what finished him off. He ended up cumming ferociously, getting his panties absolutely drenched (if they weren't enough already). James sighed. \"I could get used to this.\" he said to himself, chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Amongst  the afterglow of his first female orgasm, a tiny bit of rationality popped up in Jame's head. 'Hey, wait a minute. We learned about hormones in anatomy class last week. What will happen to me with the huge increase of estrogen from mom's, uh my body.' James thought. This somewhat startling conclusion led to James getting up from the chair. He was only dressed in his very wet panties and black flip flops; having removed most of his clothing during masturbation. He walked to his bedroom mirror to check his reflection. He was quiet and moved slowly; the only noise that could be heard was his flip flops slapping his soles. He didn't know what to expect when he got to the mirror, but he wasn't any less scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    He got to the mirror and put his face close to it. He couldn't see anything different about him (besides the obvious), but he checked his whole body just to be sured. His breasts, unsupported by a bra, jiggled freely as James turned his body around in front of the mirror. There was no new physical changes that he could see, so he breathed a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    James felt the sweat covering his body and decided he should go take a shower. He hid the TSAR and the awareness regulator in his drawers and then headed to the bathroom. As he walked, he still couldn't shake the feeling of dread he has, wondering what his new body's hormones will do to him.</span></div></div>",

His mothers' body (and mouth) are 40 years old, but the rest of his head is still 18, including his brain. It's due to this combination that all of the age inducing hormones become messed up and prevent any part of him from aging any further. James would now be a sexy milf for the rest of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     James got to the bathroom and undressed; getting ready to shower. But his attention was drawn to the mirror. There was different since he checked a minute ago. \"Holy shit.\" James said, making poses in the mirror. \"It's kinda hot that I have the body and mouth that gave birth to me. I guess in a way, I am now my own mother, from a biological standpoint.\" James was starting to get wet but quickly got into the shower before he got too horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 <br>\r\n   The water cascaded down the curves of James' mature body.

In and out, James felt such rush of pleasure. With his free hand, he brought his right nipple to his plump lips and began sucking. With this added stimulation, James  moved his fingers even faster bringing him to climax, as his knees buckled and he curled his dainty toes. Panting heavily, James just remained silent and finished his shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Once in done, he immediately went to bed naked. \"If tomorrow's a nice day, I should go to the beach.

He stood up and stretched, scratching an itch under his breast, and looking out the window.  There was something he forgot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right!  Today is the weekend I totally almost forgot!\"  He exclaimed, still with his mother's voice.  \"And it looks like it's going to be perfect beach weather, I'd better call Eric and Lauren before they make plans.  Maybe Kim can come too and we can get the whole gang together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames quickly put on a bra and panties, not even thinking about the fact that this was not normally part of his morning routine.  He stepped into a pair of shorts and a revealing tank top, and seemed pleased with himself.  He saw nothing out of the ordinary here, just a cute outfit to wear to the beach.  Finally he made sure to grab his black two piece bikini and put it in his purse to get changed when they finally got down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lauren,\"  James called up his girlfriend.  He absent mindedly rubbed the awareness regulator ring around his finger, still not even sure what it was for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren responded cheerfully at the sound of James's new feminine voice, \"Oh hey James!  You got plans for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames found himself giggling a bit, \"Sure do, and they involve you.  Let's get the gang together and head to the beach, it's the perfect day for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know...\"  She sounded unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wear that black bikini again, but only if you wear yours.\"  James teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear Lauren's cute laugh over the phone, \"Do I have to...  Alright fine, but you better be wearing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, James and Lauren met up at the beach, expecting Eric and Kim to join them soon.  James wore nothing but the awareness regulator ring, and the black bikini underneath his clothes.  When Lauren arrived, he noticed she was wearing a knee length skirt, and a t shirt.  She was wearing her own bikini underneath that outfit, but swore she wouldn't be seen in public in a bikini unless James did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems going to sleep with the awareness regulator ring on, James was having trouble remembering what was different, and what had changed yesterday.  His current body seemed completely normal, and of course with this ring, everyone around him saw it as normal as well.  He was just a 18 year old boy with the body of a sexy 40 year old woman, as well as her outfits and mannerisms.  No one thought it out of the ordinary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eric arrived, is there something off about him?  It's possible getting zapped by the second ring had some affect.

Eric seemed to be in higher spirits than the day before, but he still had a slight look of disgust when he saw James' current body. He was surprised James was so comfortable in public already. \"You guys are always late.\" Lauren joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The four walked to the beach, picking a spot close to the water to minimize the walking distance. \"So Lauren, did you wear that sexy bikini of yours?\" Kim whispered in Lauren's ear. Lauren blushed a bit then answered. \"Yes, but only because James over here wore his.\" This caused a bit of excitement to whell up in Kim. \"Oh goody! You two look absolutely perfect together when you wear them.\" she said out loud. Eric just groaned. \"Please stop talking about stupid bikinis. It's annoying.\" he berated the two girls. Lauren just laughed. \"What's the matter Eric? Don't like hearing girls talk about girl things?\" she giddily asked him. \"That's not the reason why.\" Eric muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The girls and James went to their respective changing rooms, leaving Eric alone at their spot. He was wearing his trunks already, so he just had to pull off his shirt. \"Boy, this'll be a long day.\" he said to himself with a chuckle. He waited for about a minute when he heard a female voice to the left of him. \"Hey there.\" Eric turned his head and saw a slender but curvacious latina girl standing there, wearing a thin blue bikini. \"I see you here alone and thought you'd like some company.\" she continued. \"Uh, actually...\" Eric was starting to say. <br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n    At the same time, James was coming out of the men's changing room, donning a tiny black bikini and flip flops on his milfy frame. \"Wow, no strange looks from the men in there. How unexpected.\" he said stretching his arms up causing his chest to push forward a bit. \"Doesn't look like Kim and Lauren are done yet.\" James said, checking the entrance to the women's changing room. \"Better head back to...Eric!\" James turned his head and saw Eric at their spot with an unknown girl standing next to him, clearing striking up conversation. \"Is he cheating on Kim?!\" James was starting to get a little worried. He pulled out the TSAR from his purse. \"I'll have to fix that.\" he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n      Eric started explaining to the girl he was already in a relationship when he noticed that she started changing. Her legs grew longer and lighter in skin color, becoming increasingly hairier as well. 'The hell?!' Eric asked in his mind. Almost as quickly as the change started, it was over. The latina girl's tan upper half remained normal, but connected to her waist was a pale male pair of legs. They were hairy and overly muscular. But the girl's lower swim attire did not change so Eric could see the huge bulge outlined in the girl's bikini panties. \"Suit yourself.\" she said in a snobby tone of voice. She turned and walked away, allowing Eric to see her bikini causing a wedgie in her white ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Was she up to your standards?\" Eric heard the familiar motherly voice say behind him. \"James?\" Eric asked, turning around. \"What'd you do that to her for?\" James held up the TSAR in front of Eric before placing it back in his purse. \"Making sure you don't do any cheating, Eric.\" he said. \"She didn't do anything wrong James. Fix her now.\" Eric yelled, getting up from a sitting position. James completely disregarded Eric's order. \"You know Eric, seeing her change was pretty funny. Maybe we should mess with more people.\" James suggested. This was the point Eric feared; when James would gain a sick sense of humor from abusing the TSAR on innocent people. This was something he wouldn't stand for.</span></div></div>",

Her flat, hairy butt wiggled as she walked with on foot mostly in front of the other in a feminine manner.  The straps of her bra top clung tight to her now broad shoulders.  The boys couldn't see the front of her bra top which hung uselessly in front since she didn't have any boobs anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that,\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's funny,\" James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut from around them they heard the sound of a punch followed by the sound of someone falling to the sand.  \"Fuckin faggots,\" a woman screamed.

He didn't expect this hot babe to take such offense or to hit him square on his jaw.  The woman punched him like a man, a straight right that put him down.  But it didn't hurt him too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames recognized the 'woman'.  It was the guy who James had swapped bodies with with the girl who had talked to Eric. James was so caught up with the scene with Eric that he didn't consider what would happen to the guy.  What happened should have been expected.  A man seeing a pretty woman who was topless on the beach made a rude comment and the man (who now looked like a woman) clocked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople started to gather.  Security was called, and both the 'new woman' and the man she hit were taken away by beach security.  Eric recognized the face of the 'woman' and surmised what had happened.  \"Now look what you did!\" Eric warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the girls had returned.  \"What happened?\" Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think some girl punched a guy who was hitting on her,\" James said.  Which was both true and not true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he rip off her top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They why was she naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Let's find someplace else on the beach,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\" the girls replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric didn't know what to say.  This was getting out of hand.  Especially when in about three or four minutes another scream was heard.  It was the friend of the 'former girl\" that talked to Eric.  The former girl rejoined her friend and the friend not knowing who this perverted man was who was wearing a bikini screamed at her/him.  Eric glared at James.  \"You have to stop this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop what?\" Kim inquired not knowing what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Eric's command, James said.  \"Let's go,\" and led the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen things had calmed down and there was sufficient distance from the commotion.  Eric whispered to James, \"See what you have done.  This can't go on.  You have to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I thought it was funny.  I think I should do more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment when Eric thought he had to get the ring away from James.  But how should he do it?</span></div></div>",

She was headed towards the ocean.  She passed a hot girl who was in her upper teens.  James couldn't see her face as she was lying down trying to get a tan on her back.  James swapped the two's fashion sense.  The old woman was wearing the girl's bikini as she reached the water.  The suit resized itself so it covered everything on the older woman, but few wanted to see the woman in a bikini although no one said anything.  The young sunbathing woman didn't notice any changes although she wouldn't get as much of a tan as she had expected.  Of course, this didn't apply just to the beachwear, but to their entire wardrobe.  The two won't see anything wrong with what they are wearing.  You wondered how long (or even if) their families and friends can convince them wear clothing more age appropriate for them.  Eric was so busy telling James what to do that he didn't notice this change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not listening to me.  These people have lives.  They aren't your play things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't?\" James said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric realizing he wasn't getting through to James tackled him and tried to pull the TSAR off, but the TSAR wouldn't let itself be removed in anyway.  Only James could take it off when he wanted to.  Since James had mostly his mother's body Eric could dominate the 'fight' despite not being able to get the ring off James' finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

James' muscles filled with energy although his body didn't bulk up.  He continued to look like the same MILF with James' head that he was before.  But the gain in strength yielded immediate results.

Once inside Eric tried to explain to James again what was so wrong with what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wasn't paying much attention.  He was standing in front of a urinal, but realized that wasn't going to work.  So he turned towards the stall.  Looking at the disgustring state of the seats on the stalls, James recoiled.  He didn't want to sit down on the seat.  But he had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves you right,\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames gave him a glare.  Then a man came in.  James got an idea and before Eric knew it, James had a cock in his bikini bottoms.  The man who was standing in front of the urinals realized his problem and then turned towards the stalls.  he closed the door and then used toilet tissue to clean the seat.  The man didn't like having to sit down on the seat to pee anymore than James.  But the man didn't know he was supposed to have a penis anymore so he resigned himself to doing what he must.  James pushed his bikini bottoms down under the head of his penis and peed standing up as he always had.  It didn't take that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames went over to the sink and started to wash his hands.  \"So you are going  to keep your mom's body but have that guy's cock?\" Eric whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God no.\"  When the man came out of the stall, James switched their genitiles back.  Looking down at his bikini he saw it didn't have any bulges anymore.  \"See everything is back to normal,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the new normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She is now taller, stronger and full of more energy just as her son had been.  She had his body.  She didn't like doing the house work..  It was just something she had to do and she liked a clean house.  But today she did it with the extra energy that came from having a teen body.  She also didn't have any of her usual back pains nor the slight discomfort that came from wearing a bra.  With all of these advantages she finished her housework in record time...not that she was timing herself.  She could have done other chores, but they could wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang at some point, it was James saying he would be home late.  She hoped he would have a good time and to drive safe and then bid him goodbye.  Nick was on the couch.  he asked who it was.  Instead of telling him right off, Heather came up close to Nick's ear and whispered, \"Jason will be home late.  We have the house to ourselves.\"  Then she started licking his ear in a way she knew he liked.  Her tongue was different as she had James' mouth but Nick didn't notice or mind.  Soon she was wrapping her arms around him, her penis was semi-erect and full of the vigor of youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick knew his wife well although at this point, a stranger would have known what she wanted.  It didn't matter that she wasn't dressed sexily.  She was wearing James' jeans and a t-shirt, but Nick didn't care.  Nick lifted her into his arms.  She was heavier than she was when she had her own body, but Nick could manage.  \"Nick, can I be on top this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you do what I like?\"  Meaning starting with oral sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, don't I always?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo words needed to be spoken, Nick just smiled.  Nick had his cock sucked and his butt pounded.  All this seemed no just perfectly fine, but very pleasurable to Nick.  After they were done, Nick helped Heather fix dinner.  She didn't need his help of course, but she enjoyed the closeness.  Despite all the physical changes that had come to Heather (and James), Nick and Heather were still very much in love and could make each other happy emotionally and physically.</span></div></div>",

The boys blazed the trail and the girls were a step behind as they headed towards the parking lot.  Eric reminds James that he shouldn't use the ring anymore.  That it is dangerous and destructive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I have been thinking about what you said.  I think you are right.  I won't use it anymore,\" James told Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, then you should take it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naaa, I like the way it looks.  But I won't use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way towards the exits, people were passing our foursome heading towards the ocean.  This was the late afternoon crowd who wanted to miss the morning rush and the afternoon heat.  People came alone, in couples and small groups.  A guy and his girlfriend passed James.  At least he thought she was his girlfriend, he supposed they could be siblings or just friends.  James could only hear snippets of their conversation.  But he clearly heard the boy call the girl by her name, Jennifer.  James without a thought swapped the name of the couple.  Jennifer Lynn's new name was Kevin Gary and Kevin took on Jennifer's name.  Since they were a couple neither noticed any change and continued chatting without interruption.  But then they were with othert people know knew them there might be some trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had decided to continue to use the ring.  But now he was going to do so without letting Eric notice, but making small changes.  Speaking of small changes, a man and his six or seven year old son were heading towards the ocean.  The boy was on his father's shoulders.  James swapped their penis.  There might be a bigger bulge in the boys trunks, but who would notice while he had them on.  The boys mother might probably would be the first to notice when she saw her husband (or son) naked.  Probably no one in the locker room would notice if they changed here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore reaching the concrete path that lead to the parking lot, James spotted another couple.   This time he thought they were brother and sister just by the way they were acting.  The boy was about fourteen and his sister was nearing seventeen.  James waited until they had passed him and Eric before swapping all their mannerisms.  The boy now walked with a definite swish in his step and the girl walked a little more boyishly.  But Eric didn't notice since he was ahead of them and there was no reason to look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this final swap James reiterated to Eric.  \"Yeah, I'm not going to make any swaps anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled at James.  \"I'm glad you are seeing it my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     'These swaps are pretty good.' James thought to himself. 'But maybe I can do better.' Eric up to that point had not noticed any of the changes James had made to people. They were very subtle and he truly trusted James to listen to him. But James just couldn't resist doing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The four passed by a parking lot, a perfect hunting ground for James. He scoured the rows of cars and saw a very susceptible target. A man, either drunk or just tired, was sleeping in his car. He was shirtless, allowing James a view of his upper torso. 'So there's one, now just one more.' James thought. He managed to find another good target. A young mother was helping her 5 year old daughter into her carseat nearby. James smiled and swapped the nipples of the sleeping man with those of the 5 year old girl. The man's nipples shrunk, appearing a bit more bare too. They looked out of place on his slightly apparent manboobs. The girl didn't notice, obviously, and neither would her mother until she was at home or even after her daughter has gone through puberty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      James' swapping urge still wasn't sated, so he looked for more victims. The parking lots were mostly empty, save for just a family of a father, mother and two sons, one the age of 11, the other age 7, getting out of their car to go shopping. \"Ah, perfect.\" James said softly. \"What's perfect?\" Kim asked James, walking up to him. James quickly had to think of something to say. \"The weather today. It was just perfect for the beach. We may not get another day like this in a while.\" he said with a smile. Eric heard James this time. \"Boy, ain't that the truth.\" Eric said with a chuckle from further ahead. A bead of sweat trickled down James' face. Now with suspicions gone, he looked towards the family again. He didn't have enough time to make as many changes as he wanted, but he wasn't going to leave without changing something. He concentrated a bit and swapped both of the son's dicks and then swapped the hair of the father and the 7 year old son. Both of their hair was short so nobody would notice the change right away. But to help with preventing people from noticing easily, James kept them with their original hair colors. 'I think that's enough changes...for now.\" James wickedly thought with a smile.</span></div></div>",

The man is wearing jeans and a t-shirt and so is the woman.  Coincidentally James' booth over looks theirs.  James sits on the inside of the booth with Lauren to his right.  Eric is opposite James with Kim to his left.  James can see the back of the man';s head and the woman sitting across from him.  James swaps the couple's clothing preferences.  No one notices any different.  The man is still wearing jeans and at-shirt so is the woman.  The woman's B-cup boobs, droop a little but not too badly.  The man is now wearing her bra, but the cups deflate since they have nothing to hold and are unnoticeable.  Who can tell that the man is wearing panties and the woman is wearing briefs.  The woman is now wearing sneakers which seems perfectly normal.  The only thing that is out of place is the ballet flats on the man's feet.  Of course, as the man goes through the rest of his wardrobe his crossdressing probably will become more apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the restaurant for more victims.  You spot a married couple with their two teenaged children.  You swap the power structure in their household.  There isn't any immediate changes now, but when the teens want to stay out late or have other ideas, their might be a problem.  Although what trouble the kids get into without adult supervision is no ones guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt another table, a woman starts coloring with crayons on her placemat.  It was a little strange, but not a very big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered swapping the waitress with a woman sitting alone.  But decided against it.  Although Eric wouldn't notice the rest of the wait staff and kitchen staff would and there was too many to control.  It wasn't worth the risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you decided to swap Kim's pussy (Eric's girlfriend) with another girls who happened to be walking by.  You wondered if Eric knew Kim well enough to be able to tell the difference.  You doubted it. Eric would probably say something if he noticed.  Maybe he wouldn't.  A broad grin at the thought appeared on your face.  Eric didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James?\" Kim asked seeing the smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, why don't you wear lipstick?  You have such pretty lips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lipstick???? Should I wear blush and eyeliner too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was perplexed, why would Kim think it would be a good idea for him to wear lipstick?  \"What do you think, Lauren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a little lipstick would be very pretty on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only lipstick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you have worn lipstick before.  I saw it.  I don't know why you aren't wearing it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for James to realize, he had his Mom's mouth (and lips) they is why it seemed so natural to the girls he would wear lipstick.

James gave out a hardy chuckle, which sounded funny with his mother's voice. \"Ok sure.\" he agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Lauren and Kim both gave a gleefull yay, and Lauren proceeded to pull out a tube of lipstick from her purse. \"Here James, this color is a little basic, but it'll look great on you.\" she said as she opened it. Eric gave a laugh at this. He'd known Jam es for so long that he knew how much of a distaste James had for  makeup of any kind. He was genuinely interested to see how James will react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Alright babe, pucker up!\" Lauren said in a jokingly sensual voice. She proceeded to rub tube along James mature lips, giving him a good coating that could be considered good by Hollywood makeup standards. Lauren finished rather quickly, leaving James a slightly bit nervous about the whole thing. \"How do I look?\" James asked, finding it weird that he could taste the lipstick on his lips a bit. \"Here, see for yourself.\" Kim said, handing him a pocket mirror. James opened it up and was astounded. His lips actually looked fantastic to him. He pouted and smiled to see how his lips looked in different expressions. This made James even happier he ended up the way he is. At this point, he genuinely wanted to keep his mothers' body and mouth forever, even if there was a way to make him normal again. 'Nice, very nice.' James thought. 'But I'm gonna need to do something if I'm going to be wearing lipstick now.' James thought of Lauren and swapped her knowledge of lipstick with his. He now knew the best colors to choose, how to apply it, and the better brands to buy. Lauren now only knew what lipstick was and that people like to wear it. But she still kept her original knowledge of other makeup items like eyeliner and nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Ooo, I absolutely love that color on you!\" Kim complimented. \"Well, thanks Kim.\" James said, eagerly accepting the compliment. \"What about you Eric. What do you think?\" James' question really hit Eric out of nowhere. He was completely surprised James actually went through with allowing Lauren to put lipstick on him. \"Well, I'm a guy, so I don't really know. I guess it looks okay....\" he uneasily said. This answer was good enough for James, so he went back to talking about other topics with the two girls. 'He just keeps getting more and more different. Is he actually okay with all this.' Eric thought. He didn't know that James had swapped with Lauren. As far as he was concerned, James got the mentality of caring about lipstick from his mothers body parts and wardrobe. He was still completely of James' recent swapping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after their little conversation, the four order and then receive their food. But as James eats...</span></div></div>",

He could recognize how different shades of lipstick were used to give the woman a different effect.  On one woman he saw that she was wearing a a lipstick that looked good on her but was better suited for late evening in a club, not early evening at a dinner.  He also realized that not only did he know about lipstick, but he knew about lip gloss and lip liner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makeup knowledge gave James an idea.  James swapped the makeup knowledge of a woman and the man she was sitting with.  James didn't swap their desire to wear makeup just their knowledge.  The man now had all this 'useless' knowledge about selecting and applying makeup and his companion didn't know very much about it.  She could learn it again James supposed.  She would have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas there any other knowledge that James could swap between men and women?  James didn't want to swap clothing knowledge that was too easy.  He wanted to give the woman some knowledge a man would have that a woman normally wouldn't.  Sports was his first thought, but again, some women knew sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe James decided to swap a boys knowledge and desire to play with action figures with his mom's knowledge and desires to watch daytime soap operas.  It was a small thing, as opposed to the swaps he had already done, maybe the mom and the boy could get along without too much trouble after the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, James, did you hear what I was saying,\" Lauren asked.  James was busy thinking about his swaps had become distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was saying we should go rollerskating after dinner.  What do you think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kim and I are going to the ladysroom.  You decide by the time we get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls left the table.  Eric inquired, \"Dude have you been swapping people again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look around.  Do you see anything out of the ordinary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Eric did as James suggested. He subtly looked at all the different people sitting down and even the employees of the establishment. Surprisingly, none of them looked out of the ordinary, at least in his opinion. \"Nothing looks different; then again knowing you and the swaps you make, there'd be screaming if you used that damn ring.\" Eric said with a chuckle. James nodded. \"Yeah, see. Now just chillax. I'm done using this ring on myself and other people. Stop worrying.\" James told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     James' words put Eric at ease. His friend had controlled his 'urges' and is no longer anything to worry about. He had to quickly change the subject, lest James start worryong about him. \"So about what Lauren said, you wanna actually go rollerskating?\" Eric asked. \"I mean, is it even good to do since your mom's body is like 40.\" James quickly waggled a finger in front of Eric's face. \"MY body is only 29 at most.\" James said, jokingly sounding like a woman in a midlife crisis. Eric burst out laughing but soon stopped. Not only because people could hear him, but also due to the fact James called his mother's body his own. Eric may have come to accept James as he is now, but he was still uncomfortable about the whole thing. \"Honestly, though you have a point. My breasts are too big. I'll probably end up falling over from being topheavy.\" James explained. Eric wanted to ask something but James quickly cut him off. \"And no, I'll not swap my breasts with someone else's. I like my body and am not giving up a single part of it. This is my body permanently now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Eric was getting a little freaked out from James' obsession with his, er his mother's, body (and mouth). He changed the subject yet again. \"If you won't go rollerakating, then what will you do?\" Eric asked eliciting a moment of silence from James. After a bit of pondering, James got a few ideas. \"I'll probably just go home. My parents will probably get worried if I'm gone any longer.\" he stated. Eric nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kim and Lauren finally got out of the restroom and walked back to the booth. Before Lauren could even inquire, James told her that he couldn't go rollerskating. She was a little bummed out at first, but got another idea in her head. Lauren leaned over and whispered in James' ear. \"How about you come over to my place tonight then?\" she sensually whispered. Upon hearing this, James got really flustered. Being with his hot girlfriend in bed with his new body excited the hell out of him. \"Don't give me your answer now though.\" she continued, before going back to an upright sitting position. \"Alright, guys. Can we finally eat?!\" Kim groaned. The other three laughed and the all dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on....</span></div></div>",

They had had a lot of fun in their bedroom, but Nick had shot his load and couldn't recover as fast as Heather did with her new teenaged body.  Ever the gentleman, Nick relieved his wife's tensions with his hand.  He could have done it with his mouth, but he didn't like that too much even when Heather had a pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Heather screamed.

With his new forty year old body, he couldn't be at the beach all day and rollerskate all night.  As long as he had a middle aged body, those days were over.  He didn't expect to find his parents having sex when he came home.  Of course, he would have thought that same thing even without the TSAR's changes.

But this was an idle thought as he didn't want to fool around with changing the body he had now at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm going to my room.

He soon came upon a pretty big house he had visited a couple times before when he picked up Audrey. He gave a knock on the door, only to be greeted by Audrey. She immediately had a look of disgust on her face. \"Why'd they send you?\" she angrily asked. James didn't know what to immediately say. \"They were...busy. Very busy.\" he said, with a fauxe grimace. \"Ooh, is that James?\" a voice further in the house asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     James winced a bit. Riley had a crush on him and wasn't afraid to show it. She always acted super nice to him, even in situations where that wasn't called for. He quickly wanted to avoid Riley, so he swapped the levels of niceness between Riley and Audrey. Now Riley will act like a bitch to him, despite having a crush on him, and Audrey will acting in an excessively caring way to him. \"Well, James, how about you stop wasting space on my property.\" Riley said as she walked towards the door. \"Riley be nice.\" Audrey berated her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     James was about ready to leave when he saw Riley's father pull into the driveway. \"Oh, honey you're home.\" Riley's mom said, exiting through a side door to greet her husband. James looked at the two and swapped their eye colors in their right eyes. The mother now had a blue left eye and a hazel right eye; the father had the reverse. \"Still not enough.\" James whispered. He snapped his fingers and swapped their ass fat. The mother's ass shrank, but due to retaining a feminine shape still, it actually looked nicer. The father's ass merely grew in size, looking like the butt of an obese man. 'There.' James thought. \"Bye Audrey!\" Riley cheerfully said as Audrey walked down to the sidewalk. \"James, let's go home now.\" Audrey said to James with a smile. James merely chuckled. 'That's probably the strangest swap I've ever made.' he thought, as he followed his gleeful sister home.</span></div></div>",

Margret had the majority f the drawer and closet space but Jerry had his drawers too.  James ignored the stuff in Jerry's drawers and only looked through Margret's drawers.  Most of it was ordinary stuff.  There were several drawers full of tops, such as t-shirts, blouses and other tops.  There was a drawer full of bottoms.  It contained mostly pants and shorts but there was also some skirts in this drawer.  Since it was summer, the shorts were in the top drawers.  James wondered if she reversed that when the weather got colder. This was the majority of drawers.  There was two drawers full of lingerie.  They contained mostly bras and panties, although there was also some shapeware and things like scarves in these drawers too.  Looking through this drawer James found a babydoll/panty set.  James smiled at the sexy underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, James checked the closets.  Some of Jerry's stuff was there, but it was mostly Margret's apparel.  There were dresses in there, but there was also some tops, skirts and pants in there too.  Why these pants ended up hung up instead of in the drawers James didn't know.  This is where Margret also kept most of her shoes.  Looking through the shoes he found a pair of high heeled slippers.  These shoes were definitely not for going out or even walking around the house.

When Riley left with Jerry's friends, she was wearing a yellow golf shirt with tan Bermuda Shorts, golf shoes and white socks.  On her head was a baseball cap.  Jerry was wearing a black t-shirt with a slight scooped neck and a picture of a slice of pepperoni pizza on it.  He wore black jeans with a silver chain attached to one of the belt loops.  The chain hung loosely and then ends in a set of keys which are in his pocket.  He is also wearing black sneakers and no socks.  Jerry wore small earrings in his ears and a gold colored necklace with cheap glass stones of different colors.  Riley has a sort of goth/emo look.  She wasn't sure if she was goth or emo but didn't worry about it too much.  This was Jerry's look now.

Most people assumed they had simply assumed that they were a father and daughter, not two best friends.  Although the t-shirt and black jeans didn't look too bad on Jerry, Riley's earrings and her sneakers did cause a few to give him a second look..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince, Jerry had his daughter's social life he didn't question that all his friends were about thirteen and almost all of them were girls.  They were simply his friends and he tried to fit in with them.  But it wasn't just his friends that had change it was his entire social life.  He had all of Riley's friends on social media and somehow Margret wasn't his wife anymore, she was his mother.  Also for Jerry to have Riley's social life he has to 'like boys.'  This was an unintended consequence of the swap, but it was true nevertheless.  It was also one of the few things that Jerry had in common with Audrey...that and common friends and fashion choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the movie was over the pair walked into the mall and decided to go clothes shopping.  Jerry could get anything he wanted since he still had his own credit cards.  But Audrey was limited to the money she had in her pocket.

They had a good time pointing out this and that boy to each other.  They even for the cutest ones tried to attack them with flirty looks.  Audrey didn't have any luck, since any boy who was interested would see her with an adult man and that would scare him off.  Jerry on the other hand could attract any boy who would be attracted to Riley, but he was also as shy when it came to boys as Riley.

I didn't do anything else, I promise.\" His friend's explanation was acceptable, but he was morbidly curious about something. \"Even if you didn't swap anything else, did you actually 'do' anything, if you know what I mean.\" Eric asked, making air quotes out of habit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       James knew exactly what Eric meant. \"No I didn't 'do' anything.

Interesting how that stupid ring of yours just keeps getting weirder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It took a moment for the realization to hit Eric. \"Wait a minute, this means you can make nonphysical swaps to people! Did you know about that?\" Eric started to interrogate again. James was in a corner now. Thinking back, maybe calling Eric wasn't the best thing to do. \"Yes I knew that. But if you're trying to imply that I used that to swap people's names and stuff, you are wrong! The only time I used it was yesterday, which I already explained.\" James genuinely sounded like an innocent person trying to defend themself. \"Well, James, I can't trust you entirely but as your friend, I'll take your word for it.\" Eric said. James breathed a sigh of relief, but away from the so Eric couldn't hear. Eric didn't stop talking though. \"But just in case James, let me have the TSAR, at least for a day. It'll be good for you. Please.\" Eric pleaded with James. </span></div></div>",

Besides, I deserve to laugh considering the crap you've been putting me through lately with that ring.\" The two hang up their phones waiting for when the exchange to happen. James checks to make sure that he has the TSAR with him and is about to leave when he hatches an idea to get a little revenge on Eric for his insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Twenty minutes later, Eric hears a knock on the front door, knowing exactly who it is. \"Wow, I'm surprised you actually-\" Eric says as he opens the door but stops when he sees James. Eric's eye go wide at the sight of James dressed in a tight pink tube top with his breasts spilling out the top, a pair of white bike shorts that were extremely short,managing to show a bit of ass, and a pair of clear stiletto heels making James tower over Eric. \"I brought the ring, big guy.\"James said in a quiet tone of voice and giving a wink. \"Here it is.\" James said bending forward to put Eric at eye level with his cleavage. James gave the TSAR to Eric, who at this point had his jaw hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       James walked past Eric and sat down on a nearby chair, crossing his legs in a way that exposes his crotch area. \"I hope you don't mind me sitting for a minute. The walk over was killer on my feet.\" he said making his mother's voice sound sensual. Eric still with mouth agape, turned and saw how James was sitting before he violently covered his eyes with his hands. \"Dude! What's with that outfit?! Holy crap!\" Eric started to sound frantic. This was exactly the kind of reaction James wanted to hear so he burst out laughing. \"What's wrong Eric? Am I turning you on? Haha!\" James laughed. \"That's what you get for calling me stupid, buddy.\" \"Yeah, yeah. Can you just go though so I can uncover my eyes?!\"Eric urged. James didn't bother responding. He just continued laughing as he left the house and walked home. Eric opened his fingers ad checked to make sure the coast was clear before removing his hands from his eyes. \"Damn dude.\" Eric muttered to himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He doesn't need you screwing up his life anymore.\" It didn't seem weird to Eric that he would be talking to the ring. He assumes that it can think or at least hear since it spoke to James once before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Eric makes his right hand into a fist, clutching the ring tightly. \"You are not leaving my sight.\" Eric tells it. No response from the TSAR. Eric walks towards the stairs to go do some videogaming when he is suddenly met from a pain in his palm. \"OW god dammit!!\" he yells; letting go of the ring. He examines his palm and sees no wound but he does recognize this sort of thing; when he had once tried to hold James' awareness ring, it hurt him as well. \"So this ring can do the same thing, eh?\" he bends down and looks at the TSAR. Sure enough, it has morphed a bit, now with a spike protruding from the outer edge. \"Never mind,that's different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Eric stalls a bit before trying to pick the ring up. He watches it closely and sees the spike retract in a sort of fluid motion seen in metallic liquids. Whatever the TSAR was doing was enough to make Eric put up his guard. He backed up about a foot and slowly reached for the TSAR, keeping his hand very close to the floor as he did so. The TSAR moves almost as if it can 'see' Eric's hand. When he gets too close, the TSAR forms many spikes along it's entire surface making it look like a sea urchin. \"Strange,but it still can't stop me.\" Eric comes up with an idea. He leaves the ring alone and goes to the kitchen and searches through a couple drawers. He manages to find a pair of wooden tongs which would allow him to pick up the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He walks back to the ring and uses the tongs to pick up the 'metal spike ball' it appeared to be now. \"Stupid ring. Outsmarted by a boy and his kitchen utensils.\" Eric flatly says. The walk upstairs resumes and the TSAR makes no further changes to itself. \"I should let James know about this when I give this back.\" Eric decides.</span></div></div>",

Eric decided that the TSAR was much too dangerous for James to use again and he tried to think of ways to keep the ring away from his friend permanently.  The next day, Eric left the TSAR in his drawer hidden under some clothes and went off to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that morning, Eric's mother Sara was carrying Ertic's newly washed clothes into his room.  She complained to herself that Eric should have done this himself, but she was in a hurry and decided to do this chore.  Sara (a nurse by trade) is a very religious and vain woman who sees the world in 'shoulds.'  Such as that woman shouldn't wear her top so low.  That man man should have shorter hair.  I (Sara) should be younger and prettier.  To her the devil's influence was everywhere and she wished she could fix things.  There was a truth in that these days, although she couldn't ever imagine that from today on, she would be doing more of the Devil's work than of God's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TSAR was in the drawer that Sara wanted to put the clean clothes in.  The TSAR wasn't happy, it wanted to do what it was made for: Trait Swapping.  That was it's purpose.  Refrigerators want to keep food cold, cars wanted to take people places and the TSAR wanted to swap traits.  It knew it would never get to do it's thing if Eric controlled it, so it changed itself.  It's grew longer and thinner and became an expensive looking necklace.  It also produced an awareness regulator and reformed it into into a cross shaped pendant and string itself through it.  When Sara picked it up for a second and wished it was hers.  The TSAR (now in the shape of a beautiful necklace and pendant) swapped its ownership with the necklace that Sara was already wearing.  The awareness regulator prevented Sara from noticing the change.  She had thought she had tried on the necklace she had found in the drawer and was holding in her hand her own necklace.  She quickly swapped the necklaces putting on the TSAR and returning her former necklace to Eric's drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow any little wish that Sara had the TSAR would make happen by finding a trait (or two or more) with people to swap.  Her body would improve to the 'detriment' of the people around her as well as other's lives and bodies would be changed just by an errant thought that Sara would make.  On the other hand, the awareness regulator would keep havoc from happening around her and let her think of the changes as being God's work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The boy  seemed to gain several inches and could finally see over the desk by the time that Sara had handed him the lolly.  The boy hadn't grown, but the four foot two boy was now wearing the high heeled platform pumps that a relatively short woman (five foot one) had been wearing.  The extra few inches gave the boy the boost in height he needed.  Back in the waitingroom, his shoe collection grew to dozen's of pair of woman's shoes almost all with a heel.  The woman who had been sitting in the waiting room was now wearing little boy sneakers.  She used to have scores of shoes but now she only had three pair: the worn sneakers she was wearing now, a pair of flipfops and a pair of little boy dress shoes for special occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara didn't notice the height change.

She is an older lady who had been widowed for some time.  She now lives in a nursing home.  She had been brought to the hospital for what turned out to be a minor problem but you can never be too sure in her condition.  Now in her wheelchair, she has to wait for The Home to send someone to pick her up.  With nothing to do she is simply waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too far from her a man was waiting impatiently for his wife.  She seemed to be taking forever in the bathroom.

Women seemed to like to spend a half hour in the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara saw Mr. Hall waiting for his wife and thought, \"What is he complaining about at least he get's to go home.\"  The TSAR reading Sara's mind switched things up.  When Mrs. Hall came out of the restroom she walked over to Mrs. Sullivan.  Mrs. Sullivan stood up from the chair she had been sitting in.  Mrs. Hall gave Mrs. Sullivan a peck on the cheek and then the two walked off to drive back home.  Mrs. Sullivan's health had improves such that she didn't need to be in a nursing home and lived with Mrs. Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Hall on the other hand was still impatient.  He was sitting in his wheelchair waiting for the driver from The Home to finally get there.  He now had a host of medical conditions which made constant nursing care imperative.  He had live in the nursing home, but he hated to wait for the attendant who picked him up every time he had to go to the hospital.  It was true that sometimes an ambulance could be sent, but this time his condition wasn't sufficiently serious to warrant an ambulance.

James wiped a bead of sweat off his forehead. \"So, I'll talk to you later then Eric.\" James said to end the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      A few minutes later, James felt the urge to use the TSAR again. (How surprising) But instead of just making random swaps for his amusement, he wanted to test the limits of the ring. He went to his window which overlooked the street. Right across the street was a house, belonging to some neighbor(s) he didn't know. In the window, he could see a woman, probably slightly older than him, undressing. Normally, James would start to enjoy the sight but he looked away. Down at the far left end of the street, was a boyfriend and girlfriend holding hands. James knew what he wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     James quickly ran into his closet. He sat down on his plump ass, and held the ring up to his face. Remainkng silent, he closed his eyes and pictured the undressing woman and the boyfriend. He pictured them swapping heads, but acting normal. And to top it off, her pictured them with AR's on their fingers. James reopened his eye'a and rushed to the window. He first looked towards the couple and could see them. But the guy had a woman's head with messed up hair as if he had taken a shirt off, messing it up. The two acted like a normal couple and kissed before walking away. James' then looked at the woman, who had finished redressing. But she had the head of that guy, yet still acted normal. \"It worked. I can't believe it worked.\" he yelled out of excitement. He had swapped the two people's heads (not their brains) and gave them ARs. \"So I can swap people if their in another building and out of view. I'd just had to have seen them first. Awesome!\" James said very happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      James was glad he learned more about the limits of the TSAR, but for some reason he felt a rush of pleasure go through his milfy body. \"Oooh god! I think I should visit Lauren now!\" James quickly decided. He went and changed his clothes. He put on a hot pink thong with matching colored bra, a white tshirt with large v neck, black yoga pants, and white flip flops. He took the TSAR off and put it in his purse and grabbed that too. \"Lauren, won't be expecting this!\" James said, sweating a lot. </span></div></div>",

In the small amount of time between getting out of the stroller and being ready to be put into the car seat the little girl bent her knees squatted a bit and took a poop into her diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took just a second for the woman to notice the familiar odor and knew what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you have waited until we got home?\" the woman asked exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mommy\" was the reply to this rhetorical question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are going to have to wait until we get home for me to change you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then preceded to strap her daughter in.

Upon surveying the rooms he could see, James found that they were empty. Meaning that Lauren's family was either not home or in different rooms.

Taking the penis for himself never entered his mind.  Due to the TSAR, Lauren now had her father's penis and it was immediately erect.  She knew how to use it on a woman better than most men since she knew what a woman liked.  Soon, Lauren was pumping inside James and he was loving it.  he brought his left hand down to message his clitoris to add to his stimulation.  It didn't take long before both Lauren and James were having an orgasm.  Lauren pulled out of James and both enjoyed the after glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn  Lauren's parent's bedroom, neither Lauren's dad nor her mom knew anything was wrong.  Mr. Tam who had been transformed thought he had always been this way and Mrs. Tam simply didn't see her husband naked so how should she know he doesn't have his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

One was a mother and her ten year old son.  She was holding his hand as the maneuvered to find a nice spot on the beach to set up their towel.  The boy was wearing his blue swim trunks with tan shells on it and a t-shirt.  On his feet he wore the standard footwear for the beach, flipflops.  Passing the boy and his mother was a young couple who were obviously boyfriend and girlfriend.  They must be in the initial stage of their relationship because the boy (22 years old) was holding the hand of his girlfriend (19 years old.)  The girlfriend was wearing a blue and white striped bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames thought it was sweet the two pairs were holding hands.  The first thing James did was to make sure that their the mother nor the boyfriend would notice any changes.  The next thing James did was to swap the chests and genitals of the ten-year old boy and the nine-teen year old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy didn't notice that his penis was gone and replaced with a damp vagina (and all the internal sex organs that went with it.)  But when his chest ballooned out to the pert B-cup that the woman had (including the mature nipples of a young woman) that he noticed immediately.  Shocked, the boy said, \"Mommy I have boobies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Timmy,\" you do just like mommy.  Timmy's mom was worried this day would come.  She didn't think he was old enough at ten to need a bra (or a bra top for that matter) but she thought she would have to break down and start getting him some.  \"You are getting older and developing.  I think that tomorrow we will have to go and get you some bras.  But for now, I think you had better swim with your t-shirt on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Mommy, I'd not supposed to have boobies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I wish you didn't.  Not yet anyway.  But you are growing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the young woman also didn't notice the slight bulge in her bikini bottoms.  She had the small penis of a ten-year old and his testicles too, but they didn't make that much of a bulge in her swim bottoms.  What concerned her was that her bra top deflated.  Her breasts had gone, replaced with the prepubescent nipples of a ten-year old boy.  She looked down and instinctively put the palms of her hands on her chest to feel the flatness that was now there.  \"Oh My God,\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong, Sherry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breasts are gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??? you look fine.\"  Ross knew that Sherry was over sensitive about her body.  Ross didn't care, he thought she looked sexy and due to James influence, as with Timmy's mother he didn't see anything wrong with his girlfriend not having any breasts (and later the penis of a boy.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look fine??? My breasts are gone!!!  This can't be!\"  Sherry couldn't understand how Ross was acting so normal about this.  She also didn't know what to do.  The only thing she thought she could do was go to the ladysroom and look at her chest herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He was looking for the same type of people as before.  He found then a boy about nine with his mother and another couple (boyfriend/girlfriend) who were in their twenties.  It was exactly the same, but close enough.  What James swapped wasn't the body parts of the boy and the woman but what they expected.  The boy expected breasts on his check and a vagina in his shorts.  The woman expected a flat boyish chest with undeveloped nipples and a small also undeveloped penis with testicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, I have boobies on my chest!!!\"  Stephanie cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do, and I love them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?

He got into a kick where these couples we so different like a mom and son and boyfriend and girlfriend.  It was fun to change one of each couple and see how the other one reacted.  But then he realized he could do more than just that he could swap the relationship itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames got the idea when he saw a mom, Wendy putting sunscreen on her son, Brian and then saw a boyfriend, Todd do the same to his girlfriend, Bonnie.  They were doing the same thing, but it felt different to him.  So he swapped their relationships.  Wendy and Brian thought they were boyfriend and girlfriend.  Todd and Bonnie thought they were mother and child, with Todd being the mother in the relationship.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian wanted to make a sandcastle and Wendy helped him, not because she wanted to, but she was scoring brownie points now with a hope of Brian doing something for her when they got home later.  Bonnie had to ask Todd's permission to go to the shore line.  Todd when with her to keep an eye on her.  Todd never let Bonnie out of her sight.  It was dangerous with so many people around a mother could never let down her guard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the building  of the sandcastles, Brian snuggled up in Wendy's arms.  Todd took Bonnie by the hand and took her to the concession stand where he bought Bonnie an ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relationship might have changed, but at a public beach it didn't look too strange.  But there were certainly difference now.  Bonnie now lived with Todd although she had her own room.  Wendy and Brian slept in the same bed now and did more adult things.  The TSAR made these changes without being asked.  But Wendy's husband was too far to be effected and so was Bonnie's parents.  When these other people got involved it wasn't going to be pretty.  Eric was right, but James didn't know how screwed up things had become.  James planned on returning the couples to normal but since nothing strange seemed to happen on the beach he forgot all about it.</span></div></div>",

Brian had never sweared before, but since taking the role of Wendy's boyfriend, he assumed a more boyfriendish personality. \"If you liked me in a swimsuit, how about in my birthday suit?\" Wendy whispered to Brian. Brian in turn fist pumped and did a little celebratory dance; causing Wendy to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Wendy drove herself and her \"bae\" (don't ask why I used that word) back to their home. She didn't find it abnormal that her boyfriend didn't yet have a license, so she spoke nothing of it. She quickly parked the car in the driveway and ran out. Brian however took his time, being the one to gather the beach supplies from the car. Once inside, Wendy made sure to grab Brian's arm, causing him to drop all their stuff on the floor. \"Hey, we gotta put all that away-\" Brian tried to say but was cut off as Wendy bent down and gave Brian a sloppy wet kiss on the lips. The two passionately made out for a bit until Wendy decided to end it for now. \"Just forget about that crap for a minute. I've been waiting for us to have some privacy all fucking day, honey.\" Wendy told her son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Wendy? Is that you and Brian? How was the beach?\" an older male voice said from the kitchen. The voice was that of her actual spouse, her husband Carl. \"Oh shit, Carl's home.\" Brian sneered. Carl didn't get a response from his wife. He assumed that she just didn't hear him, so he went to go greet her. \"Welcome home honey.\" he said as he reached in to hug Wendy and gave her a kiss on the lips. Carl didn't notice, but Wendy acted a bit repulsed from his exchange of affection. \"So champ,\" Carl said now talking to Brian. \"Was the beach fun today?\" Brian gave a fake smile. \"It sure was. I couldn't have imagined a better day for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      These interactions seem normal, but what is the hierarchy of their household like now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

So in Brian and Wendy's mind, they were boyfriend and girlfriend living with Brian's dad.  Wendy held the pants in the relationship (like the man), but Brian controlled the relationship in that he was the one who determined if they had sex or not (like the woman).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl caught Wendy and Brian kissing on the couch and seeing something was wrong with it, broke it up.  \"Carl we were just kissing, Wendy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy, that looked like more than kissing.\"  The two got into an argument, but neither were really listening to what the other ware saying.  Carl tried to patch it up by getting more affectionate with Wendy.  Wendy was shocked at Carl's advances.  She thought he was a pervert trying to get frisky with his son's girlfriend.  Wendy knew she couldn't sleep in the same bedroom as Brian while living in his father's house.  So when she slept on the sofa an uneasy truce was formed.

Kim was trailing behind him, wearing a tiny pink bikini leaving nothing to the imagination of passerbys. \"Hey James, sorry we're late.\" he said, wiping his forehead of sweat. \"No worries, Eric. Just got here myself.\" James replies. Eric nods and puts a hand on James' shoulder. He whispered, \"James I need to talk to you about something.\" James nodded and told the girls that he and Eric would be right back. Kim and Lauren agreed and went off to find a spot on the beach.  Eric lead James behind the changing rooms after checking to make sure that the coast was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Okay Eric, what's wrong?\" James asked. crossing his arms in front of his breasts, squishing them. Eric turned and held up his right fourth finger. There was a plain greyish ring on it. \"This is what's wrong.\" he said. \"I think it's another one of the strange rings. And I can't take it off.\" James was taken aback upon hearing this. Both of James' rings were removable so it didn't make sense as to why Eric's was stuck. \"So do you know what that ring does?\" James asked as he pulled Eric's ring to try to remove it. Sure enough it was actually stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I don't really know. When the ring appeared this morning a voice said it prevents detection from similar devices. What do you suppose that means?\" Eric asked. James could tell that Eric was worried but he too didn't really have any ideas. James looked down at his awareness ring on his finger and a lightbulb clicked in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I got it!\" James quietly proclaimed. This certainly got Eric's attention. \"If it has anything to do with my rings, maybe it makes you invisible to whatever causes changes.\" James said. This made sense to Eric. Perhaps his ring did protect him from the other rings. But he was immune to the rings before, so did his new ring actually work. Eric scratched his head and then realized James had said invisible, not immune. So included with Eric's immunity, he is now invisible to the other rings. This caused Eric to smile due to him hating James' TSAR. Eric thanked James and went into the mens' changing to put on his bathing suit. James did the same but hesitated as to which room he should go into. Technically he was female but his friends and family still recognized him as male. Deciding to go into the womens', James took off his clothes and stuffed them into his beach bag. He spent some time marveling at how amazing his mothers' body looked in a bikini. Everyone else was waiting for him though, so he hurried out and regrouped with the other three. He felt a sort of euphoric rush being out in public with his mothers' body and mouth while wearing only a bikini and flip flops. He enjoyed himself, but there was a nagging thought in the back of his head: Where did these rings come from and what is their purpose?</span></div></div>",

Kim and Lauren, who saw no change to James acted completely normal, talking to him as if they were talking to a guy.

Surprisingly he wasn't attracted to the beauty that was James' milf body, he held more of a 'that's kinda gross, let's not look too closely' mentality, but he was still James' friend and acted as such. James didn't act too differently either, but running around with his mom's body and mouth practically naked in public started to make him horny. \"Perhaps mom was a bit of an exhibitionist' James thought. 'Which means I'm probably one now!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Realizing this fact didn't help sate James' increasing lust, so he quickly excused himself and ran as fast as he could wearing his mother's flip flops to the womens' changing room. He quickly ducked into a stall and sat down. \"I never got this horny so easily when I still had my body. I never knew a female's body could be so different.\" James said to himself. But his manicured hands moved towards his breasts and pussy while James was trying to rationalize. His left hand got to his left nipple and started rubbing and squeezing it. \"I guess I can kind of respect mom a bit more now.\" James continued talking to himself, moaning a bit in his mother's voice. \"But I don't know if I should be happy or worried being stuck like this.\" James' right hand got into his bikini bottoms and flicked his clitoris. \"Oooh, I guess I am a bit happy about this.' James murmured. His right hand slipped inside and James proceeded to finger himself, moaning loudly as he did so. He didn't know if there were other people in the room, but if they were they didn't care about listening to James' moans of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Kim checked her cell phone. \"How long is he gonna take?\" she laughed. \"It's been ten minutes already.\" Lauren understood what Kim meant. \"You know James, can't keep his hands out of his shirt or his pants.\" she joked. Both girls laughed at the thought, but Eric was left clueless. 'Do they think James has always been like this? Getting horny so easily?! Man, these rings just keep getting scarier by the minute.' Eric thought to himself. He looked down at the grey ring on his right hand and clenched his fist. 'Hopefully this really will protect me.' Eric's train of thought was interrupted by both girl's cheering and whistling. He turned to see James walk back from the changing rooms. Albeit sweaty, and walking like a horny girl, swaying his hips, pushing out his ass and making sure his breasts jiggled nonstop. \"Sorry guys. Was I really gone that long?\" James asked. Kim and Lauren laughed, but Eric stayed silent still. He looked down at his ring again and pondered. </span></div></div>",

You are clearly a man and I don't appreciate you using the ladysroom.\"  The awareness regulator ring had to make a choice since James had his mom's body but all his friends thought he was a guy and it decided that he was a guy despite his body.  He had to use the mensroom like the other guys.  It may be weird to 'see someone with his shape' inside the mensroom but no one would complain because of the awareness regulator ring.

He could even wear exclusively feminine clothing and it wouldn't matter.  But if he used the female equivalent people would notice, even with the awareness regulator ring.  It sort of made sense that everyone would see him the same and have the same expectations of him.  Of course he could override this with manual changes to people.  But that was a hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady walked away with her son.  She didn't notice that there was now a small bulge in the front of her swimsuit.  It was the small penis of her son, no one would probably notice a penis that small in her suit, not until she got home and her husband saw her naked.  She of course, didn't know anything was wrong with it, nor did she think anything was wrong with her son having her 'mature' vagina  instead of his four-year old penis in his suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames rejoined his friends.  \"What did she want,\" Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was pissed because I used the ladysroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used the ladysroom???

It's almost dinner time at my house.\" Lauren said in agreement with Eric. James said nothing and ran to the men's changing rooms, taking what the woman told him earlier into account very seriously. \"Don't want to be labeled as a pervert anymore.\" James said to himself as he ran, making him constantly aware of his current form. \"Especially with a body like this.\" he said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Eric' you gonna change too?\" Kim asked him, drawing his attention away from the ring on his finger. \"Uh, no my swim trunks are pretty dry. I'll just wear them home.\" he said back. \"Whatever you say, babe.\" Kim winked at him as Lauren dragged her to the women<br>\r\ns changing room. Eric finally found himself alone for the first time that day. He started packing up his stuff without so much as a thought. Sure he had fun, but for some reason he felt a little anxious around James, Lauren and Kim. \"It's probably nothing.\" he tried to consul himself. Yet every time he did a bit of reassuring, there was always something in the back of his mind that disagreed. It wasn't a particularly strong part of him. It was more like a little bug that gave him an itch every time he told himself that everything was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n         Eric trudged into his house after dropping Kim off at her place. He dumped his beach stuff on the floor and ran to the bathroom to shower himself. His parents were in the kitchen talking about their days as any working couple would, leaving Eric to his own devices. \"Door locked, check.\" Eric said, running off a small checklist he thought up. \"Lights, check. Ring...check.\" Eric decided that now was the time. It was time for him to understand his ring. If he had tried to examine his ring at the beach, he was sure that his friends and girlfriend would think something off about him; which was something he didn't want to happen especially because James was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Alright ring. Talk.\" he spoke sternly to the gray ring on his finger, almost as if he were interrogating it. But no answer was given. \"Come on. You talked to me yesterday. Just what are you?\" he questioned. The ring remain still and silent. Since he was getting nowhere, Eric started scratching the ring, pulling it, biting it, to try and get at least some sort of reaction to it. Even after all the force applied to the ring, it still did not move or talk. \"Dammit all!\" Eric blurted out, giving one last pull to the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Later that night, Eric was preparing for bed. He stayed up a few hours later than usual trying to force the ring to react. He had yet to make progress. Eric laid on his back, with his hand behind his head and looking at the ceiling. \"I wonder if James really is comfortable being the way he is. I mean the ring did forcibly change him... to an extent.\" Eric pondered. \"If his life hasn't been affected too much and he's happy like that, maybe these rings aren't as bad as I thought.\" Upon saying this, Eric felt a prick on the finger where his ring was. Immediately wincing from the pain he moved his hand to his face. The ring looked ever so slightly different; it had a little red dot on it. Eric touched the spot with his finger then checked his fingertip. There was nothing, meaning that the red spot was under the surface of the ring. This should've set Eric on a tangent, going on about how he hates the rings and wants his gone, yet he remained at ease. This unexpected feeling of peace drifted into Eric's mind, putting him soundly to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>         After listing off to sleep, Eric found himself in a dream. He looked around and saw absolutely nothing. Everything around him was pure black and nothing else; but when he looked down at his feet, which he could see, he saw he was standing. \"Ok, now this is one weird dream.\" Eric said, not realizing that he knew he was dreaming. He was having something like a lucid dream but all he could control was himself. \"Kinda dull in here.\" he spoke out loud again. \"Does it really need to look aesthetically pleasing?\" a voice said back to Eric. \"Whaa! Hello? Who's there?\" Eric asked the darkness around him. It wasn't scary to Eric that he heard a disembodied voice speak to him, but the fact that it actually spoke in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        The voice did not respond to Eric's last question, but instead started talking in a dismissive tone. \"Look here.\" it said. Of course everything was black so being told to look in a particular spot wasn't much help. Eric turned a couple times, trying to see what the voice was referring to. \"Urgh, stay still.\" It said sounding frustrated. Eric did as he was told and look in front of him for a bit. They were faint at first, but clearly visible. Little specks of light were flying towards him pretty quickly. Eric raised his arms to try and shield himself but felt nothing hit him. He slowly lowered his arms and saw the lights were forming together to create a large image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        The image stayed a single color for a second before becoming more defined. Eric could now clearly see what it was. The image was of James, naked in his current form with his mother's parts. \"AAAAH, cover him up please!\" Eric pleaded shielding his eyes. \"As you wish.\" the disembodied clone of Eric's voice said. The image of James blurred a bit before redefining as James' current form in his bikini and flip flops from the day before. Eric lowered his arms and saw the image. \"Smartass.\" Eric muttered with a sigh. The voice gave no attention to Eric's insult and spoke again. \"This human currently possesses the ring that changes him, leading to his current image.\" Eric crossed his arms in front of his chest. \"Yeah, I already know that. What's your point?!\" he said sounding annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         The image changed to a large picture of the TSAR. \"This ring your friend possesses doesn't affect you. You are immune.\" the voice continued. Eric started to get nasty and gave a grunt, to infer the voice to say something new. Eric soon got his wish as the image changed again; this time to a silhouette of a man shaded blue. \"This represents that immunity in you. By using your ring, you can make your friend immune.\" The image changed a bit by removing some of the blue shading in the silhouette. Eric nodded his head, although the image did cause him to worry. \"Won't that deplete my immunity? I mean come on, this image isn't making me feel any better.\" Eric said. Almost immediately the voice responded. \"Do not fear! It'd be like taking a cup to the ocean and taking some water from it. You'll still remain immune.\" This made Eric smile. If what the voice says is true he could make his parents, James, Lauren, Kim, and all their families immune to the horror that was the TSAR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         The image in front of Eric started fading, but not before Eric spoke up for his friend. \"Wait, what about James? He has most of his mother's body along with some other changes. Can I fix him?\" \"No! Your immunity will prevent any further changes that could happen by the TSAR. What has already been done is irreversible at this point.\" This brought down Eric's spirits a bit. \"Please understand, the TSAR is not evil. It just...takes thing a little too literally.\" the voice said again. \"What do you mean?\" Eric asked, but his question got drowned out by a loud static and everything becoming a bright white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric woke up slowly, feeling a pounding migraine in his head. \"Uh, talking to rings in my sleep is bad for my health.\" he said. Putting a hand to his head proved that he did have a bit of a fever, but nothing that he couldn't deal with for the day. \"Anyway, I think it's time I finally help my best friend.\" Eric said to himself valiantly.<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

Wow that is cool.\" Eric said to himself.  \"I need someone to talk to about this and James isn't it.  He already knows about the ring and I don't think he'll be willing to give up it's power.  Who should I talk to.?\"  Then the obvious answer came to him, Kim of course.  Kim is his girlfriend she is the one he should share this with.  Plus he didn't want Kim to be changed in any way, especially by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric got dressed and at an appropriate time walked over to Kim's house.  he was intent on using his ring on her to get her to see the truth.  Eric used his ring on Kim the way he was told (in his dream) and then asked her a bunch of questions to see if it worked.  If it had worked, she would be immune and could see what was wrong with James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim, what did you think of James' bikini?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice.  A little old fashioned for my taste, but it was nice,\" Kim replied.  This wasn't the answer Eric expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, but why was he wearing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess because he likes it.  Why are you asking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, wearing a bikini seems odd to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does?  I wear a bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I\"m a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are supposed to wear bikinis.  But James is a guy, he shouldn't wear a bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean he should wear a tankini or a one-piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He shouldn't wear a suit that covers his chest at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't go around naked.  Not in public, that is indecent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wear a top at the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have the breasts that James has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But James is a man.  He shouldn't have breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see your point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting exasperating to Eric.  This immunity thing isn't working.  Maybe he should try something else.  \"Look, James doesn't have a penis.  You know that.  You can see that fact by looking at his bikini bottoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All guys have dicks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if James doesn't have a dick, he isn't a guy is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he's a guy.\"  No, matter what Eric said, he couldn't make Kim see the contradiction that James was a guy but he had a woman's body.  If Eric couldn't convince her about James' boobs and pussy.  Then trying to convince her about talking about his butt, waist or thick thighs wouldn't work either.  Nor talking about his apparent mature body even though he was still a teen.  This immunity transfer didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's dream was just that.  It was just a dream, the ring didn't talk to him.  It didn't have any magical powers, not any that Eric could use.  He was immune to the new ring just like he was immune to the TSAR.  The fact was, this ring was just stuck on his finger in a conventional sense not a magical sense.  After a while he gave up.  Kim wondered why Eric was asking all these strange things and she tried to ask him about them, but he found a way to change the conversation to something else.  Finally he asked, \"Hey can you help me get this ring off my finger?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once in the shower, James took his time cleaning his new body.  He lathered up with soaps and shampoo for his new hair, which had seemingly appeared in his shower due to a previous swap most likely.  As he ran his fingers through his hair, rinsing the conditioner out, he felt something strange.  The hair seemed to pull and stretch when he combed his hands through it.  By the time he realized what he was doing, he felt locks of wet hair clinging to his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\"  He mumbled, as he grabbed a handful of hair to look at.  His hair had suddenly grown two or three times its previous length, and was long enough to cover his breasts if he brushed the hair forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames decided it was best to stop touching his hair for now, and started washing his body.  But when the soap rinsed off, he could feel something peeling on his flat belly.  Curious, he wondered if it was just dry skin that needed to be pulled off, and gave it a tear.  There was no pain, but the skin didn't break off.  It kept peeling, and peeling, until the entire top layer of skin on his whole stomach was peeled off.  Horrified, he looked down between his tits to see the new layer of skin that was just revealed on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere there were once stretch lines and marks from giving birth to three children, it was now smooth and taut skin, like a girl half his mother's age.  He thought it might end there, but as the warm water continued running over him, more of his skin began peeling away, over his whole body.  His legs, his breasts, even between his thighs, the skin came off painlessly.  In fact he felt himself almost getting aroused by the sensation, and amazed at the results.  It wasn't just new skin, but he felt younger suddenly too.  The breasts that previously belonged to his mother, were no longer sagging due to years of gravity.  The muscles in his feminine thighs and abs felt stronger and more energized.  'He' was like a whole new woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen there was no more skin to be removed, he practically leapt out of the shower, dripping water all over the floor.  He rushed to see his new appearance in the mirror, and was shocked...  What he saw was no longer just a boy's face on a 40 year old woman's body.  'He' now looked like a proper 18 year old girl.  Below the neck wasn't the only change.  The skin on his face had peeled away as well, revealing softer more feminine features.  The face he saw now resembled his sister if she was older, but looked more like a feminized version of himself.  The strangest thing however, was that it seemed to fit perfectly with the rest of his body.  His lengthened hair was still the same color as before, a light brunette shade.  The girl in the mirror didn't look like a hodgepodge of different people's traits.  She looked like a real person...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...\"  James muttered under his breath.  He noticed his voice sounded slightly different now too.  It wasn't exactly his mother's voice, but maybe what she had sounded like at his age.  \"What the hell happened?  That other ring...  I was wearing it when I... orgasmed.  I was thinking about how that girl in the porn video was so much younger and cuter than me.  Did the ring somehow grant my wish?  Did the orgasm give the ring power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames realizes...</span></div></div>",

'So this means I'm Lauren's girlfriend.' James smiled at this thought and took the awareness regulator off her hand before going to sleep. She had no problem finding a comfortable position to sleep in with her large breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    During the night, she had dreams of having sex with Lauren. James felt amazing as her pussy grinded against Lauren's as she moaned like an animal in heat. Lauren sucked on James' nipples, causing James to moan as well. They both came soaking each others' groins in sexual fluids. Suddenly, a double sided strap on appeared. Lauren grabbed it and put in on, cringing as the inner dildo slid inside her. James responded by getting on her hands and knees to present her backside to Lauren. Lauren wasted no time and straight away penetrated James' pussy. The outer dildo slid so in and out so easily, hitting James' g-spot causing her pussy to grip onto the dildo never wanting to let go of the feeling. Lauren thrusted even harder forcing her and James to edge of fierce climax. James wished this amazing dream could go on forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But then James woke up. James looked around and sighed not noticing how soaked her thong and bedsheets were. James put the awareness regulator back on. \"Maybe I should pay Lauren a visit.\" James said, crossing her arms.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After such a vivid dream, there was no way James could go back to sleep.  She needed to see her girlfriend immediately.  It was easily two in the morning, still many hours to go before she had to wake up for school.  <i>And still plenty of time for me to see Lauren...</i>  James thought to herself, her nipples getting hard just thinking about Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she realized the second ring was once again on her finger.  She didn't even remember putting it on, but she had apparently put it on without even thinking earlier.  She inspected it for a second, and then looked back to the original TSAR in the drawer.  The TSAR had caused all of this mess, but at the same time, she wasn't annoyed.  In fact, James adored her new body and gender, not even realizing that it was the ring that made her think this way.  She decided to grab the TSAR, but not put it on.  She didn't want to risk it changing her any further, but she also didn't want it falling into anyone's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she noticed the purse sitting at the foot of her bed.  She didn't see it there before, and it didn't look like her mother's.  James opened the purse and looked inside, seeing an assortment of things like a makeup kit, tampons, her cellphone, and a wallet.  The wallet didn't have any form of identification in it, but it did have all of the cash James had been carrying in his male wallet before this happened.  She shrugged and carefully slipped the TSAR into the wallet, making sure it wouldn't fall out on accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she knew she would need to get dressed, and opening her closet she was greeted by an absolute mountain of clothing.  It resembled her mother's wardrobe, but altered to suit a teenager, rather than a milf.  There were more skirts and dresses than she could count, and the floor was littered with shoes of every type.  Clearly the second ring's transformation had done more than just change her body and mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was in a hurry and had no time to fuss over outfits.  Despite being ok with the situation, James <i>was</i> still new to being a girl, and didn't want to get carried away.  She knew she'd have to try on some of these heels later, but right now she didn't trust herself to walk in them.  For now, she found a pair of knee high flat boots, and a red pleated skirt that came down mid thigh.  She found a cute white camisole  that revealed a hint of cleavage, and wore an open black cardigan over top of it.  When she saw herself in the mirror she was shocked at how quickly she'd picked out such a cute outfit, and knew that Lauren would be pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames finally snuck out through the window, climbing down from the second floor with surprising agility.  She landed softly on the lawn, and snuck off into the night.  Lauren only lived a few streets down, and James was lucky that nearly everyone from her high school lived within walking distance.  After walking for about 10 minutes in the silent dark streets, she finally came upon Lauren's street.  All the lights in her house were out, but James had done this before when she had been male.  Today wouldn't be any different.  She checked to make sure the second ring was still on her hand, still not sure what it did, but she had the feeling like if she wore it, Lauren would know she was James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames climbed up the tree outside Lauren's window, with the agility and grace of a gymnast.  She had no idea how she did it, but she was at Lauren's window within seconds, and began tapping at the glass to wake Lauren up.</span></div></div>",

When she peeks through the curtains, she sees a teenage girl clinging to the tree just out the window.  For a split second she doesn't recognize this girl, but a moment later, James's ring automatically activates and alters her mind.  Her eyes glaze over for a split second and then she immediately recognizes her girlfriend and opens the window with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie?!  What are you doing here?!  It's so late!\"  Lauren says in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jamie' smiles, and realizes that must be what people call her now, since James doesn't really suit her.  \"I... I couldn't sleep, can I come inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, just be quiet my parents are sleeping...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie carefully climbed in through the window, and adjusted her pleated skirt which had gotten messed up from all the tree climbing.  Once she was satisfied that her outfit was presentable, she looked back up to Lauren and smiled.  Lauren looked back with a confused, but tired stare.  Before she could say anything, Jamie pulled her in for a gentle and passionate kiss.  It was her first girl on girl kiss since her transformation, and she didn't want to waste any time.  Her dream had left her incredibly horny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally came up for air, Lauren said quietly, \"Whoa... since when did you learn to kiss like THAT?  That was... really nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie brushed a lock of hair out of Lauren's face, caressing her cheek, \"Hmm, I guess I took some of my mom's advice.  She used to be a good kisser in her day you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they resumed kissing, Jamie was pleasantly surprised to feel Lauren getting into it and grabbing Jamie's ample breasts through her shirt, and even placing a hand on Jamie's inner thigh under her skirt.  Lauren had no idea what was driving 'Jamie' to come in the middle of the night acting all horny, but she wasn't complaining.  Jamie was way out of her league as it was, and she wasn't about to turn down sex from her beautiful girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to make sure to do things quietly, so as to not wake the parents, but before long, both girls were on Lauren's bed, nude, pleasuring eachother with their tongues and fingers.  Jamie's vagina felt like it was on fire as Lauren ate her the best she could.  It wasn't the first orgasm she'd had as a girl, but it was her first time with Lauren, in her new body.  She moaned in pleasure into a pillow, hoping to muffle the sound, and in the end Lauren's mouth was covered in her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only fair that she returned the favor, but she had no penis now that she was a girl.  She did the best she could to imitate what Lauren had done to her just a moment ago, and learned quickly how it was done.  She brought Lauren to climax, learning to use her fingers and tongue like she never had to do as a guy before.  She may have the body of a girl, and a girlfriend, but the ring gave her no knowledge about sex other than what the original James already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally both girls were satisfied and decided to rest.  Jamie's energy was absolutely spent, and she passed out curled up on the bed with a stupid grin on her face, she was so pleased.  Lauren on the other hand, was wide awake, and couldn't stop thinking about what had just happened.  Her memories were foggy, but she had no memory of ever having sex like THAT before.  The awareness regulator ring had altered her to accept Jamie as her girlfriend, but she still had memories of having sex with a guy.  Why had she been so eager to sleep with another girl?  She realized she wasn't even sure why she started dating a girl in the first place.  <i>Though after that... I certainly don't regret it...  Jamie is amazing!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot able to sleep, Lauren slipped out from Jamie's sleeping embrace, and noticed the purse on the floor of her bedroom.  It certainly wasn't one of her purses...  <i>Did Jamie always have a purse?  I guess it's not that unusual for a girl...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer curiosity still getting the best of her, Lauren couldn't help but wonder what Jamie kept inside.  She fished around inside, finding normal things that were in every girl's purse.  But then... her fingertip brushed against a cold metal ring.</span></div></div>",

A slight breeze blew flew the ajar bedroom window. The atmosphere was silent and tranquil. Lauren could hear a whisper, almost as if it was right in her ear and in her head at the same time. She reached back into the purse, but this time she picked up the ring. The whisper grew into a full voice, speaking to Lauren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"W-what is this?\" she shakily asked. The voice shushed her so it could speak. \"I am the TSAR.\" it stated. \"By using me, you can swap traits, mental or physical with people.\" Unbeknownst to Lauren, this was the same voice that talked to James, er Jamie, when she first found the TSAR. The ring outlined its capabilities and limits before quieting completely. Lauren wasn't one to quickly believe the voice was real, so she shook the ring to try and make it talk again. She had no luck, so she stood up and examined the ring. It was too dark to really see, but she could tell that it could fit in as a normal ring. \"If this is real, I wonder of I should try it.\" Lauren said. \"But this was in Jamie's purse. If it's hers, I shouldn't take it without permission.\" Lauren realized something and turned her head to face Jamie. \"This was in Jamie's purse... Could she have used this already?\" Lauren thought, slightly moving towards Jamie; trying to figure out what she should do.</span></div></div>",

Jamie used to be a boy, and was just playing with the ring like it was some kind of toy\u2026  Oh my god\u2026 he didn't even want this, the ring changed him into his mother almost entirely!  And then\u2026 made him younger and more beautiful than ever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren snapped out of the sudden memory flashback as she had seen the past few days from Jamie's perspective\u2026 well James's perspective until recently.  She looked down at the beautiful sleeping girl on her bed, and sighed.  How much of her feelings for this girl were fabricated by the ring?  None as far as she could tell.  Jamie\u2026 James had never swapped Lauren.  She was relieved that her feelings for this\u2026 person\u2026 were genuine.  But to find out that her girlfriend had once been her boyfriend was hard to believe.  Lauren wasn't sure she even wanted a boyfriend.  If she helped her change back into a boy, would she even still be attracted to 'him'?  All she wanted to do was cuddle up to her girlfriend and forget everything that had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she admired her sleeping girlfriend, who was still nude and glistening with sweat from their sex, Lauren couldn't help but notice the nipples on her small breasts hardening.  <i>Jamie has such beautifully large but perfectly shaped breasts, and mine\u2026 a curse for having Asian genes I guess.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could think another thought however, she felt her breasts begin to tingle, and watched in amazement as her petite B cups began to inflate, and keep inflating.  They stopped when Lauren now had a pair of DD tits on her chest that looked huge on her small frame.  They were big on Jamie but looked even more ridiculous on Lauren's petite Asian body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\"  Lauren cursed in surprise, and cupped her new breasts in each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked up she saw Jamie still fast asleep, but now with perky little B cups.  The ring had acted on its own accord by reading Lauren's thoughts as she admired Jamie's body, and had already begun giving her what it thought she wanted.  Does Lauren panic and take the ring off?</span></div></div>",

Lauren also didn't want to have her boobs switched but The Ring had done that to her anyway.  The Ring was dangerous and out of control.  She quickly took The Ring off her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commotion had awoken Jamie.  Once fully aroused, Lauren said, \"We have to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About this,\" Lauren said showing Jamie The Ring.  With Jamie's memories of The Ring wiped she didn't know what it was.  She thought for a second, why would Lauren give her a ring?  It didn't have a stone so it wasn't an engagement ring, besides they weren't ready for that.  Then Jamie realized, it must be a \"Promise\" ring.  It meant that Lauren was promising that some day in the future she would propose marriage and give her a legitimate engagement ring.  Jamie loved it immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Yes, Yes....\" Jamie said.  \"When you do ask me, I will say Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"  Lauren didn't realize that Jamie didn't know what The Ring was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what that ring means.

Lauren didn't know what was going on.  This was serious, not a time for a little kiss and tickle.  But, thinking about it a little more they could talk about The Ring after a little fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

To Lauren, Jamie had always been female, thanks to the awareness regulator altering her memories.  So she decided it was better off not bothering to mention to Jamie about this, since Lauren still wasn't even convinced the memories were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Jamie, I love you, but you have to listen to me.\"  Lauren said in between kisses, causing Jamie to stop and look at her with a loving smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it now?\"  Jamie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this ring, this doesn't have anything to do with... well it isn't something I'm giving to you, it's actually yours.\"  Lauren tried to explain.  Jamie simply tilted her head looking very perplexed.  Lauren continued, \"I mean... that doesn't make sense I know but... Ok I'll try to explain it as best I can.  Somehow this ring has the ability to change people when you put it on.  It talked to me when I found it in your purse, and it explained everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?  Lauren is this... are you trying to say... you don't want to promise to get married someday?\"  Jamie asked as tears started to glisten in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren reacted instantly, \"No, no!  That's not what I'm saying at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit... how did I get so lucky to have such a beautiful girl become so devoted to me like this.  She's devastated about this!  Oh of course... the ring.  She didn't always used to be this beautiful, though as James I would like to think he was this in love... I hope.</i>  Lauren thought, wondering just how much of Jamie's personality had been altered by the ring.  The memories she stole from her didn't really indicate anything of the sort had been changed.  Aside from the new female hormones in Jamie's body, it was still the same James personality inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?  Why would you try to make light of this situation by saying its some magic ring...  Oh wait I see... you were just trying to be poetic I'm sorry.  I really overreacted.  You mean to say, the ring will change us both when we put it on.  We'll be able to be together forever.  That kind of thing changes a person for sure!\"  Jamie said cheerfully, carefully wiping the tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren sighed and put her hand behind Jamie's head to pull her in close for an intimate hug.  \"Oh Jamie...  You are completely misunderstanding me, but that's ok.  Listen Jamie, you're like, the perfect girlfriend, the girl of my dreams just about, or what I thought were my dreams, though they may be made up dreams I don't know.  Either way, I don't want to ever lose you, ever!  If they ever allow us to get married I will absolutely... but this isn't about that.  Just listen to me.  This ring is absolutely magical, and not in the poetic way.  It can do magic literally.  It can change people around by swapping traits, physically or mentally...  It is your ring but you don't seem to have any memory of it, since I accidentally swapped your memory when I wished what you used it on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie stared at Lauren blankly, not really believing what was going on.  All her memories of the ring were transferred to Lauren, so it was as though she was hearing this for the first time.  But the TSAR did not speak to Jamie when she held it, because she had already heard the instructions once already.</span></div></div>",

Even if he could convince his friends and others that he had always looked like this what about his mother's friends and the people around her.  He couldn't be with her all the time.  Once she got outside and started being with her friends they would know immediately that her body wasn't right.  His mom didn't have the TSAR and couldn't do anything about it.  Worse yet she wouldn't even know anything was wrong.  She would insist that she was perfectly fine.  That might even work with her friends and strangers but what about when she went to the bathroom with her 'boys body'  Ladies would say that there was a boy in the ladysroom then what would happen?  He had to get his body back. if not for his own sake than for his mothers.  Then for a moment the thought of his body 'kissing' his dad like his mom used to and it just made him sick.  Grownups weren't supposed to be intimate like teens, but that would be a thousand times worse.  He had to get everything as close to normal as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Eric, that can't work,\" James started and then he explained his thinking.  Eric reluctantly agreed that he was right.  Eric and James worked out a plan.  What they had to do was control James' thoughts while he made the changes.  They thought that if James just concentrated on what he wanted that he might be able to get things right.  To help him, they made a list of what James needed to change.  They started from the ground up.  On the list which was written on white loose leaf paper they wrote: From Mom: FEET, LEGS, BUTT, GENITALS, WAIST, STOMACH, CHEST, SHOULDERS, ARMS and HANDS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around,\" Eric said.  When James did.  \"I don't know, do you have your Mom's back?  It's hard to tell all backs look alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know either.  It's not like I can look at my back.  Maybe it doesn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but lets see what else.  Your face looks OK although you are wearing lipstick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let's skip that for now.  This obviously isn't my hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it isn't your mom's either.  Maybe it's your sister's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably right.  Write that down, AUDREY: HAIR.  Is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.  Except for the lips and back, which I'm not sure about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  OK, here's the plan.  ONE: I will go back to my house.  TWO: I'll take out the list and concentrate on it. THREE: I'll put on the ring.  FOUR: One at a time, I will swap back. FIVE: When I am done I'll take off the ring.  SIX: I'll return here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan.\" Eric said.  \"Maybe I should go with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, that couldn't hurt.  But we are coming back here when I finish with the list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me.\"  Then the two returned to James' house with list in hand.  Neither was a hundred percent sure they had included all the body parts needed.  Neither was a hundred percent sure it would work.  Finally, neither had taken into consideration any mental changes the Ring had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

James' noticed how his mother looked so much like him.  For a moment, James' started to imagine how it would be for his Dad and Mom to start getting frisky with each other when his Mom was mostly him.  It sort of sickened him for a short while.  It was at this moment when James put on the ring.  In an instant, without James' noticing James didn't worry about his Mom and Dad kissing.  After all, it was he who did the kissing with his Dad as his Mom's sexual attraction for his Dad came into his mind.  He smiled for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Eric snapped James back into reality.  \"Dude stop day dreaming, you have to put the plan into action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right, I must have zoned for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking James over Eric said, \"Nothing else seems to have changed.  OK start concentrating on the list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames did as bidden and one by one his body parts returned: feet, legs, butt, etc.  One by one his body was returning to normal.  When he got to Audrey's hair James said, \"OK done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well what about the clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't thought about that.  These are clearly Mom's clothes.  Audrey wouldn't wear this.\"  Soon, James had swapped clothing with his mom but it wasn't right.  \"These aren't by clothes.  They must be Audrey's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, try swapping your clothes with Audrey and see if that works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon James was back in his own clothing.  \"Anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lips?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think these are Mom's lips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the lipstick was gone and James seemed to be back to normal.  \"OK, take off the Ring.\" Eric said.  James took the ring off immediately.  \"Let's get back to my place and see if everything is back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked in the mirror.  Everything looked like it should, but for James it didn't feel right.  Being in his own body and clothes just felt a bit odd to him.  He sort of missed having Mom's body and he didn't feel right walking around without a bra even though he didn't have boobs to support.  He guess that he was just disappointed that he couldn't have his Mom's body for a little longer.  But the truth was he had swapped  his body comfort with his mom and so he wouldn't feel normal about his body again until he had a female body or he swapped this mental trait back.  But before he could ponder this Eric hurried him along.  Then the two, left the house again.  James' Mom Heather asked the boys where they were going.  \"Back to Eric's, we just had to get something I forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you call if you are going to be eating at Eric's or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\" and then the boys were off.  James was relieved to get his body back.  He wanted to share his good fortune with the man who meant the most to him, his dad.  James knew that Nick was his father, but he felt like Nick was his husband.  James felt that Nick was the man he had shared everything with.  A man who knew all his secrets and he wanted to tell him this one too.  He felt as a wife would.  He wanted to tell Nick everything and then have Nick to hold him in is arms and kiss him and say everything will be fine.  When James was sure, he would come home and do just that.</span></div></div>",

With his perception changed the reason for wanting his Mom's pussy had changed too.  It wasn't just to see how it was or to test out the ring or anything like that.  Now he had a legitimate reason for wanting it.  He now loved Nick, like a wife not like a son.  James knew that Nick had always wanted him to have a pussy.

I can control it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Right.\" Eric said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you can't control me.  I'll be at your house in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you should.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine.\" and James walked off towards his house.  There was little Eric could do.  James would be careful, he wouldn't even enter his house.  He would go to the window outside the kitchen and if his Mom was there swap her pussy for his cock.  This was best for everyone.  Since James considered Nick to be his husband, Heather considered Lauren to be her girlfriend.  It would be better for them is Heather had a cock.  Lauren was a nice girl she deserved to be dating a person with a cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames quickly took the Ring and put it on his finger.  Then he concentrated.  Soon he had his Mom's pussy again.  He then quickly took the Ring off and jogged towards Eric's house.  Now that James had his Mom's pussy he was eager to let Nick try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

We'll be fine.\" James told his mother. A funny choice of words considering his current condition. He then studied his mother for a moment, at her mismatched body.Only most of her torso and her head were still her own.

He looked down and saw his feminine t-shirt was still distended by his mom's breasts. And from the warm, wet feeling between his legs he obviously still had her pussy too. He'd also neglected to switch his clothes back with Audrey. It was 7:15pm now, and there was a second knock on his bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever it was then entered before James could even think what to do. Lauren was stood there smiling at him. \"Hey, your mom let me in.\" She said in her cute voice as she closed the door after entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" James mumbled, suddenly feeling silly in front of his girlfriend with a large pair of breasts and lacking his manhood. Not to mention his clothes, which were still casual... but a 13-year old girl's kind of casual. And now with Lauren here, James found himself unable to concentrate on swapping his mom's 'intimate' body parts back with her or giving Audrey her outfit back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.\" Lauren chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sat up straight and neatened his shirt, which was pulled taut over his mature breasts. \"Hey babes, it's um... nice to see you.\" He mumbled, failing to sound enthusiastic about Lauren's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Doesn't sound like it.\" Lauren frowned, sitting beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames knew he only had himself to blame for his situation. He'd planned on returning his body back to normal before meeting up with Lauren. But he never thought of the possibility that she would come to him instead. Oh well, he now had three options. 1. To just keep Lauren talking and slowly ease himself into things, hoping he didn't feel too weird making out while having his mom's pussy between his legs and her tits on his chest. 2. He could make sure Lauren didn't sweet talk him into making out at all. Or 3. Maybe think up another way to make him and Lauren 'compatible' again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He hid his breasts by folding his arms but he couldn't keep this up forever.  He knew Lauren she was about to approach him and give him a kiss and when she was that close he couldn't hide them.  The only thing he could do was to make her unaware of the situation.  So he swapped bodies with her.  Once he was in Lauren's body she would be unaware of the changes to him and herself.  It was all he could think of on such short notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever tell you you look so handsome early in the morning?\" Lauren said while looking at what was in effect her own 'old' body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames tried to blush but he couldn't.  \"Awe that is so sweet of you to say.\"  As Lauren moved in closer James saw the mismash that his body had become.   It was a combination of his old body and his mothers.  Eric was right he had gone nuts making all those swaps.  And the swaps he had now were only a fraction of the swaps he had before.  He could see his own face and general body structure on Lauren, but on that he could see his mom's boobs and her rounded hips where his flat chest and straight hips should have been.  he knew that under Lauren's jeans were a totally flat front, but he couldn't really tell since her jeans weren't tight and thus there was some folds of material that would hide such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, Lauren had closed her eyes and kissed him.  James kissed her back but he had forgotten to close his own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, get dressed, we have to get to school.\"  Lauren then turned around and headed for the door.  At that time, James could see his mother's middle aged ass in Lauren's jeans  It looked out of place under James' broad shoulders.  Now that Lauren left the room presumably so that James could get dressed for the day, James finished up at getting everyone back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone, including Lauren and himself was back to normal.  James had time to realize that the big problem was that he wasn't totally in control of his powers and he could swap without realizing it.  James debated with himself whether to take off the ring.  But he worried that if he did someone would find it.  While it was on his finger at least he always knew where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I'm gonna need proof.\" Lauren said, letting out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded. \"No problem, hang on a second.\" He then looked around the campus for a suitable person. He figured giving a penis to his girlfriend would not go down well (no pun intended), and so he picked out another girl, Melissa Hawkes, who was a bit of a ditzy blonde. James picked her because she had a healthy pair of DD-cup breasts. With a quick thought, Melissa's boobs shrank down several cup sizes. Lauren gasped as she looked down at her chest. She grabbed her boobs as they started swelling against the fabric of her bra and t-shirt. They stopped at Melissa's former size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, I told you.\" James said, feeling actually a little smug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Lauren simply remarked, shaking her head as she continued feeling up her new bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might want to stop doing that.\" Eric interjected, nervously looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.. sorry.\" Lauren said, dropping her hands.

James decided he would have to tell her.  Eric's girlfriend was honest and reliable, and wasn't the type to gossip, despite being more popular than the three of them combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kim, since you asked so nicely\u2026 This.  This is what's so important.\"  James held up his hand so Kim could see the TSAR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An ugly old ring?  Seriously though\u2026 you guys are hiding something I know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watch ok?\"  James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames focused on his next swap, and when no one else was looking, he quickly felt himself begin to change.  He started losing weight and becoming more fit, just before a pair of breasts ballooned out onto his chest.  His hair grew long and became a brilliant shade of light blonde, just before it styled itself into a ponytail.  His clothes also altered into a pair of girl's tennis shoes and short shorts, topped off by a volleyball jersey and a sports bra encasing his chest.  He was now Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was still resting her head on his shoulder when this happened without warning, and now she had an eyefull of blonde hair but otherwise didn't know anything had happened.  James had decided to make Lauren unaware of this change, while Kim would be aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\"  James's old body yelled out as Kim realized what had happened.  She was now almost entirely James, except for one important thing.  James had left their genitals intact, so he still maintained his penis in what used to be Kim's shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you believe me now?  James?\"  James asked in Kim's somewhat sultry voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do?  Yes I believe you but\u2026 what is this?\"  Kim freaked out as she looked at every inch of her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry it's completely reversible, I just wanted to prove to you what it can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lauren looked bewildered, \"What did you change, Kim?  I don't see it?\"  Lauren asked, addressing James as 'Kim' because he had swapped his name with Kim as well, making Lauren unaware, just for the time being.  The whole time Lauren was still embracing James's new feminine body.</span></div></div>",

The only person who wasn't aware was Lauren, and she was by now totally confused. \"Okay guys, what's the big deal?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big deal is your perverted boyfriend just swapped bodies with my girlfriend, but he kept his own dick.\" Eric answered Lauren's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" Lauren furrowed her brow. \"Kim looks perfectly normal.\" She said, looking at James as she continued hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JAMES!\" Eric raised his voice, showing his obvious anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill the fuck out, it was just a demonstration for Kim.\" James addressed Eric in Kim's sexy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren let go of James and backed off a little. \"Wait... it's true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shrugged his slender shoulders and gave Lauren an 'innocent' smile, all the while Kim was busy patting her flat chest and feeling up the rest of her mostly male body in the background as Eric tried to calm her down. She was at least relieved when she found she still had her vagina. \"Okay, look... I apologize to everyone, especially you Kim.\" James eventually said, and he set about reversing the body swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James and Kim felt their bodies shifting back to normal, along with their clothes, Eric let out a rather annoyed sigh. James and his new ring were really beginning to irritate him. He had to say his piece. \"Look dude, I know we're friends, but you're pushing it. I don't want you using that thing on my girlfriend, my family or ME... okay?\" He made clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim stepped in to calm things down. \"Sweetie, it's okay, he was only showing me what it could do. And... it is kind of awesome.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first yeah, but things can soon spiral out of control.\" Eric responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on controlling it dude. James tried reassuring Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good luck with that.\" Eric grumbled, glaring at James again for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren by this time was back holding James' hand, showing her obvious support for him. After all, she thought, having such a ring and controlling it's power must be difficult. She was sure he was doing his best.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So he complied and swapped back everything with Kim... for now. In the meanwhile however, James was thinking up a way to somehow keep Eric from noticing the swaps he makes. After all, how else would he be able to improve on his control this power if all he gets is disapproval when using them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed, clearly in disapproval of these powers. \"Leave my family, my girlfriend and myself out of this, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I got it... I won't even mention it to you.\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames got up, and just as Eric turned to walk away, he decided to swap with Kim once again. This time however, in a way he believed that even Eric wouldn't see through. It was going to stretch what he thought the ring could do, but if he was to control this, he'd need to stretch the limit sometime. James started with a complete body swap, making sure that Kim, Lauren and everyone else around were unaware. Next he swapped some major things with Kim so that Eric wouldn't catch on. Name, hobby, and certain memories relating to relationships and etc., all mainly so that the unaware Kim will act like he does. This of course, will have a lot more consequences later on, that James himself didn't think would occur. James however decided to keep his current relationship with Lauren as having powers like this is something he wanted to share, even if his best friend wanted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the huge swap with Kim, James knew he would be able to pretend to be Kim without even Eric noticing. He looked at Lauren, who still thought of him as her boyfriend despite being pretty much completely Kim. He gave her a small kiss that went unnoticed by Eric, then realized his busy schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I got to go, see you guys later.\" James said with Kim's voice, leaving the group behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kim was taking it slower than James ever did.  She didn't want to move straight to sex.  She wanted to kiss and hug and fondle Lauren's body.  Lauren enjoyed the foreplay   She had wished that James had been more tender with her and now that 'he' was she enjoyed every minute of it.  This would be the longest session of love making that Lauren had ever had and they did it while mostly dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, James decided to go to the gym. Once there, instead of quickly changing into Kim's workout clothes as Kim usually did, James decided to linger in the women's lockerroom.  There James saw many women in various stages of dress.  James slowly changed his own clothes while covertly looking at all the other women there.  Most of the women were totally free of modesty since they thought they were in a room full of other women.  Seeing them all made James hot, but with Kim's body the other women couldn't tell.  Well it certainly wasn't as obvious as it would have been with an erect penis.  Soon, James was getting wet between his legs so he decided to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took what he didn't and walked to the showerroom.  In the showerroom, women were even more exposed that in the lockerroom.  James wanted to touch himself to relieve the sexual tension, but he dared not.  The other women would see that and that would be a problem.  He didn't want to ruin Kim's reputation he didn't think that was right.  (Stealing Kim's body on the other hand he didn't have a problem with.)  Once under the showers, James decided to turn on the cool water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He now believed his own name was Kim, because he had to make sure the real Kim would respond to the name James.  He also swapped all of his memories of friends with Kim as well, with the sole exception of his romantic relationship with Lauren.  He also had to swap all of Kim's hobbies and interests to make sure  she would play a convincing 'James' to Eric.  This meant James had all of Kim's interest in athletics and school activities.  There were other side effects of the memory swaps that James was not even aware had happened yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, the new Kim, realized that class was about to start and she didn't want to be late for the start of her busy day.  But of course, every day was busy for her, since James now had all of Kim's memories of her after school clubs and sports, but also all of her classes that she took.  Kim was what you'd call an overachiever, and made sure she always took the advanced classes.  James realized Kim's classes might be a bit too hard for her, but decided there was enough swapping for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs 'Kim' walked to her next class, Eric hurried close behind to talk.  \"Hey wait up!  You're taking this awfully well babe.  My friend swaps his body with you, and you didn't even bat an eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when 'Kim' realized she was still wearing the ring.  Before Eric noticed, she slipped the TSAR off her finger and hid it in her new purse which she'd acquired in the clothing swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Eric\u2026  Don't worry about it.  I think you're too hard on James sometimes.\"  James said with Kim's voice.  He hadn't intended for it to come out so feminine but he didn't even realize he was talking with Kim's inflections as well as walking with a feminine gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed, \"You didn't see the things he did with that ring.  He got out of control and would have lost himself if I hadn't stopped him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's pretty awesome to be honest!  You would rather him not use it at all?  Think of what we could do with it\u2026 with James's help of course.  It's his ring after all.\"  'Kim' said, trying to stay in character, but not finding it difficult at all.  It felt perfectly natural calling James, James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would rather he wasn't an idiot about it!  I don't know, let's just forget about it for now, and hope he doesn't turn the whole school upside down before the end of the day.\"  Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kim' smiled in a particularly Kim fashion.  \"Oh don't worry about it, he'll be fine!  Listen I have to get to class though\u2026 and today I'll be particularly busy so I don't think we'll be able to hang out tonight.\"  James said in Kim's voice, trying to get Eric off her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, I know you're a busy girl,\" Eric said as he pulled 'Kim' in for a kiss.  In front of the other students in the hallway, he French kissed who he thought was his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kim's eyes went wide, as James was completely caught off guard by this display.  She thought it was disgusting kissing a guy, her best friend especially.  But she couldn't break character now\u2026 it would ruin everything.  'Kim' managed to kiss back just enough to not arouse suspicion from Eric, but afterwards would end up cleaning her mouth out in the drinking fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled after their kiss, causing James to get a bit uncomfortable and wish that she had thought of a better plan than becoming Kim.  But her new body was far too enjoyable to give up, and she would just have to deal with this for now until he could figure out a better way to deal with Eric\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah um\u2026 Maybe I'll see you tomorrow?\"  Eric asked, seemingly wanting to be around his girlfriend more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see what my schedule is, but I'll call you if anything comes up!\"  James said, waving Kim's hand in a feminine fashion, as she walked to her first class.</span></div></div>",

Eric and James were still unaware of Kim's presence, and now would be the perfect time.  It was lunch time and Kim sat with her friends and fellow volleyball team members.  She watched from across the courtyard as James was about to make a move and get Eric's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit I have to do something now! </i> Kim thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the TSAR on her finger, the original James, now Kim, focused on the new James's attraction towards Eric.

Some part of Kim's emotions told her this would be a good idea and would help her pretend to be a better Kim!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the swap, Kim didn't feel any different, but noticed that James was no longer giving Eric secret glances.  She breathed a sigh of relief now that he wasn't trying to steal her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a close one\u2026\"  Kim muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that Kim?  You ok?

When are you gonna find a real guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kim' suddenly found herself offended at this, \"He's not dorky!  I love him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the swap she had intended to give away the attraction to Eric to one of her girlfriends once it was safely away from James.  But now that she felt these feelings towards him, she had no intentions of making Angela fall in love with Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill, girl I was just kidding\u2026 Kinda.  You seem pretty serious though, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you two were already at the 'L word' stage.\"  Angela said, sticking her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L word?  Oh love.

Kim found herself staring at Angela's cleavage a lot more than she remembered. <i> Does this make me a lesbian?  Or bisexual?  Did I swap something to make me attracted to her\u2026?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hit her:  She was attracted to girls now because she was still attracted to Lauren!

While she couldn't really remember when or why she was attracted to Lauren or other girls exactly, Kim knew that she just had just swapped James' attraction to Eric to herself. Which really brings her mind to a confused state, split between two natural feelings of love towards two different people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was James attracted to girls? Yes, but no, I was James, so Kim was? Wait, what?</i> Kim found herself simply confusing herself mid-thought. She took a deep breath in attempt to clear her mind, calming herself like before a volleyball match. Her moment was then broken by Angela, who was still with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim? You alright, you seemed to be in deep thought about something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, it's nothing.\" Kim replied quickly, looking back at Angela. Her eyes once again fell down to Angela's cleavage, before returning to Angela's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought I might have stuck a chord with something I said, you're usually not the type to glaze off.\" As Angela spoke, Kim returned to thinking about how attractive Angela was. Which also led back to the girl she really loved: Lauren. <i>That last swap really messed with my head, I better put James' feelings back with James...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kim' attempted to focus the feelings and relationship 'James' had to 'James'. It was all a bit entangled however, and she ended up swapping out 'her' feelings of friendship with Eric along with the feelings of attraction. This however did help clear her head a bunch and shortly realized that by doing what she had just did, it completely undone the swap that would allow her to continue to pretend to be Kim. Thinking quickly, and now without the feelings to Eric, she went with her original plan of putting 'James' attraction to Eric to Angela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Eric and 'James' again, 'Kim' took a sigh of relief as she saw that 'James' was no longer trying to hit on Eric. Her cover was safe, and she could continue pretending to be Kim. Seeing Kim looking at Eric again, Angela also turned to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I take it back girl, I get what you see in your boyfriend.\" Angela said, with her new attraction to Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really..?\" Kim replied, now not feeling anything for Eric at all. She knew he was 'her' boyfriend, and maybe her best friend? But she couldn't really feel anything for him at all. She looked back at the group she sat with, and noticed all of them appealed to her much more than before. While it was a bit strange that Kim would feel this way, 'Kim' felt really lucky. </span></div></div>",

I mean I just told Angela I loved him\u2026 but I have all these feelings for Lauren too.  Lauren and I\u2026 I feel like we really have something special.  Eric doesn't really do anything for me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she realized that the original Kim's feelings were not very strong towards Eric.  Sure she told people they were close, and she had no problem saying she loved him.  But deep down, this new Kim realized she loved Lauren much more.  The conflicting sets of memories took some sorting out, but by the end of lunch, the new Kim realized that Lauren was who she really loved.  And she was ok with cheating on Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when it came time to respond to Angela's question, Kim said, \"Oh no we're very close.  Eric is wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she knew it was a lie.  All of Kim's feelings were her own now.  She knew Kim didn't have strong feelings towards Eric.  And once she realized that her feelings for Lauren were originally James's feelings for Lauren, she remembered that before all of this she was James!<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nShit did I really used to be called James?  That's so weird\u2026  I remember being a guy but\u2026 having all of James's friends and hanging out with Eric as a buddy\u2026?  That just doesn't seem like something I'd do.  </i>The truth of the matter was, with Kim's memories of her friends, the new Kim was now closer than ever with Angela and Nicole, and all the other friends she currently sat with.  Not to mention the many other kids around the school who she knew.  She couldn't imagine NOT being as popular as she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, Kim went to the remaining classes in her schedule, which she didn't even bat an eye at.  It all came naturally to her, and once her final period was over, she knew to head to volleyball practice right away.  But first, she reached into her purse and found her phone.  It was Kim's phone of course, but she'd swapped all of her belongings with the real Kim, so this was of course her phone now.  It had pastel colored flower designs on the plastic case, and she thought it looked adorable.  She quickly dialed Lauren's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren answered, a bit confused.  \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lauren, it's me Kim!\"  Kim said in a cheerful tone which came naturally to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi!  Sorry I didn't recognize your number.  Strange that it's not coming up with your name\u2026\"  Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OH right\u2026 Lauren probably didn't have Kim's phone number saved.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's fine, this is my cell number.  Say do you wanna stop by the volleyball court?  I've got practice in a minute and you can watch.  We can go over to your place afterwards\u2026\"  Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the moment of truth.  Does Lauren still think of Kim as her 'boyfriend' or rather girlfriend now?  Or did something go wrong with the mental swap this morning?</span></div></div>",

While at the changing room, Kim found herself more... distracted than usual, though she managed to remind herself that she already has Lauren to think about. She was however still the last one to get changed and get onto the volleyball court. Looking over to the stands, Kim quickly found Lauren waving to her. Kim smiled and waved back, feeling good that someone she loves is watching her do something she loves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough 'Kim' remembered that she wasn't really good at volleyball back when she was James, it all came really natural to her now. In fact, she couldn't imagine bad at volleyball, this was her sport. She felt alive while playing it and while it was exhausting, it was also very enjoyable to her. Though it had been a rather long day, practice was over before she knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim followed her teammates back to the changing rooms to take a shower. After she stripped down and entered into the shower, Kim once again was reminded that she had once been James with the new sensations the water brought to her body. It was a bit strange, as her memories tell her how familiar her body was, yet the sensations felt new. It was arousing, but Kim did the decent thing and opted not to masturbate in the public showers where all her friends were. She quickly finished up her shower and dried herself off before dressing up in a fresh set of clothes. Remembering the ring, Kim put it into her purse, knowing she'll probably use it again sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to Angela, Nicole and the rest of her volleyball teammates, Kim met up with Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lauren, ready to go?\" Kim asked, draping her arm over Lauren's shoulders.

She still thought of herself as a girl, and as Kim, but holding Lauren in her arms was enough to remind her why she didn't want to get rid of her attraction to Lauren.  Lauren was the one she truly cared about.  <i>But there's still Eric\u2026  How am I going to deal with this?  I can't date them both\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim remembered to keep her distance from Lauren, in case Eric saw them together.  In Eric's eyes, Kim was still his girlfriend, and though she still liked him, she wanted Lauren more.  If he saw them, he would surely figure out that James had used the ring on Kim.  Though he might not realize that James now WAS Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked to Laurens home, she asked Kim, \"So Kim\u2026 did you use the ring at all today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's eyes went wide but she wiped her expression clean immediately.  \"A little bit\u2026  Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just curious, you aren't wearing it anymore.

Don't worry about it, let's just hurry home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren nodded, and after a moment of silence, asked, \"So I guess Eric still doesn't know about\u2026 us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit\u2026 that's right.

Let's not talk about Eric ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren noticed how Kim was still sensitive about the subject, and dropped it.  Finally the two managed to get to Lauren's house.  Her parents weren't home, and they hurried straight to her bedroom.  Kim set her bag down and sat on the bed, but was shocked when Lauren practically leaped through the air, pouncing on 'Kim' with a passionate kiss.  This was far more intense than Lauren usually acted around James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of kissing, with Lauren stradling Kim on the bed, they finally came up for air.  Lauren grinned, \"Kim I wanna use the ring.  I've got so many ideas.\"</span></div></div>",

Right now, just bring that cute behind over here and lets have some more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Lauren and 'Kim' met up with Eric and James at school.  Lauren wanted 'Kim' all to herself.  Also Lauren thought it was sad that 'James' (the former Kim but Lauren didn't know that) didn't have anyone.  So the first thing that Lauren did was to swap 'Kim's' feelings for Eric with 'James' feelings for Eric.  Then she had to make it so that Eric wouldn't notice, so she also swapped Kim's and James' bodies although not their genitals.  Lauren was a lesbian now and she didn't know how her relationship would last if her girlfriend became complete a man.  Then to make sure that Eric wouldn't notice anything, Lauren swapped James' name with Kim as well of her as athletic abilities.  Lauren thought that her girlfriend spent too much time playing that silly game (volleyball) and that if the new 'Kim' from her perspective playing it instead of her girlfriend there would be more time for being together.  Lauren didn't swap Kim's outgoing nature though.  Lauren wanted the person she loved to be the same outgoing person that she had fallen in love with.  James who had his name and most of his body returned to him was oblivious of the changes that Lauren had made.  James was now the outgoing social butterfly that Kim had been although he was returned to his own body except he had Kim's kitty which Lauren loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren thought that this would work for everyone.  She didn't realize that it was doomed to failure when Eric realized that his girlfriend Kim now had a penis.

What's wrong with being you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, you're just so... beautiful to me?  I love how confident and sexy you are, and you're so tall compared to me.  I wanna know what it's like.  Aren't you curious what it's like to be me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little I guess... but if you're unhappy with who you are, I don't think this is going to solve anything.\"  Kim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren sighed, \"It's just for tonight sweetie, you can switch us back to normal afterwards.  If you want...  Or we could see how long we last in eachother's shoes huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know about that, we'll start with just tonight, and see how that goes.\"  Kim said with a giggle, kissing Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe focused on the power of the ring, and swapped everything physical with Lauren, from her body to her clothes, and even her hairstyle and makeup.  Soon Kim began to shrink down in size, as she lost muscle tone and became more petite, with her skin getting a shade tanner as she turned Asian, and her face became just like Lauren's.  Her breasts became smaller, and her hair darkened to jet black and perfectly straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying next to her was Lauren who was going through the opposite changes, and began growing taller and filling out her curves, and her hair growing blonde and wavy.  Her skin paled slightly as she became Caucasian like Kim.  Before long, the two girls were now eachother, and Lauren was now on top as the stronger of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim lay there helplessly as her now more athletic girlfriend straddled her hips on the bed, playing with her small nipples.  Kim got to experience what it was like to orgasm in Lauren's body, finding that her smaller breasts were more sensitive, and she loved the way Lauren touched her since she knew exactly how to pleasure her own body.  Kim had to hold back screams of pleasure from the new experience of sex in a new body.  Of course this was much more of a new body to James than it was to Kim, but since James now had all of Kim's memories of being female, it wasn't such a different experience for 'Kim' than it would have been if she had still been James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter both girls were sufficiently pleasured, they lay there cuddling the rest of the night.  Kim being the smaller of the two now, rather enjoyed feeling Lauren's arms around her as they spooned together until they were nearly about to fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

She let her blonde hair out from its ponytail, letting it cascade down. \"It's not going anywhere, we have all the time to use it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren pouted, with Kim smiling back before leaning in and kissing her again. The two began feeling up each other up, Kim enjoying all the new sensations her body was giving her. One thing led to another, and soon their clothes were on the ground. This was however, about as much as Kim led, as none of Kim's old memories had anything the sort about sexual encounters with another female and James was of course, formerly a man. Of course, with Lauren unaware that she was supposed to be dating James as a male, she had remembered all of her previous sexual experiences with Kim. Lauren then went down onto Kim, soon giving 'Kim's first' orgasm ever. Kim returned the favor   right after, and though she was a bit more sloppy than usual to Lauren, she still satisfied Lauren enough. Their lovemaking continued on for a bit, before both were exhausted and had their sexual desires fulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laid on the bed cuddling for a bit, with Kim thinking about how great that was. It was definitely different compared to a guy, which was a memory that she hadn't thought of swapping in the morning. As she thought about the differences in the experience, Lauren brought back the subject of the ring again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we had used the ring earlier, I wonder how different that would have been...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim giggled at the irony of what Lauren just said. \"I'd imagine it'll still be great, especially with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled back, and cuddled closer to Kim. </span></div></div>",

Before all of this of course, Kim had been James originally, but he had acquired Kim's body and stolen her identity.  In addition to this, he didn't realize but he'd also gained memories of having a female body his whole life, which is why this whole situation now didn't seem all that odd to him at all.  Sure the new Kim was turned on by seeing 'her' girlfriend's nude body, but seeing her own breasts was something she saw every day, though that never got old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lauren spoke up, \"I don't want to lose you Kim\u2026 I really love you, you know that?  Is there any way that ring can change things for the better?  Why don't you just get rid of those feelings you have for Eric?  Make it so we don't have to hide our feelings anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lauren\u2026 if only it were so easy.  You see, for some reason Eric is immune to the effects of this ring.  I can't use it to change his relationship with me, because he sees through any change I make, and I can't change him at all!\"  Kim explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lauren was determined, she sat up and faced Kim, with her perky breasts bare for her girlfriend to see.  Lauren was not modest in any way, after their lovemaking, the two had nothing to hide from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can get rid of your feelings for Eric can't you?  You can change yourself!  Then break up with him and tell him you're a lesbian!  You don't even need to use the ring on him.  Just good old fashioned feminine charms.\"  Lauren said, excited that she had such good plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim smiled, \"That could work, but\u2026 it would mean hurting Eric, and I don't want to do that.  Even if I got rid of my feelings for him, I don't want to do so knowing that I'll hurt him afterwards.  The only real way I can think of fixing this situation is if I become someone else.  Would you still love me if I became a different person?  A girl Eric has no interest in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked confused, \"A different person?  Why?  You're perfect how you are though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because then I could change things to be just right for us.  We'd have no more jealous boyfriend to get in our way.  I can change other guys, just not Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\u2026 you'd be giving up your entire identity!  And you'd have to steal someone else's too!\"  Lauren pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim sighed and flopped back on the bed, her large breasts falling to either side of her body.  She then looked up and grinned at her girlfriend, \"Well then the final option is, we use the ring to spice things up and go for round two in bed?\"</span></div></div>",

Kim was really James, her boyfriend, but her mind had already been altered to believe she was in love with Kim, and she had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Kim, let's say you got a whole new identity, what would you do with your old life?\"  Lauren asked, admiring Kim's nude body on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd let her stay in love with Eric and he'd never suspect a thing.  There would be a new Kim, and she'd be just like me, but completely devoted to Eric.

Oh but think of the possibilities, you could pick the hottest girl in school, omigod\u2026\"  Lauren began to daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, James had so much of Kim's female personality, that it seemed perfectly normal for her to stay a girl when choosing a new identity.

But first, she needed to change out of her current clothes.  She drove home and switched into a new outfit so Eric wouldn't suspect that she stayed over with Lauren last night.  She put on a pair of short shorts and running shoes, as well as a purple tank top.  She tied her blonde hair back up into a ponytail the way she liked it, and then headed off to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the TSAR safely in her bag, Kim met up with Eric and James, who arrived at school just before she did.  Eric greeted her with a quick peck on the cheek, and she smiled in return.  She still did have some of Kim's original feelings for Eric, but at this point she knew they were not her own feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'morning sweetie, how are you both today?\" Kim asked Eric and James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shrugged, \"I'm doing ok, just another normal day at school you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric raised an eyebrow however, \"A little too normal if you ask me.  I'm surprised you haven't been using\u2026 you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Using-?\" James started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim interrupted however, \"I thought you told him not to use that around the two of us?  Maybe you should be happy that he's actually respecting our personal space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed, \"Yeah I'm sorry, I am just surprised honestly.  James has been acting a bit too\u2026 'normal' since yesterday.  After what I saw that one day\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric relax I don't even-\" James said, as he was once again interrupted, the first bell rang, meaning they had to get to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I gotta get to class guys.  Eric maybe we can do something later?\" Kim said, and hurried off before he could respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well that was close, James almost gave the whole thing away.  I need to make sure James doesn't blab\u2026  I need to go back to being a guy\u2026 Ugh\u2026</i>  Kim thought to herself, as she imagined how weird it would be to become a guy.  It was the only way she could make sure James didn't spill the beans, was by becoming James.  Yes she was once James originally, but currently that all seemed like another life to her.  She had no actual memories of having that body, but she knew it was still true\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen James and Eric parted ways to go to class, Kim hurried after James, and decided it was time to use the TSAR.  As soon as they rounded a corner where there weren't many students, she focused on reversing the swaps she had made.

The first thing was to swap their appearances.  Kim felt her familiar female body shifting and melting away as it reshaped itself into James's male body.  After her clothes morphed into his, she still felt like she was a girl in a guy's body.  She decided to swap sense of gender and name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that was over, James looked down at himself and felt relieved.  He was sure this was how he used to feel when looking at himself.  After spending the last few days in Kim's body, it was strange to have a lack of breasts and long hair and a curvy body.  Even though he'd swapped his gender back, he still felt like he enjoyed having a female body.  He wasn't sure what it was, but perhaps something of Kim's personality was still in his head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, James decided to catch up to Kim and make sure she was acting normally.  \"Hey Kim!  What are you gonna be doing after class today?  You still going on that date with Eric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked at him blankly, \"Eric?  Why would I want to date him?\"  then she laughed, \"Oh you're pulling my leg aren't you?  Come on James you know I'm just friends with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s when James remembered, HE still had an attraction to Eric, believing that Eric was HIS boyfriend.  He made sure to swap that next, returning Kim's love for Eric to her.  He also swapped back all of Kim's family and friends relationships back to her, reclaiming his own.  A second later she shook her head and looked dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm just kidding\u2026 Yeah I always have plenty of time to see Eric, why?\"  Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't you have lots of after school clubs to go to, like volleyball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Kim was confused, \"Um\u2026 I don't know, I'm not on the girls' volleyball team like you are.  How you got them to accept a guy, I have no idea, but good job!  I'm sure you love being on a team with cute girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oops, another thing I forgot to switch back\u2026</i>  James thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another activation of the ring, he swapped all of Kim's hobbies and social status and her position in school.  The last thing he remembered to swap was Lauren's relationship with him, to make sure she wasn't still attracted to KIM.  He was sure that was everything he'd swapped in the first place, and everything SHOULD be back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked like she had a bit of a headache, \"Yeah um\u2026 I don't know anymore.  Tell Eric I'm not sure if we'll be hanging out today, I am SOO swamped with school stuff.  Anyways I really gotta get to class now see ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames watched as Kim hurried off to class, seemingly unaware of anything being different than before.  As far as she was concerned, she was just going about her life as though the past few days hadn't even happened.</span></div></div>",

He remembered living the past few days as Kim, and the time he spent with Lauren as two girls in love.  He couldn't get the memories out of his head as he tried and failed to focus on his school work.  Everything just seemed so trivial now that he had such incredible power.  If he wanted to, he imagined he could just give himself all of the knowledge that the teachers in his school had, meaning he would never even NEED to go to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now he was resigned to laying low, and resisting the urge to get out of control with the power of the ring.  In third period, he had a Math test which he had not studied for, since he'd been so busy living Kim's life he'd completely forgotten about it.  He decided to simply wing it, and guess on the answers he couldn't figure out.  Since he'd mostly guessed, he ended up finishing the test early, but stayed at his seat and waited for the end of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he waited, he found himself sneaking glances at the various cute girls in his class.  It wasn't because of his typical male tendencies to check out girls.  Rather, he was sizing them all up, comparing their strengths and weaknesses as people.  One girl was cute, but rather brainless, while another was quite the genius, but had nothing going for her in the looks department.  He realized he'd already convinced himself that if he wanted a new life, it would be as a girl, and he wanted to find the best possible option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of these mental notes taken, he hurriedly turned in his test at the bell and rushed down to the courtyard at his usual spot.  Lauren was waiting there for him, sitting alone on a bench next to the fountain where she liked to eat her lunch.  She smiled and waved him over when she saw him approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey James!  How was your test?\"  Lauren asked, making friendly small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shrugged, \"Meh it sucked.  With all the excitement lately I'd forgotten to study completely, but whatever, it's really not important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not important but-\"  Lauren started, and then realized, \"Oh\u2026 I see you're wearing the ring in public again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nervously twisted the ring around his finger, \"Yeah\u2026  I set everything back to normal this morning.  At least I think I did..  I just wanted a clean slate before we started our plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Plan?  What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, what we talked about last night?  We\u2026 or at least I\u2026 could get a brand new life.\"  James explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked confused for a second, as she sifted through her jumbled memories.  Finally she remembered this conversation she had last night, which in her memories was now James she had the conversation with, rather than Kim.  She looked at him strangely, not sure why he was so set on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026 why?  Why do you want a new life?  What's wrong with our current ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026We could start over as different people.  I've been thinking about it a lot.  You don't have to change yourself, if you don't want, cause I love you the way you are.  But for me\u2026  This is the chance of a lifetime.  I could be anyone.  And you yourself agreed that it was a good plan\u2026\"  James explained.</span></div></div>",

She had seen James' boobs many times before it was no big deal. But she did wish that he wore a bra like women who had breasts did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames quickly caught up with Audrey. \"Let me go,\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on up there,\" they heard their mom say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing.\" said James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was saying you two looked like fags with Eric staring at your tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that the real problem passed, James retorted, \"You had better say you're sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames held Audrey in place. She couldn't get loose from her big brother. Resigned she said, \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames let her go and then Audrey bolted from his arms and called him a fag again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, why not stay for dinner. I'll fix things later.\" James told his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric knew he couldn't force James to do anything. So he agreed. The two came down to dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames went into the kitchen. He wanted to see if his mom found it 'odd' that she didn't have breasts anymore. He suspected that she hadn't. She sounded normal when she called up a moment before. \"Mom,\" he said when he saw her, \"Eric is going to stay for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he call his mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, but he'll do it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she says it's OK, its fine with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout this entire conversation James didn't notice anything wrong with his mom. She clearly saw him and his breasts but she seemed perfectly normal. \"Thanks mom,\" James said. \"I'll tell him.\" Then James thought, if I'm going to have Mom's tits and other things, I probably should be wearing her underwear too. In a moment his boobs were now being supported by a bra. He was also wearing his mom's panties which he couldn't possibly know matched the bra he was now wearing. James returned to the dining room where Eric was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I don't know why she's so worried about me, I'm old enough to vote for fu- for crying out loud\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather, James's mom, patted Eric on the shoulder.  \"She's just being a mom honey.  She worries for your safety of course.  My mom didn't stop worrying about me until I was married to James's father, and even then she still calls wondering what I'm up to.  Moms never stop being moms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded, \"I guess you're right\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he noticed the same thing James had noticed.  Heather was completely flat chested, and her blouse was completely flat, as though it was designed to fit a boy's chest rather than a woman with a large bust.  Perhaps James's swap affected more than just their bodies?  No one in the room seemed to notice the changes though, so he guessed James had succeeded in making his little sister unaware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he saw James.  James sat at the table, putting food on his plate, and under his shirt, Eric spotted a white bra strap poking out.  James's breasts seemed to be pushed up and out more now that they had support, and this made them even MORE obvious than before.  His t-shirt had also been resized to accommodate the large bust size James now had, and was no longer straining at the seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sat next to his friend and whispered to him, \"A bra?  Really?!  Aren't you taking this a little too far James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needed support!  These things are heavy and I was tired of them bouncing around!\"  James whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were supposed to put them back\u2026\"  Eric said, before finally paying attention to the meal Mrs. Barrett had prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen James's dad got home just in time for dinner.  They heard the garage door, and knew exactly who it was.  James knew it wouldn't be his brother.  His brother was always working at this hour.  At first, James didn't think anything of it, until Eric smacked him on the shoulder.  James's breasts swayed to the side a bit, even in their new bra, and he realized what Eric was trying to warn him about when he looked down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick, his father, entered the house, James made sure his father was unaware of his current boob situation.  As far as Nick knew, his son always had large breasts, though that didn\u2019t mean he had to be proud of the fact\u2026  He took one look at James and his very prominent bust, and shook his head before sitting down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Eric, I didn't know you'd be here tonight.  You two having a sleepover or something like when you were younger?\"  Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames rolled his eyes, \"Dad we're way too old for that now\u2026 he's just here for dinner and then he's gotta go.  You know how is mom is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I don't think I'm comfortable with you sleeping in the same room as my son anyways, especially now that he's gone through his 'growth spurt'.\"  Nick said with air quotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was unsure what he was referring to, but he noticed his mom giving his dad the evil eye.  \"Nick\u2026 give James a break it's not his fault, you know it's just his genetics!  At least he finally agreed to start wearing bras!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he certainly didn't get them from you or me!\"  Nick said.  \"It's not like Jordan turned out like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick not at the table, just eat\u2026\"  Heather glared at her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, James was conflicted between holding back the laughter of watching this whole situation play out, or being annoyed that he was once again compared to Jordan, his brother the golden boy who could do no wrong.</span></div></div>",

He could have done it with his mom, but she stood up for him and Audrey deserved it anyway.  Soon, Nick was wearing a tunic that dropped to his thighs and then flared out a bit like a skirt in a light red color.  He also wore matching leggings and Audreys' bright pink tennis shoes.  He wore no socks at all.  Through his tight fitting tunic, James could see the outline of a bra.  On his lips James could see the remnants of lip gloss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was now wearing her dad's business suit, except for the jacket which was draped over the back of her chair.  For the first time in her life she wore a tie around her neck.  On her feet was black men's shoes and socks.  Neither Audrey nor Nick noticed the change.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James was still a bit annoyed by what his father had said, and didn't think the clothing change was doing enough to teach him a lesson.  He also was finding it amusing how much Eric was opposed to this, and once the power started getting to his head, James knew he wanted to see just how far he could go before Eric lost it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe focused on another swap as dinner was ending.  His father's short hair suddenly sprouted out of his head, growing in length until it was past his shoulders.  It turned a light auburn color, and quickly styled into the same manner that Audrey usually wore her hair.  Nick flicked his head and his bangs fell back into place, as if he'd been wearing hair like this his whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Audrey's hair was sucked into her head and she had the short, dark brown hair of her father, neatly cut and groomed.  She looked almost like a young boy dressing up as a business man, since she had no makeup or long hair to distinguish that she was female.  Of course she still had her same feminine face as before, but the casual observer might make the mistake\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas Nick was now dressed in the same clothing and hairstyle as his 13 year old daughter, thinking nothing was strange.  He stood up from the table straightening out his red tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well honey that was a great meal, thank you.  And good to see you again Eric, but I need to go get changed out of my work clothes.\"  James's father said as he hurried upstairs in his daughter's pink tennis shoes which were sized to fit his feet.  His new auburn hair fluttering behind him as he hurried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shook his head, \"Seriously, the morning?  You've gotta change them back dude\u2026  What is this going to accomplish?  He's not even aware of what happened so it isn't like you can teach him a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames ignored him for a second, \"Thanks for the dinner mom.\"  And then he left the table and took Eric aside to talk alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was once again reminded of the large breasts he now carried on his chest, which he had nearly forgotten about.  He straightened his new bra, finding it annoying how it still didn't quite fit perfectly, even after being resized to his body.  The underwire was pinching a bit, and he couldn't wait to take it off in the privacy of his room later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eric and James were finally alone in the living room, Eric stopped him, \"Dude are you even listening to me?  You're going too far.  What will this accomplish?  Are you going to go around convincing everyone you meet that you have tits?  Are you going to change every one of your father's coworkers so they think it's normal for him to wear girl clothes to work?  And what about your sister?  She didn't even do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Eric, jeez you're taking this way too seriously.  I told you I'll swap everyone back in the morning at the latest.  I just\u2026 I am so tired of my dad finding any excuse to talk about how my brother is so much better than I am.\"  James said frustratedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't exactly make it hard for him to immascualte you.  You have tits on your chest\u2026  And besides, he's not going to learn a lesson if he has no idea it's happening.\"  Eric pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're right\u2026 I don't know it's just fun I guess.  I'd let you try out my mom's tits but it still doesn't seem to work on you, I tried again.  They're really fun, just touch 'em.\"  James said pushing his chest out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's fucking weird!\"  Eric said, as Audrey walked past rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fags\u2026\"  She said as she headed up to her room wearing a business suit and short hair.</span></div></div>",

He laid on his bed to plot his revenge.  He then realized that the bra he was wearing sort of itched and decided to take it off.  He pulled off his shirt and then managed to undo the hooks and let his 'girls' free.  Seeing them on his chest for the first time he decided to explore them.  Messaging them felt so good.  He was so busy that he forgot all about Audrey.  Soon he realized that he didn't just have breasts he also had something new down below that he wanted to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoincidentally his mother passed by his door which he had left ajar.  She saw what he was doing.  She was going to break into the room and tell him to stop but then she thought better of it.  She decided to tell Nick and have him talk with the boy.  Nick had just gotten out of his leggings and was about to put on a pretty nightshirt with kittens on it.  His tunic was left on a chair.  Heather was going to chastise Nick for not putting the tunic into the hamper but that could wait.  She wanted to talk to him about what James was doing.  Nick reassured her, as he had many times before, that boys his age did this type of thing all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe your right, but could you at least talk to him about keeping his door closed.  Audrey could see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll talk to him tomorrow.\"  Heather then also got ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As James discovered what it was like for his mother to have an orgasm, he had forgotten to close the door all the way.  He was much too far along in fingering his new vagina to care, and when he saw his mother walk past the door, it gave him a sense of excitement knowing that she had no idea how wrong this was.  Quickly he was brought to climax and lay on his bed panting and sweating, with his large breasts falling to either side of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit that was amazing\u2026  I've never felt anything like that with a penis, even after sex with Lauren.  Girls have it awesome!\"  James muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in a particularly good mood now, and continued playing with his nipples and squeezing his breasts as he wondered what to do next.  The night was still young, but he was exhausted from his first female orgasm.  That was when he was reminded of his sister, \"fags\" she had said to Eric and him.  He thought it was hilarious how she was all dressed up like a boy in a suit, but it wasn't enough punishment for her.  A wicked grin flashed across his face as he thought of making a swap that she would be completely aware of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey sat in her room wearing nothing but a pair of boxer shorts.  She had taken off the suit and neatly hung it up in her closet.  She was sitting at her computer reading Facebook, and noticed that a lot of her pictures she was wearing what looked like her dad's clothes.  In fact, they were her own of course, but James had altered her entire wardrobe to be her father's.  This didn't change reality however, and all her old pictures she was wearing girly clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh weird\u2026 Why would I be dressed like that?\"  Audrey wondered as she browsed through her friends pictures that included her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly that\u2019s when Audrey felt a tingling between her legs.  At first she thought it was her period acting up, since she was young and had only been getting periods a short time.  But this was nothing like that.  In a few short seconds, her groin grew more and more uncomfortable as she was forced to spread her legs apart.  As soon as she felt what was going on, she let out a blood curdling scream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god oh my god oh my god!  What the fuck?!\"  Audrey yelled as she felt a penis and balls growing where her vagina used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever tiny A cup breasts she had, had also completely vanished, being replaced by flabby male pecs.  Of course she had no way of knowing this, but she had just given her girl parts to her father, and received his male parts in return.  She was just freaking out over a mysterious dick appearing between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather and Nick heard the scream and rushed to see what was the matter.  When they saw their daughter looking into her boxer shorts with a horrified expression, Nick rolled his eyes. \"You got this Heather?  If I have to talk to James tomorrow, I'll let you handle this one.\"  And Nick walked back to their bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's mother carefully approached and sat down on her bed across from her.  \"Audrey are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no mommy, I\u2026 there's a penis\u2026\"  Audrey started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh\u2026 It's perfectly natural for a girl your age.  I got my first erection around your age too, it's fine.\"  Heather said, running her fingers through Aubrey's short brown hair.  \"Your body is just growing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, James could hear what was going on through the door, and he was trying so hard to stifle laughter.  He knew that this was going to drive Audrey insane if he left her like this, but he wasn't that cruel.  He figured after that scream she'd learned her lesson.  But did he want to leave her like this until morning?  Or maybe it was a good idea to just put things back to normal before he falls asleep\u2026</span></div></div>",

He was going to swap this for that but then decided it would be fun to swap a bunch of stuff with just one person.  No one on the train would be aware of these swaps, except the victim who wouldn't know exactly what was wrong but would sense something amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around he found two women, friends obviously who were talking.  You decided to make one of them your victim the other wouldn't notice any changes at all with her friend.  The couple were both in their twenties and were chatting away like they didn't have a care in the world.  You swapped one of the woman's long chestnut hair with the hair of a balding man who was only left the typical white horseshoe shaped tuft of hair that older men typically have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie was listening to her friend, Charlotte say something when she felt something wrong.  \"Char, do you see anything different about me?\" Lizzie said with her newly bald head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Charlotte said concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know something doesn't feel right, I can't put my finger on it.\"  What didn't feel right was that she no longer felt her hair on her shoulders or on her forehead where her bangs used to be.  But even though it felt different she couldn't place what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look fine to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie was looking down at herself.  Then she reached into her purse to pull out a compact.  Looking at her face and her bald scalp she couldn't tell what was wrong but it just didn't feel right.  \"I guess you are right.  I had this strangest feeling that something was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  We all have that feeling sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this time, that you gave Lizzie the hips and butt of the fattest man in the train.  Her butt got both bigger and flatter, her hips jutted out farther from her waist than before, but lost its curved shape.  She had to adjust her sitting position to make room for herself.  Even though her skirt didn't change style it did grow bigger to accommodate her new butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it happened again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know something strange.

Are you sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte reached her hand to feel Lizzie's head, she touched in the area where Lizzie's bangs should have been..  \"You don't seem to have a fever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is good, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where exactly do you feel different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Something has changed.  I don't know where.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is wrong.  You are the second pretties woman in the train...Next to me of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie smiled at the joke, but her teeth were different now.  Her teeth had been replaced with the baby teeth of a young girl including missing her front two teeth.  \"Oh, you think your are the prettiest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am.  But we aren't talking about me.  We are talking about you.  Let's check you from head to toe and see if there is anything wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hair?\" Lizzie had the typical male patterned baldness of an older man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Fine,\" Lizzie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  They continued down Lizzie's body not finding anything wrong with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to Lizzie's breasts, they found nothing wrong with that, even though her formerly modest B-cup breasts had been replaced with the breasts of the woman who had the largest breasts in the train.  They were over an F-cup now and were sagging a bit due to their age.  Neither Lizzie nor Charlotte recognized any change in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, under Lizzie's shirt in her panties her vagina was gone replaced with the largest penis of all the men who were in the train.  Soon they were finished with the physical inventory and neither had noticed that Lizzie who had been five foot five when she took a seat in the train was now only four foot eleven and was the shortest woman in the train.  True there were children who were shorter, but of all the adults, Charlotte was now the shortest, although she did have the biggest feet and wore the highest heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now that that is done.  We can talk about something else.  You are perfectly fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you are right,\" Lizzie said although she didn't say it from the seat next to Charlotte, she now said it while being strapped into a stroller that Charlotte held onto to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a stroke of inspiration Charlotte asked Lizzie, \"Are you wet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better make sure.\"  Charlotte then slipped two fingers under Lizzie's skirt into her diaper and felt around.  She inadvertently touched Lizzie's penis.  \"No, you are as dry as a bone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't hurt to check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all at once, Lizzie realized all the changes that had been made to her.  From her bald head, to her massive breasts, the penis in her now damp diapers and her short stature in the large stroller she was sitting in.  She started to say something, but only baby babble came out of her mouth.  That is all she could say besides a few words one of which was 'Mama'.  She started to babble excitedly.  But no one could understand her.  Charlotte took out a pacifier and put it into Lizzie's mouth.  This quieted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man who was sitting next to Charlotte said, \"They are awfully cute when they are small like that.  How old is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is twenty four.\"  Charlotte meant twenty four years-old and the man knew that is what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wonderful age, in no time she'll be walking and talking all by herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is well on her way, you should see her toddle in her heels at home.\"  Charlotte could remember how Lizzie in high heels would use the furniture to get up off her hands and knees and take a few steps either to the next piece of furniture or to fall down on her big flat butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is quite a handful actually.  You have to always watch her.  But at night when she is in my bed and her penis is hard as a rock and she is inside of me, that makes it all worthwhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know she is such a good girl that she never cums before I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte's fog had totally lifted and even though she couldn't say anything because of the pacifier in her mouth she understood everything that Charlotte was saying and she knew it was true.  She started to cry.  Charlotte lifted Lizzie out of her stroller and cuddled and rocked her until Lizzie feel asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames enjoyed the show.  By the time it was done, the train had reached the stadium and James got out.</span></div></div>",

But Eric quickly gave him a disapproving glance and James shrugged, putting his hands down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured he would teach Eric what was so fun about having breasts, and once again tried to use the TSAR on Eric.  This time however, he tried giving Eric Audrey's breasts and vagina.  After a few moments of concentrating, however, he noticed nothing happening.  James got more and more annoyed, and focused so hard on swapping Audrey, that he once again accidentally swapped himself.  This time he didn't even realize it, but his breasts had shrunk down several sizes to Audrey's small growing boobs.  His vagina also grew tight and young, unlike his mother's was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was the first one to notice that the large breasts on James' chest were deflating, nearly going away entirely.  James was left with Audrey's measly A cups, growing into B's.  But with James' loose shirt over them, they could easily be confused with flabby male pecs.  Eric believed that James had finally reversed the swap, despite the fact that James was still very much female between the legs, and had pubescent breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About damn time, stop messing with that thing, it's dangerous!\"  Eric scolded his friend, thinking that everything was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked confused however, he wasn't trying to swap back to normal, and Eric clearly looked unchanged.  He could still feel between his legs that he had no cock or balls, but he soon noticed that his breasts were gone.  He patted his chest and realized they weren't gone, just smaller and less noticeable.  They were still more sensitive than normal, and he tried to hide a brief smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... yeah sorry.  I'm done messing with it for now, figured I'd go back to being me, you know?\"  James bluffed, as he nervously crossed his legs, trying to hide a lack of bulge.  He wondered if Eric would even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Audrey's breasts had gone up several sizes as she now had her mother's chest and vagina.  She seemed blissfully unaware however, as the TSAR apparently made her comfortable with the change, the same way James seemed comfortable having Audrey's parts.  If someone pointed it out to her, she might find it odd, but just explain it away as a sudden growth spurt.</span></div></div>",

She then slammed the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames meanwhile immediately stood in front of the mirror when Eric had gone. He took his shirt off and inspected his tiny breasts, they were definitely Audrey's alright, and were still developing. They were sensitive however, and James liked the way they felt. He figured Audrey wouldn't mind being the bustiest girl in her class at school, even if she were somehow aware her changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the new vagina James had nestled between his legs. It was much tighter than his mother's had been, which made sense. And it had recently gone through puberty. He was actually feeling really horny, he reached down and didn't feel the least bit guilty as he slipped one of his fingers into his 13-year old pussy. He just moaned in pleasure when he made contact with his clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, he was wondering why he hadn't swapped with Audrey first instead of his mom.

While pretty much everything else in her room she had thought was too girly or childish for her, she felt a sense of... attraction to her own reflection. Audrey pushed up her large breasts, watching herself with a feeling she had never felt towards herself or her own body. She now loved the feeling of breasts in her hands as she massaged them, and wished that she would be able to feel another girl. Removing her own top and bra, Audrey felt herself getting wet just looking at her own breasts. In the back of her mind, she wondered why she never felt this way before, but with the effects of TSAR, she just passed it off as part of puberty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of playing around with her own breasts, Audrey took off her skirt as well, and began to masturbate. At 13, she had only done it a few times, but with her new teenage boy interests and preferences she felt a stronger need for sexual release. As she continued, she began imagining doing it with several other girls, though for whatever reason the one that really stuck with her was Lauren, James girlfriend. Though Audrey had not cared much about Lauren before (due to Lauren being James girlfriend), she now felt a lot of attraction to her. Sticking a finger into her own vagina, Audrey imagined she was sticking it into Lauren. And soon after, she climaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to it, her boyfriend bill was asking about sex earlier. While Bill did look kinda like a milf, he was lacking in what Audrey found attractive now. And the fact that he had a penis as well, just made Audrey uneasy. She was definitely going to break up with him the next chance she got, she did not want to go through with that relationship anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting off her bed, Audrey looked at the pink shirt she was wearing just before. She simply had no idea what compelled her to wear it before, its far too girly. Plus, it didn't even show any cleavage, so she couldn't even see her breasts without taking it off anyways. Looking into her closet, she again disliked how pink it was. And all of the underwear was too much of girl's underwear, nothing really sexy enough in her eyes either. Even with her new preferences however, she knew she had to wear these to be acceptable even if she didn't like it. In the end, she went with a white button up shirt with a lot of cleavage showing and a short plaid skirt. Audrey wasn't that comfortable wearing these items but she enjoyed looking at her reflection with them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with the night still young, Audrey once again grew bored of what she could do in her own room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted to put on his jeans too, but they were just too big for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around James' room she felt at home.  It was a painted soothing light blue color.  There was a desk where James usually did he homework which was a bit cluttered but what she really liked about it was the picture of Lauren he kept there.  Before Audrey had to imagine what Lauren looked like, now she could see her in the flesh.  It was a full body shot where Audrey could see her long legs in short shorts.  Even though Lauren was a short girl she had great legs.  Audrey had come into James room to play some of his video games, but seeing Lauren in the picture got her hot again.  She wished she had a girlfriend like James did.  For a moment there she envied her brother.  Audrey put her hand down her skirt and started to rub herself.  She used her other hand which still contained her panties to rub her breasts.  By the time she had relieved herself, James' briefs were sopping wet.

But I appreciate it.\" Audrey thought that James had a reason why he was being nice.  He probably wanted something, but she didn't care, she was in the middle of a game and she wanted to finish.  James did have an ulterior motive.  He had Audrey's pussy and her breasts, he wondered how it would feel to wear her bra and panties.  He didn't realize that he had lost most of his interests in playing with genitals.  He was curious as a thirteen year old girl, but also sort of shy about it was Audrey had been.  Maybe shy wasn't the right word, but he didn't think it was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got into Audrey's room, James looked through her drawers.  He was going to pick up the first bra and pantie that he saw, but once he saw them, he realized that he had to select a pair that matched.  He thought it was best for his lingerie to be coordinated.  It took James a few minutes to pick the right set.  The set he picked wasn't the sexiest pair, it was the pair that Audrey really liked.  He had to get undressed and dresses quickly because he didn't want anyone to see him naked wearing the panties in Audrey's room.  But soon he was wearing them and they felt good.  He actually enjoyed the knowledge that he was wearing such a cute set, even though he knew no one could see them.  He didn't even get a sexual thrill.  When he looked at himself in the mirror he thought that the bra made his boobs look prettier.  He admired his look and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he did was find Audrey's diary and started to read it.  But he didn't laugh at the entries, he felt for them.  He understood the pain and laughed with the problems of a teenaged girl.  But like with the lingerie he didn't want to get caught with the diary.  It was private and he had developed the sensitivity of a young girl who would be mortified if anyone was reading their diary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames turned on some music that Audrey liked and started to listen to it.  He simply enjoyed the music without considering whether he should like it or not.  A little while later, Heather knocked on the door and then let herself in.  \"I wanted to talk about what just happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mom,\" James tried to explain.  \"I didn't mean it.  I don't know what got over me.  Maybe it was the movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more discussion, James and Heather reached an understanding.  Heather wouldn't tell Nick.  Heather left the room without asking why James was in Audrey's room.  James started to think about it.  Why was he in Audrey's room.  He didn't feel like he remembered he should feel.  Then it hit him.  He must have swapped something with Audrey.  But what was it exactly?  James wasn't quite sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He loved his wardrobe and little makeup table for learning how to apply makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this definitely seems back to normal!  Of course this is all my stuff, I can't believe I swapped that on accident, oops!\"  James laughed.  \"I'll have to be more careful in the future or I might have never realized my mistake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext James stood up off the bed, realizing that he was wearing his sister's jeans and t-shirt over his bra and panties!  \"Oh god, I can't believe I tricked myself into cross-dressing, ew...\"  He said as he quickly stripped the boy's clothing off and walked over to 'his' closet to find a new outfit for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought, James picked out a comfortable, yet feminine outfit and laid it on the bed to start getting dressed in.  A pair of shorts and a soft cotton v-neck shirt that would expose a tiny amount of budding cleavage.  But when he tried fitting into the outfit, he noticed everything was several sizes too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?  I could have sworn all of this fit the other day... am I getting fat?  I know I would remember if I changed the size of all my clothing...\"  James mumbled to himself, feeling annoyed now.</span></div></div>",

Soon he discovered that the jeans and shirt he was wearing became unbearably tight.  The t-shirt stretched until it looked silly on him.  But his pants became so tight he couldn't get them off.  He finally found a scissor and cut them.  He didn't know it, but it was a good thing that he didn't have a penis or it would have hurt more than he could possibly imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got out of his jeans, he put on the shorts and v-neck shirt.  He liked how he could see the bra straps peeking out on his shoulders. He had never realized before that the bra one was wearing was as much of a fashion statement as the top that one wears over it.  When he looks at his new wardrobe he doesn't see them as just shirts anymore, they are tops, blouses, polos and tanks.  Bras and panties are not just underwear now, they are as important to his wardrobe as the dress he wears over them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was laying on his bed reading one of the books that Audrey had read many times before, but he was reading it for the first time (and enjoying it) when Eric arrives at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

When James had went down the stairs, he found Eric visibly displeased. Eric also cringed at the sight of James wearing what looked to be his sister's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, we need to talk.\" Eric said to James, then looking at the boy who acted like James mother. \"Privately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, let's go to my room.\" James replied, leading Eric to what was Audrey's room. Before Eric entered, he saw Audrey in what he knew was James room, enjoying herself playing a video game. When James closed the door, Eric began his rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what did I say about thinking twice before using that thing? I knew checking up on you was a good idea!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, most of everything is fine.\" James replied, not realizing how much he screwed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at yourself, look around you! You're dressed like a girl, this isn't your room, I can tell you have no dick, you have what I think are boobs, and your mom looks like some kid! NOTHING is fine about this.\" Eric said angrily. James took a moment to think about what Eric was saying. Well, some of the stuff he did know he did, like swapping his mom with Bill or taking his sister's privates for whatever reason. But the rest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I admit I swapped my mom for fun earlier. But I know for a fact these are my clothes and this is my room. Just look, everything fits me and I like them. If they weren't, won't they not fit me?\" James stated, pointing out the fact that the clothes fit him perfectly. Eric facepalmed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the damn ring affecting you.\" Eric replied angrily. He was angry that his friend had gotten so twisted by the ring. A part of him in fact wanted to simply ditch out of this whole situation altogether. But the good within him won out, and he knew he had to help James get all of this twisted magic fixed. \"Look, I'll help you with fixing this before you go outside making yourself a complete laughing stock. Just promise me you won't use that accursed ring after we're done.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So returning Audrey's vagina and boobs was fine with him.  As for Bill's body, he really liked the boy now, it would be best if he had his body back too.  James used the ring and his boobs melted away and his penis returned.  In return his mom got her body back although she now had her daughter's vagina and boobs.  Bill was completely back to normal.  James thought to himself that \"Bill was back to his own gorgeous self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I am back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are,\" Eric said and smiled.  \"Now take off those ridiculous clothes and let's go back to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my room and these are my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bra too?\"  Eric could see the bra strap on James' shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have any tits anymore why do you need a bra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know anything.

It was a small twin bet with a wooden headboard.  \"It has the my cute hot pink comforter with my peace sign throw pillow.  All my stuffed toys are on it too.  Look there is my pink lion, and my red and pink spotted teddy bear and my stuffed basset hound.\"  You've been my friend forever you know how I love these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gave James a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here in the bookcase there is my plastic organizer for all my needle stuff.

You know that.  OK OK, here is my Diary,\" James took a diary from a drawer by his bed.  \"look through it, it is clearly mine.\"  Eric looked thought the diary.  It was clearly a girl's diary except all the references were changed.  Instead of Audrey it said James thought out.  Instead of feminine pronouns it had masculine pronouns.  Everything was subtly changed to make it seem like it was James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, boys don't write in diaries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they do....OK how about this.\"  James hands Eric his school binder.

James frowned a bit at the mention of Lauren, which Eric took as James simply being stubborn. Of course, Eric still did not know that James had swapped all his interests with Audrey, and was frowning about why he even had a girlfriend right now. As Eric rang up Lauren, James thought about Bill, and how he'd rather be with him instead of Lauren now. But of course, Bill was Audrey's boyfriend... though then again, he did have a swapping ring to fix that. But before he could do anything though, Eric had ended his call with Lauren, turning to James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, she's coming over. Maybe if my words won't convince you how wrong this is, your girlfriend's will.\" Eric said. \"I told her that you have show her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is all mine, I don't know why you don't believe me.\" James replied with a deadpan. \"She'll know it too when she's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked around the pink room, there isn't even anything that he and James shared interests in anymore. No video games, no action movies, no sports. Just fashion and books a young teen girl would enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on man, you're a guy, this stuff isn't what guys are into. Not even Lauren or Kim is this girly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you suddenly can't accept me for what I am suddenly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see soon enough. All of this isn't right.\" Eric replied with a sigh. He wanted his friend back and was hitting himself on the inside for even leaving his friend with such a thing that could do this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long later, the doorbell once again rung at the Barrett household. Heather, back in her own body answered the door for Lauren and shouted to James that Lauren was here. Both James and Eric went to greet Lauren, though James was much less into Lauren now than before. Lauren meanwhile tried to hold in a laugh when she saw James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lauren.\" James greeted. \"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... did he lose a bet?\" Lauren asked Eric, still holding in a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What bet?\" James asked obliviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but he does look ridiculous doesn't he?\" Eric replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... so why the clothes?\" Lauren asked again, now laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, this is what I normally wear.\" James stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Right you do. Anyways, thanks for showing me this, it was funny.\" Lauren said, preparing to leave. Before she was out though, Audrey popped out of her room to see what all the commotion was about. She was now dressed in just a T-shirt and jeans, loose fitting but to the size of her normal body. Upon seeing Lauren about to leave, she had to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Lauren...\" Audrey said shyly, her eyes looking twinkling as she saw her new crush in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm.. hi Audrey.\" Lauren replied. \"Anyways, I told my parents I'll only be out for a little bit, I gotta head back. Cya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lauren left though, James felt a bit insulted by his girlfriend. His fashion was no joke. James knew for certain though Bill would appreciate him for who he was however. And seeing the little twinkle in Audrey's eyes when she had saw Lauren, James decided to make things better for the both of them and swapped their relationships. Now James was dating Bill, and Audrey was dating Lauren. He smiled at the swap, thinking it was probably the best thing he had done with the ring. <i>\"I'm sure everyone is happier with that change too. Eric just can't see how much good can be done with this ring.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door had closed, both James and Eric had returned back to \"James' Room\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Lauren thought what you were wearing was just a joke.\" Eric said to James, hoping that would convince him to switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what she thinks. I know for a fact this is me.\" James stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was flabbergasted. Not even someone on the outside was convincing James how wrong this was. He then decided to go with a last resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh, fine. But if I can't convince you, at least give me the ring for safekeeping so you won't mess anything else up.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wouldn't go shopping for shoes with your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did it say I did in MY DIARY.

He decided to talk to Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering Audrey's room, Eric saw she was playing the latest Call of Duty video game.  \"Hey, I love this game, can I play with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but I didn't know you liked to play with girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two started playing and Eric started asking questions.  \"You like this game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the shit!!\"  My god, Eric thought, he remembered the girlie girl that Audrey had been.

This whole ring thing was driving him nuts, and he felt powerless to do anything about it. All he knew was that it couldn't affect him. After a few minutes, Audrey hung up the call, and looked at Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you acting all crazy tonight?\" Audrey asked, snapping Eric out of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This whole night has been crazy...\" Eric replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep mixing me and James up, you're playing games with me instead of doing whatever you do with James... oh by the way, you kinda suck.\" Audrey listed, before killing the distracted Eric in the game again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrgh.\" Eric was undoubtedly frustrated. This entire family and close ones were getting messed up by James' negligence with this ring AND he was now embarrassingly getting slaughtered by his best friend's formerly girlie little sister in Call of Duty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This time he beat her as he had beaten James many times before.  But when it was done he still didn't know how to set things right.  Both Audrey and James thought that nothing was wrong.  Eric wasn't really sure if he was now friends with Audrey instead of James.  He certainly had more in common with her than him, especially if Audrey was dating Lauren.  For a moment, Eric imagined him on a double date Eric and Kim and with James and Bill.  How would that work?  Eric didn't know what to do, but it was getting late so he thought he should go home and sleep on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile James was concerned that Eric would try to take the TSAR.  It would be best if he hid it.  But if he left it in his house, who knows what might happen to it.  Audrey or his mom may find it.  He thought it best to keep it with him.  But then he realized that even though the 'R' in  TSAR stood for ring, it could look like any type of jewelry.  James put on some cute bracelets and will the TSAR to look like one of them.  If Eric asked, James would say that he put the TSAR away but wouldn't let him have it.  That should satisfy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames interest in 'having fun' with the TSAR had lessened now that he had Audrey's interests.  James looked at himself in the mirror and saw himself in a similar way that Audrey would have.  His hair was too short to be able to use the bows, ribbons and hair clips he had in his room.  He wished his hair was longer.  He could wait for it to grow, but he didn't think he had to wait he could use the TSAR.  It was a small change that didn't matter much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames also thought his clothes would fit better and look better on him if he had some breasts.  He didn't want huge breasts like he wanted before, but modest B or C cup breasts to make his tops look better, especially those with lower necklines.  Finally, he didn't like his hairy legs.  If he could find some legs that he didn't have to shave so much and were a bit more shapely, they would look better in the skirts and dresses he sometimes wore.  James decided that tomorrow he would swap with a few people.  He didn't want to make major changes, but these little things would help.  If he was modest, Eric wouldn't fault him for using the TSAR.  After all how could Eric fault him for not using the TSAR now that he had it.  If he did, it was just because Eric was Jealous that the TSAR didn't work on him.</span></div></div>",

With Audrey's interests, James actually had proper sleep last night and even woke up earlier than usual. That was of course so that he'd have enough time to prepare himself for the day. Unlike most days, James this time was first in and out of the bathroom.  He began dressing himself up, with a frilly purple top and a pair of skinny jeans. And of course, the silver TSAR bracelet (TSAB?) with several other multi-colored bracelets. Today will be the day he'd make some small changes for himself to better his look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his morning went smoothly as well. Audrey for once came downstairs for breakfast after James had, dressed in a very tom-boyish way with a T-shirt and jeans, no makeup at all on her face. Of course, as the whole household was oblivious to the swaps and no one found anything out of place. During all of breakfast, James was thinking about the swaps he would do. He decided to follow Eric's advice though and not make anymore swaps with his mom or sister even if they were easy to do. Even though normally he'd walk with Eric to school (not Bill as they went to different schools), James decided he would take the bus. It would be easiest to get the traits he wanted there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen James got to the bus stop, the others there were laughing for some reason. James ignored them mostly, but saw an opportunity there. A brunette with long brown hair was also laughing, whispering something to her friend. He recognized that she had a very similar hair color to her, and immediately swapped hair with her.  <i>That's one done already, day is already going well</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames continued to wait for the bus, looking around obliviously as the others were still giggling at his look. They were of course, oblivious that James only just got his long wavy light brown hair courtesy of the girl that now thought she always had short hair.</span></div></div>",

He probably should have shaved it off in his shower this morning, but it wasn't something that Audrey had gotten in the habit of doing so he forgot.  But now seeing his hairy ankles at the bottom of his jeans when he crossed his legs he realized he should do it.  It would make his skinny jeans fit better too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to go overboard, just legs without any hair or stub would be fine.  He selected a girl  around fifteen years old who had nice legs and soon his legs were hairless and had a little shape to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final thing he 'needed' were breasts.  He didn't want huge breasts just breasts that would make his tops look better and fill out his bra.  It didn't occur to him why he was wearing a bra when he didn't need one.  He justified it to himself that it was more of a fashion statement.  That is why his top was sleeveless so people could see his bra straps peek out.  Besides without boobs to keep his bra in place, the straps on his bra kept falling down his shoulders.  Well the probably would even if he had boobs, but not as much.  He found a girl with perky B-cup breasts and swapped with her.

The second grade class had under twenty students and was in an enclosed area so James could effect anyone and make the class not notice anything was wrong.    While the other students were hard at work and Mr. Fletcher was either working with them or doing his paperwork, James made his plans.  The first thing James did was swap Mr. Fletcher's suit with one of the girls who happened to come to school that day in a skirt.  Mr. Fletcher now wore a cute Frozen Elsa top with a matching purple skirt resized for him <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.jcpenney.com/disney-collection-frozen-elsa-top-and-skirt-girls-2-10/prod.jump?ppId=pp5005942962\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jcpenney.com/disney-collection-frozen-elsa-top-and-skirt-girls-2-10/p...</a>  The little girl was now wearing Mr. Fletcher's suit.  No one noticed, but you James thought it was hilarious, especially seeing Mr. Fletcher's hairy legs peaking out underneath his short skirt.  James wondered if Mr. Fletcher was wearing the girl's panties.    Mr. Fletcher walked around the class as if everything was perfectly fine.  At the moment, he was leaning over a student, Victor Senter and James thought maybe he should swap Mr. Fletcher's body with the boy too.  James decided to hold off for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst James wanted to inflict revenge on Derek, but he didn't know how.  An opportunity come when one of the girl's raised their hand saying they had to go to the bathroom.  James decided to swap the girl's bladder (and the rest of her lower anatomy with Derek.  You also made everyone think that it was Derek who asked to go.  Mr. Fletcher allowed Derek to go.  You wondered if Derek knew what the difference between boys and girls was.  It didn't matter too much since Derek was about to have the biggest surprise of his young life when he finally got to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

James went down to the lunch room with the rest of his class.  Some of the girls beckoned him to their table and he sat down with them.  He had never sat with a group of girls when he was in second grade and was eager to find out what they talked about. They talked mostly about their toys and shows on tv.  He didn't know what to expect but it seemed quite ordinary and he didn't know how to add to the conversation so he got bored.  He thought that maybe he should increase his knowledge of girl topics by swapping with one of his 'friends'.  But before he could the girl's invited him to play leap frog with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into the play area and got in line with his other three friends and soon, like human checkers they were jumping over each other.  Some of the girls had a hard time getting over James because he was so much bigger, but that added to the excitement.  James also was careful not to hurt the girls, they were only seven or eight.  James enjoyed himself more than he would have since he had swapped interests with the girl who was now at his high school.  James wondered how she was making out.  James didn't realize how much he had lost, since he had lost in the switch all interest in sex and his girlfriend Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boys, seeing the girls play ran up from behind them and leap frogged the girls and then instead of stopping at the end, the boy (Victor Senter) purposefully backed up and so his ass wound up in the last girls face.  She screamed at the insult and the game was ruined.  In James head, he decided that Victor must die (figuratively) for ruining his game.  The yard contained kids from the second grade and younger all the way down to kindergarten.  James made Victor the youngest boy in kindergarten.  That was just a start.  But it was at this time, hearing the girl scream an attendant came to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that the boy who had caused all the trouble was a kindergartener, the attendant shushed the girl instead of taking the boy away.  This made James made at the attendant as well as the now very little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

You could use the TSAR to keep a small class of second graders unaware, but there was five classes of second graders in the yard now.  Not to mention the first graders and kindergarteners.  There were also the fifth grade helpers and the other adults such as the teachers and other attendants and maybe the principal or office staff who might enter the yard.  You returned the man back to his former age and clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\" the attendant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl who was bumped told her story.  It was at this time you worked on the attendant in a less obvious way.  While the girl was explaining what had happened, the attendant became more and more unsure of himself.  He realized he was all alone and that his mommy was no where to be found.  He had to do a good job or his supervisor would yell at him.  He hated being yelled at.  It made him feel so small.  What would he do if he messed up?  His thumb involuntarily extended itself as he brought his hand to his face.  He put his thumb in his mouth, it made him feel better.  But then he realized that if people,saw him with his thumb in his mouth they would call him a baby.  he quickly withdrew his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want anyone to think he was a baby.  He started to worry whether he should have worn diapers today.  It was only a year ago he realized that he started wearing his big boy underwear all day.  He still wore his pullups at night in case he wet the bed.  He still did that sometimes, but not all the time.  He couldn't remember when he had his last day time accident, but when he was scared it could happen.  He would forget sometimes, how could anyone expect him to always remember.  It worried him again his thumb approached his mouth.  But this time he pulled it back just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had finished her story and now he was interviewing the boy.  Soon the boy would be done and then he would have to act.  He knew what to do, but what if someone yelled at him for being wrong.  Finally another attendant came over.  The man felt much better now.  This man was his 'big brother.'  He would make sure everyone would treat him right.  It was like the other attendant was in fifth grade and he was in first grade and he would take care of him.  He wanted to run into his 'brother's' arms.  But he couldn't.  He had to be brave.  His brother would know what to do if there was a problem.  With this extra support the attendant resolved the issue.  There wasn't any screaming and the attendant felt proud of himself.  His 'brother' gave him a reassuring smile and both went back to work.  Although this brother always kept an eye out for him, ready to help if there was trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was proud of himself.  He had made many swaps with the attendant and several of the students.  His emotional maturity had been swapped.  Along with his potty training and the relationship he had with a fellow attendant was swapped with two bothers.  A lot had changed for the attendant, but at first glance everything looked perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spotted your teacher in his cute skirt and top set.  This meant that recess would be over soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you make more swaps before recess is over or wait to get back to class?</span></div></div>",

This was going to be the most 'challenging' of the day since he knew the kids' stomachs were filled and the end of the day was far off.  Mr. Fletcher gave out his 'Silent E' worksheets and the students got to work on it.  James snickered when we saw Mr. Fletcher walking around in his Frozen Elsa tunic and matching skirt.  James found the work very easy and wondered how it would be if he found the work more challenging.  James thought about temporarily switching his intellect and schooling with on of the students in the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could decided on who to swap, he felt a tapping on his back with a piece of paper.  He retrieved the note and looked at it.  It was a crayon drawing of a horse with a horn, with the caption \"I like Unicorns.\"  The girl who drew it waved to James.  James took the picture and wanted to add to it.  He he didn't have any crayons.  All the rest of the students had crayons it was required.  So he swapped all his supplies with the boy next to him.  The worksheet didn't require crayons so the boy didn't notice anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames used his crayons to draw a rainbow as a bunch of upside down 'U's inside the body of the formerly white unicorn.  Then under the caption he added, \"I Love Rainbow Colored Unicorns.\"  He then folded up the paper and sent it back on its way back to the original sender.  But before it could get there, it was intercepted by Mr. Fletcher.  Mr. Fletcher could have put the paper away and scolded James, but instead he tried to embarrass him by showing the picture to everyone in class and saying in a silly mocking voice, \"James Loves Unicorns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wasn't embarrassed.  He wasn't seven, he was seventeen.  But he didn't think it was right for Mr. Fletcher to try and embarrass him.  So he plotted his revenge.  He wanted something hat would embarrass Mr. Fletcher but not screw up the class.  No reason for the whole class to suffer, so James wasn't going to make Mr. Fletch as smart (dumb) as one of his students.  But then James decided upon a great idea.  James swapped all of the teachers sexual knowledge with one of the boys.  In the second grade no one knew anything about sex and at this age then didn't need to know.  All the boys thought the girls were 'dumb' and vice versa.  It didn't matter if the boy knew what to do in bed, he didn't want to have anything to do with a girl anyway.  That knowledge would just go unused.  But James smirked when he thought how Mr. Fletcher would do when he tried to be intimate with his girlfriend or wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce James got that out of his system.  James returned to his thought, wouldn't the class be more fun if he found the work as challenging as one of the students.  James decided to swap his intellect with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mr. Fletcher resumed the lesson, and James leaned over to the girl sitting next to him (one of his new friends, it turned out), and asked, \"Who's the dumbest kid in class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl replied, \"The dumbest? I think it's Todd, over there.\" She pointed to him, and James followed her finger. Outwardly, he didn't look any different from an average second grader. He was currently staring off into space while Mr. Fletcher was lecturing, but a few other kids were doing that as well. \"Are you sure?\" James asked the girl. She nodded. \"I've been in the same class with him since kindergarten, and he doesn't care about school. I don't think he's learned much.\" This revelation intrigued James. He had always been very diligent about his schoolwork, and he typically looked down on people who couldn't care less about their education. James was curious about Todd's mentality, and so he decided to swap their intelligence and interest in school. James concentrated, and performed the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was expecting to feel something, like his brain being sucked out of his head. But he didn't. The swap happened instantly. James was smart, and then he wasn't. He looked down at his \"Silent E\" worksheet, and he knew his answers were right because he wrote them down when he was smart. But he didn't know why they were right. Now, James didn't see why the word \"done\" shouldn't be pronounced with the \"e\" at the end. Not that it mattered, anyway. If James wanted to spell \"done,\" he'd just spell it \"don,\" because that's how people say it. He didn't care if his teacher said it should be spelled a different way. \"School is stupid,\" he said out loud. The James' friend sighed and said \"You really need to care more about school. You should be more like Todd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said he was the dumbest kid in class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't! He's the smartest! He always does his homework and he cares a lot about school! You're the dumbest, James!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames became overwhelmed with anger, and he was about to hit the girl when Mr. Fletcher said, \"Stop right now!\" James and the girl both stared at the teacher. Mr. Fletcher's hands were on his hips, and he had a scowl on his face. \"Now, since you've both been behaving very well today, I'm going to let you off with a warning. But if you start arguing again, you will both be joining me after class.\" After thinking for a second, Mr. Fletcher said, \"And I want you both to say something you like about each other. Now.\" The girl said, \"I like your name. 'James' is a cool name.\" \"And I like your clothes,\" James said, which was honest. She was wearing a pink shirt and bedazzled jeans, which James thought were pretty. Deciding that this would be a good way to get revenge, James swapped clothes with her. He looked down at his new jeans, and immediately fell in love with the flower patterns on them. Mr. Fletcher was satisfied, and went back to teaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames felt that he didn't punish the girl enough, and wondered if he should go a step further...</span></div></div>",

James didn't want her to be as traumatized as Derek who had never come back to class since the incident so he swapped her new lower regions with with the girl who was now wearing James' clothing, Melissa.  This would make everything right at least for the first little girl.  The other little girl shouldn't have angered James.

The class just wasn't challenging.  And although the students and teachers treated him just like another girl in the class he didn't feel like one.  James decided to swap his intelligence and education with one of the girls in the class.  It didn't matter which one, so he picked one at random.  Once completed he looked at his worksheet.  He saw all the answers and eh assumed they were right, but on a few of the harder ones he couldn't quite see how he came up with the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not knowing how to do the work wasn't all it took to feel like he was part of the class, he had to have the interests like the students.  He had already swapped his position in the school with a girl who he still didn't know her name, which allowed him to play with jump rope before.  But he enjoyed the idea of playing jump rope with the little girls, he didn't actually have the joy one gets from doing what one truly likes.  So with the same girl as before he swapped her interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world looked different to him now.  When he saw Mr. Fletcher in that cute Frozen Elsa skirt set he didn't feel the the fun of embarrassing him.  He thought the outfit was cute and he would prefer to wear it than see it on the teacher.  What James wore, he thought, wasn't cute or pretty at all.  There was nothing wrong with a t-shirt and jeans, but that outfit on the teacher would look better on him and so he swapped it.  Not only that, but all of the clothing.  In James' closets hung cute outfits that a little girl would wear in his size.  Mr. Fletcher had the apparel of a teenaged boy and a little girl had the outfits of an adult man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at what he wore, James was pleased.  James still had a little time while until Mr. Fletcher would go over the worksheet so for the second time today, James took out his crayons and started to draw a picture.

He could now see James point that playing a game as barbaric as dodgeball wasn't good for the children.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Children,\" Coach Hayes declared, \"we are not going to play dodgeball today.  We are going to play hopscotch instead.\"  An audible groan could be heard by James from several of the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to play hopscotch,\" one of the bigger boys stated.  He approached Coach Hayes along with a couple of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what we are playing,\" Coach Hayes reaffirmed.  At this point the boy was about to throw a tantrum.  James could tell what was about to happen, so James copied into the boys (all three of them) the interests of the same girl who Coach Hayes now had.  Now the boys were thrilled with playing hopscotch and ran off to the painted on courts on the playground floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazed at this turn in events, Louis and Wesley started to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that?\" Louis said.  \"Micheal would never play hopscotch.  I don't believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way would he play that.  He loves dodgeball.\"  The boys continued to talk like this until James went over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louis,\" James asked him, \"how can you want to play dodgeball when you are wearing such a pretty dress?\"  James had swapped the boys apparel with one of the girls.  He was now wearing a pretty salmon colored dress with puffed sleeves <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.onlypromdresses.com/prodid.php?prodnum=201-5014922Dori\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.onlypromdresses.com/prodid.php?prodnum=201-5014922Dori</a>  He was also wearing white tights and open toed sandals.  He didn't think what he wore was odd in the least, but he also realized that it would be tough to play dodgeball in what he was wearing and that hopscotch would be much better.  His friend, Wesley also found that he was wearing a knee length dress <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.onlypromdresses.com/prodid.php?prodnum=926-b016cvg1toPettigirl\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.onlypromdresses.com/prodid.php?prodnum=926-b016cvg1toPettigirl</a> that would surely fly up if he tried to run during dodgeball.  He was deftly afraid at everyone seeing his panties if he tried to play dodgeball  Due to the dresses they were wearing both boys knew it was best that hopscotch was the activity for gym.  Although they still wondered why the other boys agreed so readily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames swiftly copied girls interests onto any boy who who showed any hint of not liking to play along.  Even a girl with tomboy tendencies had her interests changed.  In the end, everyone happily played hopscotch or so it seemed as no one dared to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

The classwork moved very swiftly since no one wanted to cause a problem like getting into a fight or pulling hair.  The closest thing to discord were boys who envied the dresses and skirts that girls or other boys were wearing.  But even though they complained under their breath, they didn't do much about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the boys started to decorate their books with hearts, flowers, cute faces and the alike even those who had formerly liked skulls, and gore decided that flowers were more fun to draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames enjoyed the afternoon class.

Tommy and Chris were friends and Tommy's mother was escorting them home.  Normally the two boys would rough-house on the way.  But today, Tommy asked to hold his mother's hand.  Concerned, Tommy's mother asked him what happened at school?  \"It was a great day,\" Tommy said exuberantly  \"We learned about lots of stuff.  I spelled a word all by myself.  The teacher say I did a very good job.\"  Tommy's mother was perplexed as to why Tommy was so affectionate today.  Then she looked up ahead and found that Chris was actually skipping in front of them.  She didn't think she had ever seen Chris skip before.<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Little Suzie's mother wondered what happened to her dress.

It was shocking to see him in the dress that Suzie had come to school in.  \"Jason what are you wearing???\" Jason's mother said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, my dress?\" Jason didn't see anything wrong with what he was wearing and so he didn't know what his mother was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, why are you wearing a dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This dress is very pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are a boy.

He looked for the mother of the girliest girl in class, seeing her lovingly talking to her daughter about her day and copied her views of her child and how they are being raised (among other things) to every classmate's parent. The worried expressions quickly changed to looks of satisfaction and delight. As he looked on, James heard some of the boy's parents now suggesting going to buy new clothes and dresses for them, much to the boy's delight.

He wanted to get to school and play with and socialize with his friends.  But before he could do that he had to get ready.  His mother laid out the clothes he was to wear for the day, it was a top and skirt set with knee high socks and pink sneakers.  Underneath was an appropriate panty.  He took his clothes to the bathroom with him.  He would need them after his shower.  Before his shower he had to brush his teeth and there was a bunch of things he had to do now that he was a girl.  But they didn't take too long.  Finally after brushing his hair with at least fifty strokes, He got dressed and went to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon thereafter his mother took him to school.  Some of the students were already there.  Others arrived in dribs and drabs. Every student in his class was wearing either a skirt or a dress as their mom's laid them out.  But not everyone wanted to wear a skirt.  Being girlie didn't mean you had to be in skirts all the time, some preferred leggings or jeans.  But their mother's insisted as they all had the desires of the mother with the girliest opinions.  James decided to make everyone happy by making all the students want to wear skirts too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn James' class he found that a lot of the students had brought their special dolls.  The ones they just couldn't leave home without.  James thought this was a great idea and by the end of the day, every student needed to have his/her doll with them at all times.  James even did this to himself.  James didn't realize that the more girlie/feminine he got, the more girlie/feminine he wanted to get.  He also dragged all the students in his class down with him.  Soon, skirts weren't even girlie enough for them, they had to wear dresses.  Sneakers were out too, not even for gym class.  James had caught himself in a vicious cycle of complete femininity.  Even their emotions were drastically effected.  Every student had to be either very cheerful or so sad they were crying.  All aggression was removed.  Every student needed to have their nails painted and that polish had to match their outfit.  There were hundreds of such needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He set out to find as much as he could about subliminal messaging and all the best ways to employ it. After looking into it, James knew he would need more help than just himself. Luckily, with the ring, he knew he could get the allies he needed on his side. James discreetly left the house to find the people he needed without Eric finding out. His plan was to project his ideal changes to Eric's appearance, interests and mannerisms to the people close to Eric while also having them act discreetly so as to not arouse suspicion and not act too differently and have them all in on the plan to change Eric for the \"Better\". First, James' old girlfriend, Lauren, as a precaution, then came the more necessary allies for his plan, Eric's parents, Sara and Eddie, James was careful to make sure Eric wouldn't see him as he implanted the information into them, The two gave a discreet wink out the window, as if to signal the success. Then came the final loose end, Kim, Eric's girlfriend. She easier to target then Eric's parents since she was with the volleyball team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the tough part out of the way, James went back home, implanted his family with the plan and hid the ring in a place Eric would never think to look. Then per accordance with the Plan, James' Mom called the Pierson's to request their son babysit James for the next couple of days since she and Audrey would be busy and out of the house.

But, you better remove it before I leave and promise not to use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Eric removed his shoes and James soon got to work on applying the nail polish it did not take too long before nice layer was applied to each nail. \"Perfect!\" James said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you had your fun now let's quickly whip something together for dinner\". By 'whip something together', Eric just meant nuke some hotpockets in the microwave. James was unimpressed but, he would soldier for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs 8 o'clock rolled around, James took off the nail polish and Eric left when Audrey and Heather came home.</span></div></div>",

Just make sure you take it off before I go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, James applied a coat of clear nail polish to his hands and feet. Eric was surprised at how fast he could do it. \"Alright, Mommy said she is going to be back around 6 pm so we still have enough time for a little snack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric got up, \"I'll make us something, I want to move around a little anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was hesitant at letting him go, he wanted to give him some super sweet cookies and tea.

It was an easy thing to make since he just followed the instruction son the box to the letter and like this morning, Eric was taking smaller bites and going a lot slower than before, though James was too focused on his own bowl to really notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 pm came and Eric left on his way, forgetting to have James remove the nail polish.</span></div></div>",

Nothing seemed out of place, but when James saw him he knew progress had been made. Eric was wearing flip-flops. Okay not a huge change but, Eric never liked to wear open toed foot wear , they got in the way and he felt they just didn't suit him. but there they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Eric. Ready to play?\" James said avoiding the subject of his footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but I'm not playing. I'm trying to get you back to normal, remember?\" Eric determination still held strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Yeah. Anyway, Totally Spies.\" Eric seemed to be getting good and remembering the details, no matter how inconsequential, as it had only took him two tries to get the questions right. Although it meant he wouldn't be exposed to the subliminals as much, it still meant he was retaining an awful lot about a show aimed for girls and James was fine with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss, okay James. The Hint.\" Eric demanded with a hint of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. The hint is: Away from civilization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Away from civilization'? At least James was avoiding being redundant, so that means its deep in one of the parks, the mountains or somewhere out of town. We're getting somewhere! \"Alright\" Eric relaxed and looked at James expectantly until he said, \"So might as well get it over with. Paint my nails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paint my nails what?\" James asked coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paint my nails, please.\" Eric slightly annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" James had managed to were him down even if it was just a bit. now he didn't ask to have them, probably because he forgot to. This time he painted them a semi-glossy pink, something girlier but not that noticeable. After that, James talked about what he had planned to do for the rest of the day: have a play date with some of the girls in his class and go shopping with his mommy afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Audrey got home, Eric said goodbye and as he left he received a text from....</span></div></div>",

The two decided on the walking area first. Eric and Kim combed through the walkway though Kim was substantially faster than Eric to the point that at the end of the wlkway she managed to end up combing through Eric's side.

Mr. Fletcher came first since James needed Fletcher  to help with Eric. Finding Charlie Fletcher was not too difficult thanks to asking around with her classmates. He was in a cafe at the moment, sipping some tea as he read the newspaper. James first swapped his sex and gender with a baby who was being nursed by her or rather his mother. Swapping just that gave fine results, Charlie or rather Charlene looked looked pretty despite her clothes and lack of makeup and a discerning teenage boy's eye could easily discern that she was at least had a pair of D-cup breasts and lovely rump to match. But James was not done, across the street was a beauty parlor and James copied their skills and knowledge makeup, skin and hair care, and woman's clothing from the experts on to the new Ms. Fletcher while coping the interest in looking good and actually wearing and using woman's clothes and products from the customers in the store. For good measure, James copied the mother's motherly instincts and Knowledge with handling children onto her as well along with the plan to change Eric that James now slightly revised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Ms. Fletcher stood up and rushed out of the cafe to what seemed like the mall, no to replace her old man stuff with new stuff for her new needs. James had designed her to be a good role model for her students similar to an older sister who could teach them not only math but about ways to be even more feminine as they grew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came Coach Hayes, who thanks to James needed a new way to teach the class to be healthy, since they only played the activities the girls would have wanted to play. Much like Ms. Fletcher, Larry Hayes was not hard to find, perusing a local Walmart looking for a new jump rope and also much like Fletcher, James swapped his gender and sex, this time with a young girl trying to sneak some candy without her mother noticing. Larry or rather Lily Hayes looked younger and more petite than her more sultry coworker Fletcher. Next, came the mental copying, James copied a love and interest in flowers and cooking from the florist and mother nearby respectively while again coping Motherly instincts on to her as well. James also copied her favorite colors of pink and lavender and the love of dresses and girlier clothes to Coach Hayes on top of the knowledge of make up and all woman's products from the woman just down aisle from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayes immediately began to bolt toward the clothing aisle, paralleling Fletcher though she struggled to move in her now much bigger clothes. James intended Hayes to be the mother hen for the class, sweet and kind and cute, encouraging the class while keeping them happy and healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was proud of the swaps she made on them, they were fore the best and thanks to the ring, she had been walking around town slowly changing everyone who may have known them to convince them that Hayes and Fletcher were always like this. James gave the ring back to Kim and told her to put it back making extra special care no one, especially Eric, would find it.</span></div></div>",

Eric was caught off guard and as her body squeezed against his, he struggled with making a coherent reply. \"Oh, sorry. Guess you found it a little strange for a grown woman you just met to start hugging you.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah a little bit.\" Eric squeaked as he tried to regain his composure. Charlene and his mother both gave a look at each other and laughed. \"So long have you and my mom known each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh since childhood, we had a lot of fun together.\" His mother chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that Sara, but you were quite a bit older than me but we spent so much time together, You're practically my older sister.\" Charlene interjected. This was half-true. James had swapped the two's memories around to have a shared childhood and the cost of switching the memory that they had shared with someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, and Charlene is also a teacher so maybe, Eric, you could have a tutoring session or two with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I insist, Eric.

Then his expression turned into a confused one all of a sudden. \"How come this ring doesn't work on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric just rolled his eyes and shrugged. \"How the hell should I know?\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, James wasn't convinced Eric was telling the truth. He had a feeling Eric knew more than he was letting on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you think you'r the first one to get a ring like that?\" Eric started to explain, catching James' interest enough for him to stop playing with the large tits stretching out his shirt. \"I didn't say anything when it fell out of the sky, but I had one a while back. But... I gave it up, because unlike you I had my subconscious telling me that having such a thing - was bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't seem convinced. \"Bullshit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric groaned. This was exactly why he hadn't said anything. \"Why do you think the ring won't work on me? It's probably the same one that I threw away. Fuck know's why it fell out of the sky again, or where it had gone in the meantime. But it won't work on me because I was the one to own it first mostly likely.\" he informed James, who was staring at the ring on his finger, listening to his friend intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's say your're right. You'd think you'd tell your best friend about getting a fucking TRAIT SWAPPING RING\" James raised his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric didn't appreciate being shouted at. \"Well here's an idea. Maybe the ring came to you because you're a lot dumber than me and you won't think twice before using it on ANYONE.

Was he actually getting through to James' better nature? Or was that too much to hope for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, you happy?\" James grumbled, before glancing down in disappointment at his familiar appearance. He then shrugged.

The truth was he was afraid to use the TSAR alone. Originally he was going to take the TSAR to the mall and swap some of the people there. That sounded like a lot of fun, but he wasn't sure what would happen. He was sure that it would work, the TSAR did 'speak' to him, but he didn't want to get into trouble. He was so excited that he didn't really worry about screwing with other people's lives. Before he would go out and have a little fun he thought he should test it out on someone and the person to test it out on was Eric. Besides he would turn Eric back and then the two of them would go to the mall together. Eric had been his best friend since grammar school and James was sure that he would be cool with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric came over and James invited him into his room. Soon James was showing Eric the TSAR and explaining how it worked as best he understood it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're shitting me,\" was Eric's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"I am not.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Have you tested it yet?\"<br>\r\nJames: \"No, that is why I invited you here.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"What?\"<br>\r\nJames: \"I thought I could test it on you.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"No fuckin way buddy.\"<br>\r\nJames: \"You have been admiring my mom's boobs, how would you like having them?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Hell NO!!! Make that FUCK NO!!!\"<br>\r\nJames: \"Well you don't think it'll work anyway.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"I don't care, I don't want your mom's tits. Not even for a second.\"<br>\r\nJames: \"How about Audrey's tits??? They are smaller.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"I don't want anyone's tits. No like that I mean.\"<br>\r\nJames: \"OK, maybe something small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric realized that James must be trying to fool him decided to go along with the gag. Signing Eric said, \"OK, something small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: \"HMMM, something small, lets see how about my mom's hair?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Her hair? What if something went wrong?\"<br>\r\nJames: \"Well then I suppose you could have your hair cut and no one would notice.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Your mom's hair is RED!\"<br>\r\nJames: \"And you cut your hair so short, you might as well be bald.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"\"Fuck you, I like it short.\"<br>\r\nJames: \"\"Well there is short and there is what you have.\" Soon a playful fight broke out among the friends which broke the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, OK, if you must,\" Eric said with resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames closed his eyes and concentrated on Eric's hair and that of his mom and then willed them to swap hair. When he opened his eyes and saw nothing had happened he was very disappointed and shouted \"SHIT!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See I told you it wouldn't work,\" Eric stated with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we aren't close enough. Maybe we have to be in the same room for this to work?\" James didn't think there was such a restriction but he didn't want to give up on his dream of a trait swap ring whether it was alchemical or brought by aliens or even some ancient Asian secret. Humoring him, Eric followed James down to the kitchen where Heather, James' Mom was cooking dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames concentrated again although since they were both in the same room he didn't close his eyes this time. It still didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather: \"It's too late for a snack boys, dinner will be ready soon. Eric are you staying over?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"I don't think so Mrs. Barrett.\"<br>\r\nHeather: \"Well you are more than welcome to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys left the room and headed back to James room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are lucky that this didn't work or I would have given you my moms boobs...and her vagina too,\" James said. James was lying but he didn't mind ribbing his friend since he knew the ring was a fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, they are your mom's boobs you should have them to keep them in the family,\" Eric said.  \"So since it doesn't 'work' what will you do with the ring?  Keep it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames replied, \"No, I have never been one to wear rings, I think I'll give it to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why weren't you in school today?\" Eric says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that.

Opening the door was a girl that Eric didn't know.  She was about thirteen years old and dressed in a cute knee length dress with a floral print.  This girl was obviously a relative of the Barrett's but he had never seen her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric you are here, come in\" the girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric followed the girl in.  Once inside Eric saw James' sister Audrey but she was different, she was much more mature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you going to say hello to your friend Jamie?\" Audrey inquired.   Looking closely, Eric realized that this was a regressed feminized version of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, it did work!\" Eric said as what must have happened dawned upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey: \"Jamie, go into the kitchen and get us something to drink and some snacks.\"<br>\r\nJamie: \"Sure thing Audrey.\" and Jamie scampered off.<br>\r\nAudrey: \"That girl loves her sister,\" Audrey said absently.<br>\r\nEric \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\nAudrey: \"I made some changes.\"<br>\r\nEric \"I can see that.  But why?\"<br>\r\nAudrey: \"I didn't want to be a kid anymore.  Now next year I'll be off to college.  I hated middle school.\"<br>\r\nEric \"But, James is a girl now.\"<br>\r\nAudrey: \"Yes she is.  Who wants an annoying little brother.  They are almost as bad as annoying big brothers don't you know?\"<br>\r\nEric \"Your still a girl too, I didn't know the ring could perform sex changes.\"<br>\r\nAudrey: \"Well it can't.\"<br>\r\nEric \"Then how is James a girl?\"<br>\r\nAudrey: \"Well last night I was babysitting for Taylor.  Taylor use to be a girl's name.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Why did you get me here?\"<br>\r\nAudrey: \"Jamie, I love calling her that.  Oh well Jamie told me 'she' had only told one person about the ring and it was you.  So I think we should make some changes around here.  I don't want you telling anyone about anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric became frightened.  He now saw what the ring could do.  Maybe James was using it incorrectly before.  Eric didn't know whether to run or attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey continued, \"I'm too old to babysit now, but Jamie is just the right age.  I'll see that she gets the job babysitting you when you are Taylor's age (which was under two years old.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey tried to swap the ages of Eric and Taylor but it didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Is that it?  Too bad your stupid ring doesn't work anymore.  Give it up.\"  He said as he applied pressure to Audrey's wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to hurt his best friend's little sister, but she wasn't exactly little anymore.  She looked like she was now 18 years old, and had matured in all the right places.  Swapping ages with James must have made her into what she will look like at his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me you creep!  Jamie gave this ring to me!  Why won't you change?!\"  Audrey screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric struggled to get the ring off Audrey's finger, he realized there wasn't anyone else around.  James's parents weren't home, or maybe Audrey had done something to them too?  He couldn't know for sure now, he just had to focus on stopping Audrey.  She yelled in pain as he grabbed her finger, while trying to hold her arm straight, and found that the ring wouldn't come off.  It was fit perfectly around her ring finger, right under her knuckle, and it was on tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued pulling on, Audrey struggled, and started punching him in the face, but even as an 18 year old, she still seemed to hit with the strength of a 13 year old, and it didn't do much to Eric.  He was a fairly strong guy, and when he attempted to dodge one of her punches, accidentally pushed her back and she smacked her head on the ground, on hard tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck\u2026 Audrey are you ok?\"  Eric asked, but she was out cold.  He still felt a pulse, so she was probably ok, but he hoped there wasn\u2019t a concussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was unconscious however, he grabbed her finger and tried to pry the ring off again, but with no luck.  That was when he noticed the small indentation on one of the edges.  When he pressed it with his fingernail, the ring suddenly grew in size, easily large enough to remove from her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the ring in his hands and inspected it closely.  It was made of a dark metal that was engraved with some strange shapes and symbols, but was otherwise a perfectly smooth and polished object.  He had no idea how it could change size the way it did, but if it could make his best friend into a tween girl then he supposed it could do anything.</span></div></div>",

She gasped when she saw her sister sprawled out on the floor, unconscious.  \"Sis! What happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just bumped her head, she'll be fine.  But what happened to you?!\"  Eric asked his girlified friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie tilted her head, \"What?  I'm fine, my sis is the one who is hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie set the lemonade down and rushed to the bathroom and wet a towel for her sister to rest her head on.  But when Jamie returned, she saw Eric had picked up her older sister, and placed her in a chair.  Jamie quickly placed the towel on Audrey's head, and held her hand to comfort her.  She was being the perfect little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shook his head, wondering how it got this bad.  \"Ok look James, just make sure she doesn't move, I'm going to get a rope\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A rope\u2026\"  Jamie asked, but Eric was already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned from the garage and tied Audrey to the chair, so she wouldn't be able to move her arms.  Jamie as shocked.  \"Eric!  What did you do that for?!  She's hurt and you want to tie her up like some kind of criminal?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She turned you into this!  Don't you remember?  Can you tell me how she used the ring?\"  Eric asked.  The ring hadn't told him anything or done anything when he picked it up.  It seemed like just an ordinary accessory to him, aside from its magical ability to change shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie shrugged, \"Turned me into what?  Why are you so obsessed about the ring?  It didn't work remember?  I tried it yesterday on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed in frustration.  His best friend seemed completely unaware that he was now a middle school aged girl, and had no idea Audrey used the ring.  He decided to risk it, and put the ring on his own finger.  When he squeezed the indentation, it shrunk to fit his finger size perfectly.  He expected it to pinch, but it was quite snug actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok let me see if I can fix this then\u2026\"  Eric said to himself as he decided to try swapping Audrey's age with Jamie's, so Audrey would at least be back to normal again.  \"Am I doing this right?  I just have to focus right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie shrugged, but didn't notice anything happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried swapping other things between Jamie and Audrey, none of them seemed to have any effect.  \"Ugh!  How did she do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie's eyes lit up as she got an idea, \"Oh!  What if it's you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?  Well\u2026 she did say she couldn't use it on me.. And you couldn't use it on me\u2026 and now I can't use it...  Maybe you're right.  Maybe the ring just doesn't like me at all\u2026\"  Eric said, taking the ring off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed the ring to Jamie, \"Look.  You're going to have to fix this yourself.  Just focus on swapping your age with Audrey's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie held the ring in her hand.  In its currently oversized form, it looked massive in her tiny feminine hands, and she was perplexed about what she was supposed to do with it.  \"But Eric\u2026 Audrey didn't swap anything with me, I'm completely fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please\u2026 just do it ok?  Swap your ages so she can become a 13 year old again.\"  Eric groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh!  You want me to be the big sis?!  This should be fun!\"  Jamie said excited, as she finally thought she understood what was going on.</span></div></div>",

Audrey also swapped James relationship with her with the relationship of one of her friends and her sister.  The little sister who was only five years-old used to idolize her older sister and thought that she could do no wrong.  That is how James now felt about Audrey.  Now Jamie follows Audrey around like a puppy dog, just happy to be around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other swaps too.  Jamie was now much more girlie than Audrey ever was.  Audrey swapped Jamie's 'girliness' with a girl that Audrey had never seen ever wear a pair of pants.  Audrey had been busy swapping James with lots of people since Eric had last saw 'him.'  All these swaps in an effort to make James into Jamie, Audrey's perfect little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She looked down at the ring which had shrunk to fit her slender fingers.  A strand of brunette hair fell in her face, and she subconsciously brushed it aside.  Eric noticed just how feminine she was acting.  The number of changes Audrey had made were incredible.  Both physically and mentally, the 13 year old girl before him was nothing like James.  Yet, she still believed Eric was her best friend.  He just hoped that her love for her 'big' sister wasn't stronger than her trust in her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you promise not to use it to do bad things to my sister.  She never did anything to hurt anyone. \"  Jamie said as she carefully slid the ring off her finger as it grew in size to come off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed it over to Eric reluctantly, and he quickly snatched it up and put it on his own finger for safe keeping.  He still had no idea why he couldn't use its power, but Jamie and Audrey seemed to be able to.  He considered for a minute that only girls could use it, and now that James was Jamie, she was capable of using it.  On the other hand, it could just be him that can't use it.  They were both unable to swap him before, so there could be some truth to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Jamie we need to get out of here before Audrey wakes up.\"  Eric said, as he grabbed Jamie's hand and started walking towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

You trust her to use the ring responsibly?\"  Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My girlfriend\u2026?  I trust\u2026 I trust my big sis!

It's possible her mind was too innocent to think of being in a relationship like that.</span></div></div>",

The two walked to Lauren's house.  On the way there, Eric asked Jamie some questions and found that all of her answers were normal for a girl her age (13).  From where she went to school to what she got for Christmas all seemed perfectly normal.  Eric asked her about some of the things that Eric and James did together.  Those events weren't totally removed from Jamie's memory but they had been modified as if she had done them as a young girl not a young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they arrived at Lauren's house.  They rang the bell and Lauren let them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Eric...Hi Squirt.\" she greeted them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren,\" Eric said excitedly, \"you have to help us out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren: \"Sure thing, what do you need?\"<br>\r\nEric pondered her reaction, \"Hey wait, don't you see something wrong here?\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"Wrong??? with what?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Wrong with James.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"Whose James?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Your boyfriend, James.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"I don't have a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Who is this then?\" referring to Jamie.<br>\r\nLauren: \"That's Jamie, Audrey's little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait a minute, I have something to tell you.,\"  Eric told Lauren.  Then to Jamie, \"Jamie there is some ice cream in the freezer, you get it while I talk to Lauren.\"  Jamie scampered off to get the treat.  When Jamie was gone.  \"Look Lauren, that little girl isn't really a little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren: \"She isn't?\" Lauren said skeptically. <br>\r\nEric: \"No, she is really your boyfriend James.  Audrey used some sort of magic ring thingie to change him into a little girl?\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"Oh, did she now?\"  Lauren thought that Audrey sent Eric over to play a trick on her.<br>\r\nEric: \"Yes, and now I need your help to turn her back.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"How are we going to do that?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"I got the ring from Audrey and I need you to use it to turn James back.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"Why don't you use it yourself?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"It won't work for me.  I don't think men can use the ring.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"Oh?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Hey I don't know.  I just can't use it.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Come back with me to James' house and swap his age back with Audrey.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"Swap his age back?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Yes.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"And that'll make HER my boyfriend?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Well...I don't know.  But at least he'll be an adult again.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"What about Audrey?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Well she'll be back to being thirteen.  That is the way it should be.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"Where is Audrey now?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"She's back at her house.  I have her tied up so she won't get away.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"YOU HAVE HER TIED UP???\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Yes.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"Like with ropes?\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Yes.  I couldn't let her get away.  We need to turn everyone back to normal.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"Let me get this right.  Audrey is tied up against her will and you want me to put on this magic ring and use it to swap her age with the Squirt over there?\"<br>\r\nEric noticed that Lauren called James a Squirt again.  He assumed that when he was back to normal she would return to normal also.  \"Yes, that is about it.\"<br>\r\nLauren: \"If you have Audrey tied up, I'd better go with you.\"<br>\r\nEric: \"Great let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Lauren then went into the kitchen to find Jamie eating her ice cream.  Eric told her it was time to go, but Jamie wouldn't go until she was finished.  Lauren agreed with her so Eric waited impatiently for Jamie to finish.  Jamie had taken more ice cream than she could eat so she slowed down at the end but she insisted that they wait until she finished every spoonful.  Eric could do nothing but bide his time until she was ready.  Soon the trio was on their way back top James' house.  Even though Jamie had ice cream it was cold outside and so Lauren put on her gloves besides her coat for her trip back to James' house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, Eric gave Lauren the TSAR.  \"Now look, I don't know exactly how this works.  James told me, it talks to you and gives you instructions.  I think you have to concentrate and it'll make a swap.  Just go there and swap their ages and we'll go from there.\"  Lauren took it in her gloved hand.  Because she was wearing gloves she didn't get the instructions that James and Audrey got from the ring.  The ring has to touch your skin to give you its instructions.  On the way back to James' house Lauren thought that Audrey was just playing a trick on her.  She was playing along with the gag to see what happens.  Lauren didn't believe for a moment that Audrey was indeed tied up against her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you getting the instructions?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure I am.\" Lauren lied to keep up the joke pretense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio arrives at the house and Eric led the way.  Lauren saw Audrey indeed tied up and assumed it was a big joke until she saw the terror on Audrey's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me, help me!!!\" Audrey shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my god what happened to you?\" Lauren asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then said, \"Lauren, swap their ages now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren knew that Eric had flipped.  She was afraid for herself and Audrey too.  She knew she couldn't over power Eric to free Audrey so she made something up.  \"UMMM, the ring told me that you can't be in here for it to work.  You had better leave and then I'll swap them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made sense to Eric.  he left the room, but stayed by the door. \"Not far enough and close the door too,\" Lauren told him.  Eric did as she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, what happened?  Eric has gone nuts,\" Lauren said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are telling me.  Let me out of this and we'll do something.  I think you, me and Jamie can get him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren started to loosen Audrey's rope.  \"I can't believe that Eric would think that I would help him.  He knows that you and I have been best friends since we were in diapers.\"  Eric didn't know that Audrey had visited Lauren with ring in hand the day before.  She swapped the relationship of Lauren with James and Audrey.  Now Lauren thought that Audrey and herself had been best friends forever and that Jamie was just Audrey's cute little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She slipped the ring on her finger and marvelled at how it shrunk to fit her slender girlish fingers.  With a thought, she wished that she was the older sister and Audrey would be 13 again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey began shrinking while still tied up to the chair.  Her body shrank down to its old 13 year old state, but now the ropes were slightly lose around her, and Eric was concerned that when she woke up she'd be able to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile however, Jamie was shocked as she sprouted up a foot in height, and her body began to mature.  Her brunette hair grew longer as she quickly aged 5 years.  Her hips widened and her ass expanded to mature female proportions.  Finally the tiny breasts that she had before began to expand until they were cute C cups.  She was still wearing the same cute floral dress that came down to her knees, but it was resized to fit her taller more mature body shape.  She was wearing no bra however, since she never used to need one before when she was 13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's jaw dropped as the little 13 year old girl that used to be his best friend, grew up and became a slender and beautiful young woman.  She still had an adorable innocent look about her, with plain brunette hair and a simple modest dress.  But he could tell the body underneath the dress was a knockout.  He felt a tightness in his pants as he looked at her chest which was moving freely inside the dress with no bra.  He slapped himself to be reminded that this was still James!  At least what was left of James\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James\u2026 Jamie?  You still in there?\"  He asked carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god it worked!  I'm the older sister now!  I've got tits!\"  Jamie said, covering her mouth and realizing she just swore.  \"Sorry I said a bad word\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, you're almost an adult now you can swear all you want.\"  Eric said with a chuckle at how strange this 'girl' his age was still acting like an innocent kid.  Well not entirely innocent.  She obviously knew the word tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great\u2026 I can't believe how much taller I am now.  And look at Audrey\u2026  she looks so peaceful asleep in that chair.  Did you really have to knock her out like that?\"  Jamie asked with a caring sisterly tone to her voice.  She knelt down and stroked Audrey's auburn hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric noticed how Jamie was starting to act more like a mature older sister compared to the subservient younger sister she was just a minute ago.  Swapping ages to become the \"older sister\" must have told the ring to give her some of Audrey's personality traits as well, along with her age.  Eric might be able to use this to his advantage, if Jamie could be reasoned with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was dangerous with the ring, but now that we have it, things should be ok.  Do you believe me that she used the ring to make you a 13 year old yet?  You've seen what it can do.

Jamie needed to know the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me\u2026\"  Jamie said with a nod of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric took Jamie into the living room where the family usually kept family portraits.  \"See look-  What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family portrait had been altered\u2026  Where there was once 17 year old James and 12 year old Audrey standing next to their parents, in this year old picture, now stood a 12 year old Jamie next to her older 17 year old sister, Audrey.  Had Audrey managed to alter the photos as well?Jamie saw the picture and was even more confused, \"But see look, this picture is correct.  Shows me as how I should look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026 come on let's check your room there's gotta be something Audrey didn't change.\"  Eric said as he hurried upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shocked when he saw a completely pink feminine room.  Audrey had been busy, changing just about everything in Jamie's life to be something a 13 year old girl would own.  The only thing mostly unchanged was James's laptop, which now had cute heart stickers on it, but was otherwise the same.  In the end however, Jamie said that she didn't have the password to it and had to ask Audrey for permission to use it!  Apparently Audrey had even swapped his memories of computer passwords out of James's brain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just getting ridiculous\u2026 How did she change so much?\"  Eric sat down on the pink bed, feeling defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie sat next to Eric, and put her hand on his, to comfort him.  He felt immediately uncomfortable as he realized just how close his best friend was sitting to him.  He could feel Jamie's warm, matured body touching him, and he knew something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James\u2026 stop.\"  Eric said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not James, stop calling me that.  I think you're right about my age.  This feels right.  I think I understand why Audrey wanted to be an adult so much.  Are these feelings normal for people our age?  I like the way this feels\u2026\"  Jamie said softly, leaning her head on Eric's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh fuck\u2026 he's\u2026 she's coming on to me.  Swapping ages must have gotten rid of her childish outlook on romance\u2026  I mean deep down in there that's James, a hopeless romantic.  He's been with Lauren for years so he's no stranger to\u2026  Oh god stop thinking about this.  It's your friend, don't try to rationalize it!</i>  Eric debated with himself.</span></div></div>",

I don't think you are really dating Kim.  I hardly ever see you together.  Weren't we just talking about this?  I remember telling you, 'she's been out of your league for a while now, why did she ever start dating you in the first place?'  You aren't dating, you just use her as an excuse so you don't have to date other girls.  You are just shy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look dude, Kim and I are dating and even if we weren't you should be a guy so I can't date you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like a guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is besides the point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you how all girl...I mean WOMAN I am now.\"  Jamie leaned in close to kiss Eric.  Eric push his own face away from Jamie's lips.  Jamie didn't know this of course since she closed her eyes to initiate the kiss.  Jamie missed Eric's mouth completely and ended up kissing the side of his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie smiled and said \"Hey, no fair, you moved,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to.  Now let me kiss you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric didn't know what to do.  He wasn't going to kiss his best friend even if he was now a she.  Besides as he told Jamie he already had a girlfriend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other room, Audrey was waking up.  She started to scream..  In her smaller body she got out of her ropes after a minute and headed to Jamie's room.  Seeing Jamie and Eric together, Audrey lunged at them.  Eric didn't know if he was saved or was in worse shape than before.</span></div></div>",

He tricked you into swapping our ages, you have to put us back!  Just do something to get him off me!\"  Audrey whined as she was held down onto the bed, squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie looked at the ring on her finger, and frowned.  Eric could tell she was going through turmoil, and he hoped the age change had affected her enough so that she would see how crazed Audrey had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie, your sister caused all of these problems, are you really going to let her cause more?  We can set things right with the ring.  You already know you have the power to use it.

Then she looked down at her 18 year old body, with her new breasts and taller height.  And finally she looked at Eric, who she just couldn't help but find attractive.  She remembered being best friends all her life with him, and knew that she always had feelings for him but he was always dating girls prettier than she was, never paying any attention to her.  But now with the ring Jamie could fix this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Audrey, the ring's mine.  I was the one who found it in the storm, it spoke to me first.  You're just not responsible enough to handle it.\"  Jamie said, sounding like a mature 18 year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Jamie you are supposed to be the perfect little sister that does everything I say!  What happened?\"  Audrey blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Jamie realized what had happened.  <i>So Audrey really DID trick me into thinking I was a 13 year old.

Immediately Audrey's expression changed from anger, to fear.  Her personality now resembled that of 13 year old Jamie.  Easily impressionable, and willing to do anything for her big sis Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow\u2026 Eric stop\u2026 you're hurting me\u2026\"  Audrey cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric\u2026 let her go.

Her demeanor had changed to a very meek and obedient 13 year old, compared to the seething rage that she had just a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used it on her didn't you?\"  Eric wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie smiled, \"I only gave her the personality changes that she made to me\u2026 and took back my maturity.

Audrey, just go run along and do your homework for now ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Audrey quietly nodded and hurried out of Jamie's bedroom, Jamie continued to Eric, \"But the good thing is at least I feel so much more comfortable in this body now, things are getting back to normal again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're NOT normal!  You're not a girl!  As James you never had feelings for me, so I have no idea what swap caused THAT.\"  Eric protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't believe you would try to convince me I'm something I'm not.  Eric I LIKE you, I told you before.  I may not be able to use the ring on you, but I'm not giving up yet.  I just want you to give me a chance\u2026 and I can become whatever girl you want me to be now.

But Jamie was determined to become Eric's girlfriend at any cost.  She formed a plan, if Eric only had eyes for Kim then Jamie would become Kim.  The first thing she would need to do was to change the shape of the ring so Eric wouldn't recognize it.  Jamie thought to change the ring into a bracelet that she always wore.  But Eric might notice then then she thought she should totally change it into a necklace with a pendant.  Eric would never suspect that, it didn't look anything like a ring.  Soon the new pendant was around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie walked towards Kim's house.  On the way over she thought to herself what would she need to swap.  Jamie thought to herself, \"Well I would have to swap my body with hers, that was obvious.  But then Kim would still say she was Kim and maybe Eric would believe her.  Well then the next thing to swap was names.  Jamie Bennett would be Kim Weiss from now on.\"  She said the name out loud, \"I'm Kim Weiss.\"  It didn't sound right to her, but after the swap it would.  Continuing her plan in her head, Jamie thought, \"But that might not be enough, Kim would still think she lives in her house not mine.  OK, I'll have to swap where she thinks she lives.  OK, that is three things.  Then she realized she would have to swap families.  Jamie would miss her mother and father, but it was worth it to have Eric.  Is that all?  Well Kim is an athlete should she swap athletic ability?  No, she'll just quit the team, she wanted to spend that time with Eric anyway.  What about their friends? Naaa, she would let things continue and then decide who to be friends with as time went on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that it?  A four part plan, swap, one: bodies...two: names...three: addresses and four: families.  Then she could be Eric's girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Kim was usually too busy to hang out all the time, but when she did, she seemed like an incredibly friendly and outgoing girl.  Jamie decided if she had to become anyone else, Kim was as good a choice as any.  She was fit, attractive, popular, and most importantly, loved by Eric.  Jamie sighed as she realized what she was considering.  But no\u2026 this had to happen.  Eric was immune to the ring, so there was no way she could MAKE Eric return her affection.  This was the only way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived at Kim's house, Kim answered the door wearing shorts and a sporty red tank top.  She likely just got back from practice, and was still wearing a sports bra underneath.  Jamie could tell because Kim's chest was normally a bit more prominent than this.  Her blonde hair was also tied up in a ponytail, as usual, and she seemed to be in a pleasant mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\u2026  can I help you?\"  Kim didn't seem to recognize her.<br>\r\nThat's when Jamie remembered, she hadn't yet fixed the changes that Audrey had made!  Kim probably only knew Jamie as an innocent little 13 year old.  Jamie quickly used the ring to make Kim see Jamie's body as being normal again.\"Oh wait, Jamie is that you?  Sorry I didn't recognize you at first, come in!  You aren't hanging out with Eric today?\"  Kim said as she invited Jamie indoors out of the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no not today.  Eric went home.\"  Jamie said as she made herself comfortable on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you by?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kim I wanted to ask you about Eric.  You two have been going out like\u2026 almost 6 months now.  Do you really like him?\"  Jamie asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim stared blankly for a second, \"Um\u2026 yeah I love him.  Like\u2026 a lot actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Then you two have\u2026 you know?\"  Jamie motioned with her hands to imply intercourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim laughed, \"Well that's a personal question\u2026  What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this about Jamie?  Oh!  Is there a boy you like?!  You gotta tell me!\"  Kim was excited now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no!  It's no one\u2026 I was just curious that's all.\"  Jamie said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that she had to act soon, she couldn't keep Kim talking forever.  When Jamie concentrated, the TSAR pendant on her necklace activated, and she found herself changing quickly.  With a jolt, she felt her whole body tense up and become more fit and toned.  She lost a few inches in height and her hair became a brilliant blonde shade, right before it tied itself up in a ponytail just like Kim had it.  Jamie's breasts grew another size to Kim's pert D cups, but she didn't have time to look at them before her clothing changed as well.  She felt a sports bra constraining her chest all of a sudden, and she was now wearing short shorts that exposed her completely smooth, shaved legs.  Jamie now looked exactly like Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Kim had become the spitting image of what Jamie looked like just a minute ago.  She seemed completely oblivious to all of the changes as well, so Jamie felt proud that she had managed to successfully do swap number one.  She now had Kim's body and entire wardrobe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you listening Jamie?  I was just saying, it seems like there's a boy you like\u2026  It's obvious.\"  Kim said with Jamie's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really\u2026  I just wanted to know how close you and Eric were that's all.  But you really seem to like him, so I'm happy for you!\" Jamie lied, as she knew that this would make it easier for her to become Eric's girlfriend if Eric really did love Kim.</span></div></div>",

She felt a brief tingling in her head, and then she assumed it was over.  <i>My name is Kim Weiss\u2026 wow that's so weird!  It feels like that's always been my name.  I didn't even think about it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jamie,\"  The new 'Kim' started, \"Thanks for the relationship advice.\"<br>\r\n'Jamie' smirked, \"Oh is that what you call it now Kim?

The name change had replaced all memories of ever being called Jamie, but she was still technically aware of the change.  So now Kim activated her pendant once again, this time focusing on swapping her place of residence, and all of her belongings with Jamie.  Again, nothing visible happened, but the new Jamie would now believe she lived with Audrey and Audrey's parents.  Kim now had memories of living in this house, and owned all of the previous Kim's stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was going according to plan.  All that was left now, was to swap families so that the new Jamie would believe Audrey is her little sister, and make sure she made everyone aware that Jamie was an 18 year old again.  If Audrey had even gotten to Kim's awareness, surely every one of Jamie's old friends would think she was still a 13 year old.  That would have to be fixed later.  But for now, the new 'Jamie' needed a new family!</span></div></div>",

Audrey didn't know why this appealed to her, but she thought it was just be so fun.  The biggest kick out of it was that they weren't even Catholic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Audrey all my friends go to public school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be losing your old friends, you will be making new ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Kim, I really need your help\u2026  Please.\"  Eric said, out of breath as he had run all the way to his girlfriend's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim Weiss stood in the doorway to her house, wearing the school's volleyball uniform which consisted of a sleeveless sport top with a sports bra underneath and tight shorts.  Her wavy blonde hair was pulled up into a ponytail and she was looking at Eric, her boyfriend, with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong honey?  Did something happen?  Do I need to call the police?\"  Kim pulled out her phone and got ready to start calling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the police won't help.  This is beyond them.  Is there somewhere we can talk that's\u2026 private?\"  Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim nodded and brought Eric up into her bedroom, and locked the door.  Her parents knew when the door was locked not to disturb her, especially when her boyfriend was visiting.  Their daughter was a responsible 18 year old and they gave her a lot of free reign.  Kim sat down on her bed, and pulled Eric over to sit next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to keep me in suspense?  What's the deal with running all the way here and acting like you just saw a ghost?\"  Kim teased Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric knew this would be hard for her to believe, and he didn't even have the ring to prove it to her.  He'd have to get her to trust him somehow.  Naturally she should trust her boyfriend, but what he weas about to tell her was completely off the wall\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so just bear with me.  You're not going to believe this but\u2026 yesterday James found this\u2026 thing. It's basically a ring of some kind that fell from space or I don't know where it came from.  There was a big storm and there was a flash of light and he found it in the crater in the park.\"  Eric paused to see if she was already lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim stared blankly at him, and put her hand over her face, \"A ring from space\u2026 ok?  Pleeeeease tell me this isn't another one of your dorky roleplaying games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm serious, this really happened in real life!  Just forget about how stupid it sounds.  Alright so look.  The ring told James it had some kind of magic power, that it could swap bodies around or some bullshit, I didn't believe him either.  Then he tried it on me, and it didn't work.  So we figured it was just a joke, and he gave it to Audrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued, \"So today I go over there and there's this little girl that answers the door that looks just like James, but she's completely girly and 13 years old.  And I see his little sister Audrey there and I swear to god she's like the same age as you and me.  The little girl answered to 'Jamie' and Audrey says she completely changed James into a little girl, and stole his age.  Now Audrey's the big sister\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim stared at him for a second and then closed her eyes and flopped back on the bed, with her arms flailing out to each side.  \"Eric!  What the fuck are you talking about?!\"  She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me!  It's all true!  I don't know what Audrey did but I know she used the ring, and she tried to change me too.  I got out of there just in time.\"  He insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim knew that Eric was not the type of guy to believe in the supernatural, he didn't even like science fiction or the other dorky stuff that James was into.  So if Eric was so sure of himself, then maybe he was telling the truth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so what if this is really true?  What then?  What the hell am I supposed to do to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we've gotta get the ring back obviously.  And I didn't want to do it alone, I needed a plan.  And we need to get James back to normal somehow.\"  Eric explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if we try to steal the ring wouldn't his sister just change us like she changed James?  I mean\u2026 if this is for real of course.\"  Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric thought for a second.  \"Well\u2026 You've never met James's sister before right?  Audrey has no idea you're my girlfriend.  Right before I left she said now that she turned into an 18 year old she's going to college this year, so I assume that means she switched school roles with James.  This means she's going to be taking James's classes most likely.  If you can meet her at school and try to become friends with her, you could try and get close and find an opportunity to take the ring.  Just act like she's a new student and you want to be friends with her.  You're a popular girl so she will want to be on your good side if she wants to survive high school life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that could work\u2026  What about you?  If she sees you she'll use this ring on you\u2026\"  Kim asked, worried for his safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to stay away from her at school, but I also want to try and track down James.  He's probably going to her old middle school and I can't show up at his house or she'll be there for sure.  If you can befriend her you can let me know when she's away from home so I can track down James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim smiled, \"Sounds like a plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim still wasn't fully convinced any of this was real, but she trusted Eric enough to know that he was seriously worried about this, so she agreed to play along for now.</span></div></div>",

But since he was so insistent, she figured that she should at least help him along.  After all, Eric was her boyfriend, and his word carried a lot of weight.  They'd been dating for several months now, and she was starting to think this could be a long term thing.  But with all this talk of magic and other things, Kim wondered what she was getting herself into\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Kim drove to school, making sure to stay away from Eric.  If what he said was true, they didn't want Audrey finding out who Kim was.  Audrey seemed to have it out to anyone who knew James, and Kim had only met him a few times when he hung out with Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kim entered the school, she was greeted by her girlfriends, Ella and Britney, who were excited to see her.  Kim was very well known around the school as being the star volleyball player and for being members of just about every other after school club she could find time for.  She was the type of girl everyone expected to have run for student president, but she decided her work load was too much, and didn't bother trying.  If she had however, she would likely have been one of the most popular candidates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing this well-known had its advantages, as she had connections all over the place.  She decided to see if she could find Audrey and invite her into her circle of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ella, did you hear about a new girl transferring to the school today?  I heard she's a cute redhead, just your type.\"  Kim smiled, teasing Ella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was their secret that Ella had kissed a red headed girl at a party one time.  It was on a dare but Kim and Brit were the only two who knew she actually liked it.  They didn't hesitate to tease her about being bi-curious from that day on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla blushed, but nodded, \"Um\u2026 Yeah actually I heard her name's Audrey.  She already made waves in first period by showing up and humiliating the teacher somehow.  I only heard through the grapevine, but they say she's got quite an attitude.\"Ella was Kim's eyes and ears throughout the school.  She heard everything that went on through her network of friends that texted her every little juicy detail.  Kim smiled, \"Interesting\u2026 so maybe he was onto something.\"  Kim mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing.  Good work Ella.  What kind of attitude did she have?  Is she a troublemaker?  I'd like to meet her\u2026\"  Kim made clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they say she's quite pretty, and likes making fools of guys who hit on her.  She seems very headstrong but is staying out of trouble for the most part.\"  Ella informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit finally interjected, \"Wait\u2026 Kim you're not actually thinking of making friends with this new girl?  She sounds like a bitch, I wouldn't bother.  You're just giving her the attention she wants if you do anything but ignore her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Brit, don't worry about it.  I just want to see what she's like.  If she's cool, then maybe she can be our friend.  She's new so she probably doesn't know anyone yet.  If we get to her first, she could be on our side.\"  Kim said with a pleasant smile, reassuring Britney.</span></div></div>",

They found her leaving the lunch line and headed over to invite her to sit with them.<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nAudrey had just gotten her lunch and was looking for a place to sit when she spotted two girls heading her way. One was tall and athletic looking with blonde hair in a pony tail and wearing sneakers, shorts and a tank top. The other was a bit shorter with long brown hair and wearing 4 inch heels and a dress. Audrey had been playing with the TSAR a little throughout the day and decided it would be fun to change a few things about these two...<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nAs Kim led Ella over to the new girl, she couldn't help checking her out. Audrey was short, with long auburn hair and quite pretty. She blushed a little as she remembered Ella And Brit teasing her about her attraction to readheads. She still hadn't told her boyfriend Eric about that. Maybe he would like it if she let him watch her make-out with another girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's daydreaming was interrupted by Ella as she greeted the new girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Ella and this is my friend Kim. We heard that you're new to the school and wanted to invite you to eat lunch with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey smiled and said \"Thanks, I was hoping someone could introduce me to people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat down at their usual table Ella introduced Audrey to Brit and the rest of their friends and explained that she was the star volleyball player, a member of several after-school clubs and that she was planning on going to college for an engineering degree. Kim sat with her legs crossed, one of her heels hanging off her toes and toyed with her dress under the table. She was always impressed with Ella and wondered how she managed to handle so much. Kim was glad she was only the head cheerleader, and was planning to become a fashion designer. It gave her a lot more time with Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked, Kim decided Audrey seemed nice enough, but then she noticed Audrey playing with a strange looking ring on her finger. She brushed her long blonde hair behind her ear and wondered how she could find out more about the ring without making Audrey suspicious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's note: I apologize if this chapter is rough, this is my first time actually writing anything. I liked this story path and hope people will continue any of the paths where Audrey abuses the TSAR.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The TSAR was capable of swapping everyone memories about Ella and Kim, but Audrey didn't think to do that.  Audrey watched the exchange and was actually pleased.  Ella had all the memories and skills to be the star volleyball player but the team probably wouldn't let the cheerleader (as they thought) play.  Kim would probably have just as difficult time when she showed up for cheerleading practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Kim didn't think there was anything strange about Audrey.

She was clearly dressed for practice, but was confused to see what she thought was her team standing around waiting for someone.  She cheerfully waved to everyone like she was there every day and knew all of them by name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Sorry I'm late, were you all waiting for me?  We should be practicing!\"  Ella announced to the volleyball team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were blank stares and the team looked to eachother whispering things to eachother.  Then one of the girls, Carrie stepped forward with her hand on her hip, staring Ella down.  \"What is this Ella?  Are you here to mock us or something?  You're dressed like you're part of the team, did you steal Kim's uniform?  We all know you prefer cheerleading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla's ego is suddenly deflated and she has no idea what Carrie is talking about, \"What? No I'm here to practice, I've never been a cheerleader!

He thought maybe she was just feeling extra girly today, and wanted to compliment her.  He had no reason to suspect she'd had her entire style and school life swapped with her best friend Ella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim beamed at Eric and gave him a deep kiss, loving the attention he was giving her.  \"I uh... well you know I like dressing like this!  I have an image to uphold anyways!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked at her suspiciously for a second and then smiled.  \"You certainly do, I just can't believe I'm dating someone that looks this good.  I guess this means your volleyball practice was cancelled, otherwise you'd be in your uniform?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim seemed to shrug it off, \"Oh no, I don't need to be in uniform until tomorrow, but Ella's practice was today.  Don't worry about her, I'll cheer for her at her game next week.  You're coming right?\"</span></div></div>",

She's the superstar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be you.  Ella is a girly girl who loves cheerleading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ella a girly girl??? I don't believe it.\"  Kim imaged Ella of all people being a girly girl.  Kim couldn't remember the last time she saw Ella in a dress.  She always had her hair in that ponytail.  Although Kim thought that with a little fashion tips, Ella could be quite pretty.  Kim smiled at the thought.  Then it occurred to her.  Eric was saying that she was a jock like Ella.  She didn't like it.  She liked being a girl.  What use is there in being a girl if you don't wear pretty clothes.  Kim loved Ella to death, but she acts a bit too masculine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she and you must have swapped personalities.\"  Eric hadn't talked to Ella but he assumed that Ella and Kim had swapped personalities or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was like her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and I'm sorry this happened to you.  I'll have to find Audrey and get everything back to normal.\"  Eric started to look for Audrey who was in the gym watching practice.  Eric didn't know exactly what to do.  He really couldn't force Audrey to change people back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim like who she was now.  She like Ella, but she didn't want to be like Ella.  Ella is a wonderful person but it's better to be a cheerleader than an 'sports star.'  Even if you were going to be a sports star, you could be fashion conscious off the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Look she should be in James' old classes, his second class is Living Environment with Mr. Conti.  You can look for her there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does she look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"like James, its his sister.

When the day was over, he went to the local middle school.  Eric was a senior and had a light course load so he got out in plenty of time to catch James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he got there, he couldn't find James or Jamie anywhere.  He waited for all the students to leave.  While waiting he saw something weird.  One of the 'students' caught his eye.  At first he thought she was a teacher or something, she was in her thirties and she wore a nun's habit, but the way she interacted with the other students she was definitely treated like a kid, not an adult.  When her 'mother' came and took her my the hand and scolded her for not coming one right after class (which included two hard smacks on the woman's bottom) Eric knew that Audrey had made another switch.  If the nun was here, that must mean that Jamie was going to the local parochial school.  He wasn't sure but it was a good place to start.  Eric wondered if James was now a nun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone let out and Eric was sure Jamie wasn't there he returned to Kim's house to see how it was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well did you find her?\" Kim inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I have a lead.  How was it at your end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was great.  Audrey is so cool.  Everyone knows her and she knows everyone.  But she spent time with me.  You know she is on the volleyball team and is one of the best players there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's on the team with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me on a sports team?  You are nuts.

I have never been good at sports.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used to be.\"  Then Eric took a good look at Kim's room, it was mostly the same although all of Kim's trophies and other sports stuff was gone.  Eric felt horrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You used to be a great athlete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wasn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you were, you have to believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some convincing but Eric did get Kim to believe somewhat what he said was true although she had no memory of ever playing sports.  \"We'll continue with the plan then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I can't be responsible if things get worse for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she trusts me now.\"  Now it was Kim's turn to convince Eric to continue with the plan.  Her main point was if they didn't she would never get her athletic ability back which she didn't actually remember having.<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Audrey arrived home from school.  She got home late since she was trying out for the volleyball team.  Audrey knew the team was one member short now and she had the ability to fill that vacancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home she was greeted by Jamie.  Jamie was always happy to see her big sister.  Jamie was still wearing her school uniform except she had taken off her maryjane shoes and was walking around in her stocking feet (technically navy colored knee socks.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was now a very sweet little girl.  Attending Catholic school had improved her manners.  Audrey started her homework on the diningroom table.  Jamie decided to join her also doing her homework.  When Audrey was done she addressed Jamie, \"Hey, would you like to learn how to wear makeup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't allow us to wear makeup at school,\" the good girl in Jamie reminded both Audrey and herself..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not at school.  All girls wear makeup.  C'mon, I\"ll teach you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie didn't need much coaxing she was dying to try on makeup, but her mom never taught her and the school said she was too young.  But if Audrey thought it was OK, that was fine with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two were in the bathroom and Audrey was teaching Jamie the basics of putting on makeup.  Audrey had acquired her advanced makeup knowledge from a girl she saw in the bathroom of the high school.  There was a lot to teach, but Audrey was only going to teach Jamie the basics.  Audrey would show her what to do by doing to herself and then she would show Jamie in the mirror.  Finally Audrey would wash off the makeup and have Jamie try it herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying on the makeup, Jamie made mistakes and after one really bad one, she said, \"OH SHIT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that anyway for a young lady to talk?\" Audrey chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll try and do better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you,\" Audrey thought and removed all knowledge of bad words out of Jamie's head.  It was as if she hadn't had them at all.  She didn't even know the word piss, the she could do was say go potty or make a doody..  Everything else was totally gone from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, Audrey wondered, what would James think if he saw what 'in effect' he was doing and had become.  It was fun having a cute little sister around.  Jamie seemed to be a happy girl, but Audrey didn't do this so that James could be happy, she didn't want him to be just a happy little girl that was no fun.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it occurred to her, James wasn't aware of what had happened to him, she could let him be aware.  What would he do if he knew what had happened to him?  She decided to let him be aware of who he was.  She did that when Jamie was looking in the mirror after finishing up her last attempt at putting on makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY...  What have you done to me.\" Jamie screamed.  If her knowledge of cussing was still intact she would have said, \"Oh my god, that the fuck have you done to me, bitch.\"  Well maybe not that vulgar but somewhere in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what do you mean JAMIE\" Audrey emphasized James' new name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made me into a little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have?\" Audrey said feigning ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you did, now turn me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn you back? Into what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to be a little boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to be a man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jamie said not thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if your a man, then you can't go to school and be with your little friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie hadn't thought of that.  But she knew she was really a man and so she pressed on.  \"Well, I want to be me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are you.  See yourself in the mirror.\"  Jamie looked in the mirror, this was her face now, she just knew that she should be a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very pretty.  If you were a big man, then you can't wear pretty dresses.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie did like wearing pretty dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing, \"If you were a big man, you couldn't play with your barbies.  If you were a big man, you couldn't go to Joanna's thirteenth birthday party Saturday..  There will be ice cream and cake and lots of games there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men can go to birthday parties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to birthday parties for little girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can turn me back but let me go anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will all think you are a...\" Audrey wanted to say freak or pervert, but without her knowledge of cussing Jamie might not understand so she said, \"strange man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made sense to Jamie.  Jamie's mother had told her to stay away from strangers.  Jamie was trapped, she had been so changed that he actually liked being a little girl.  He knew she should be a man, but he didn't want to give up all that being a little girl entailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jamie thought about it for a while.  She was not happy when she suddenly learned her whole life had been a lie.  She realized that at one point she had been an older boy named James, and her sister had changed her.  But that wasn't her now.  She loved her sister more than anything, and couldn't really blame her for this.  Jamie loved being a girl and getting to wear dresses, it was one of her most favorite things to do.  If she made her sister change her back, she would lose all of her favorite things in the world.  Her school friends, her dresses, her toys, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be a strange man\u2026  I want to stay this way sis\u2026\"  Jamie said, staring into the mirror at her 13 year old face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was shocked, but then remembered all of the mental changes that were still in Jamie, and smiled.  Jamie was aware of her past life, but was so much a girl now that she had no desire to ever change.  That is until Jamie asked a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sis\u2026 you said if you change me back I will be a \u2026 strange man\u2026 for wearing dresses.  But why can't I be the big sis again?  Big sisters can still wear dresses and no one would call me strange.\"  Jamie asked.  Her logic was sound\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey grinned, \"If you're really good maybe I will let you be my age for a weekend, and I can show you what it's like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Audrey got to school and the first thing she did was head to the girl's locker room where the volleyball tryout results were posted.  As expected, she had been picked as the replacement for Kim who was no longer on the team.  Audrey had blown away the competition using the athletic skills she stole from Kim, and she was quickly becoming a rising star at her new school.  She was grateful to have befriended Kim, who was going to be the key to Audrey's popularity.  Kim was well liked, pretty, and had been very active and athletic until yesterday\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Audrey!  You made it on the team huh?\"  Kim said as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!  I can't believe I'm already on the varsity team on my second day of transferring to a new school!  It's all thanks to you Kim.  You've been so helpful showing me around and helping me meet new people.\"   Audrey said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim smiled nervously.  \"Yeah\u2026 No problem.  I'm happy to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was starting to think that maybe Eric was right.  Audrey was definitely acting strange, like it was her first time ever trying out for a sports team.  A girl with this much talent should have been playing volleyball for years already, but Audrey didn't act like that.  And then there was the ring around Audrey's finger that she never was without.  Eric's story all seemed to add up, but Kim had no idea what she could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Audrey could truly swap things around and make Kim completely unaware, then how could she be sure Audrey hadn't taken more than just her athletic ability?  Kim started to wonder if anything was real anymore.  Was her auburn hair actually hers?  Had she once been taller than 5'0\"?  All of these things seemed completely normal to Kim, but she had no way of knowing what Audrey had done to her, if anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Audrey did indeed now have Kim's fabulously blonde hair and 5'8\" height.  She even took Kim's athletic toned muscles for herself, leaving Kim skinny with no muscles to speak of.  All of these things were helping Audrey excel as the new popular girl in school.  One by one, Kim was forgetting about her friends, as Audrey stole her relationships from her.  Every time Kim introduced a friend to Audrey, that friend became Audrey's friend, and it was as if they had never met Kim before today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kim didn't know any of this.  To her, Audrey was just incredibly popular and knew tons of people in the school, and Kim was just lucky enough to be friends with such a popular girl, having no friends herself.  The only real friend she had left was Eric, who she knew she couldn't introduce to Audrey.</span></div></div>",

She cared deeply about Eric, and wanted to help him get the ring back, however was now filled with a general uneasiness towards the ring's true power. Nothing really felt wrong, but how was she to know what the ring had changed and what it hadn't? To remedy her growing problem, she decided to directly ask Audrey about the ring to see what she felt about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight shakiness in her voice, Kim spoke up. \"Hey Audrey, that's a beautiful ring. Where'd you get it from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's face quickly shifted to a guarded expression. \"A friend gave it to me. It is lovely, isn't it? Anyway, I have Calculus to get to, don't want to be late. I'll see ya later, okay Kim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Audrey, bye!\", Kim replied. It was time for her to get to class anyway, and there would be time later in the day to figure out more about the mysterious ring. Kim headed off to her next class, checking her schedule to find her next class was Music Appreciation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Kim, Audrey had switched their academic interests, and by extension, their general intelligence. Audrey's previous knowledge was that of a 13-year old girl despite her outward 18-year old appearance, but now she possessed all of the necessary brainpower to take on Kim's rigorous Engineering degree. Kim now had no idea what she wanted to do in life, and didn't care much for complicated things like math or science. Right now Kim's major was undecided, and with five years of maturity lost it would be a while before she would be able to focus on any long term academic goals. Crucial items like graphing calculators and textbooks disappeared from her backpack, replaced by mostly empty notebooks littered with sketches and doodles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim walked to class, throwing her straight auburn hair over her shoulder, wondering how Audrey could handle whatever derivatives were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs class dragged on, Kim found it very difficult to focus. She could only stare at the clock, daydreaming of hanging out with Eric and occasionally brainstorming plans to find out more about the ring. Fifty long minutes later, she was free, with a few hours open before her next class, Public Speaking. Should she go try to find Audrey again and try to grab her ring? Or should she head home and spend time with Eric, and see if he's uncovered anything else? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not for a proper date anyway, so he called her up and planned a date with her at their favorite Italian Restaurant.  James loved this restaurant and took Lauren there many times.  The food was good and the price was reasonable for his budget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while that he was preparing for his date he debated whether to tell Lauren about the ring or not.  He debated up until the second that he arrived at her door.  He was let in by Lauren's parents and made to wait while she 'got ready.'  James knew she was ready in plenty of time but she always made him wait.  James thought it was some sort of conspiracy agreed upon by all women that they can never be ready to go when their date was at the door.  This clinched it, he wouldn't tell her.  But he wanted to try the ring out so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they got to the restaurant and sat down.  Lauren was talking and normally James would say his piece too, but right now he had other things on his mind.  He wanted to test the ring but he had to do so in a way that was unmistakable but was also slight so that if it didn't work he wouldn't make a fool out of himself.  James was only half listening to what Lauren was saying preferring to look around at the people at the restaurant trying to come up with an idea of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at a table adjacent to Lauren and himself was a British couple.  He could tell by their accents.  Once he was made aware of them, the woman in particular drew his interest.  She was quite very well endowed.  Certainly much bigger than Lauren.  James wondered what a man like that (the gentlemen she was with was tall but very thin with glasses and quite average looking, not in the league of the woman he was with) was doing with him.  James decided to make a swap with them.  But what, it had to be something small but unmistakeable.  He couldn't swap Lauren's boobs with the boobs of the other woman, that couldn't be nice and what if she noticed, how would he explain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he decided to do was swap their first names with the names of the couple.  He'd use her name and see how she reacted.  This was the perfect test.  It was small, no one would notice and he could swap it back without causing a scene with anyone.  He did it.  He found his name was now Steven.  This disappointed him, he was hoping he would end up with a nice British name like Clive or Nigel.  James (now Steven) realized that he was now sitting with Liz instead of Lauren.  But he had to find out so he broke into the conversation, \"L-L-Liz, I have to go to the mensroom.\"  He didn't have to do, but he had to find an excuse to use her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, sure go then.\"  'Liz' said naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had worked, he was now Steven (he knew his name should be James, but he knew it was Steven nevertheless.)  He would quickly go to the restroom and return and try to say Liz as often as he could.  This was so cool.  'Liz' had talked for a while now it was his turn.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While in the bathroom, 'Steven' washed his hands, and kept looking at the ring on his finger.  He realized this was only the tip of the ice berg, and if all the things the ring told him were true\u2026 this could be amazing!  He saw his reflection, and it looked the same as always.  He regretted not getting all dressed up for his date, but it wasn't like he owned a suit or anything.  He had come to the Italian restaurant wearing jeans and sneakers, and a semi-decent button up shirt.  <i>It's fine though\u2026 not like Liz got dressed up either\u2026</i>  He thought to himself, and realized he'd just thought of his girlfriend as Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Steven' started to get concerned, and realized that he was having some trouble recalling his own name.  He just kept thinking Steven was his name every time he thought about it.  He reached inside his wallet and found his driver's license which read: James Barrett.  <i>That's right\u2026 it was James.  Strange how easy that is to forget now\u2026 I better remember to switch that back later\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finally done in the bathroom, 'Steven' returned to the table, seeing his cute girlfriend waiting there, sipping some tea out of a straw.  When he sat down he took a moment to admire her.  She had a cute Korean face with straight black hair.  The two of them had been a couple through most of high school, and knew each other quite intimately\u2026  But something in the back of his mind always wished she would be a little more\u2026 girly.  She wasn't a tomboy, and her hair was very long, but her choice of clothing was a bit plain.  She rarely wore makeup, though he thought she didn't need it to look cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had come to the date wearing similarly plain clothes to him.  She was wearing black jeans and a T-shirt with cute variations of certain game characters she liked, with a light jacket on over top of that.  'Steven' didn't mind her look, but he suddenly noticed the British couple again, and how much well-dressed they were.  Sure they were adults in their early thirties most likely, but they dressed much better than the two teens.  <i>That Lauren lady\u2026 wait\u2026 no that's not Lauren, that's Liz's name\u2026 I mean Lauren's name\u2026  Shit whatever.  That British lady is pretty attractive\u2026 I wonder if this thing can swap outfits?  Too bad about the tits though, everyone would notice Liz\u2026 I mean Lauren, with giant knockers like that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a simple thought, 'Steven' thought about swapping Liz and Lauren's current outfits.  He didn't really want to affect their whole wardrobe, but he was sure no one would care that Lauren was suddenly dressed nicer when she was going out with her boyfriend.  If anything her parents would probably be glad that she finally put some effort into her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked across the table at his girlfriend, who was no longer wearing jeans and a T-shirt, but was wearing a black PVC dress that was resized to fit her petite body.  If she had something larger than her B cup breasts, the dress might have shown off a lot of cleavage, and she didn't really have much of an ass to fill out the back of the dress either, but it compensated by being a smaller, more form fitting dress.  The dress stopped mid-thigh, something much shorter than Lauren would normally wear, and if he looked under the table, he'd notice she was wearing a pair of leather boots that would boost her height by 4 inches when she stood up.  He wondered how she would handle this, since his girlfriend was never the type to wear heels, despite her short stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made sure to make Lauren and Liz unaware that this wasn't the outfit they both came to the restaurant in, and for good measure he made 'James' (originally Steven) also unaware of the change.  Now the real Liz was wearing Lauren's old clothing, complete with the video game T-shirt that was re-sized for her tremendous bust size.  He chuckled that she would likely have no idea who the characters on the shirt were, but in her mind she would remember owning this shirt for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new 'Liz' was looking fantastic however, in her new black dress and boots, and she had even gained a few pieces of jewelry, a necklace and earrings, which actually looked quite good on her.  To top it all off, James suddenly realized his girlfriend was also wearing makeup now, as it was part of the whole outfit swap.  The tasteful makeup made her look way more attractive than her normal cute look.  James was quite pleased with the results, and no one seemed aware.  The only thing that happened was 'Liz' now wondered why 'Steven' was taking so long to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steven, you don't like what you ordered?  I haven't seen you eating much.  Did you want some of my chicken?  I'm not hungry enough to finish it anyways.\"  The original Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks Liz\u2026 it's not bad I'm just a little distracted.  You look gorgeous tonight by the way!  I don't know if I mentioned it.  You should wear dresses like that more often!\"  James complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's pale Korean complexion went red as she blushed, \"Thanks\u2026 this is the only one I have like this though.  I kinda do like it actually.  I wonder why I've never worn it before?\"</span></div></div>",

He couldn't just remember what it was exactly, well he would remember it eventually. 'Steven' and 'Liz' ordered their food and made some small talk while waiting for it. He knew he was somehow excited to call 'Liz' by her name, but it might be the excitement of knowing how lucky he was having her as his girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress brought them their dinner. A pepperoni pizza for 'Liz' and spaghetti for 'Steven'. 'Steven' just loved spaghetti, it was only too bad that his mom never made it that often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later 'Steven' was already finished with eating while 'Liz' was still busy with her second slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you eat that fast 'Steven', it's a wonder that you don't get cramps from it.\" 'Liz' said surprising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a gift 'Liz', a gift.\" 'Steven' said very proud leaning back. He noticed 'Liz' leaned back as well, smelling something awful. It was then that 'Steven' realized they must have put too many onions in his spaghetti. Clearly he could use some breath mints. 'Steven' grabbed his wallet and looked around for them. He usually had a couple of them in case of an emergency like this. It was then that he came across his driver's license. It clearly stated James as his first name. It then came back to him. The swapping of the names with the British man James. Or was it Steven? He remembered doing the same thing with the British lady 'Laura' and 'Liz'. Better fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick thought 'Steven' switched his name back with 'James' and 'Liz' with 'Laura' while taking a breath mint. He was wondering if the swap worked when he noticed Laura was talking to him. \"James are you there? Your mind seemed to have wondered off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing Laura, just thinking about something. What did you say?\" James asked. <i>It worked, I'm James and she's Laura again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I couldn't take a bite more, do you want it?\" Laura said shoving her plate over to James. It didn't take long for James to finish it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird isn't it?\" Laura suddenly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is? James asked back as he finished the last slice of the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That British couple that just left the restaurant, that lady was wearing a shirt with video game characters on it. Kinda weird isn't it for a woman that age to wear something like that.\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think so too. Wait a sec they left?!\" James asked surprised. James peered through the window and saw how the couple stepped inside a cab and rode away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What have I done? That lady just went off with Laura's clothes, Laura won't be too happy if she finds out.</i> James thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, is something troubling you?\" Laura asked concerned. \"You've been acting weird this whole evening.\"</span></div></div>",

But then James realized if it was only one outfit it wouldn't make much of a difference.  So what if Lauren had one more black dress and maybe some leather boots.  If she didn't like them, she just wouldn't wear them again.  But James had to make sure.  He would go back to Laurens house and find an excuse to look into her closets and see if everything was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, all is well, Lauren.\" James said making sure to include Lauren's name.  \"I just don't think I want to see the movie after dinner, let's go to your house and watch a video.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which video?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know we'll find something on Netflix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you just want to get me home so you can take advantage of me?\" Lauren said with a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to get you home to take advantage of you.  Besides its not taking advantage if you want it too.\" James said returning the smile.  James and Lauren had a mature relationship that didn't need constant sex to thrive.  Not that there wasn't plenty of romance.  But James didn't want to go to Lauren's house for romance this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let's go after dinner.  I want to get these clothes off and put on something more comfortable.  You know me.\"  This was a good sign to James, Lauren didn't like wearing dresses all that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to Lauren's house, Lauren excused herself to get changed.  A few minutes later she returned, everything that she wore was different except her high-heeled leather boots.  She was now wearing skin tight leather from head to toe.  She wore a fitted leather sleeveless tank top with wide straps and a crew neck that came down to the tops of her thigh.  Under that was a pair of tight leather pants that descended into her boots.  James was in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was so great to get out of those clothes and get into something that fits.  When are you going to try this type of thing.  There is nothing better than wearing clothes that used to be part of an animal.\"  Lauren said with a serious and flirty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast James said, \"I do wear clothing that used to be part of an animal, I have lots of wool sweaters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I like what I wear.\"  James had to find a reason to go into Lauren's room and see the clothing she had.  He had been there many times before and besides he knew what she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's watch in your room, instead of down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't have Netflix on my TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll watch it on your computer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OK, you just want me alone in my room.\"  Which was the last thing that James wanted right now.  Maybe not the last thing he was an eighteen year old man, but he had other concerns at the moment.  When he got up to Lauren's room, he knew immediately things had changed.  Looking into her closet he could see her 'everyday clothes' but besides there more than half her clothing was made of leather or PVC plastic.  \"What have I done,\" he thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James couldn't handle it anymore. The shock of seeing Lauren's wardrobe changed into this, was too much for him. This wasn't what he wanted. The only thing he wanted to do was to see his girlfriend in a dress, not give her an entire make-over.  And how would he explain this to anyone? How his girlfriend suddenly wore clothing made of leather or PVC plastic without a notice. And Lauren wouldn't be able to tell the difference, she always remembered wearing clothes like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when James sat down on the floor and bowed low towards Lauren she could only smile nervously as she saw what James was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James? What's wrong? Come on up. We've got a movie to watch.\" Lauren said kneeling down near James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Lauren, I'm so sorry.\" James said depressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? What happened? This entire evening you've not been yourself.\" Lauren said looking worried at James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like that. We better sit down on your bed, it's a complicated story.\" James said standing up and sitting down on Lauren's bed. Lauren looked confused as she sat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then began to explain the story about the ring, how he acquired it and how he used it. Lauren just listened to his story and didn't intervene. \"And so it all happened. I'm so sorry about this Lauren, I have been so stupid about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, I just don't get it why you wanted to see me in a dress. We've been going out for so long. Why didn't you say anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was afraid you would object. I mean I know you don't like wearing a dress, but you look so amazing in it Lauren.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren just leaned backwards against the wall as she looked up. \"Perhaps this is a lesson for the both of us. Perhaps I should be more feminine sometimes and you shouldn't try to change me and just ask it. She said pulling James down and tickling his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, just stop it.\" James squirmed as Lauren continued her tickling attack. \"But how are we going to deal with this situation, I mean everyone including me remembers you not wearing clothes like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might be a problem, although I can't imagine wearing something else than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to swap you and that Liz woman back. But how? I don't know where they could be.\" James said with his hands in his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's think logically about it James. We know they are British, probably on holiday, where could they stay?\" Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Palace Hotel. Of course, why didn't I think about it.\" James said standing up. In an instant his mood went from depressed to confident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you remember it. But we also need to think about what we need to do if they aren't there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren, don't think like that. We need to get there right now.\" Lauren then grabbed James his arm as he wanted to leave immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on James. The reason we're stuck in this mess is because you don't think things straight through. Now you say that I always dressed up a little plain. The way I look now is a bit too much. Then that means we just have to find someone else who dresses up like me and swap them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren, I don't know anyone who dresses up like you. And besides wouldn't we just move the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that isn't right yeah. I know, we just need to find a compromise. Find someone who is fashionable enough that I would wear her clothes, but not too fashionable that it would make people suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good. But first let's go to the hotel.\" James said being ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could just concentrate on finding someone else for me to swap with, the choice is yours James.\"</span></div></div>",

Where do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On Google of course.\"  The two went to Lauren's computer but instead of watching a video as Lauren originally wanted to do, the search for 'specializes in leather clothing.'  They found some manufacturers and a bunch of cleaners.  This wasn't what they were looking for.  On the bottom of the screen was suggested search terms and so they tried 'leather clothing stores'  From their they found a site called 'Leather Fashion Products Retail Store Directory'.  After some searching they found \"Deerskin Neck Leathers\"  The place says its \"has been catering to the leather lovers for over 28 years now with expertise in high quality merchandise at reasonable prices and excellent customer service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds perfect.\" Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, they seem to sell a lot of jackets and shoes.  Not the stuff you are wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine, besides they are close and what can we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, what's the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go in there dressed as I am and say I want to buy something and when you see a woman wearing something 'tasteful' you'll swap with her and then we'll be out of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good plan,\" James agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan went like clockwork.  They when in, browsed a until a salesgirl came over and poof they were out of there, Lauren was back in jeans and a top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let's go home and see what my wardrobe looks like now.\" Lauren said.

Several tops (one of which was made out of leather, but that was reasonable for James), jeans and even skirts for Lauren to wear.

To her, she'd always had this wardrobe.  She was currently wearing a pair of jeans that showed off her cute butt, and a rather stylish V neck blouse with a flowery pattern on it.  Her shoes actually hadn't changed much since the last swap.  Apparently the sales girl who worked at the leather store was wearing a pair of black leather boots with a 3 inch heel.  Her jeans were apparently boot cut, James realized, as they covered over most of the boot, only revealing below the ankle.  It was a sexy look, and James was just glad Lauren was happy with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wanted an explanation, or even a demonstration, now that he had told her about the ring.  He could probably just get away with telling her it was all a prank, but he loved Lauren, and wanted to share the experience with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok ok\u2026  I'll show you a swap\u2026\"  James said as his mind wandered off, staring at Lauren's butt again.  \"Sorry, you know I gotta say this new wardrobe is the best yet.  You look absolutely amazing honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren blushed.  She wasn't good at receiving compliments, she always got embarrassed and shy.  But since they were alone, she didn't mind as much this time.  \"Ok flatterer\u2026 are you gonna show me what this thing can do or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed her body up against his, and stood on her toes to kiss him on the lips.  Even with 3 inch heels, Lauren was still several inches shorter than James, who was not even a tall guy by any means.  She only had her Asian genetics to blame for her height however.  But James kissed her back passionately of course, and even grabbed her butt to help her stand up taller.  Unfortunately all this did was break off the kiss when she started giggling and couldn't control herself.  She did like the feeling of his hands there\u2026</span></div></div>",

How kinky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames just smiled at her.  Lauren looked into her lingerie draw and saw the contents.  It was full of mane's briefs mostly from Hanes and Fruit of the Loom.  \"So what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are those your panties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes, they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at them closely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren picked one up and looked at them, they were clearly men's briefs.  \"So what I like these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are men's underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I like wearing these, they are more comfortable then normal women's panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they have a hole in the front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because they have a hole doesn't mean I have to use it.  They are much better, they are thicker and feel good around my privates.  They aren't thin like the stuff that are made for girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it surprise you if you knew I was wearing woman's panties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you like them.  I don't know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This all makes sense to you doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it does.\"  James then switched everything back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Lauren was holding a pair a panties in her hand instead of the briefs she was just holding.  \"Nothing, I have always wear panties like every other women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you were just saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just saying that these are made for women like me, they are are comfortable.\"  James realized that clothing was too ordinary so he tried something else.  He then swapped his head (including hair) with Lauren.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you referring too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My face,\" James now had Lauren's girlish head on the rest of James' manly body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it, you look cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is a woman's face,\" James said exasperated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, some men have faces that are somewhat feminine.  I still love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this should be your face.\" (not to mention hair and hairstyle and the rest of Lauren's head..)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No its not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look into the mirror.  Lauren did indeed look.  \"What do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you have a masculine face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to insult me??? You know how sensitive I am about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that should be my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish it was,\" Lauren said wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop insulting me.  If you can swap something, then I am still waiting for you to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames realized that he could never convince her.  He could swap her boobs or even her vagina and walk around naked and she would never see the difference.  \"Please you have to believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would if I could, but there is just no proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Lauren thought that his clothes was fine for him, but not for the occasion.  He shouldn't be wearing 'his pajamas' at his girlfriends house.  Well not when her parents were home anyway.  James realized that he couldn't convince her of the power of the TSAR because the TSAR was simply too powerful.  Lauren was angry at him now and she insisted he put on his clothes and go home.  But he couldn't go home the way he was dressed.  He needed to change into his daytime clothes so he could walk home without getting stares or getting into trouble.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf James wanted to put on day clothes he had two choices.

He would have to get a second opinion on this.  Immediately his thoughts turned to Lauren's mom.  If he could show Lauren that other people saw things differently than she did, maybe he could convince her.  <i>But what could I swap that wouldn't reveal to Lauren's mother that something is swapped?  I already have Lauren's head, but her mom would see my male body and freak out!  Unless\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames got an idea but he was a bit scared to go through with it at first.  He loved his girlfriend, but he needed to do this for science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Lauren I'm going to swap some more, and then in a few minutes we're going to go ask your mom if she sees anything different, ok?\"  James said with a nervous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren seemed bored of the game she thought James was playing, but just shrugged and let him get on with it.  James focused on the ring on his finger, and willed his entire body, and current clothing, to swap with Lauren.  He already had her head, but everything below the neck began to change.  His height shrunk considerably, his body became more petite, and he grew B cup breasts on his chest.  His butt grew slightly rounder, and his penis vanished, replaced by Lauren's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the clothing changes.  His height increased a few inches as his shoes became heeled boots, and his jeans were now covering them just like Lauren wore them a second ago.  For a top he now wore Lauren's floral blouse with a hint of cleavage peeking out of the v neck.  The change was complete, he was now entirely Lauren in body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you notice anything?\"  James asked, surprised that he even had her girly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren shrugged with James's body, still oblivious to what was happening.  \"James I'm getting bored of this, you can stop this game.  Let's just watch a movie like we planned\u2026 I'll even let you cuddle up to me like you always like to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled, looking up at his former body, \"Maybe in a minute, but first let's go say hi to your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren sighed in her deeper male voice, and followed her short Asian boyfriend (girlfriend?) out into the living room where her mom was watching a TV show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mom, whatcha watching?\"  James asked her, trying to imitate Lauren's manner of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Lauren, just getting caught up on my dramas, nothing special.  Oh and I see James is over again!  Good to see you James, it's been a few weeks hasn't it?\"  Mrs Tam said in a slight Korean accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up off the couch, and approached Lauren when she addressed him as James.  She even reached over and gave who she saw as James a big hug.  \"Oh I hope you are taking care of my daughter, I hear you two went on another date today. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was speechless, her mother was treating her like her own boyfriend.  \"Umm\u2026 mom it's me.  Lauren\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Tam laughed and patted Lauren's male shoulders.  \"Of course you are honey\u2026 and I'm the President of the US.  Is this a new game you two play?  If it's something you two do in the bedroom I don't want to know about it\u2026.\"  She then turned back to James in Lauren's body, \"Now Lauren you know you can't have him staying here later than 11, that's your father's rules.  But between you and me, he doesn't have to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Tam winked and then sat back down to watch her TV, \"Alright now let me finish watching this show.  Good to see you again James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was left in a state of shock, \"But I\u2026\"<br>\r\n\"Come on James, let's go put on Netflix.\"  James said as he dragged his former body back to Lauren's bedroom.</span></div></div>",

Am I supposed to have a pussy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.\u2026I don't know\u2026?  No? I  guess?  Ugh\u2026\"  Lauren sat down on her bed and put her male hands on her face.  \"You're right that does sound really weird when you put it that way\u2026  I never really thought about why you had a cute female body and I still call you my boyfriend.  And then mom was talking to you like you were me and\u2026 I'm so confused.  Can you please put your pants back on, a hard on is the last thing I need right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames laughed, but it came out like a giggle in Lauren's voice.  He sat down next to Lauren on the bed and put his hand around her shoulder.  \"It's ok, take your time.  I only made this swap just to prove a point.  We can go back to normal if you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal?!  What is normal?!  Are you saying that I normally look like that?  Are you saying normally I'm a short girl with your cute boobs and vagina?  I don't know if I can believe that.  For some reason I thought you've always been the one that looked like that James.\"  Lauren insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sighed, \"I don't know what else to say.  The ring really does work, and I really am in your body right now.  But when I picked up the ring it told me that the people who get swapped are unaware of the changes happening, except for the person wearing the ring obviously.  That would explain why you thought we were normal, but your mom recognized me as you, since I\u2019m in your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren stayed quiet, and continued staring at the wall.  But suddenly James got an idea.  He jumped off the bed, and noticed how his small breasts bounced a bit inside of their bra.  It was a feeling he wasn't used to, but he tried not to think about the fact that he was in his girlfriend's body right now.  He was trying to resist touching himself so much\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright look, let me see\u2026\"  James muttered in his feminine voice as he rummaged through 'his' purse, and found Lauren's wallet inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened it up he saw it still contained Lauren's driver's license, which had her cute female face on it, and all of her statistics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Lauren, here's you.\"  James smiled as he showed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inspected it closely, noticing that it was definitely her driver's license, her name and address looked to be in order.  But\u2026 the picture showed her as a girl.  The girl that James looked like right now.  It said she was Female, 5'3\", with black hair and brown eyes.  That didn't match her at all!  That's when she reached into her own pocket and in that wallet was a license that had James's personal info but his photo looked like a man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to say\u2026 Did you forge these or something?\" Lauren, asked, desperately trying to hold on to what she THOUGHT was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook his head, causing his black silky hair to fall into his eyes.  \"It's all real.  Do you want to swap back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!  I mean that sounds weird\u2026 I don't know how I could handle being in that body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done it your whole life, you just don't remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I just need time to figure all this out\u2026\"  Lauren seemed rather depressed suddenly, and was avoiding looking at James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have time Lauren\u2026  Just let me know what you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect tonight would be like this.  I wanted to come home from our date, maybe watch a movie and then\u2026 you know.  Cuddle up together and see where that took us?\"  Lauren muttered quietly.  She always was a bit shy when talking about sleeping together, even after a few years of being a couple.  \"But now you've shown me all of this and I don't know what's true anymore.  I mean I can't deny the evidence is stacking up, but I just don't want to think about it right now.  Maybe tomorrow you can try this swap thing on us again and I'll try not to forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook his head. \"You don't get it\u2026 everyone will see you as me.  You'll have to go to school as me if we don't swap back.  Are you prepared to pretend to be me?  Would the entire school treating you as James be enough to convince you this is real?  I promise I didn't convince the entire school to be in on a silly prank.  I'm telling the truth.\"</span></div></div>",

I'll let you pick the movie.\"  James smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to be enough to make Lauren happy for now, and so she got up and followed him into the living room.  Lauren's dad, a strict Korean American father, was home now, and was sitting on the couch using his laptop, while his wife watched her drama shows.  James knew that he would have to swap something plainly obvious to make sure Lauren saw the swap.  The first thing he did was swap Mr and Mrs Tam's heads.  Mr Tam now had his wife's feminine face which was wearing makeup, as well as her shoulder length straight hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lauren walked up to her parents, she gasped, \"Oh my god\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it honey?\"  Mr Tam asked in a female voice.  He clearly had his male body underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?  It's good to see you too\u2026 Oh is that James?  Hello.\"  Lauren's father said curtly with his wife's voice.  \"You won't be here past 11 I hope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook his head.  \"No sir, of course not.  I know your rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good.\"  Was all the response he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was still speechless, but before she could say anything, James swapped her parents heads back to normal right before her eyes.  She watched as her father's male head returned to normal, as well as her mother's, and neither of them seemed to notice a thing!  Then she saw her mother begin to transform, and before she knew it, James was sitting on the couch watching TV next to Mr Tam!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she turned to look at James, she saw her mother standing there wearing a knee length dress and flats.  \"Mom\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it now Lauren?\"  James's body asked from the couch.  She noticed James's body was speaking with her mother's voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back to who she thought was her mother, and saw her smiling mischeviously, grabbing her own breast when neither of her parents were looking.  A second later, James transformed back to normal, and her parents were none the wiser.  Mr Tam had been so focused on writing his email that he didn't even notice his wife's brief transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nudged Lauren on the arm and motioned to leave.  Lauren told her parents, \"Ok we're just going to go watch a movie in my room ok?  I promise James will leave by 11.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents agreed, and Lauren hurried back to her room, closing the door quietly.  \"What the fuck just happened?!  You became my mom?!  My dad had my mother's head?!  This kind of thing doesn't just happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames held up the TSAR on his finger, \"It does with this.  I told you it was real.  Now do you believe me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026 yes!  How could I not?  I saw them change with my own eyes, and they didn't even notice!  You're saying that what you did to my mom is the same thing you did to me?\"  Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but only for like 5 minutes.  It was quite fun being you and tricking your mom, but it's no fun when you aren't aware\u2026  I wish I could figure out a way to make it so you can see what happens to you.\"  James wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!  Oh my god I can't believe I didn't believe you at first.  I'm sorry I ever doubted you James.\"  Lauren said as she once again stood up to kiss him on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was expecting just a little peck, but Lauren seemed really into it now.  Quickly they started to make out, collapsing onto the bed.  James hoped this was leading to where he thought it was\u2026  It wouldn't be the first time the two made love as a couple, but that didn't make him any less excited.</span></div></div>",

James nodded as he helped Lauren take off her blouse. He then had the honor of taking off her bra as well, though James was rather nervous. He couldn't help but fumble around with the bra. Why couldn't they invent something easier for men to take off? After a few frustrating seconds James was ready as he threw the bra away. James couldn't help but admire Lauren's petite small breasts. They were beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop staring at them like that.\" Lauren said covering up her bare chest with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, I think you're beautiful just the way you look.\" James said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but let's get on with it.\" Lauren said pulling off her jeans.

James and Lauren had done it a few times and though Lauren said she enjoyed herself as well James always wondered if he did it right. It was then that he also remembered Lauren's parents still downstairs. He could transfer their knowledge about sex with them. Instead of doing it like a couple of fumbling teens they could do it as expert adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might not be such a bad idea after all.

Lauren noticed, \"Good thing you remembered to swap that skill over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled, \"I tried to remember almost everything. But I left you with your knowledge of how to take the bra off. I figured you may need that next time we hang out. I am probably going to easily learn now that I have to do it everyday. There are probably things I forgot though. Keep a record if you notice anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at the clock, \"Oh, crap! You need to get dressed! It's almost time for you to go! Your dad will kill me if you stay even a minute too late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're going to be comfortable with having my parents? It's still weird to think that to the outside world I'm you and you're me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're the only ones who know.\" James gave Lauren a kiss.</span></div></div>",

He felt like a woman inside where it counts but he was still very much a man in many ways.  He knew how to wear a bra now and he would love for his tender breasts to be stroked by a strong hand he also might like to wear dresses, but did he really want to give up watching sports  and playing shoot-em-up video games like guys did.  Did he want to eat more salads and other rabbit foods to maintain his now girlish figure?  Did he really want to associate with Lauren's friends just to talk about the silly daily gossip and other stuff that girls like to talk about?  James didn't have the personality of one person anymore or even two, in fact he had the personality of three people.  His original personality, some of the personality he got from Lauren and lots of the sexual desires and other stuff from Mrs.Tam.  As he was walking Lauren towards the door and then back to his 'old' home all this was occurring to him and he was starting to think that this was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Maaa...Mr. and Mrs. Tam.\" Lauren said as she was leaving the house to join her new family.  When Lauren greeted them, they became quiet immediately before Mr. Tam said, \"Good evening James.\"  But there was a strange look in Mr. Tam's eye.  Lauren recognized it immediately.  She was his daughter and she knew something was wrong.  Then she saw something similar in Mrs. Tam's expression too.  Then she realized it, this switch didn't effect her and James, it also effected her former parents (Mr. and Mrs. Tam)  If Lauren left then Mr. and Mrs. Tam  relationship would never be right.  They wouldn't feel for each other as they should and they would wonder what was wrong with themselves.  They were 'her parents' she couldn't leave them like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

They could solve the problem in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exchanging goodbyes, James bounced back up to Lauren's room. He was actually feeling a little sexually frustrated from earlier and went straight to Lauren's underwear drawer to look for his vibrator. But he didn't find anything there. It took him a moment to realize his mistake. At first he thought his vibrator must be back at his place, then he realized his own body was male and had no need for one. Of course, Mrs. Tam must own one! It's probably in her underwear drawer. However, he wasn't going to go sneaking around Lauren's parents' room looking for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached his hand down in order to satisfy himself the old fashion way. He had no problem starting to arouse himself, but then he started to fantasize. He imagined himself being held in bed by Mr. Tam's strong arms. He suddenly stopped himself. That seemed so wrong. He was imagining Lauren's dad in a sexual manner. And considering he was currently in Lauren's body, that seemed especially weird!  Then he realized, he had so much of Mrs. Tam's sexuality; it made sense that he found her husband attractive. Still, he couldn't get over how strange that was. Ultimately, he decided to let himself go to bed sexually frustrated.</span></div></div>",

If he didn't he could never get to sleep.  But he couldn't just go into the Tam's bedroom and start looking around for it.  He decided to make one quick swap, get the vibrator and then get back to this room and help himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swapped the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Tam and himself so that now for the next few minutes (until he retrieved the vibrator.) he would be Mr. Tam's wife.

He knew he shouldn't keep secrets from his girlfriend, but he no longer felt the same love he once did. He thought of her more as a daughter now, and sometimes you don't tell your own daughter some things simply for your own good. Of course, he wasn't realizing that he only thought this way since he had forgotten to swap back his and Mrs. Tam's relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames opened the door to see Lauren in his body. He gave her a hug and kissed his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gees,\" Lauren said, \"Don't be weird. I know we're close, but it's not like we're actually related. Besides, I'm here to pick up Mrs. Tam anyway...for our date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames could tell she was lying, but he started to put the pieces together.

So that it was James who was now topless except for a bra in Lauren's body.  Lauren then in James' body took off her shirt which now exposed her masculine chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are falling behind, are you doing to get undressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.\"  James then took off his bra by pulling it over his head like a shirt exposing his breasts.  James wasn't concerned about unlatching it to keep from stretching the bra out.  Next he tried to take off her boots, but it took quite an effort and in the end he had Lauren help him take off his leather boots.  Once that was off, it was easy to get completely naked.  Lauren took her time in removing the rest of James' performing a little striptease.  The she threw herself into James' short feminine arms.  Even though James now had the feminine body he was still the male of this tryst and so he took charge of the love making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHHH OHHH!\" James cried out in pleasure as Lauren penetrated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, my parents are down stairs.\" Lauren admonished James in a manly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames decided not to say \"I'm sorry'  But he did try and stifle his moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the both climaxed and fell out of each other's arms.  \"That was great,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you were an animal tonight,\" Lauren replied.  \"But now it's time for the movie and I get to pick.

James wants to see if when Lauren got her body back what clothes she would put on.  Lauren did indeed put on James' underwear first followed by his jeans and shirt.  James got dressed her her clothing.  Not knowing how to properly fasten a bra around himself he put it on like a t-shirt pulling it over his flat chest and then got dressed in the rest of her clothing except the boots.  Once they were both dressed, James resolved to stay clothing swapped until the movie was over and he was ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the movie, Lauren kept interrupting.

Being in his girlfriend's body and the feeling of being penetrating, and having an intense female orgasm was a lot more enjoyable than he expected.  He thought to himself that he might want to try it again.  But not every time, he still liked being the man in the relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James are you listening?  I was thinking what would happen if we swapped two people, like maybe a girlfriend and boyfriend, into each others bodies.  They'd be clueless they were in the wrong body, but everyone would be treating them like the other person.  The girl would be in her boyfriends body but end up going in the girl's bathroom and people would freak out!  Oh that would be hilarious\u2026\"  Lauren said while the movie was still running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Lauren can't it wait\u2026  You picked this movie don't you want to watch it?\"  James moaned, his male body exhausted after the sex.  Though it had been Lauren in this body at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but your ring is so much better than a dumb movie\u2026\" Lauren fake pouted as she cuddled up closer to James, loving that she was small enough to be the little spoon.  If there was one thing Lauren loved was a lot of physical contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames knew that she was always like this, and held her close in his arms looking over her head to see the movie as they lay together in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren interrupted again, \"You know what if we swapped just a part of someone, like the size of their clothing.  The guy would have to wear his girlfriend's clothes cause his would be too small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames chuckled, finding it ironic because at the moment he was wearing Lauren's blouse, jeans, and underwear.  He had swapped clothing preferences after the sex, and Lauren was completely unaware that she didn't normally wear male clothes.  He had to of course swap the clothing sizes because Lauren being so petite, her clothes would be a tight fit on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be fun, but wouldn't their friends start to get suspicious?  If we suddenly started going to school wearing each other's clothes people would laugh and all our friends would think we'd lost our minds.\"  James pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\u2026 yeah I guess we don't want to ruin anyone's reputation.  Didn't you say you were supposed to be able to make people aware of a swap that happens to them?  Like you were trying to with me\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, but I haven't figured out how yet.  This thing never talked to me again after the first time.\"  James shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled, \"Well\u2026 what if I tried it on?  Maybe I could get it to work properly?\"</span></div></div>",

And better yet, James had decided to leave her clothing the same size, and as she gained weight, she started to muffin top over her jeans.

So if you win you can swap something about me with someone else\u2026  But if I win\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not exactly fair.  If I win you won't even know about the swap, it'll hardly be bad for you if you aren't aware of anything different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're just going to have to try to make me aware then aren't you?\"  Lauren smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\u2026 but let's agree that we won't pick any swaps that are obvious and could draw attention to the ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat down to start an intense game of chess, with the victor getting to swap the other person\u2026</span></div></div>",

This will work out for everyone and it's just such a small thing,\" Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when we go to movies, neither of us is happy.  I mean I don't like those boring action pictures you like.  And I know you just can't get into the romance stories I like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no guy likes chick flicks...That is why they are called chick flicks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't true.  But nevertheless, I want you to swap your interest in movies with Carly over there.\"  Carly was a casual friend of Lauren.  They knew each other and would talk occasionally, but not about anything important.  They usually made small talk about celebrities, the weather or movies.  It was this last topic that enabled Lauren to know that Carly had similar interests in movies as she has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to like chick flicks,\" James mock whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, once the swap is done, it'll be as if you had always liked them.  Believe me, if we see more romances then you will benefit aftert the movie is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We see them now.\"  James took Lauren to some movies that she liked.  It was all part of the ritual of dating.  But Lauren knew he didn't really care for them and that was a drag on her mood after.  She liked that he would take her, but she felt bad that he didn't like them himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be better if we both like them.  Besides, you said anything.\"  James didn't say anything, but it seemed such a small thing.  James used the TSAR to make the switch and now Lauren thought that James had always liked the romantic tear jerkers (and other 'chick flicks') that she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it did,\" James said, although only he knew what the wish was.  Once the TSAR made the change, Lauren didn't remember what the request was since as far as she knew, James had always liked chick flicks so why would she request that.  \"Do you remember what your wish was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, no not really.  But if you tell me it worked that is good enough for me.  Now it's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I have something in mind.\"  Lauren had a very cute, but pert butt.  James preferred a big round butt.  What James wanted wasn't called a butt at all it was a BOOTIE.  James swapped Lauren's butt with a girl who had a butt what James lusted after, although he never do so in front of Lauren.  James was sensitive to Lauren's feelings  James used the TSAR and soon, Lauren had a wonderful bootie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, swap away.\" Lauren said although James had already done so before she said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, everything seems the same to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames escorted Lauren a glass display case so Lauren could see her reflection..   \"Do you see anything different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No everything looks as it should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even your hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it looks perfectly normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know how you have always liked long straight jet black hair.  So I swapped your mousy hair with another girl so you can have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to have mousy hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I thought I would do something nice for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it.  But you know it feels like I have always had hair like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't,\" James lied.  Lauren threw herself into James' arms, kissing him for giving her such a 'gift.'  While Lauren was kissing James' face, James hands were messaging Lauren's new very big, very round backside.  No one would ever know that Lauren wasn't like this.  James didn't think Lauren would be as appreciative if she knew what James really did swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After they kissed, Lauren noticed James looking at her strangely.  He was acting much more affectionate and loving than he usually did, a bit feminine in fact, the way a girl might act around her significant other, not James's usual attitude.  The TSAR had made sure to make Lauren unaware of James's new appreciation of romance movies, but if any other mental changes had slipped through, the TSAR hadn't taken those into account it would seem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm, I wonder if that was one of the things I asked him to swap?  He's acting so romantic lately, I think I like this!  He never used to be so touchy-feely in public before...</i>  Lauren thought to herself, trying to figure out what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe positioned her ample butt in his lap, cuddling into his arms, and enjoying this slightly more affectionate version of James.  Of course, Lauren was still completely unaware of her new butt size, and in fact was quite proud of her juicy rear.  She enjoyed plopping it in James's lap, feeling a bulge forming between his legs, causing her to smirk playfully.  But she had to remember, they were still at school, and anyone could be watching, so she left that alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well James, I think these swaps are already working out for us, whatever they are.  What should we do with the ring next?  Maybe this time I can be aware of what you change?\"  Lauren asked, still sitting on his lap with her arm wrapped around him, looking into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean next?  Did you want to change more?  We're going to have to go back to class any minute now.\"  James responded, still caressing Lauren's rear with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right, of course.  School... and all that.  Hey!  We should use it some more after class is over, what if we went out on a date tonight?  Maybe dinner and a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled, \"That sounds lovely hun, I know just the movie...  I...  Hmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I think I know a movie we'll both love.  You know that new one that opens tonight?  The one with the two best friends who fall in love with the same guy?  That one looks hilarious!\"  James suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren didn't question it, thinking this had always been James' preference in movies.  \"That sounds great!  Oh man I can't wait, it's been so long since we've had an actual proper date, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames gave her a quick peck on the cheek.  \"Has it?  Well sweetie, that changes today.  Make sure you're ready, cause I'm going to treat you to a date like you've never had before.  As kind of... a celebration of finding this lovely ring, and sharing it with you.  Maybe I'll teach you how to use it too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was settled, Lauren felt that something was definitely off, but she didn't want to say anything.  James seemed so much more in tune with his romantic side, and even slightly feminine, but she was loving it.  It was just what she wanted to spice up their relationship.  So they said no more and hurried off to their last two classes of the day before they were late.  The whole time, Lauren was staring at the clock thinking of what to wear for their date tonight, and thinking of ways she could use the ring if James let her try it on!</span></div></div>",

Usually for a movie like this, James spent most of the time during the movie trying not to look bored and waiting for it to be over.  This gave him lots of time to think about how to get closer to Lauren.  But quickly he got involved in the plot.  The movie was heartwarming and funny and he wondered how he ever liked the movies he was supposed to like.  They seemed much too loud and had too many silly stunts.  Stunts were OK, but a whole movie full of explosions he could do without.  He instinctively moved into closer with Lauren.  There wasn't a plan as with the other movies, he simply felt closer to her and it was only natural this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie, they both had something to talk about.  Both really enjoyed the movie and there was a lot to say about it.  Not that both had agreed upon every point, but as compared with the usual conversation after a movie which was simply, \"Did you like it?\" and the other one saying \"Yes\" regardless of how they felt because they didn't want to hurt the other ones feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the movie as a starting point and the closeness that was in the air, Lauren told James,\"You know it isn't fair for you to make a swap that concerns me and only you know what has happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's the way the ring works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me have the ring and see how it feels to know something has changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I do, but...\"  But feeling the way that James was feeling he had to give into Lauren after she promised not to 'do anything big.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't make be into a woman or anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?\"  Lauren promised and James gave her the ring.  Due to the movie and it's end of the the two main characters getting married, Lauren was feeling very romantic.  When James gave her the TSAR she used it to change James and her relationship.  She swapped it with a young married couple and when she was done as far as James and everyone else knew, James and Lauren were a married couple.  Several changes were made to their living arrangements and other things to make a marriage between the two possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, honey, I made my swap.  I didn't do anything BIG. Do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Darling, I can't tell anything has changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh something small.  No one will notice.\"  James now that he was married to Lauren loved her ever more.  It was a love formed not by the TSAR directly, but due to the newly shared experiences that they must have now since they are a married couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess not.\" James patting his chest in a mock manner to indicate he didn't have large boobs on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go home,\" Lauren said flirtaciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Maybe I'll convince my parents to let you stay the night...\"  She added playfully, as a test to see how he'd react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut James seemed confused.  \"Your parents?

Holy crap, this ring really did work didn't it?  James and I live together, but... where?</i>  Lauren thought, as she inspected the ring on her finger again.  She just realized she was still wearing it, and James hadn't asked for it back yet, so she didn't say anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh... no it's fine, I prefer going straight home anyways.  You... know the way right?\"  Lauren asked, realizing she still had no memory of this house, but a blurry image of it was slowly appearing in her mind.  As were some vague memories of their wedding, which she now regrets she completely missed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames chuckled, \"Of course, I'm not THAT bad with directions.  We only drove like a block to get here remember?  You can be so forgetful sometimes sweetie.  But I still love you all the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Lauren might have been irked by that comment, but she let it slide, since he was right.  She would have to get caught up on all the changes that had happened as a result of the TSAR.  She also began to worry about the couple she had swapped with.  Were they now only dating?  Did they somehow move in with James' and Lauren's parents?  She shook her head and tried to focus on the present, wondering what kind of house they both now lived in together.</span></div></div>",

Lauren got into the passenger side and James took the drivers seat.  They didn't live a block away from the movie theater, James was exaggerating, but it was still quite close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way 'home', Lauren looked at her finger it had the TSAR on it.  But then she noticed her other hand.  She now sported a wedding ring and an engagement ring.  This was tangible proof that she was indeed married.  Lauren turned on the dome light in the car to get a better look at the rings.  She adored them.  The wedding band was just a simple gold ring, but the engagement ring was something special.  It had a diamond in a fancy setting and was something that a teenager like James could never afford.  She fell in love with it instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking at my ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you looked at it long enough???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never tire looking at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even after we have been married all these years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word 'Years' echoed in Lauren's head.  How long had they been married.  It couldn't be too long, they were both teenagers.  The dome light was still on and she took a good look at James.  He wasn't a teenager anymore.  As the car pulled into the driveway of a lovely suburban home that apparently belonged to James and herself, Lauren realized that James was clearly older.

She quickly dug into her purse to find her ID, and discovered that she was now 21, a full three years older than she had been when she woke up this morning.  Seems the couple had been married for three years, so the ring had assumed they got married right out of high-school, and have since had three years of marriage together.  The photo on her ID proved that she hardly looked any different, just somewhat more mature than she remembered.  But other than that, she was, and still felt, like the same old Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Years... yes, it's been three hasn't it?\"  Lauren asked, fishing for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stopped in his tracks, almost looking panicked.  He wondered if Lauren was testing him, but he was now a hopeless romantic, and could never forget their anniversary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course sweetheart, it's been three years to the day.  Why else would we be going out to a movie and our anniversary dinner and you got all dolled up.

I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren hadn't even realized it, but she was in fact wearing a dress, a designer one in fact which she guessed was worth a few hundred dollars at least.  Her body was the same as before, but the dress hugged her body, pushing up her average breasts, and showing off her large butt that James gave her.  A part of her thought this dress was a bit too fancy for her tastes, but she suddenly realized she loved the way it looked on her.  Maybe her tastes had matured over three years of marriage?  She'd gone from an artsy, shy teen, to a...  She realized she had no idea what she was now, and just how did they afford all this anyways?  She shook her head and promised to figure that out later, but was eager to get inside and see her new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren rushed ahead as quickly as her dress heels would allow, and unlocked the front door.  She put her hand over her mouth as she took in a lovely home, decorated with high quality real wood furniture, a fully decked out TV and entertainment center, and a fully stocked kitchen.  She also noted the small Christmas tree snugly sitting in the corner, casting a soft rainbow of colors over the dimly lit living room.  It looked like an actual adult house, not a house that two people straight out of high school would live in.  She also noted there were only two presents under the tree, waiting to be opened.  Part of her was relieved that no one else lived here, and she could have some alone time with her boyfr-no, her husband.  She smiled at that thought, and seemed to give no conscience to the fact that she may have stolen another couple's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped out of her daydreaming when the feeling of James' hands wrapped around her shoulders, and hugged her close to his chest.  He leaned down to plant a kiss on her neck and her knees nearly gave way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God this is all so perfect... too perfect almost.  The ring wouldn't just do all this out of generosity would it?  There must be a catch...</i>  Her mind was racing with possibilities now.  She expected to discover something horribly wrong at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?  You're going to catch cold if we just stand here in the doorway.  I can only warm you up so much before we get to bed.\"  James said with a grin, continuing to embrace her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When did James get so smooth... it's like he knows how to push all my right buttons now...  I suppose he would, if we've been together for so many years.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and returned the hug, burying her face into his soft jacket for warmth.  \"Alright then, shut the door and we'll warm up in a minute.  I just want to relax for a bit first, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren didn't bother even stepping out of her heels as she hurried off to look through all the rooms of the house.  She found an office, two guest bedrooms, and of course, their own bedroom.  It all seemed so damned perfect, and it was really starting to bother her.  Then she suddenly realized she was still wearing the ring after all this time.  James still hadn't said a word about it...  <i>Did he forget about this...?  And worse... what if this thing has been making all my thoughts into reality?  I dreamed of having a lovely house and hear it is.  Maybe it stole someone's house and gave it to me instead, just by thinking?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the ring off, and threw it in her purse, as she collapsed onto the bed in an exhausted huff.  She James in the living room turning on the TV, and just lay there for a moment, letting everything sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lauren,\" She said to herself, \"I've read too many fantasy stories to know that magic like this doesn't come free.  This is all way too perfect, think...  Losing three years of my life is... well it's bad, but look where my life is now.  I could barely ask for more at this point, there must be something I'm not seeing...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lost in thought about what had happened, Lauren felt a nibbling at the back of her neck.  It was James, trying to be romantic.  Lauren found she liked this type of playful contact and started to giggle.  She discovered she liked it a lot even though as far as she knew it had never happened to her before.  But like a person who has been married to a particular person for many years, James knew exactly how to 'seduce' his wife.  James was in the mood since he was now a 'hopeless romantic' and this was his anniversary.  Worry about how things had changed left Lauren's mind as more carnal and pleasurable thoughts and feelings filled up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were done James asked Lauren, \"OK, I give up what did you wish for with the ring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you tell?\" Lauren said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around at Lauren and then himself, \"Nope, everything seems just the same.  Tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be quite honest with you, I didn't do anything.\"  Lauren was just fooling around to see if James noticed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't do anything with your anniversary wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No everything is perfect.  What else do I need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a better job so we can pay down the mortgage faster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had wished for that, then I would have wished for the house to be ours free and clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, how about for a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't need a ring to have a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough.\"  After several more suggestions which were never close to the mark.  \"I guess you didn't wish for anything.  In that case give me back the ring and I'll wish for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you wish for?  To make me a bimbo stripper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you one already?\" James said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren mock punched James in the chest with a big smile on her face at his little joke.  \"I have the ring, how about you be the bimbo stripper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes I would.  I would love to see you strutting your stuff on stage wearing just a little G-string, high heels and pasties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you would?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, do it, I dare you.\"  A moment later, James still naked then robotically got out of bed, stepped into Lauren's discard heels on the floor and started dancing sensuously.  \"OH MY GOD,\" he said semi-giggling, \"you did it.  Make it stop, Make it stop.\" but he kept on dancing to imagined music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren burst out laughing.  \"You are just so silly.  That is why I love you so much.\"  It was at this point that Lauren decided she couldn't tell James.  This was just so perfect, how could she let him know that their marriage wasn't real.  It was just a trait swap from the TSAR.  Lauren then got out of bed and tackled her loving husband as a prelude to a second round of love making.  The two fell asleep in each other arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Lauren got up first.  In the light of morning, she wondered about her marriage.  Was it really a cheat or was this love real.  She certainly didn't feel like this before she made the wish.  They were just dating then.  But now they seemed to be the perfect loving married couple.  Should she let this continue or return to the way there were and let their relationship grow naturally.  She also wondered if she could undo the wish without finding the couple that she had swapped with.  Was there an 'Undo' feature of the TSAR?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He was wearing a tight-fitting pink shirt and skinny jeans that she was sure she had leftover when she last spent the night at his house.<br>\r\nHis hair was meticulously groomed and he was wearing a tad bit of make-up to enhance his features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry it took forever!

Lauren noticed that his hips were swaying a bit in a sexy, feminine way, which again was strangely attractive to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey barely made it to the movie on time. James got really into it. It was heartwarming and funny, not anything like those boring action movies that involved<br>\r\nfar too many explosions and noise. He didn't mind some action, but so many of those movies he used to like were so stupid. James himself didn't notice his other changes to his personality and mannerisms. It just seemed natural for him to put more care into his appearance\u00a0. They also usually overly sexualized women, and while James was attracted to the opposite gender (as displayed in his appreciation for his girlfriends rear), he didn't have much interest in senseless fanservice anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was finding himself quite jealous of the lead actresses' clothing. To him women's fashion was just beautiful and he should look his absolute best at all times, especially for his amazing girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Lauren's eagerly discussed all aspects of the movie after it was done. The couple felt closer then they ever had before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then...I was wondering if I could use the ring to make a swap?

Like I said, I don't have anything to wear that I like. These are your clothes.\" James said. Lauren thought it over for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me.\" Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames squeed and performed his wish.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tried to switch back, but he couldn't seem to. He looked over at Lauren's window, the shade was down. He wondered if being within visual sight of someone was a restriction of the ring. At least he hoped so! He didn't want to be stuck with Lauren's clothing preference -- though those boots on the ground were cute!

That would be perfectly fine.  Then when he saw Lauren in the morning he would swap their clothing preferences.  As he walked home he got to thinking, \"What clothes will be there?\"  He didn't know if he swapped just this one outfit or all of his entire wardrobe with Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wondering about them when he bumped into Mrs. Winters.  When she saw him, she noticed that he wasn't wearing a mans shirt but a blouse and that his jeans were tighter than they should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you dressed like that?\" Mrs. Winters' inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't have an answer but he knew that if she swapped with him then she wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  Soon he was wearing her gorgeous thick straps knee-length taffeta dress in ivory and black with a matching jacket. He had on her shoes with a thick heel and control top pantyhose.

But this wasn't the Barrett's home it was the home of Mrs. Winters.  Mrs. Winters wasn't a Mrs. at all, not any more anyway.  She was a divorced woman who had been married for over twenty-five years and received both this house and a generous alimony settlement in the process.  When James entered the home everything looked as it should be but Mrs. Winters (now his) cats looked at him quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames needed to know if he had his own wardrobe instead of Lauren so he quickly went to the master bedroom and looked inside 'his' closets.  Hanging up were all of his male clothing.  He was relieved that he hadn't swapped his entire wardrobe with Lauren.  He would swap their clothing preferences in the morning when he saw her next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames realized that he had to take a piss so he went to the master bathroom to relieve himself.  Once there, he saw that the toilet seat was down so he picked it up and did his business.  Looking around the bathroom, just like the whole house looked familiar but there was something wrong.  It was done in a pastel purple motif with feminine accents all around.  Then he realized that even though this was his bathroom and his house it shouldn't be.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Winters entered the Barrett's home with her key.  It was late so everyone had gone to bed although Heather, James' mother was still awake.  When she heard the door open and close she assumed that James was home and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Winters went to James' room and took off her dress.  She found her nightgown in the closet and put it on.  She then went to the bathroom to prepare for bed.  The bathroom looked familiar although she couldn't find some of the creams and lotions that were part of her daily ritual before going to bed.  She thought she must have just ran out and and resolved to get more the next day.  After brushing her teeth (using James' brush) and removing her makeup using some products that had actually belonged to Audrey, she got into James' full size bed.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nRealizing where he was an what must have happened, James knew he had to swap back.  But what exactly was he supposed to swap back?  He didn't think he had become Mrs. Winters.  He simply just now lived in her house.  That is what he would have to swap, their addresses.  But if he did it now, would he still be here or would he magically be transported to his own house.  James knew his own house well and could get into it even without his key.  He could go into his house, find Mrs. Winters who presumably was there and then swap.  But Mrs. Winters would still be in his house.  That wouldn't be good.  But it would be better than waiting for the morning.  In the morning, if the shit hadn't already hit the fan, James' family would find Mrs. Winters in their house.  James didn't know what to do.</span></div></div>",

He thought he'd gently make his move by copping a feel on her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey...\" She stopped, halting the making out. \"I don't really feel like going all the way tonight. Let's just watch a movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames felt disappointed at this juncture, as he was totally expecting to score tonight. He quietly sighed as he popped on a Netflix movie and let his boner go to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the film however, James was still quite horny. He had to subdue his pent up sexual frustration for now, however... Or would he? He thought that maybe he could use the ring to relieve himself, if only in a masturbatory way. While completely avoiding attention to the TV, he thought of the possibilities. He couldn't swap with Mrs. Tam or Lauren because one or the other would notice in both cases. At home would also be complex, he'd have to get everyone in the same room or something. Wait. He could wait until they are all downstairs in the same room and swap at the same time. No, that wouldn't work. He couldn't stand sitting through the entire movie like this, so he made up a lie to get him away from the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, according to my watch it's nearly 11. I better go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already? Oh. Okay then. I was getting pretty tired, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tired as in... Likely to go to bed soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, tired as in becoming a wheel YES TIRED AS IN GOING TO BED SOON!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames noticed he might have a chance, and he decided to jump at it. He kissed his girlfriend goodbye and went off to say goodbye to her parents with his shameful agenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile peering in through the door crack, James noticed that Mr and Mrs. Tam were still at the positions he last saw them in. With this, James saw fit to slowly creep in while opening the door before quickly swapping out his entire body with Mrs. Tam's. This was easy as she was asleep on the couch and he was still engrossed in his email. He promptly swapped out their bodies and clothing while they were both unaware that anything had changed. And with this, he still decided to go in and bid them farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, just letting you know I'm leaving now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine James.\" The former Mrs. Tam said. \"Thanks for being protective of my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile saying that, James spontaneously swapped out her sexual own body knowledge with the brief time frame he had. He then left and hoped that they weren't going to be up to anything sex that same night. He snuck into his own house and planned to exit early in the morning so that he could go to the Tams and swap back before Lauren would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames ripped off his clothes against the mirror in his bedroom and immediately began making out with his reflection. While doing this he began rubbing his pussy and breasts on it. \"It's not technically cheating... It's not technically cheating...\" He came not too long after, and fell to sleep in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, he woke up as his mother yelled him. He was going to miss school if he didn't get a move on!</span></div></div>",

His mother fixed a plate of pancakes and eggs in front of him.  He decided that he had to get Audrey alone to swap back with her so he might as well eat his breakfast while he waited.  He was working at a plan when he realized the body he was in felt different than Mrs. Tam.  It was not just firmer (with of course, small breasts) but it had a vitality that Mrs. Tam's body didn't have. He supposed his real body did also, but last night he was to occupied with out concerns to notice.  This brought him back to thoughts of sex and masturbation.  He still had Mrs. Tam's knowledge of her body.  He wondered if Audrey had played with her self.  Did he have time to take Audrey's body upstairs and use it like he used Mrs. Tam's.  He was about to excuse himself from the table when he caught himself.  \"I have to stop thinking about sex all the time,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could return to thinking of a plan to get everything right, the door bell rang.  Heather answered the doorbell and escorted Lauren to the kitchen.  Lauren looked around and spotted Audrey in Mrs. Tam's body.  She went up to her and whispered in Audrey's ear.  \"We have to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey who was just about finished with her breakfast and wondering what this was about said, \"OK, about what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here, silly.  In private.  Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curiosity got the better of Audrey and she left the table and walked to the hall with Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now what?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you did and you have to switch it back right now,\" Lauren demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I did?  Switch what back?\" Audrey asked perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looking at her mother's body knew what she was talking about was perfectly obvious.  She didn't know how James could feign ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look you have to change this back now.  We don't have much time.  Stop being difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Lauren, I don't know what you are talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, stop this.  This is serious, we have to change mom back before she....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that James made his way out to the hall in Audrey's body.  Lauren cut off her sentence so no one would know what she was talking about.  \"Lauren,\" James said in Audrey's voice.  \"I'm over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't understand, I'm James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was now totally confused, why would James tell Lauren that he was James.  It was the most obvious thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren to Audrey asked, \"Your not James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looking at her mother's body said, \"No I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is all this about?\" Audrey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just a joke,\" James reassured Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not very funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had better run along..\" James told his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although,\" and Audrey turned to get ready fro school.  Before she left, James swapped the body he was in with the body Audrey was in.  James now had Mrs. Tam's body again and Audrey was back to her thirteen year old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Audrey was gone, Lauren asked,  \"James is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James I am really mad at you, but we don't have time.  You have to come back and swap everything back.  Mom is about to leave.

There were plenty of cotton tops but they where mostly in feminine colors or patterns or their neckline was in a low U or V shape.

It wasn't perfect like the jeans, but hopefully if James didn't wear a bra underneath would be passable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she found some white socks to replace James' stockings and a pair of sneakers that might be in a woman's pattern but was the best she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK James get undressed and take off that bra and put this on,\" Lauren demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' perception of what he was wearing had changed.

It was at this moment that he decided that maybe Lauren was right, but he shouldn't dress down for school he should dress up.  He found a skirt suit in his closet in a soft pastel yellow and paired it with a floral blouse with a scoop neckline.  He selected textured hose also with a floral pattern in black and shoes with a small heel.  He went into the adjoining bathroom to look at himself.  He washed his face and then redid his makeup from the ground up.  He also put on a nice pair of earrings to complete his look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got out, Lauren was flabbergasted.  \"That isn't what I got for you to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but this is much better.  I can't go to school in just jeans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames thought that Lauren should dress more maturely.  At least that is what he thought now that he dressed like Mrs. Tam.  Using the TSAR James decided to swap Lauren clothing with his own mother's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Lauren wearing now?</span></div></div>",

Hair could be seen both over and under the nightie she was wearing since the nightie was so sheer.  The spaghetti straps of the nightie hung from the strong shoulders that Lauren now possessed.  Lauren didn't have to worry about her unsupported breasts, she didn't have any anymore.  But she was also now unconcerned about her penis which hung loosely from her crotch.  The outline of it was clearly seen and since she didn't wear a jock or even panties to support it, it hung loosely between her legs.  Her naked legs peeked out under the bottom of her nightie from her knees   On her feet she wore soft pink slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Lauren, we are late, we have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren thought that if James wanted to wear her mother's clothes let him do it.  He'll be embarrassed not her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames told Mr. Harris to work while they were at school.  Normally Mrs. Tam wouldn't let a stranger alone in her house, but James didn't worry that much.  Plus James reasoned if anything was missing when he got back, James could use the TSAR to make sure Mr. Harris would lose something himself.  Say his potty training or his education or his ability to walk.</span></div></div>",

He didn't find anything wrong with his outfit, and despite Lauren's numerous objections he confidently walked toward school with a smile on his face. The smile, came from looking at his once beautiful girlfriend Lauren. She did not think of James as her boyfriend anymore. Oh no. She was now walking to school with her mother Audrey and she was completely humiliated that SHE was wearing her boyfriend's new skirt suit. \"Look's like you are a bit cold Lauren.\" James laughed pointing to Lauren's shriveled penis. It wasn't that big to begin with, but now with it completely exposed it's shrunk to a laughable size. Lauren stopped and slightly pulled her nightie to cover it. She now looked ridiculous walking down the street. She now had Henry's 60 year old over weight body. She wasn't totally fat but more around the size of 230, just under 6ft tall with thin gray hair. Her once strong legs, were pretty unsightly with gray hair and blue veins. The slippers she wore were scuffing on the sidewalk and her old man boobs, actually fit her top section nicely.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked down the street then ran into some people at the cross walk....</span></div></div>",

They had to get to school so James used the TSAR to swap Lauren's clothing with that of the toddler who had been switched before with it's mother.  Lauren is now wearing the stylish clothing of the toddler's young mother.  \"James,\" Lauren said, \"I think you are right, it isn't too chilly, I don't need a jacket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" James said as if he didn't use the TSAR to change her apparel.  Regardless, the TSAR made James forget that he had swapped Lauren's body with the sixty-year-old man.  James and Lauren continued on their way to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the police arrived they put the woman who was dressed only in a diaper in their squad car.  After talking to her for a few minutes they realized that the woman didn't think anything was unusual about the way she was dressed.  Although she did think she should have maybe worn a onesie since it was a bit chilly.  The police decided to take the woman to a mental hospital instead of to the jail.  By the time they got there her diaper wasn't flooded, but one couldn't call it dry anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Tam's house, Henry discovered that for the first time in years that his body felt young and vigorous.  His body was now responding like a teen instead of the old man who had had erectile dysfunction for years now.  Henry pulled down his pants and boxers exposing his moist pussy and began to play with himself with his right hand.  It didn't take long until he started using his left hand to massage his left boob.  Soon he was moaning and enjoying himself in a way he hadn't in many years.

Regardless, he wasn't complaining about it, even if he felt perhaps a little guilty for masturbating right there in his neighbor's home. Though he reasoned that anyone would do so if they suddenly felt so much sexual energy return to them after so many years of not feeling it really. Henry put his clothes back on, not really noticing it doesn't exactly support his body, even if it did fit it for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his little masturbation session, Henry got back to what he was hired to do, painting the house. While doing so, Henry found it was a little more difficult to reach the higher parts, though in the meantime it also didn't hurt at all if he got down to paint the lower parts. Regardless, he didn't know what was going on still and continued to paint throughout the day. It was when he was going to take his lunch break however that he noticed something odd in the Tam household. It was a picture of Lauren in a casual clothing, but with the TSAR altering Henry's mind, he was confused why the Tam family had a picture of him in their house. Crossdressing too, of all pictures they could have had! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do they have a picture of me?\" Henry asked himself as he looked at the picture confused. \"I never wore that kind of clothing in my life either... it really makes me look like a teenage girl.\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, he believed that he had this body since ever, but he also knows for a fact that he should not be feeling this sudden invigoration nor should the Tam household have pictures of him in girl\u2019s clothing. He may be an old man (in mind), but he certainly wasn't an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that the rest of the Tam family won't be back for hours, he headed to upstairs to the bedrooms, Lauren\u2019s specifically. Now, from what he remembered, Lauren was quite a lot taller than him, with a lot more body mass to put it kindly, balding and well, a penis. That meaning, absolutely none of her clothing should even remotely fit, Henry reasoned. Walking in, he took a look around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at me being a pervert snooping round some teen girl\u2019s room. Well I already masturbated in their house so this isn't the worst I\u2019ve done.\u201d Mr. Harris chuckled to himself, not realizing it sounded more like a girly giggle than anything. The room was rather clean and well organized, so it took no time at all to find Lauren\u2019s clothes. Henry opened up the closet, taking a gander within. It was pretty apparent to him that the clothes within wouldn\u2019t fit Lauren. Taking a dress out of the closet, he sized it up on his body. It certainly was his own size, though he had never thought about wearing a dress before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst time for everything I guess.\u201d He said to himself as he stripped out of his own clothes. It certainly felt perverted to put on clothes from a girl many years younger, but it turned him on greatly. The dress slipped on and fit snugly around his body, and he had to admit, not wearing pants was pretty nice. This was great and all, but he wouldn\u2019t be caught dead wearing a dress outside. Though\u2026 if he was actually in a teenage girl\u2019s body, everything should be okay. Henry took off the dress and put on his old clothes back. He looked at Lauren\u2019s clothes curiously, putting the dress back but taking a few articles out from the back of the closet that Lauren probably wouldn\u2019t miss unless she looked for it. Not like anything in there would fit her, Henry reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that room looking like it was when he came in, he decided to go back home and think about what to do with his new found youth.</span></div></div>",

Henry returned to Lauren's room and looked through her drawers.  Just like with the closet, he took a pair of panties and a bra that were at the bottom of the drawer in hopes that Lauren wouldn't notice.  Henry wondered why Lauren wore a bra at all since she didn't have any breasts.  He then found a pair of tights and some shoes and left for home again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he returned home, he went up to his bedroom to put the clothing on.  There was a large mirror on the back of his bedroom door which would allow him to see himself in his new outfit.  He took off the men's clothes he was wearing and put on his panties first.  They happened to be black and a bikini cut.  Next he put on his bra.  He wasn't quite sure how to put it on and do the hooks in back.  He had seem comedic movies where a man tried to put on or take off a bra and he decided to simply hook it together before putting it on and then pulling the bra down like a t-shirt.  It went on without much trouble.  Henry wondered why women went to all the trouble to do it any other way.  Next he tried to pull the tights up his legs.  It took some effort but he finally got them up.  Next he put on the dress.  He didn't know that the dress was out of style.  Finally he put on his shoes.  They fit, but there weren't appropriate with the dress he was wearing, even if the dress would have been in style.  Looking in the mirror, he could see the outline of his dark colored bra under his dress but he didn't care.  On the other hand, he didn't notice that you could also see the dark panties through his dress until he looked over his shoulders to see  his backside in the mirror.  It hadn't occurred to him that his lingerie had to be coordinated with his dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry had no sense of style and thus he thought as long as they clothes fit they looked good.  This was especially true since the dress was very tight on his body.  Henry may have been 'old' but even he had a cell phone that took pictures and si he took a selfie of himself. It was when he started to smile that he realized that he wasn't wearing any makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The TSAR had hit a paradox which make it behave strangely.  The apparent problem with the purse and James' knapsack was just the tip of the iceberg.  The paradox happened when James swapped his clothing (when he was already wearing Mrs. Tam's clothing) with the clothing that Mrs. Tam was wearing.  Since they were both wearing Mrs. Tam's clothing, the TSAR didn't know what to do.  How could it swap Mrs. Tam's clothing with James' clothing if they were both wearing Mrs. Tam's clothing.  To try and make some sense of the paradox the TSAR made everyone unaware of the clothing change.  The only hole was that somehow James ended up with Mrs. Tam's purse.  If James would have just gotten his own knapsack back without using the TSAR or didn't use the TSAR to swap names with Mrs. Tam everything would have sorted itself out.  (The TSAR would have swapped their clothing back to the way everything was originally when both James and Mrs. Tam were asleep.)  But James went too far and the paradox caused the TSAR to work unpredictably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned at seeing Mrs. Tam's purse in his hands, James looked again (the TSAR went into action at this point) and everything seemed normal.  \"I guess I was day dreaming,\" he thought.  But regardless he took out the ID from the purse.  He looked it over, everything seemed perfectly normal.  Everything was as it should be.  Name: Adrianna Sui Tam. Address: (the correct address for James Barrett) Date of birth: 05-03-72 Sex: M Height: 5'03\" Eyes: Brown  Hair: Black.  There was a picture of him with brown eyes and black hair wearing a v-neck top.  James thought everything was correct on the ID when only his gender and address were actually correct.  the TSAR had made it's own trait swaps to have everything seem perfectly normal to James.  He didn't even remember changing his name from James to Adrianna.  All that James remembered was going to the salon and putting everything back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a care, James went into his house and went to his room to prepare for his homework date with Lauren.  The first thing he did was remove his heels.  His feet were aching.  He had a love/hate relationship with heels.  They hurt his feet which he hated, but he liked the added height they gave him and they did look great with his outfits.  He got out of his pantsuit and put it away along with his blouse and prepared to get dressed.  This time he decided that since it was cooler (evening was approaching) he would wear his girdle under his jeans.  He also substituted the bra he was wearing with a push-up bra.  He didn't have anything to push up, but he didn't notice that.  He did put on his NYDJ jeans and a sleeveless top just as Lauren had predicted.  He transferred his ID into a more casual purse and then looked over his homework before going to Lauren.  He would pretend that he hadn't looked it over before getting there so she would think he was smarter than he actually was.  Finally he selected a new pair of heels that went with the outfit he was now wearing, but he wouldn't put them on until he was ready to leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile getting dressed, his mother peaked into his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are you staying for dinner?\" Heather, James' mom inquired?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm going to be at Lauren's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, hey can I borrow your gold lame top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one with the plunging neckline?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your dad and I are going out tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure mom.  You know you don't really have to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's always better to ask.  I am trying to raise you to be polite.\"  According to Adrianna's (James) license he was actually 3 years older than his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  Thank you for asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my boy.  You're welcomed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames finished his homework (but didn't take it with him) and then headed towards Lauren's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Mr. Tam was also a master at hair styles and dying hair. But he retained his own wadrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren you made my favorite dish tonight.\" Mrs. Tam said as she dug into the tradional korean noodle dish. \"oh it is so easy I made this after I got home from the salon.

James knew he couldn't go around with dyed hair, his friends would razz him, but when he got home he would simply swap the coloring with his mother's hair.  She never dyed her hair so it'd be fine if her would just swap the dying not the original hair color or style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Mr. Tam, let's do it after dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren talking to James in Korean, \"Adrianna, what are you crazy?

She could pick out a few words but couldn't tell exactly what they were talking about.  It was at this point that James realized he could talk about the TSAR in front of people and they wouldn't know what he was saying.  He was going to swap the language abilities back later, but knowing Korean might make things easier.  The problem was was that he was taking Spanish in high school and all that he had learned about that was gone too.</span></div></div>",

Thenhe wrapped a towel around Jmaes head and lead him to the kitchen table. He rubbed James head in order to dry the hair a bit. He then began to apply the color called natural black. Then to James surprise Mr. Tam put curlers in his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJmaes' hair was not very long but it did hold about three or four pink curlers. Unbeknownst o James he look very much like Mrs. Tam at the moment. From having her height and clothes to the fact he was getting his hair colored in her usual color plus being able to speak Korean made for a very surreal situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was sitting in the chair with his legs crossed and his bra starp peeking out form the sleeveless top he was wearing. He instinctively picked up one of Mrs. Tams gossip magazines she read while she waited for her hair to dry. The magazine was on the kitchen table so he didn't think it was strange that he got caught upon the latest gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren walked in and saw him sitting there. \"Adrianna I want to tahnk you for making my father so happy.\" She said in Kirean to him. \"I am still concerned about what will happen when you get back to school.\" James wanted to reassure his girlfriend. \" Look Charlie I have been doing really well controlling the TSAR. I mean everything has been pretty normal right? When I get home I will fix this one snafu okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to reassure Lauren and leaned in to give James a kiss. \"Okay I will trust you aftre all everything is pretty normal.\" With that Lauren went back to doing her homework,</span></div></div>",

You can use the TSAR to swap your class load with him and then we'll have more classes together.  Even if we don't use the TSAR it'll be great having you in my classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have identical schedules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but we have five classes together and lunch.  That's plenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not taking ballet with you is he?\"  The class was actually called modern dance, but James liked to tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's a guy like you.

The truth be told, they now have a subtle Korean accent, but it was hardly noticeable since Mr. and Mrs. Tam had been in America for over 20 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren and James walked over to the boys house.  \"OK, I'll swap schedules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No as long as I am close.\"  James then used the TSAR.  \"There it is done.\"  James walked Lauren back to her house and then home.\"</span></div></div>",

Jeans and tops was OK for fooling around, but he should be dressing nicer for school.  Today he decided to wear another pantsuit.  Yesterday's purple pantsuit was nice, but he wanted more color today so he picked out a nice red and black polyester/spandex pantsuit.  <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Fall-Winter-Formal-Pant-Suits-for-Women-Business-Suit-Work-Black-Bow-Ladies-s-Blazer-with/32226960383.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Fall-Winter-Formal-Pant-Suits-for-Women-Business-...</a> Since he had swapped heights with Mrs. Tam he now wore a petite size.  Once selecting the pantsuit it made most of his other choices easy.  He needed a scoop neck top in black to go underneath the jacket.  He also had to wear black panties and bra to prevent either was being seen underneath his clothing.  Black pumps and nude stockings completed his look.  He also got used to wearing a girdle so he selected one of those too...in black of course.  He had decided that the girdle was essential to remove any embarrassing bulges in his outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed, James went down to the kitchen to get some breakfast.  His mother greeted him, \"Adrianna, thanks for the top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem mom, anytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast was waiting for James and he ate it carefully.  He didn't want to get anything on his outfit.  At least not before Lauren had seen him.  \"I love what you did with your hair,\" Heather said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  Charlie's dad wanted to use me as a guinea pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's very nice.\"  Later, \"Adrianna, the bus is here, you had better get going.\"  James didn't think it was odd for a school bus to pick him out due to the manipulations of the TSAR.  James got on the bus and was off.  He didn't seem to know anyone on the bus and they all seemed rather young to him, but he didn't worry about it too much.  James was the tall student on the bus since he was wearing heels.  But without his heels several of the students were taller than he was.  He expected to see Lauren when he got to classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to school and took eat he found himself in the fifth grade.  He was about to say something when the TSAR swapped his expectations with a girl in the class.  She got up and told the teacher she didn't belong here and ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher started the lesson with vocabulary.  The teacher wrote ten words on the board all beginning with the letter 'A'.  abolish, absurd, abuse, access, accomplish, achievement, aggressive, alternate, altitude and antagonist.  The students were supposed to write down what they thought those words meant.  If they didn't know they had to look them up in their dictionaries.  The teacher walked around the room helping her students.  James had as tough a time with the words as everyone else.  Since the TSAR didn't just swap expectations with the girl, it also swapped their general educations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

James didn't know what was wrong.  He had swapped schedules to be in Lauren's class.  James was starting to get agitated when the TSAR sprung into action again.  The TSAR exchanged James feeling for Lauren with feeling one of the boys had for a girl in front of James.  Since James no longer felt like Lauren was his girlfriend he calmed down about her not being here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames know had feelings for a girl who sat in front of him.  But like a fifth grader he didn't know what to do about them.  He also felt that all girls had 'cooties.'  But James liked her anyway in a way he couldn't really describe.  Since James couldn't come out and declare his love, that would make him look like a dork in front of his class mates.  He did what any eleven year old who do, he pulled her ponytail.  The girl turned around and gave him a look.  James put his hands up in a defensive manner and put a \"what, who me\" expression on his face to indicate that he hadn't done anything.  The girl whispered to him, \"You had better quit it or I'm telling the teacher.\"  James didn't know it, but the fact that the girl didn't immediately tell the teacher meant that she liked him back.  This was confirmed later when the girl made a effort at recess to tell James that she liked his pantsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that James had lost all interest in Lauren, he decided to use the TSAR on some of his fellow students.  Who does he use it on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was nice wearing the clothes she had on.  They were mostly more comfortable than her old clothing and they didn't stink, but she would be giving up so much.  She would be wearing the clothing of a homeless man for the rest of her life.

He worried. Lauren could have easily spotted his original body by now. He crawled over to the living room's window and noticed Mrs. Tam getting ready to leave. Attempting drastic measures, James climbed into the window and closed it without thinking, catching the attention of Mr. Tam. James went unnoticed by Mrs. Tam and was beginning to swap bodies back before being interrupted by Mr. Tam.<br>\r\n\"JAMES?\" He said as he noticed him from outside. James panicked. He couldn't swap bodies as Mr. Tam wasn't in the same room with him, so he'd notice when either his or Mrs. Tam's (who was still unfazed) bodies started changing. James had to explain things from Mrs. Tam's perspective. He quickly saw fit to swap more than just bodies with Mrs. Tam as he used the TSAR to switch their identities, marital status, names, and several other things not noted within the heat of the moment. James was Mrs. Tam more than ever before.<br>\r\nMr. Tam was briefly confused. \"Huh? Oh, there you are honey. What is James doing here?\"<br>\r\n\"He just asked me about... Scheduling. That's all.\" Said James. \"Didn't you, James?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? I don't know what you're talking about, Mrs. T.\" Replied Mrs. Tam.<br>\r\nJames shrugged to Mr. Tam.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I just have to check something.\"<br>\r\nJames quickly went upstairs to see that Lauren was still fast asleep in her bed. James saw fit to wake her up.<br>\r\n\"Wake up... Sweetie! It's time for your schooling!\"<br>\r\n\"*Yawn* Oh, thanks mom!\"<br>\r\nJames didn't know what pleased him more; the fact that his transformation into Mrs. Tam had been entirely successful or that he wouldn't get his comeuppance for his little exploration of the previous night. He thought he'd go downstairs and finish the job, when he noticed Mrs. Tam wasn't there at the door anymore. He burst outside and couldn't see him.<br>\r\n\"*Shudder*... Honey? Where is James?\"<br>\r\n\"While you were upstairs, he came out and told me he really had to run down to school or else he was going to miss it.\"<br>\r\nJames had monumentally fucked up. Mrs. Tam was already too far out of the radius to swap with, and he knew going into school alone would be no easy task, and that it was further complicated by the operation; he wanted no trace of this ever happening, yet he couldn't have Mrs. Tam suddenly exit and leave her daughter's school without some level of suspicion. He was suddenly interrupted by Mr. Tam.<br>\r\n\"...Say, weren't you going shopping at the K-Mart today?\"<br>\r\nJames just couldn't bother putting himself through all that on top of his current dilemma.<br>\r\n\"No, I was thinking about doing thaaaaaatttttt two days from now.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we both have a day at home day today then.\"<br>\r\n\"...Indeed...\" He said with a false smile.<br>\r\nLauren then appeared out of the front door and waved her two parents goodbye, as James became glad that their schedules didn't intertwine in classes on that specific day. Then the realization dawned that he would have to stay in the position of Mrs. Tam until the next time that he, Mr. and Mrs. Tam were all in the same place again, which could be a while, like a week at worst. On the plus side, he at least had some amount of time off of school and a hot body to play with.<br>\r\n\"So how was it for you last night?\"<br>\r\nJames recoiled in fear as he realized his original body must have had sex with Mr. Tam last night. On the bright side, it was at least still Mrs. Tam that was fucking Mr. Tam, just with a different body that happened to be his. He still had to ponder, though...<br>\r\n\"Did you like my cock action?\"<br>\r\n\"Best in town!\"<br>\r\nJames was at least impressed that his own body was capable of pleasuring someone that much. He went along inside with Mr. Tam as he pondered what the depth of his swapping with Mrs. Tam was. He thought \"Let's see, I already have her body, clothes, own body sexual knowledge, identity, marriage... Oh god, I'm MARRIED to Mr. Tam. That just sounds weird. And with my clearly female reproductive organs in sight I truly am MRS. Tam both literally and in name. Wait... No, James dammit! That's gonna get confusing. So my name feels like it's always been hers even though I know it's not and I truly am in a long lasted matrimony to my girlfriend's father, which is the weirdest mess I've gotten into yet.<br>\r\nJames and Mr. Tam began to watch TV, as James remained unfocused.<br>\r\nJames rested his head with a unexpected feminine leaning and sultry frown. He thought to himself \"Oh great! I've swapped our mannerisms too! I bet James- I mean MRS. TAM is having a good time with this. Like when we all went to the movies to see... Wait... Did I also swap our memories, at least to some amount? No, that could come from either of our memories.<br>\r\nMr. Tam noticed James was looking very spaced out. Meanwhile James looked around to see if anything else was unusual and different to him. He then noticed that he wasn't having dirty thoughts nearly as much as he usually does. \"Did... Our sex drives swap? Or does that come with the gender? The only time I remember a turn-on post-heavy swap was when I heard the phrase \"bondage\" on... Wait, bondage? That's the first time I got a turn-on from bon- Oh no, I must have swapped our fetishes, too! I can't remember having any fetishes of the sort before, but now when I mentally hear the words... 'S&amp;M'... 'Furry'... And 'Scatological' my knees cross. Makes me wonder... Do I now... Am I into guys? Did I swap that, too?\"<br>\r\nJames thought about the sexiest babes he saw from his Playboy stash... And they did SOME things for him. Especially when he mentally added bondage and S&amp;M. Maybe Mrs. Tam was a bit bisexual, it was something that came with the gender or he was safe. But then again, he noticed that he was less excited by being in a woman's body more now than ever before.<br>\r\n\"Nonono, I can't be gay. And not while in a female's body. I don't want no vagina licking-wait. I remember... Several events... OF INTERCOURSE BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. TAM FROM HER POINT OF VIEW. I can remember getting pounded by Mr. Tam! This is insane... And yet, I'd be lying if... No. It can't be... Strangely fucking hot?\" He then blushed as he noticed his pussy got damp from all those thoughts of having Mrs. Tam's pussy packed by Mr. Tam, who in reality noticed the pussy juice and asked her something.<br>\r\n\"Baby, are you... Aroused right now?\"<br>\r\n\"...I...Am. I totally am. Dear god!\"<br>\r\n\"Woah, calm down there, my hottie. It's just a cupcake commercial.\"<br>\r\n\"No it's not...\"<br>\r\nJames awkwardly halted as he pondered again. Did he swap Mrs. Tam's attraction to Mr. Tam, too? Or was it just the new sexual preference?</span></div></div>",

To clean up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wouldn't want more semen on the couch like last night.\" James felt partially disgusted and partially turned on as he headed towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile cleaning up his damp vag, it was hard for James to not get turned on again, as the thoughts of pussy packing once again penetrated his mind again and again. He still wondered if it was Mrs. Tam's attraction towards her husband, but considering how any other guys he could picture weren't giving him the exact same deep buzz that the Mr. Tam thoughts did, it had to be so. James sighed, and hoped he could keep these thoughts away. He didn't want to complicate things further by swapping with Mr. Tam, so he just continued cleaning. But with the knowledge that he was into Mr. Tam, the contact sensations only felt more justified. He now knew it was only natural for him to have these reactions. He'd try to put away these thoughts as he finished wiping, but he knew that sitting next to him all day wouldn't help. He spontaneously gave in and started masturbating to maintain his urges for now at least. \"I can't believe I'm schlicking to Mr. Tam... But at least I'm giving my body what it wants. I think it would help if I started rubbing a tit- OH MY GOD that feels gooooooood. I mean, dang this implemented attraction! I don't want this to be but these thoughts of Mr. Tam are driving my pussy insane and only my masturbation can feed it temporarily. And it feels fantastic but I don't want to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a knocking was heard on the bathroom door. \"Bae, are you clean now?\" James came to an unfortunate conclusion. He thought if he could fuck Mr. Tam and get it over with, he'd finally have vaginal relief. Since he couldn't take anymore, he unlocked the door and pounced onto a shocked Mr. Tam.

Blew my expectations sky high.\" James adjusted his rack. His reasoning for going back to his old life was getting slightly fuzzier.</span></div></div>",

Whatever remaining sexual attraction towards females James didn't have swapped over had been overridden by the overwhelming body response to the marriage attraction trait. He was now so \"straight\" it was almost as if it was never the opposite. It had been drained like his recent batch of cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mannerisms, which were also prominent as ever, included some sexual tendencies such as putting his breasts on the cock in addition and automatically swallowing the cum when it was over, which he didn't mind. Upon completion, he thought he was totally sticking it to the problem of rising urges, though he did totally like the taste of Mr. Tam's cock in his mouth.

James on the other hand wasn't thinking about the movie he was thinking about his life.  Mrs. Tam was at a different place in her life than James was.  She was in her middle ages.  The problems of youth were fading away, she was enjoying the freedom that came with being older.  She (and now James who now felt as Mrs. Tam had) knew that next year Lauren would be at of the house at college.  She would be so proud of her.  She thought that in a few years, Lauren would be on her own, then she would get married.  Lauren would make a beautiful bride.  Then before she knew it, she would be a grandma.  She wanted so much to be a grandma.  James at his age wasn't sure if he wanted to be a father, but Mrs. Tam wanted so much to be a grandma.  These were the thoughts that were going through James' mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames thought to what would happened if he swapped back.  James would be losing so much.  He would he losing his loving husband.  He would be losing his daughter who he loved so much.  Then he thought he could marry Lauren if he was a man again.  But now that he thought of Lauren as his daughter it suddenly felt weird to think of her as a sexy woman that he would make love to.  And what about Mr. Tam...er...Charlie...er. Chiwon his love.  He couldn't love him anymore if he was James.  He couldn't cuddle up in his arms like he was doing now.  He couldn't make his meals, and clean his house and listen to his troubles and be his wife.  All these mundane things like cooking and doing the housework were special when you do them for your family he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he came upon a decision.  He wasn't going to swap back.  He had everything he wanted already.  He had a husband who loved him.  He had a beautiful successful daughter who he adored.  he had a home and friends and he could look forward to a wonderful retirement with Chiwon.  They could travel, he wanted to travel if when he had time.  Most of all he would be a grandma in just a few years.  He was going to stay as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now Mrs. Adrianna (Areum) Tam, wife and mother.  A 46 year old Korean-American woman.  He...no she had a great life and wouldn't change it for all the gold in Fort Knox.  She even had the TSAR in case anyone treated her family wrong.  She was sure that James would make Lauren a fine husband.  He had better, if James didn't treat Lauren right, Adrianna would use the TSAR to take care of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(End?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor's note:  I don't like ending story arcs.

Surplus surprise, it was Lauren and \"James\". \"Mrs. Tam\" saw these two young lovebirds with the wonderful future they represented and was ready to embrace it and, of course, the entire family that she was now forever going to be a part of. Lauren greeted her parents. \"Oh, hi guys! Me and James just thought we'd hang around here for a little while; we're going to go on a date to the Italian restaurant later, and then we're gonna watch a movie on Netflix!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tams\"'s smile slowly dropped. \"Wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and afterwards we gonna-\" Lauren interrupted. \"WE'RE gonna, you know, um..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know! Things like this!\" \"James\" explained with a big, toungey kiss on Lauren's lips and a simultaneous double breast squeeze. Lauren then sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Tam\" immediately realized her, fuck it, <b>his</b> mistake. His fucking mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>FUCK NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!</b>\" he yelled as he realized he was going to put two innocent people through an unknowing incestuous relationship for the rest of their lives just for his own selfish benefit. He realized they'd already loved and made out with each other at second base, <b>AND THAT WAS JUST WHAT HE KNEW OF</b>. He realized that in this life long romantic relationship, there'd be so many acts of sexual incest that... <b>They didn't fuck already, did they?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames went ahead and swapped everything he could that was even suggestively Mrs. Tam back to her, shocking the hell out of Mr. Tam and giving the worst of implications to an already-disgusted Lauren. James would then immediately confirm her fears by yelling \"<b>YES YOU'VE BEEN DATING YOUR OWN MOTHER THESE PAST 7 HOURS JUST BECAUSE I WANTED TO MASTURBATE AS HER AND I HOPE IT DIDN'T GO ANY FURTHER THAN WHAT I'VE JUST SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>\" in complete and utter anguish. Lauren then began to break down both crying and puking as she said \"I... <b>I wish it didn't.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... Did it in the high school bathroom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>NO...</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tam had simply fainted by this point. James knew this all wouldn't have happened if he just didn't masturbate that one night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames turned to Mr. Tam and stated \"<b>And yes, you've been fucking your daughter's boyfriend this whole time but that's clearly a lesser issue here. You see, this ring allowed me to swap things and I went forward with swapping my body with your wife's just so I could masturbate as her, and that led to me seriously considering taking her place permanently and letting two of your family members commit incest innumerable times without anyone knowing... And learning that they've already done it once. Everything you've heard has gone on here is true. Your wife has a terrible sex drive problem, by the way.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>OH GOD!!! MY FAMILY'S <i>FOREVER DISGRACED FOR GENERATIONS TO COME</i>!!!</b>\" Mr. Tam dashed out of the room. Lauren continued crying, vomiting and shitting. But she was able to pull herself out of her physical mess long enough to violently jump onto James and forcefully pin him to the ground and strangle him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>YOU MADE ME FUCK MY OWN MOTHER JUST BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO JERK IT!!!!!!!! I WISH I WAS DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>DON'T YOU THINK I FEEL THE SAME WAY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tam soon come back into the room with several objects, one of which was a hammer. James escaped the clutch and took this without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>AND FOR THIS RING THAT LED TO ALL OF THIS, I WISH THIS ABOMINATION OF HELL NEVER CROSSED MY PATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the ring onto the kitchen's hard floor and mercilessly beat the everloving shit out of it until it was nothing but black fragments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>It... Is... No longer able to affect our lives...</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, FUCKO.

Mr. and Mrs. Tam were so relieved just to get to their own bodies that then didn't care what had happened or that 'James' had kissed Mr. Tam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, James let Mr. Tam take charge.  He said that he thought it would be best if James went home now and that he shouldn't tell anyone what happened.  James agreed and left the house and returned home to his house.  James knew that he would have to discuss this again and make like he didn't know what had happened or why, but he thought he had avoided disaster.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m fucking right, you\u2019re fucking not.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2026 That can\u2019t be true.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really? You want to bump this up a notch?\u201d James said as he switched their bodies back to avoid future confusion.<br>\r\n\u201cSure, babe.\u201d<br>\r\nJames and Lauren saw Mr. Tam walk into the living room. James then dragged her back into the living room with a cunning grin.<br>\r\nMr. Tam sat down next to Mrs. Tam on the couch while on his laptop. \u201cAlright Lauren, don\u2019t take your eyes off of your parents.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026O-kay?\u201d James focused his mind on Mrs. Tam and swapped his entire body, clothes and voice with Mrs. Tam, as the latter shifted into James without any reaction. Lauren\u2019s jaw dropped to the floor as she saw her mother and boyfriend shift into each other\u2019s bodies. \u201cI believe you... Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo James, check the (third) ring; that\u2019s the TSAR that gives me this power.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 What do you use this for?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot much yet, but it is nice having a pleasantly plump pair of tits for your mom\u2019s age.\u201d James stated while fondling Mrs. Tam\u2019s pair.<br>\r\n\u201cJames! How dare you be so disrespecting of my mother\u2019s body!\u201d Lauren whispered back. \u201cDo you know how weird that is to do right next to me?\u201d Mrs. Tam gave a confused look and shrugged it off.<br>\r\nThey walked outside the room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I simply couldn\u2019t help myself. I mean I\u2019m an 18 year old teen in a woman\u2019s body. Like earlier when I was in your body-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cThat must be true then\u2026 Well, how far can you go with this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStupendously far! Like, I could swap marriage positions between me and your mother!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, wouldn\u2019t that be weird, to fit the marital position to your girlfriend\u2019s father!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d be the one who married your father all these years ago and brought you into existence. Weird, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, MOM!\u201d They laugh at the absurdity of it. \u201cWe should totally try that out!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs a joke? Well, it would be cool to know what it\u2019s like, to be a married woman!\u201d James immediately focused his mind on Mrs. Tam\u2019s marital status. In the other room, they heard Mrs. Tam get off the couch, wondering why she was sitting next to Mr. Tam. She looked into the hallway and saw the other two. \u201cHi, Mrs.- er, what was your name again?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Adrianna Areum. You must be\u2026 Mrs. James Tam?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Yes. Why yes I am.\u201d James had now always been Mrs. Tam, with some expected attraction to him by proxy. James uptopped Lauren. They both went into the living room to observe this newfound relationship. Meanwhile, Ms. Adrianna Areum was pondering why she was even here.<br>\r\nJames crept up to her body\u2019s former position on the couch and sat down next to his \u201chusband\u201d. \u201c\u2026Husband..? Did you remember to\u2026 Put the dishes in the dishwasher?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I did James.\u201d<br>\r\nJames and Lauren were mindboggled.<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Compliant. That\u2019s why I love and married you!\u201d<br>\r\nMr. Tam smiled. He then put his arm around James and kissed him on the cheek. Lauren gasped. \u201cWoah\u2026 Mom. Wasn\u2019t that a bit\u2026 A thing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYup\u2026 Wonder what else I can swap.\u201d James wondered on what else he could swap with the former Mrs. Tam. He thought to himself \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 I already have her clothes and body\u2026 Her marital status\u2026 Wow it\u2019s hard to think after that little\u2026 \u201cBuzz\u201d that kiss gave me? Did I\u2026 Like that? Like, having a several-years-long marital status to the guy must mean something in the pants area. But could it be that I have the former Mrs. Tam\u2019s sexual feelings towards her husband? I mean feelings like those, they\u2019d probably be very high considering their successful relationship. In fact, almost definitively! Maybe too high for my current \u201cattraction\u201d, but\u2026 What are they?\u201d<br>\r\nThe former Mrs. Tam then lost a lot of certain sexual interest. James had accidentally swapped her sexual feelings for Mr. Tam and sexual preference by proxy.<br>\r\nJames looked back at Mr. Tam and knew his attraction had budded, as he suddenly felt much more aroused than before. Like, MUCH more aroused. Like, down right horny. Those eyes\u2026 Those strong, muscly arms\u2026 He never noticed them before as a man. \u201cHuh, guess it was the marital thing\u2026\u201d This made him question his current sexuality. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m pretty darn straight, but when it comes to Mrs. Tam, she was obviously straight in the female way. And while I\u2019m anatomically the female, I\u2019m totally straight.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh Mrs. James Tam, are you feeling alright?<br>\r\nJames leered to Lauren. \u201cOkay, gonna change back now! Be right back, honey!\u201d They left the living room.<br>\r\nBut when they entered the hall, the former Mrs. Tam was nowhere to be seen. James tried to swap bodies back, but nothing occurred. \u201cUh, why can\u2019t I swap back? Where is she?\u201d<br>\r\nJames and Lauren made a brief look all over the house, but she was nowhere to be found. The former Mrs. Tam had left after being confusingly sat next to a man she wasn\u2019t married or attracted to and had no memories of at all.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, \u201cMom\u201d is nowhere around to be seen. I\u2019m kind of worried\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least you\u2019re not stuck like this for an undetermined amount of time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know, being physically my mother and married to my father is an interesting bitch, but this is someone missing we\u2019re talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not just that\u2026 Being married to Mr. Tam\u2026 Kind of comes with a little mutual attraction.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026God dammit\u2026 How little?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell actually, full on attraction. Sorry, but it\u2019s the marriage that gave me these feelings; I didn\u2019t get them separately.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026 Did you swap more than just the marriage?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like men?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell while feelings for the entire same sex are present, it\u2019s probably a\u2026 Override from the Mr. Tam stuff.\u201d James said with crossed knees.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you still like girls?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Yeah, I swapped more.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! Maybe it was a sub-conscious thing? I remember debating with myself on how far the attraction goes on marriage alone and I thought deeply about her sexual feelings towards Mr. Ta- Oh no I have a hard on for Mr. Tam now!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, SHIT. It\u2019s too late at night to look around for mother. Looks like we\u2019ll have to spend the night with you in the role of Mrs. James Tam, horny for her husband. At least the affection is only physical.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 You\u2019re right\u2026 I promise the night will NOT go anywhere freaky.\u201d<br>\r\nSo Lauren went up to bed. Meanwhile, James stayed with his long-time husband, trying to distract herself from the dreamboat sitting next to him. He started to think of other attractive males he liked, but that only seemed to make the problem worse. Every time Mr. Tam made one sexy move, James would come back to nearly losing it.<br>\r\nThe time eventually came for them to go to bed about an hour later. While putting on Mrs. Tam\u2019s nightwear, James considered switching again\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, if I switched both our genders and preferencessssssssss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nJames stopped as he saw a fully-endowed naked Mr. Tam walk into the room, ruining any previous thoughts in his head into a blur.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want I should get into some clothes or\u2026 Not bother?\u201d<br>\r\nJames\u2019s lust replaced his will. He slowly removed his clothing while hypnotically following to the bed. He softly grasped his sensitive tits as Mr. Tam came nearer, grasping his wide, sensitive dick. They began feeling each other up as they swap their hand positions, masturbating each other off. It wasn\u2019t long before they began going at it as James experienced sex as a female for the first time. Her desire of Mr. Tam being fulfilled was only further compounded by the superior sexual feeling of penetration first experienced here, that it eventually, after a long hour, culminated in a wicked climax that gave her Mrs. Tam body a fiery orgasm that he will never forget for as long as he lives.<br>\r\nAll the while, the resulting moans and creaks woke Lauren, who shortly got the picture. She was livid.<br>\r\nBeginning to rest, James could no longer do anything but lie in bliss, though his true reasoning thought would come back to haunt him in the morning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No hanky panky with my dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad is a very handsome man.  I just couldn't resist him.

But thinking about it, James didn't know if he wanted to swap back.  He loved Chiwon and that man could make him feel better than anyone else.  It was at this point, James decided to stay as he was, at least for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll be right back.\"  James left the room but instead of looking for Adrianna, he used the TSAR on Lauren.  Lauren only knew what was going on because he allowed her to have awareness.  James looked like Lauren's mother, if he removed her awareness of the swap he could go on being Mrs. Tam for as long as he liked.  So he used the TSAR and when James returned, Lauren thought that James was her mother and that her mother's name was Mrs. James Tam.  With this done, James returned to greet Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Honey,\" James said to Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mom,\" was the natural reply.</span></div></div>",

While going downstairs, he wondered the repercussions of his actions as his reasoning came back to him. He had fully realized that he just cheated on his girlfriend sexually, with her own father, within the body of her mother. His feeling for Lauren were mixed at best at this point, and that was probably for the better considering he was in the body of a blood relative to her, but he still couldn't escape some level of guilt from it, like \"...Man, I really don't think I should have done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dusting the entire house, noticing that even if he hadn't picked up Mrs. Tam's skills that he was still fairly good at it. It wasn't long before the thought came back however, as James pondered what he was going to say to Lauren. Would he reveal the truth to her, or should he keep it a secret?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lauren was certainly having a shit day. The mere nerve of her boyfriend to both cheat on her and with her father of all people, even if he couldn't help the attraction. She felt like crying in the bathroom to vent out her distraught that the person she loved had screwed another person behind her back, but there was a small glimmer of hope as there was the slight, very slight chance that James actually somehow found her and swapped in time. Little did she know a rather perplexed Mrs. Tam was nearby her location within a crowd of people, wondering where her home might be after a long night of confused searching that left her absolutely tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time came that Lauren came back to the house. James was unloading the dishwasher and saw her walk straight into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there... Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, hi there sweetie-kins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's not beat around the bush here, are you really mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you... How am I not your mother? Don't you know your own mother when you see her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren should have assumed this was James, but she was so desperate that she soon convinced herself that that glimmer was totally true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... Ya really are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, stop your... Dilly-dallying and give momma a hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren walked over with a smile, but soon dropped dead in her tracks, as she was able to spot the apparent black TSAR in James' spread out hand. She knew this was James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>YOU!</b>\" Lauren said with a pointed finger at the ring. \"<b>JAMES YOU FATHERFUCKER!</b>\" James blankly stared into a pit of guilt.  \"<b>HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?! AND TO MY PARENTS' RELATIONSHIP!</b>\" She said holding back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>You don't know what it's like, okay?! You don't know what it's like to have these hormones!

But to make sure James asked, \"Charlie do you want any more juice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren answered, \"No I have plenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext James swapped Lauren's body with her father.  It was sort of silly seeing Charlie in his daughter's clothes, or is it vice versa.  James didn't know.  But he quickly swapped the clothing of Lauren and her father, now Lauren had her father's name, body and clothing.  But this was only half of what James was going to do to Lauren.  He wanted to do to Lauren and her father what he did to himself and Mrs. Tam.  Only Lauren and Chiwon wouldn't know anything was swapped.  Next James swapped Lauren's feelings for James with Chiwon along with their marital status.  Lauren now thought that she and James were a married couple, Mr. and Mrs. Tam.  Lauren was Mr. Chiwon Tam and James was Mrs. James Tam.  There was one final thing to swap.  James swapped Lauren profession (school girl) with Mr. Tam's profession (engineer).  James thought that everything was perfectly fine now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, James asked Lauren, \"OK Charlie, as I promised, I fixed everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren didn't see anything was wrong now.  She was Mr. Tam and Married to James who was her wife that she loved very much.  \"I should have never doubted you honey.

Not only was this not that man... It was that man's daughter within the body of her father... <i>Acting all sexually active and okay with it</i>. Did he... Screw up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames further pondered the repercussions of his actions.

Was disgusting. Like, <b>holy hell was that disgusting</b>. And he... Was the only reason it had to happen. James realized that he had created a incestuous, incestuous monster and immediately began feeling what was literally the worst sense of guilt ever possible. He might as well come clean about it at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Lauren came back from work with a huge grin on her face. \"Hi there, sweetie!

Married couple that were much older than us and didn't have a position in school. We both went to the opposite gender in the process, with me becoming the woman and you becoming the man. We also gained their sexual attraction for each other... Got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's the kicker... That couple... Was your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's expression turned blank. She paused without reply for several seconds, as if she had been paralyzed with rage, sorrow and fear. James knew the shit had hit the fan, and that the shit was on fire. After 15 seconds, he stumbled out an attempted reply. \"<b>...Chiwon</b>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren kept a dead, unblinking stare for several seconds until she finally gave a rebuttal. \"<b>...Why?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why did you... Make me... Do-<b>Why did you make me-WHY DID YOU MAKE ME SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO MY MOTHER WHILE IN THE BODY OF MY FATHER WITH FULL INTENT ON PERFORMING SEXUAL INCEST INTERCOURSE?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!!??!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! ?!?!?!?!?!!!?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had shrunk to the size of a pea. \"Be-be...Because... I did your father before... You were him and... You were mad at me for doing that and... I didn't want to properly fix the situation I was in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren pinned him to the ground while choking him. \"<b>AND BECAUSE OF THAT YOU MADE ME WANNA FUCK MY OWN MOTHER, AND WAS GOING TO LET ME DO THAT?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!??!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!??!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!? !</b>\" James thought that even with the sexual attraction towards Mr. Tam, even <i>that</i> was no excuse for this line of incest thought. \"<b>WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU YOU MONSTER?!?!??!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!</b>\" Lauren said while brutally pummeling him. \"<b>YOU THOUGHT THE WAY TO GET OUT OF A PREDICAMENT WAS TO MAKE ME FEEL THAT WAY TOWARDS MY OWN FAMILY WHILE BEING ANOTHER PERSON IN MY FAMILY??!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!!??!?!?!?!?!?! I'M NOW A LITERAL MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>\" Lauren held back neither tears nor savage beatings. James knew he deserved every last bit of it and began crying as well. Lauren used her tie to physically choke James while saying some brooding shit. \"<b>...We are fixing this down to every last detail...We are setting things back to normal...We are destroying that fucking ring...And then I never want to see you ever again...</b>\"</span></div></div>",

He immediately swapped as much as he could with Mr. Tam, not foreseeing the consequences. James's body appeared in Mr. Tam's position as James had taken his body, as well as other things. James rushed back upstairs as Mr. Tam looked slightly perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames knocked on Lauren's bedroom door. \"Oh Lauren... San? It's your father at the door...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, got you. It's actually me, James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you're in on this too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm totally serious-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, tell me, what movie did we see on our first date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames paused as he realized he couldn't remember that all of a sudden. He must have swapped some memories with Mr. Tam, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, pass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audible groan... What is your and my favorite band?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Guns &amp; Roses?\" James must have swapped interests with Mr. Tam as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Ninja Sex Party. You're not even trying, are you? See ya later, Dad-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I can prove it's not him!\" James dragged her downstairs to find the real Mr. Tam. To his surprise though, he was nowhere to be found in the kitchen. He had actually left in a bout of battling confusion in being at the Tam's for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess James must have left! I must thank him for the meal tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Mrs. Tam then barged in to greet her daughter and \"husband\". \"Lauren! Chiwon! How are you both doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling mighty pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nothing some late-night dramas can't fix! And hey...\" Mrs. Tam whispered into his ear. \"How about some <i>hanky-panky</i> later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames blushed. He then said in a very audible volume \"OH, HANKY-PANKY WOULD BE FINE... WITH YOU!\" Lauren stuck in awkward silence while Mrs. Tam rolled her eyes to this statement. \"BECAUSE AFTER ALL, I AM MR. TAM, NOT ANYBODY ELSE!\" Lauren tried to drown out these voices and went upstairs, away from her \"parents\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sat with his \"wife\" as they watched dramas. James sat upright while Mrs. Tam laid her head on James's lap. Amidst this, James began to notice just how attractive Lauren's mother was. Her pleasantly plump tits, her wide hips, her long, rockstar hair. He wasn't usually into older women, but... Oh, he guesses he is now. He looked at the wedding ring that was now on his finger, and realized that he may have swapped too much with Mr. Tam. But he couldn't do anything about it now, seeing as Mrs. Tam would question his decision to go anywhere outside the house at this hour. His thought was soon broken by Mrs. Tam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, you wanna do the old hanky-panky, soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames knew he had a marriage-level sexual attraction to Mrs. Tam now, so he knew it wasn't wrong for him to feel this way. But at the same time he'd be defiling the relationship between the real Mr. Tam and Mrs. Tam. But then he realized, he could test Lauren's disbelief by daring to have sex with her mother as Mr. Tam and see if she really still thought it was not James. Perhaps a poor reasoning, but one that could completely be seen as \"good enough\" when in the mindset of wondering whether to have sex with a person you have high sexual attraction towards when the option is just given to you. In this case, James's feelings wanted it so badly that it had overridden logical thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he went upstairs with Mrs. Tam, hand in hand, barely containing the excitement he had in his pants. He quickly undressed alongside his \"wife\". James already had a boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Lauren's room, her peace was disturbed by the expected bed noises and pleasure sounds from the event. But it almost sounded like something was being said in repetition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Am... MR. TAM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren tried to go to bed amidst all this, but it wasn't too long before her \"parents\" had finished.</span></div></div>",

I know who I am and this is my body.  There is no way you could make me forget what is mine,\" Lauren said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you, it is not your body.

James's frame began to morph into's Mrs. Tam's while hers became masculine. James's legs were beginning to take on the shape of Mrs. Tam's and vice versa. Their clothes seamlessly swapped as their faces now looked much more like each other's than their own. Finally, James's cock vanished as it grew out onto Mrs. Tam's former lady area.

Due to his wishes he had actually decided that he never wanted to return to his old life again.  He didn't see any reason in it, he was a woman now and he liked it even more than Mrs. Tam had.  Every little criticism of herself that Mrs. Tam had was gone.  He loved being a woman and could think of no reason to become a boy again.  He didn't want to be younger nor male every again.

He didn't want to return to school or find a profession out of the home or bother with anything that being young or male had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy wear any male clothing when he could wear softer and prettier fabrics.  Why struggle with work outside the home when making everything nice for ones family filled him with a sense of pride.  Why only have one organ to masturbate with when there was at least three and his skin felt so much smoother now and he can have multiple orgasms.  There wasn't a single thing about being a boy he could think of any more that was better in anyway to how he was now.

It didn't even matter if it was a skirt or a pair of pants, he no longer had or wanted a penis and so if it had a zipper in the front it had to go.  He placed everything he didn't want on the bed.  It was growing into quite a pile.  He would have to go shopping to get more clothing when he was through removing all the clothing he didn't want.  Next he looked through his tops.  All t-shirts had to go, it didn't matter how girlie the color or the pattern on the shirt.   He then decided that not only t-shirts but any top with a crew neck like boys wore had to go.  He wanted his tops to always show off some cleavage.  He had some cleavage now and he was going to show it.  He also decided that his tops had to be at least somewhat form fitting.  Why have a woman's body if you weren't going to show off your curves, whether they be his boobs or the narrowing of his waist.  Thus any shirt that didn't tighten at the waist had to go.  Looking into his lingerie draw, all granny panties had to go.  True they were very comfortable, but that didn't mean anything anymore.  He even through out his boyshorts panties just because he didn't like the name.  All white socks were thrown out along with his pair of sneakers.  After he was done, he bagged all his unwanted apparel and carried it to Mrs. Tam's car.  He would drop it off at good will on his way to pick up clothes that suited his new ultra-feminine personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way while waiting at a stoplight, James happened to notice a gorgeous girl who was wearing form fitting jeans and a t-shirt.  She was very hot, but not only didn't James feel any sexual attraction for her, he wondered how she could dress so masculine when she was clearly a girl.  To everyone else, there wasn't anything even subtly masculine about the clothes she was wearing, but to James what she was wearing was just as masculine as if she wore a man's suit with a tie and oxford shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James walked through the stores looking for a new wardrobe, James started to wonder how he had ever survived being a boy in the first place.  He didn't remember ever wanted to be masculine in anyway.  He didn't know if he should get the TSAR back.  If he did, he certainly didn't want to return to his old life but maybe he could use the TSAR for other things.  Regardless, after shopping (he loved shopping, it was now one of his favorite things to do) he returned home with his purchases to greet his family..</span></div></div>",

They both replied back as James's mind began to wonder before placing his new garments upstairs. He overlooked Mr. Tam and Lauren and realized he was a bit unsure of his sexuality. He must have gotten some of Mrs. Tam's female heterosexuality from both the identity and marriage swap but still felt oogly over Lauren's breasts which, didn't especially sound good while in the body of Lauren's mother. But wait, what about Mrs. Tam herself? While assuming and not questioning the identity of himself, she's probably mentally male heterosexual herself which is crazy. In fact, she probably has a copy of James's own sexuality, which wouldn't be good for Lauren, who also thinks that she is James. This posed an interesting question: Was James really going to put through making his girlfriend into an incestous relationship for the rest of her life just because he liked possessing Mrs. Tam's body? If anything that would promptly ruin any future masturbations he had knowing that an incestuous relationship is happening because of him. In fact, just sexually thinking of Lauren while in her Mother's body seemed wrong.

Lauren was his girlfriend, but she didn't turn him on now that he possessed her mother's body.  If not Lauren, maybe Mr. Tam.  She had the hots for him of course, but it didn't feel right either.  When he returned to his body, how would he face Lauren or especially Mr. Tam knowing they he wanked off while thinking of him.  It would be too weird.  He knew he had to think of a guy, girls didn't do it for him right now.  He was sure it would change back when he was back to normal, but still.  The next person he thought of was himself.  Well his old body anyway, he could imagine himself penetrating 'himself' but that was even worse than trying to think about doing it with Lauren.  True he had masturbated himself lots of times, but he never thought about himself not in that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let his mind go and he found the right person.  It wasn't his thoughts, but Mrs. Tam (the real Mrs. Tam) about a boy working at the grocery store.  He wasn't really a boy, he was a young man who was actually older than James' body.  He also was better developed and he was Asian too, but he was younger than Mrs. Tam and so she thought of him as a boy.  James wasn't sure if the man was Korean, but it didn't matter, he liked his Asian features better than Caucasian features.  Mrs. Tam had fantasized about this boy before and it turned her on, although she knew she would never do anything about it.  Not even masturbate like James was about to do.  James didn't even know if he had met the man he was thinking about.  James went to that same grocery store before, but he couldn't remember if he saw him there, but Mrs. Tam certainly had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about him, James let one of his hands drop to his crotch.  The other hand went to his breasts and thinking of the man, he messaged himself into a frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, James thought what was the rush to get back to his old body once he got back the TSAR.  He could use it to make this boy her husband and then have his way with him.  Then when he was good and finished he could return to himself.  Once back to normal he would never cheat on Lauren, but while he was Mrs. Tam it wouldn't be cheating, not on Lauren and not on Mr. Tam either.  James reasoned, why have Mrs. Tam's body if he wasn't going to find out how it was to have real sex as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does James decide?</span></div></div>",

Because I thought I'd give you a ride home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... But I barely even know you! Aren't you that Tam customer or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and these...\" James put the man's hand into his clevage. \"Are my tits.\" James knew that what he was doing was silly, but he had neither dignity nor the man's sexual interest to lose by doing it. \"That's where I keep my keys.\" James really did put his car keys there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was visibly embarrased. \"Mam, you can't just... Put someone else's hand into... Clevage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes or no to the ride, man?\" The man shrugged to himself and accepted the offer. They went to the car and the man was immediately told \"Oh, I know where it is...\". This confused and disquieted the man, but he was distracted by titties so he went along with it, especially since James kept flaunting them in this fashion: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thenug.com/sites/default/pub/022814/thenug-VYDDLjK18H.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.thenug.com/sites/default/pub/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouple minutes later, they arrived at the Tams. \"Uh, mam, this isn't my house!\" Mr. Tam was outside gardening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, isn't it? Check again...\" James swapped his and Mr. Tam's marital positions, identities and professions as Mr. Tam's ring materialised onto the man's finger. The real Mr. Tam finished up gardening for the Tams before leaving by walk, as the new Mr. Tam rubbed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait, it is my house! Or should I say, our house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Yes you should.\" James and him exited the car and entered \"their\" house, which \"James\" and Lauren had just left. James had successfully baited the fish, now he just had to find how to fuck it. James massaged his tits in excitement in this fashion:http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/t/o/tomroid.gif?6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent several hours just watching TV before cooking his man and himself dinner. After that, James and the man snuggled on the couch as James made the first move. He slowly moved his hand to the man's fairly large cock while he wasn't looking. This sent the correct signal to the man. James is pleased. The two went upstairs to the bedroom and, before too long, undressed and fucked until Jame's goal was fulfilled 10 times over. And he couldn't be happier. He had finally achived sex as a heterosexual woman and it was the best sexual pleasuring of his life.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't that he wondered if it wouldn't work, that wasn't a problem.  But what if it did work and he couldn't return things to normal or people freaked.  It would be best to do a little test with strangers who couldn't possible know that he made the swap.  James also decided to make a little swap, at first nothing big like some sort of body part.  He knew he could make mental swaps but since these were strangers how was he supposed to know the real tendencies of the people around him.  So he had decided that his first swap would be a small somewhat physical swap that no one else would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around at the people so many ideas of what to swap came to his mind.  But he disregarded each for one reason or the other.  Mostly they were either to big or he really couldn't tell if it had worked.  Do women always walk all that differently from men?  Finally it hit upon him, the type of swap he should do is a simple clothing swap between two friends of similar builds.  He would make them unaware anything had happened and everyone else wouldn't notice or care.  James set out to find a couple of women/girls who were together and one was wearing pants and one was wearing a dress or skirt.  This would be unmistakeable and only he would know.  Since they would be of similar builds he wouldn't even have to adjust the size of the clothing.  He wanted to do as little as possible since this was his first attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he saw them, two girls one in leggings and a long shirt and one in a pretty but casual floral dress 'perfect' he thought.  One of the girls was a bit taller than the other, maybe 2 and a half or three inches, but that shouldn't make a difference  So the skirt that came down to the knee on the tall girl would be slightly below the knee on the short girl and the short girls leggings would stop closer to the calf than the ankle.  It was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames concentrated and it was done.  He looked up and it was true, the shorter girl was now the one wearing the dress and the tall girl had on the leggings all seemed fine.  He decided to follow the girls for a while to make sure they didn't notice anything.  What James didn't think about was their bras.  For the shorter girl even though the cup size fit, the straps of her new bra were too long, she kept pulling her straps back up her shoulders.  For the tall girl it was worse since her bra didn't extend down past her boobs anymore.  It was uncomfortable.  The tall girl suggested they go to the ladiesroom so she could adjust her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was overjoyed the TSAR worked.  He decided to make another test.</span></div></div>",

Everyone was shocked until James used the TSAR to make it all seem normal to the gathered crowd.  But this Carmen, the security guard definitely knew her way around video tape.  So James made a three way switch in which he ended up being Carmen the security guard.  The mother was back to her own body and Carmen was now a seven year old little boy in the mall with his mother.  When the switch was completed the mother and boy didn't know why they were in the security office so they left.  James wished the former security guard good luck in her new life.  James surmised that the former Carmen wasn't too girlie since she became a security guard.  But he didn't care much anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking through all the tape, James found the boy he was looking for in a sporting goods store.  That was where James in the body of Carmen the security guard headed for first.  He wanted his family back.  That was his first priority.  Once he found the boy, he swapped his new life as Carmen with the boy.  The boy was now a thirty-five year old woman who worked as a security guard at the mall and James was back to being a teenaged boy and had all his family back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final step was to get his age of seventeen back from the formerly little girl.  But when he looked for her she and her mother was gone.  They had left the store and there was no way to track them.  It was a little bit sad but not too much, James was now fifteen instead of seventeen that wasn't that big a deal, plus he could always find someone to become seventeen again or even older if he liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he found Carmen and her mother where he had left them before, buying boys clothing at Macys.  He retrieved his body although he left Carmen at her well now his current age of seven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew that was a close one,\" James thought.  He had almost lost his entire life.  Luckily all he lost was two years, but he could get them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He was lucky nearly everything had been fixed, but he almost felt bad now that a little girl was now a teenager.  That girl just lost ten years of her lifespan for just a silly prank, and he no longer had any way to fix her.  Not to mention he'd left a teenage boy as a young child, but at least he would have a chance to grow up again.  James knew he had to be more careful with this, only using it on people who he wouldn't lose track of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the ring on his slightly younger hands and wrinkled his nose.  \"This thing is powerful, but dangerous.  I need to plan out these swaps better before I lose control of everything.  What if I had forgotten who I was, and gone off living someone else's life forever?\"  He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames felt like it was best to leave the mall before he was tempted to start screwing around with strangers again.  He got in his car and just started driving.  He wasn't sure if he wanted to stop by Lauren's or Eric's house on the way home, but he just drove.  He was so lost in thought about what he could use the ring for, that he ran a red light directly in front of a motorcycle cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\"  James cursed as the flashing lights shone in his rear-view mirror.  \"I need to be more careful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was pulled over, the cop walked up to his window, and leaned in to get a better look.  He noticed it was a woman police officer, but she didn't look like she was in any mood for bullshit.  She had short blonde hair and a pretty face, but an expression that made James slump down in his seat a little bit.  He'd never been pulled over before, and was rather nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You clearly ran that red light just now, you could have gotten someone killed, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, sir, ma'am...\"  James nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see your license... you sure you're old enough to drive?\"  The woman looked at him skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I got my license two years ago, let me get it real quick.\"  James said, finally relaxing.  He handed the license over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman raised her eyebrow and looked at him again, and then back to the license.  \"It says here you're only fifteen, and this is a learner's permit, not a license.  You don't look like you have an adult with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames just stared at her in shock. <i>Shit... this damn ring must have swapped more than my physical body's age, but my ID as well.</i>  He still had his hand on the wheel, and noticed the TSAR glistening in the sunlight.  He knew he had to be careful about what he did with it... but right now he was very tempted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please get out of the car sir, I don't want to ask twice.\"  The officer commanded.</span></div></div>",

But after growing a little bit, he discovered he wasn't eighteen as he wanted but was only thirteen.  That girl wasn't the and now she was seven and he wasn't back to his true age.  James realized that it was hopeless to find a strange girl that he had only seen once when she didn't know he was looking for her.  But he had to get back to his own age one way or the other.  before the former thirteen year old girl could get away he swapped ages back with her.  It wasn't fair for a thirteen year old to lose six years.  That was almost half her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he thought what is one year?  He could find an eight year old and swap with her.  One year wouldn't make that big a difference.  Then do the same with a nine year old until he was back to eighteen.  Looking around he found a girl who looked about eight and swapped with her.  It worked, he was slightly taller and she was slightly shorter.  He instinctively knew he was eight now.  This would work find, he set off to find a slightly older girl.,  He hadn't considered why it had to only be girls, but somehow he got it into his head.  One by one, he increased in age.  Sometimes a 'tall' girl who was actually younger or didn't make much of a difference would fool him, but swap by swap gaining a few months or about a year and a half at a time he returned to his age of eighteen.  His birthday was off a few months, but it was close enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a little over a dozen girls who had lost a year or so, but they'll recover.  Some didn't even lose en entire grade level anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut growing up 'slowly' and swapping with girls only did sort of make him 'grow up female.'  This had an effect upon his personality.  What happened to him?</span></div></div>",

As he walked through the mall back to the car, He felt weird. Well, not weird per say but, he was kinda of interested in a change in his wardrobe. It wasn't as colorful or soft or cute enough now that he thought about it. Then he spotted a mannequin with a clothing set meant for a young girly girl. Perhaps in memory to the 13 year old girl who sparked the idea to get to his original age, James seemed attached to it. Using the ring, he swapped his wardrobe with that of the mannequin's. He now wore a cute pink blouse and skirt with white stockings and ballet flats. The skirt was layered like a rose petal, which James loved. Flowers were the best. Almost with a skip in step he got back to the car headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen James arrived, he switched his maturity back with Mommy's. It was better this way it made spending time with his Mommy and Audrey more fun. Quickly after the swap, Audrey came up to him, \"Hey James, I was wondering. Since you like dressing like that so much. Why not try on some makeup? If you don't know how, I could show.\" Her tone was casual and downplayed yet sincere. He still felt the admiration for Audrey from when he was seven so he happily agreed. Audrey showed him some of her makeup supplies and instructed and guided him through the motions. James forgot that could just acquire these makeup skills from her with the ring, Probably as a result of his new found adoration and childish maturity. Despite being younger than him, James felt safe with Audrey and looked up to her and getting to spend time with his favorite sibling doing this kind of stuff was so much fun.</span></div></div>",

It seemed all of his knowledge about that had disappeared with his clothing.  He didn't know anything about male briefs either.  Once he looked around and saw the price of everything, and he needed everything he realized how expensive it would become.  He needed a drawer full of panties, bras and hosiery and a closet full of shoes not to mention at least a half dozen things for bed.  It wasn't fair to make his mom pay for all this stuff so he found a girl about his age and swapped everything he was missing with her.

The guy had on a plaid T-shirt with rolled sleeves and his pants had a bit of mud on them. His face, though well shaven, had sharp masculine features and a beanie covering his short red hair. The girl on the hand was petite and feminine about a foot and half shorter than the man and style that looked straight ripped from a top brand women's fashion magazine. Her face gave a smile that was both sweet and pure further accentuated by her makeup. Feeling a little mischievous, James swapped the couple's wardrobes but not anything else. The girl with her boyfriend's clothes resized on her looked kinda like a hipster given that her makeup and beauty care remained intact. Her boyfriend looked ridiculous given masculine build in the girls blouse, skirt and stockings even if the were resized to fit him. It kinda looked he wore it as a way to woo his beloved like a bizarre romantic comedy.

Passing by James was a mall attendant wearing the company all black uniform with white accents on the sleeves and around the apron she wore.  Her job was to clear the tables of the junk left there and then wipe them off.  She wished that the customers would bus their own junk to the trash cans.  Then she would only have to wash off the table with her cloth, but it seemed that people kept leaving the stuff on the tables no matter how many trash cans were scattered throughout the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant was cleaning off a table when she realized that her diaper was wet.  Knew that she would fill it soon too.  She hoped she could finish off these nearby tables before having to change herself in the ladiesroom.  She didn't think that her diaper leaked into her pantyhose but she wasn't a hundred percent sure.  She cleaned off the next table and helplessly peed herself some more.  She could fell her diaper getting heavier.  She didn't know how long she could go without changing her diaper.  But she couldn't change it too soon.  If she did and she wet again then she might have to change it again.  He boss was always one her case that she took too many bathroom breaks.

At the other table, a balding man in his fifties wearing a yellow shirt realized that he wasn't sitting with his mother.

It looked like she was going to give her fifty year old son a spanking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you moved on to a different girl.  This one had a pink baseball cap and pink jacket.

Both were young and black, and looked to cute and innocent to pass up. He was about to work his magic, when he saw Kyle quickly walking back to his mother. \"Oh this I have to see\" James said shifting his perspective. He watched Kyle hand his mother her boxers with in incredible Hulk on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling them up her feminine waist she and Kyle both looked extremely satisfied. They smiled and laughed at each other. \"Wow could you imagine the look on dad's face if he saw you in my panties.\" Kyle laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha!\" There's an idea James said activating the TSAR. Just then a cute black girl came over and kissed Kyle on the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you buy your dress sweetheart?\" The young black girl said to Kyle. James laughed at his own handy work. The young black girl and Kyle now think they are husband and wife. The cute black girl looked over at Kyle's mom. \"Hey sport!\" Getting board watching you mother shop?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's mom nodded her head and took her new father's hand. \"I'll take him to the barber shop Kyle, you finish shopping.\" She said.</span></div></div>",

His head wasn't really bald it was simply just shaved  leaving only stubble and he liked it that way.  In front of him was some McDonalds but he wasn't really eating it.  Instead he was looking around at the women in the foodcourt.  He wasn't in the mood to pick anyone up now, but he liked to look.  He was so busy looking around that he didn't notice when his penis disappeared from his pants and was replaced with a vagina.  This was good, since he no longer was interested in women, but he was attracted to men, particularly dark skinned men.  He wasn't easy, but smiling white teeth on a deeply black face drove him wild.  A person like that could make him do almost anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the bald headed man, a dark skinned woman, whose hair was pulled back into a short ponytail with a flower barrette shifted in her seat.  She had to open her legs a bit to give some relief to her squashed penis and balls.  Still being very much a lady, she had to discretely position her genitals without her friend noticing what she was doing.  When she got herself into a comfortable position, she took a look at her companion.  They had been friends for many years, but for the first time she recognized how sexy her friend really was.  She wondered why she had never asked her out before.  Her penis became a bit hard at the thought which made her have to adjust herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you had moved on and noticed a family sitting together.  There were two kids, a baby sitting in a stroller and a blonde haired boy of about six.  Their mother wore a white tee with a racing back leaving her bra strap exposed.  She wore a blue and white baseball cap which left her hair fall out the back in a ponytail.  Finally, her young husband with short dark hair and a dark shirt.  There was so many combinations to try with this family.</span></div></div>",

He was sitting next to his four year old blonde son.  Diagonally across from him was his lovely wife who also had blonde hair.  Most of it was under a blue and white baseball cap except the back which hung loosely in a ponytail.  Inside his stroller the baby was also there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the man's perspective changed.  He wasn't sitting up anymore, he was reclining a bit.  In front of his was his wife and to his right was his four year old.  Past his four year old he could see his little baby sitting up in a folding chair.  The man didn't know what had happened.  He tried to get up but found himself strapped into the reclining chair.  It took a moment to realize that he was sitting in a huge stroller.  Looking down at his hand, he saw they were perfectly normal.  The clothes he was wearing was how he remembered them.  He even wore his shoes.  (Although when he looked at his baby who was sitting where he had been, the baby wasn't wearing any.  The baby looked as he had before, except he was sitting up in a chair.)  The man tried to unfasten the snap to get out of the huge stroller, but found he couldn't work the latch.  He didn't have enough control over his fingers to manipulate it.  He tried to say something, but only baby babble came out of his mouth.  His wife saw him trying to say something and in sickly sweet tones she told him,  \"Wassa matter, is ums still hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man tried to say, \"Let me up!\"  But even though he knew what he wanted to say, nothing intelligible came out.  He kept on babbling, until his wife put a pacifier in his mouth.  He spit it out immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My are you chatty today,\" the woman said.  The woman didn't know what to do to quiet her husband down.  She knew sometimes he could be fussy.  He had just ate and he had been to the bathroom not too long ago.  She couldn't pick him up and snuggle here and he didn't want his pacifier.  She assumed he just wanted some attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, her oldest son, the four year old announced that he had to use the potty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davy,\" the woman said to her youngest son who was barely over a year old, \"can you watch your father while I take Jack to the bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Mom,\" the boy said.  In fact the boy had never said an intelligent sentence before in his life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved onto to other victims.  You saw to the right of the family several people standing at a counter who had just bought something from McDonalds.  You didn't know if they were together or not.

They didn't notice that their shirts had been swapped.  Still wearing white shirts, the man didn't care that his shirt now was a bit fighter than before it also had cap sleeves and a callar that showed more of his chest.  The woman's shirt was no a standard tee with short sleeves.  Under the shirt the woman's boobs were now unsupported whereas the bra that the man wore didn't have any purpose.  Underneath the counter, from below you could see that the man was now wearing red colored pants and the girl was wearing darker colored pants.  The man wore panties and the woman wore briefs.  The man wore ballet flats and the girl wore sneakers.  None of these changes mattered at all to the pair.  They had always worn these type of clothes.  Even in their closets and drawers at home their entire wardrobes had been swapped.  The two never knew each other, they just happened to be sitting close by after getting their meals at the McDonalds.  When the woman was done, she got up and threw out her trash.  Her id was kept in a wallet in her back pocket.  A few moments later the man left too, taking his purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention was changed to the young woman in the blue shirt with long brown hair which was sitting at the counter in front of the Subway restaurant.</span></div></div>",

His girlfriend Diane also in her thirties with shoulder length brown hair and a hot pink shirt was just as mad while eating her sandwich.  They had just had an argument.  William was at the mall at Diane's request because she said she had to get some shoes.  William thought she already had plenty.  He thought she had maybe thirty or forty pairs, but in fact she had well over two hundred.  Even Diane wasn't sure, she never counted them.  William trailed along with Diane as she went from store to store looking at one pair of shoes after another.  It had ruined his entire morning.  Diane even bought several pairs, but she wasn't done yet.  This brought upon the argument that had them both eating silently at the food court.  It ended with Diane telling William, \"You don't understand how important the proper shoe is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore William's meal was done, he did know how important.  It was one of the most important things in the world to him.  He would spend the rest of the day, buying well over a dozen pairs of woman's shoes for himself.  He needed them for all occasions and of course some just because they looked good.  Diane didn't understand why William needed all these shoes anymore, especially since the shoes he wanted were from the woman's department.  Maybe the prospect of makeup sex while William is wearing his new red heels might save their relationship.  Or at least get them back to talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames lost interest and spied a couple a few seats down, an older man with grey hair sitting next to a young woman wearing a black shirt.

Fathers with children pointing at the latest dolls and toys in the windows, Mothers pushing carriages with toddlers too busy playing on their own tablets, and Teenagers holding hands while they strolled aimlessly around the mall.  \"Who should I pick?\"  James whispered to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, I can we go in and look at the toys?\"  A little girl with her brown hair tied back in a pony tail.

Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie's mouth soon grew into a huge toothy grin.  \"Really?\"  Her dad nodded.  \"Oh thank you daddy.\"  He put her down on the ground and held her hand as they went over to the nearest frozen yogurt stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always wanted to have a birthday outing.\"  James quietly said to himself.  '<i>But do I want to swap with a girl</i>?'  He was soon brought out of his thoughts by a voice he certainly didn't want to hear today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lookie who we have here.\"  A familiar voice called out to him.  \"What are you doing here, Jamie?  Looking for some guys?\"  She asked James as she nudged her 'friends' to signal that he indeed made a joke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Becky, I really don't want to mess with you today.\"  James responded to her.  \"How about you and your friends go and check out that sale over at H&amp;M and leave me alone.\"  Her friends couldn't help but look at each other with a look of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a sale?\"  The blonde friend quickly asked.  \"Sorry Becky, but I really need a new bikini for the pool party next week.\"  With that both of her friends quickly turned and made their way over to other side of the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Emily...  Jessica!\"  Becky called out to her friends trying to get them to come back, but quickly turned back over to James, who had a nice smile on his face.  \"This is certainly not the end, Jamie.\"  She pointed her finger over to him before she followed her friends before they got too far out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that certainly was fun, but I better get this over with before she talks her friends into coming back and ruining my day.\"  James said to himself as he looked around the mall to see if he could find somebody to swap with.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James decided it was much too open here and so he went into a place that was much more confined.  He found a huge McDonald's restaurant inside the mall.  This made sense since the mall had lots of traffic and so it needed a very big McDonald's to accommodate them.  Once inside, you ordered a meal, found a table and then sat down presumably to eat your meal, but really to look around without being thought of as out of place.  You found that at this McDonald's, a birthday party was going on for a small girl.  There was not only happy meals for everyone, but paper decorations, hats and even a McDonald's cake.  What you found most interesting was that at this McDonald's there was a huge play area.  It was a large cubical with a door that was maybe four and a half foot high.  This allowed easy access to the kiddies, but the parents had to wait outside if they didn't want to bend all the way over to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cube was mostly made of clear plexiglass with red plastic dividers.  It was decorated with the McDonald's arches everywhere and had large pictures of McDonald's food items on the outside such as fries and burgers.  A large Ronald McDonald poster stood by the doorway greeting the kids as they entered the play area.  Inside the area was a contraption in which kids could get in and climb around.  Children could enter it, and follow along it's winding path.  The path led them right and left, front and back, up and down.  There was many options to choose from and there were more wide open sections inside where the children could wait at and let the other kids get by.  At several points in the contraption the children could crawl at least six feet off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a big ball pit and a place with knobs and gears that the kids could this and turn.  You could get into a ride that was shaped like a plane or a car.  These rides were free and were connected to the ground by huge springs so the kids could force the ride to move front and back.  The kids seemed to be having a wonderful time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames decided to swap with the birthday girl, because it was her party and so she was the first to do anything she wanted.  James would have preferred to swap with a boy, but it was best to be the birthday person.  He really wanted to enjoy the play so he also swapped the girl's personality with his own.  James felt like a kid again.  Everything seems so exciting.  He ran into the contraction but soon discovered instantly that his shoes made it harder to get around.  He also discovered that he didn't like wearing shoes anyway so he flung them off.  Inside the contraption, James crawled around with reckless abandon. He was now wearing a dress with white tights.  Since his new personality was so innocent, he didn't care if anyone saw his butt as he climbed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, James was only going to swap for a short time.  Just long enough to play in the play areas, see what it was like and return to normal.  But he was having so much fun, he decided to continue until he had a piece of birthday cake.  Or at least until he opened up his presents.  He really wanted to see what he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James wasn't putting a lot of complex thought about potential scenarios into his urge to swap something of his with another person. All of the options were literally available to him at face value, as far as he was concerned. \"Hoooly shit.....\" He quietly curses, watching as a super voluptuous latina woman walked by. She was ferociously typing out a text on her phone, and was turning her head to look around every so often. \"Hot damn; she's got one fine body! And that outfit, is it even allowed in this mall!?\" He wondered, noting that this sexy lady had on only a light blue bikini, black flip flops and a pair of shades. There was also a very expensive looking necklace around her neck, but he didn't even notice that with her body on display. Dressed more like she was fit for a beach instead of visiting the mall, James adored how her suit clung tightly to her thick curves and jiggling assets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6b/89/ef/6b89ef74dde3fdf7397100716af970cc.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6b/89/ef/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e1/49/9a/e1499aa68d9c77ff67ab89add941b4cb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e1/49/9a/e1499...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving focused on her entire appearance, James makes the somewhat intentional, yet partially subconscious full body swap with her. Finding himself still standing in the same spot, the cool air conditioned breeze through the mall flows across his smooth, tan skin. Tickling sensitive areas like his bare cleavage and stomach, it elicits a feminine giggle from James. Outstretching his arms, James examines his new body, finding that the woman's nails had a slightly eccentric polish design on them. \"She must go out of her way to make every inch of this body look good.\" He figures, resisting urges to touch this body out in the open. Taking no more than a few steps forward, it was surprising how well the bikini supports James' huge breasts whilst still allowing for ample jiggle physics. Growing even more amused by the situation, James can't help but wonder, \"If only Eric was here to see this, he'd have a stroke from seeing me now.\" Followed by another giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he finally realized that the woman's purse was hanging over his right shoulder and he held her phone in his hands. \"Oh, well, let's see who she was texting. Hehe.\" James deviously decides, holding the phone up, which thankfully hasn't had enough time of inactivity to return to the lockscreen. <i>Gina,</i> the text read, <i>I literally just walked right out of the shop with it around my neck. No one payed any attention to it; those horn dogs were too busy staring at my body. Your convoluted plan was genius!</i> This was definitely an alarming message, as James learned that this woman was a shoplifter and had the evidence for all to see around what is currently his neck. \"Oh shit!\" He states, dropping the phone into his purse; nervously looking around like this body's original owner was doing before. Thankfully, the woman also hadn't walked any further away, in shock that she was now a younger caucasian guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat ended up startling them both was a loud, \"Stop, thief!\" The latina woman immediately thinks she was caught and bolts out of there, not bothering to deal with her swapping issue right now. \"Aw crap; I can't let her get away with my body. Especially since I look like her!\" Aiming to swap back, James is unfortunately made aware that the TSAR is not around his dainty finger. He loudly says, \"Wait, what?!\" And sees his body, hands clenched into a fist; a small, dark band of color going across his ring finger. \"She's got the ring, too!? No!\" James worries, watching as she leaves. If he ends up being stuck in this body, there's no way he'd really be able to go home. There was no way his family would believe a buxom, dark skinned woman was their young son, even if she swore on her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning right after his body, James finds that sprinting is not a task easily done in flip flops and with voluptuous curves. \"Fuck; and she's not even out of shape. Just too much weight hanging from my chest!\" He curses, slowing getting out of breath. Looking back, the pursuing security guard was looking directly at James, fully believing that he was the shoplifting woman; and it's blatantly obvious why the guard thinks that. Picking up the pace and turning back forward, it would seem that the woman managed to get out of sight in that brief lapse of surveillance. \"No!\" James whispered, feeling despair sink into his heart. </span></div></div>",

Have you no shame?\" the security guard asks, as James continue struggling. \"No wait, you've got the wrong person!\" James pleas, unable to free his dainty hands. \"Pretty sure there's only one woman wearing a blue bikini in public. And that would be you, ma'am. You're coming with me until the police arrive.\" the guard issues an ultimatum, practically dragging James with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in James' body peeks her head from around the corner. Noticing that security is taking away someone who suspiciously looks like her. \"That horny guy went right for her.\" she takes note. \"Such a genius plan.\" It was then that the latina notices the ring on her white finger. \"Oh god! This might make me look suspicious still!\" she worries, taking off the TSAR and placing it on top of one of the mall maps standing nearby. \"Good luck pinning it on me now!\" she evilly smirks, running out of the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the security office, James is sitting in a chair while the guard questions him. \"I have no idea what store was stolen from. But I didn't freaking do it.\" he explained, feeling uncomfortable in his seat. His larger backside provided a lot of comfort, yet the cool air w made James' shapely, bare body shiver. The only good thing about this was that he was facing all of the security camera monitors, allowing James to scan for his original body. Groaning since he was getting nowhere, the guard threatens to call the cops again. \"I'm asking one more time, do you have any accomplices?!\" But James shakes his head since he wasn't part of any crime. Sure, the Latinas texts definitely reveal someone helped her out, but that would be the piece of evidence to incriminate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith James having sneakily placed the phone on his chair before sitting down, the guard never found it when searching through his purse. \"Even if you did this alone, the stolen jewelry was on you this whole time. The police are going to be contacted.\" he states before leaving to make the call. \"Finally.\" James sighs, grabbing his breasts to keep them from disrupting his balance upon standing. Walking over to the screens, Kames squints ti make out the people in view. The lack of color makes it difficult, but he notices the exact design on his shirt from earlier. The woman in his body goes off screen, but leaves something atop a mall map. \"Did she take it off?!\" he yells, hoping the ring was still there. James bolts out of the office as the guard was turned the other way. His voice drowned out the sounds of the flip flops James wore on his tanned feet, letting him have a relatively successful breakout.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon sliding into proper place, the ring's diameter shrunk a bit to fit James' new finger. Also remembering the other piece of jewelry on himself; James removes the stolen necklace from his neck and places it back where the TSAR was. Giving a sigh, James states, \"Hopefully the store owners will find it.\" Now free of evidence, aside from the very body he possessed, James finds himself walking out of the mall into the open air. Still slightly uncomfortable with a female body, he pays attention to all sides of the streets. As expected, a police car comes speeding from the right, coming to a rather screeching halt 20 feet from James. \"Stop, don't move!\" The driving officer shouts, as his partner exits from the passenger side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not dealing with this right now!\" James shouts, pushing a bit of hair over his ear. Confidently stepping forward, James uses the ring to consecutively change the awareness of both officers. The first one sees James not as a thieving woman, but as a young man walking by now. Confused, the second officer says, \"What are you doing? That's the woman we received the call about!\" Before his awareness changes and finds that James is now an innocent guy. They excuse themselves from the area and stride towards the mall; James was finally free from the crime temporarily. \"Didn't think I could really change their awareness for a second there.\" He reveals, letting forth a huge sigh. \"At least that will help me out at home until I can find this woman again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it has gotten really late in the day and that would be exactly where James has to go back to. 20 minutes later, he arrives home late for dinner, immediately changing the awareness of his family. The fact that they were altered one by one made for a rather comedic bit, but in the end, normalcy returned for the family. After that, he went about doing regular activities like homework and video games; although, it was amusing that he did such things whilst wearing such a small bikini. Wearing it as sleepwear when he went to bed, James concluded that tomorrow would be spent finding his original body. There'd be no way he can keep up with changing the awareness of everyone, even if he went into another body. Next day.....</span></div></div>",

(The truth was that the Latina used the TSAR on the security guard to make him give up the chase.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK um Miss,\" James said tentatively. \"There has been a mix-up.  Let's swap back bodies and I'll give you the necklace and we'll both be happy and back to normal.  Just give me the ring and I can fix everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you messed everything up.  I'll fix it,\" the Latina told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arguing for a few seconds, James decided to let the woman try.  He thought that the woman probably wanted her body back.  He thought it was more important to get his own body than to get the TSAR.  After this debacle, maybe using the TSAR was more trouble than it was worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames waited for about half a minute before he complained.  He hadn't noticed walking behind him on the way to the mall a woman and her four year old son.  The woman was holding onto both a stroller and the scooter the little boy was riding.

This will only take a second,\" the former Latina informed him.  She then used the TSAR to swap their bodies.  The Latina was back to her voluptuous feminine body which included her bikini.  James was back to what he thought was his normal body.  He had the body of a four year old boy.  He was dressed in a orange jacket with black stripes, grey sweat pants, sneakers and a safety helmet.  He looked at himself and thought he was back to normal.  He still wore the expensive necklace and carried her purse.  (The Latina swapped bodies and clothes, but not accessories.  She wanted to keep the TSAR.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK now Give me the ring and I'll give you your purse and necklace,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can keep it.  I have something worth much more than that,\" the giddy Latina said.  James tried to reach for the ring, but the Latina thrust her hands over he head and James couldn't reach it.  He could grab a hold of her arm, but he was too short and too weak to make her do anything.  Due to the TSAR, James didn't know that anything was wrong with himself.  Deciding that being back to normal was better than having the TSAR James left the scene.  He headed towards his best friend Eric's house to tell him about what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's parents didn't notice anything wrong with James, but Eric did.  After hearing the story, Eric told James what must have happened.

He had only had the TSAR for a short time, maybe it wasn't worth all the trouble.  He thought he was no worse than he had been before he got the TSAR.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to go home, but then he thought about the expensive necklace he now had.  \"What should he do with it?\" he thought.  He didn't know if he should keep it or return it to the jewelry store, turn it in to the police or wash his hands of it by just throwing it away.  He decided it would be best to ask his friend Eric what to do.  Besides he wanted to tell Eric about the ring and how for a few minutes he was this hot Latina woman.  He didn't think Eric would believe him, but he did have the necklace and the woman's purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to Eric's house seemed farther than usual.

He put his hand onto his crotch and tried to hold it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to Eric's house he took his hand off his crotch and pushed the doorbell.

He found himself swaying from leg to leg hoping he would make it.  He did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's mom saw James at the door.  \"James, Eric is in his room,\" she said.  She had known James since he was well the age he now appeared four years old.  She knew what he wanted.  James dashed in and ran to the bathroom.  He lifted the toilet seat.  He closed the door and pulled down his sweat pants and underwear in one quick motion.  (James was wearing Batman Underroos underwear.)  Finally he pointed at the bowl and let the stream fly.  He had only moments to spare, but he had made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, James entered Eric's room.  Eric who was immune to the magic of the ring could both see who was in his room and what he really looked like now.  Whereas Eric's mom saw James's four year old body as normal for him.  Eric knew it was James and that he shouldn't have the body he now possessed..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!  What happened to you?\" Eric exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames thought he meant about the purse and the necklace so he wasn't too concerned about Eric's reaction.  \"Boy do I have a story for you.\"  James told Eric about finding the ring and what it did.  He told him about how he swapped with the Latina woman.  He told him about being chased by security and finding the Latina again.  Then he told him about swapping back  Finishing his story with \"...and then I decided to come here and ask you what I should do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there is more to the story than you are telling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I told you everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't see anything wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look into the mirror and tell me if you notice anything different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked into the mirror.

The only thing that was odd, or so he thought, was the necklace and the purse.  \"No.  What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James how old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humor me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm eighteen, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well James you look like you're four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to convince James.  he didn't totally believe it.  But he knew the ring worked so he had to consider what Eric was telling him was true.  The necklace was forgotten.  That could wait until later, but he had to 'get his body back.'  For that they had to find the ring.  They had only one clue, but it was a big one.  They had the Latina woman's purse.  Inside was her identification and what ever else she carried in her purse.  Also, James' new four year-old body seemed somewhat familiar to Eric.  But he wasn't sure where he had seen it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found her name was Elisa Rainey and her address.  But neither could be sure if this was her real name/address or she had stole the purse just like she stole the necklace.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I guess she was too mad with power to realize you still had her personal items.\" Eric noted, as the two walked along the sidewalk to Elisa's house, after having looked up the address on his phone. \"Even if that isn't the case, it's a miracle as far as I'm concerned.\" James agreed, now talking note of his smaller height since Eric made him relatively aware of it. \"God, I wish I were taller.\" He groaned. Surprisingly, Elisa didn't live that far from the mall she hit up; most likely wanting to steal from a place close to home for her first time. The two friends were now two blocks away when Eric started noticing physical changes of the few civilians walking out just like them. A man with smaller, feminine arms trod right past them and a woman with a very masculine mustache sat on a bus stop bench, reading a book across the road. \"Uh, dude, are you noticing these people?\" Eric inquired, to which James replied, \"Of course I'm noticing them. They're just enjoying the weather, I guess. Unless, you actually mean that they're....\" He realized that people were swapped around, although the changes were more subtle than his own earlier. \"Damn, you caught sight of them pretty quickly. Maybe she's testing the ring out; in which case, we should head to her house more quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took off running ahead of Eric, now less than a block down the road. Suddenly, James feels his balance shift; he can't notice any changes, figuring he must've tripped on a hole or something. In actuality, Eric could see that James now had the lower body of a black woman, clad in jeans and flats below his younger upper body. \"Hey, James!\" He called, which ended with some success as his friend stood still to look back. \"What's up?\" James yelled back, unaware that the rest of his upper body then became that of a white business woman, wearing a tight blouse straining against his modestly size chest. Habitually adjusting the glasses on his feminine face, he scolded Eric, \"Dude, we can't keep dilly dallying; Elisa's got that ring and could be using it at this very moment!\" \"Yeah, no kidding.\" Eric grumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow being a mix of races, James obliviously kept going forward, stopping at Elisa's front door. \"You think she saw us?\" He asked, as Eric caught up. \"That would be an understatement.\" He replied, poking Jame's less broad shoulder. Quietly opening the unlocked front door, Eric sneaks inside first with James a foot behind. The front of the house had no lights on and all of the doors in sight were open. \"She could be anywhere....\" Eric whispered, looking over to the dining room adjacent to the front hall. Creaks can be heard from different parts of the house, but neither of the two could deduce whether that was from a person, or just occasional noises. James went further down the hall, his footsteps muffled by the softer flats adorning his dark skinned feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames heard a female voice shout from Eric's side of the house, so he sprinted back to see Eric pinning Elisa to the floor, the ring visible on her right hand. \"Help me man, she's stronger than I thought!\" Eric shouted. \"Oh, you have a friend?\" She snidely remarked. \"That was a dumb idea!\" Elisa stares at James, intending to make a swap between him and Eric; but to her surprise Eric is still normal and holding her down. Trying again, Elisa grows enraged that her fun is cut so short. \"What the hell; why isn't this thing working on you!?\" She says directly to Eric's face. \"Wait, what?\" James overheard, stepping forward and not reaching for the ring. \"Damn it, James. Grab the freaking ring!\" Eric demanded, bringing James back to his senses. \"Uh, right...\" He complies, moving over to grab the ring on Elisa's finger.</span></div></div>",

Elisa closed her hand into a fist making the ring tough to remove.  But held on the floor with the complete strength of an adult woman trying to open her hand, James and Eric were making progress in retrieving the TSAR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa realized her mistake.  Making James into a combination of two women (like a black and white cookie) was an error in judgement.  She focused on undoing the last two changes, returning James into a four-year-old again.  With his new body, his strength was gone.  Elisa returned her hand into a fist  James' four-year-old body was not useless in helping Eric retrieve the ring.  But Eric was stronger than Elisa and concentrated his efforts on her hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, 'James' ran off.  \"James, hey what gives?\" Eric exclaimed as he saw the four-year-old run off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude it's me,\" James said.  He was now in the body of Elisa under Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Eric heard the front door slam.  Looking back at 'Elisa's' hand he noticed that the TSAR was gone.  Then when he looked at Elisa's face, he could tell that the woman under him was't Elisa at all, but it was indeed James.  Elisa had swapped bodies with him during the struggle.  Eric got off James who now that the body of sexy Latina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do now?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go after her,\" was Eric's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we try again, she'll slip away again.  With the ring she is too tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking.  I don't have to wear the ring to use it.  As long as I am touching it that is enough.  If I can touch the ring, I can make a swap  which will give me the ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it'll work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams were heard from outside.  James in the body of the Latina and Eric dashed to the door outside they saw the body that James had inhabited screaming.  \"There she is,\" James exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that isn't her,\" Eric explained.  Eric could see through all the changed caused by the ring.  \"That is some poor person who the Elisa swapped body with.  They are screaming out of shock.  But I see her over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric saw someone quietly walking away from the vicinity of the screaming boy.  What body did she have now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh no,\" Eric exclaimed, viewing the body Elisa currently possessed. \"James; that police officer over there; that's her.\"  His friend didn't need any explanation as to why this could be the worst possible outcome. With the authority of being an officer, Elisa would only have to call for backup if they tried pinning her down again. Not to mention that if she had a body cam per chance, both James and Eric's faces would be identified and branded as ne'er-do-wells. \"How are we supposed to go about this?\" James pondered, folding his arms under his bust. \"Sure, all I'd have to do is get into touch with the ring again; but it's still difficult to get too close.\" Eric nodded, \"Plus, she knows we're after her now. At this point, I'm sure that she was unaware and merely testing the ring when we were tracking her down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let's step back and take stock of any cards we have in play.\" James suggested, as the two slowly followed from a distance. \"According to her, you weren't affected by the ring earlier. If that's the case, you're the ultimate weapon against Elisa.\" \"Unless she was lying, to mess with us.\" Eric interrupted, but James continued. \"Aside from that, I have her body again.This might be stretching it, but in case she actually does want her own body, it'll help with me inhabiting it. She might stop at nothing to get it back.\" Eric shrugged before giving his input. \"That's stretching it too much; Elisa could just swap bodies of information with anyone. Tracking you and her own body down would be a stress free cakewalk to her. Hell, maybe she wouldn't even care, since she could just swap into new bodies with status or that appeal to her.\" James didn't like the sound of that, but figured Eric was right. \"Then all we have is you, really; while she's got the power to change anything with anyone, and the authority of the law currently\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the rather strong looking, male officer that is Elisa, James couldn't help but realize one more trump card he could pull. \"Eric, we totally forgot that she has a weakness now.\" Trying to understand what James meant, Eric looked over at Elisa's back. \"I'm not seeing it; all i keep coming up with is that she can just switch into new bodies when one gets exhausted: unlimited stamina.\" James growled and explained, \"Stop trying to bring my hopes down. Take a good look at her; she's a freaking guy. You know where the weak spot of any man is? Right between the legs.\" Now Eric could perceive his friend's plan, \"It hurts like hell to get hit in the nuts; she won't be able to concentrate and swap out of it right away. Perfect, but we'll need a distraction.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be the distraction.\" James decides, stopping at the bottom of a random driveway and picking up a bike they forgot to bring back inside. \"You're able to run faster than me,\" He explained, gesturing to his current voluptuous curves. \"I'll drive ahead and get in front; if I can stop her for just a second, it should give you enough time to rather sneakily catch up. After that, wham! Give her the ole one two in her gonads.\" \"All right fine,\" Eric agree, as James got onto the stolen bike. \"But after this, I want a reward for using such a cheap tactic on another guy; it doesn't feel fully right to sneak so low.\" Although this was no more than a joke; Eric is more than willing to stop Elisa right now, regardless of her current body. \"Let's move out!\" James silently declares, speeding ahead on the road with Eric going along the sidewalk.</span></div></div>",

He knew he would only have one opportunity to get it right and he couldn't try and think of something in the heat of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa noticed the two coming out of the house.  She had hoped she could hide in this new body, but the one who was friends with the boy she swapped could see her no matter what she did.  He had some type of sixth sense when it came to this.  Her swapping ability wasn't going to help her when it come to these two.  She had to try something else.  She was about to call for backup and have the two arrested, when she felt something tugging at her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa looked down and saw a four-year-old boy standing right besides her.  He was pulling on her uniform.  This was the body of the boy she had just swapped.  Inside his body was the policeman who didn't know anything had happened.  In his mind, despite having the small body and wearing juvenile clothes, he still considered himself a police officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am,\" he said with authority, \"do you have any identification?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I umm, I,\" she stammered.  She hadn't expected anything like this.  She was caught off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impersonating a police officer is a serious offense,\" the boy informed Elisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean this is just a...a joke.  I'm wearing a costume,\" she tried to explain.  She was trying to look for a way out.  Maybe she could swap him with someone else.  Then she could get into the patrol car and drive away.  She saw many people on the street, but a toddler in a stroller was the best bet.  The boy already had a small body, plus he was strapped into the stroller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's you name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and James saw that Elisa was distracted and ran toward her.  This was their opportunity to fix things.  James had the wording of his swap prepared.  Just before Eric and James could pounce Elisa noticed them coming.  She didn't have time to think, she would put James into the toddler and then take it from there.  But at that moment James had reached the ring with a swap of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dust cleared, James was in the body of the police officer, wearing his uniform as well as the TSAR.  Elisa was in the body of the toddler strapped into the stroller.  The toddler's mother had picked up her pace seeing the trouble and wanted to get her child out of there.  Elisa strted to shout.  But the mother stuck a pacifier into her mouth.  Inside Elisa's body was the toddler who scared out of her mind started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the police office (four-year-old) James quickly swapped bodies with him.  Seeing the crying lady the police officer tried to help her.  Eric who instantly knew what had happened, grabbed a hold of James (who was back to the body of a four year old) and escorted him away from the scene.  They had gotten what they wanted.  They now had the ring.  The problem was that James needed to find the real four-year-old and get his own body back.</span></div></div>",

Was he already insane?  He didn't think so.  He decided to not worry about the ring and deal with it tomorrow.  But one thing was for sure until he knew one way or the other the ring wasn't going to leave his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was a school day and so he did his usual morning routine and then left for school.  He met up with Eric and proceeded with him to school.  He didn't want to tell Eric what had happened in case he was crazy.  It was best to test the ring out before telling anyone, even his best friend.  The first period class James shared with Eric but not the second period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames entered his second period class which was Living  Environment.  Mr. Conti was teaching and the class had settled into its routine.  James wanted to make a small change that he would notice but wouldn't seem too out of the ordinary.  The ring made it clear that he could make the people around not notice the odd things that happened and he wanted to test this too, but he couldn't do anything too bizarre in case it didn't work.  Something if it went wrong there wouldn't be any problem.  James thought about swapping the clothes between the teacher and one of the students.  Or making one of the students the teacher and the teacher a student.  He thought of a lot of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he hit upon it, make nothing happen and no one notice.  That was it.  James would reach into Mr. Conti's mind and every time  he was about to say something he would forget it.  He would stand there saying nothing and James could see if anyone noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames started his plan, there were two parts to it.  The first was to make Mr. Conti forget what he was about to say.  It was a natural thing, happens all the time, you have something on the tip of your tongue but you can't get a hold of it.  That is the way it would be for Mr. Conti if he tried to say anything about the 'Living Environment.\"  The second step was to make the class unaware that nothing was happening.  James would do this all class and see if anything (well nothing actually) happened.  If he could do this he could try something more exotic like a student teaching the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Conti was standing in front of the class and you could see he was about to say something, but he didn't do it.  The rest of the class was either looking at him, or ready to write down what he was about to say or not paying attention to what was going on as they usually did.  But no one did anything out of the ordinary even though Mr. Conti hadn't said a word in over a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of the students in the back weren't paying attention to what Mr. Conti 'wasn't' saying and Mr. Conti did notice.  he went over to them and chastised them as if it was a perfectly normal class and he had plenty to say.  But when he was done getting the class back to order he continued to stand in the front of the class on the verge of lecturing but not saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames loved it all.  Nothing was happening and it was a hoot.  When the class bell rang, James returned everyone (including Mr. Conti) to normal and went to his next class.  James decided to try and make one small change in every class he attended today but he resolved to return everyone in the class to normal when the 'end of period' bell sounded.</span></div></div>",

He loved the awareness feature best.  He could make no one aware or everyone aware or just a few people aware.  His next class was chemistry and in this class he was going to make a couple people in the class aware but most of the class wouldn't notice a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence thing was fun but doing it in one class was enough for him, this time he was going to make a different type of change.  He was going to change the clothes of at least two students.  Changing the clothing of two people of the same gender wouldn't really make that much difference.  Actually for the most part everyone wore jeans and T-shirts regardless of gender so he would have to find a girl who was wearing a dress or at the very least a skirt and swap her outfit with one of the boys of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when James got to his next class he couldn't find anyone suitable to swap with. Well there was the teacher Mrs. Mustard.  Mrs. Mustard was in her fifties and although she was a plus sized woman she still liked to wear skirt suits.  James decided to swap her clothes with one of the boys in the back.  He also decided that three people would be involved and everyone else would be unaware of anything.  Mrs. Mustard would have all her apparel swapped with a boy in the back but she would be unaware of the swap.  One of the girls in the front would be aware of Mrs. Mustard's inappropriate apparel and a boy in the back who received Mrs. Mustard's apparel would notice his clothes as being wrong but not notice anything wrong with anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames made the swap.  Mrs. Mustard was now dressed in a pair of jeans and a T-shirt which contained the name of a rock band.  Without her bra her breasts drooped noticeably under their own weight.  Her body bulged and sagged in all the wrong places and since she was wearing a pair of male cut jeans they hung low on her hips since it wasn't gathered at the waist like women's clothing usually is.  On her feet were athletic white socks and sneakers.  She didn't wear any makeup nor any jewelry anymore.  Despite this she continued to teach her class as she normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of the room, Rick was mortified.  All of a sudden he was wearing a light brown suit that descended down to his knees.  He could see a matching brown blouse with big white buttons on it.  On his legs peaking out under his skirt were nude pantyhose.  On his feet were sensible woman's shoes (also in brown to match his suit) with a small heel.  He could tell he was wearing a bra although it had been resized to his torso although the cup size did not resize to his lack of breasts.  He didn't know for sure but could have guessed that he was also wearing panties (which matched his bra (not that he cared.)  He also didn't know that the tightness he was feeling around his lower regions was a girdle.  Actually he wasn't really concerned with his underwear, what could be seen was embarrassing enough.  If he could take stock of himself he might also realize that he was wearing a woman's watch and a pretty necklace which was worn under the blouse he was wearing.  His ears had become pierced and he wore pretty earrings in each of his ears.  He also wore makeup but there was no way for him to tell without a mirror although the odd taste in his mouth (from the lipstick) might have given him a clue if he had though about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the front of the class, Stacy was horrified that Mrs. Mustard would come to class like that.  It was downright obscene.  Stacy could see the sag of Mrs. Mustard's breasts and also clearly see her nipples.  Stacy had seen this type of stuff before obviously.  She had seen plenty of women of all types naked in locker rooms and dressing rooms.  But never in public around men.  Stacy sat there with her mouth opened, not knowing what to do.  Mrs. Mustard noticed and asked her, \"Is there a problem?\"  \"No Mrs. Mustard\" was the quick reply.  Then Stacy started to look around to see if anyone else was seeing what she was.  But the class looked completely normal to Stacy's amazement.  Stacy would ask someone after the class was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back, Rick was praying no one would look back and see him.  He tried to remain motionless to prevent anyone from noticing him.  He didn't know what to do.  He could just run and leave.  He was in the seat closest to the window in the back of the room, if he made a bolt for the door people would see him.  The best plan he could come up with was to wait until class ended.  Let everyone leave and then hold his books over he face while he ran through the halls out of the school and back home.  The seconds seemed like hours as he waited for the class to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the bell ended and James returned the clothing to Mrs. Mustard and Rick.  Rick was waiting for everyone to leave not noticing that he was back in his own clothes again.  When he was ready he made a break for it.  He ran as fast as he could.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James had never been a fan of history, but with his special ring now secured tight on his finger, he knew that every history lesson from now on could be as exciting as he made them. Having enjoyed the little 'experiment' with Mrs. Mustard and his classmate Rick, James decided on something similar in his history lesson. But first he had to pick two 'victims' and choose whether to make both, or one... or neither of them aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long. Megan Harper was one of the school's cheerleaders, but not the head one. She was an attractive girl with wavy auburn hair that she wore down most of the time. Only having it in a ponytail during practise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other person James selected was one of the more average male students, Thomas. He couldn't exactly be called a nerd, but he wasn't one of the most popular lads in school either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for awareness, James decided only the girl should be aware of the change this time. He concentrated and made the swap, then he watched Megan's reactions with amusement and interest. Megan was slow at first to notice anything, but she eventually looked down when she no longer felt the straps of her bra around her torso. Her C-cup breasts were hanging loose underneath the boy's t-shirt she now wore. <i>What the hell...</i> she thought, tugging at the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA further glance down and Megan saw she was also wearing jeans and a pair of worn, boy's sneakers, and socks. To say she was confused would be a severe understatement. From the feeling around her crotch, it was obvious to her that she was no longer wearing her knickers, instead - more loose-fitting underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes, Megan began feeling self-conscious, but her confusement grew when nobody around her seemed to react to her change of clothing. Even though a couple of her female classmates looked at her, they failed to say or do anything out of the ordinary. It was then that Megan glanced off to her right and caught sight of Thomas in his usual seat. Normal... except that he now wore Megan's low-cut top, plaid skirt and her pink &amp; white tennis shoes, as well as her pendant and her rings, which she hadn't noticed were missing from her fingers until now. The skirt really didn't suit Thomas, with his hairy legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst, Thomas, what the fuck happened?\" Megan whispered loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the teacher heard her and admonished her. Not that she would have got a helpful response from Thomas anyway, he didn't know what she was talking about. From his own position behind the pair, James chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pondered whether to reverse the swap, swap something else between Megan and Thomas... or make another swap with two other people. He even thought about including his teacher again, this time... his history teacher Mr. Johnson, age 48.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr he could just leave his next swap until his next class.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had worn jeans and t-shirts before. All girls did.  But Thomas had never worn blouses and skirts.  In her opinion he looked like a fag.  She did however have one problem, her boobs.  Without her bra, her boobs sagged a bit, but more importantly her nipples could be seen through the thin t-shirt which was stretched in a way it had never done before.  She spent the class using her books to try and cover up her embarrassment.  She would talk to Thomas after class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just before class, a stroke of genius came to James.  James swapped Megan's and Thomas' bodies from the neck down, but this time, Thomas would notice the change and Megan would think all was perfectly alright.  Within a moment, Thomas' body adjusted to fit the clothes he was now wearing.  Breasts filled out his bra and his hips filled out the curves of his waist.  The first thing that Thomas noticed wasn't the breasts on his chest, it was his new long, manicured finger nails on his delicate hands.  The girlish rings he wore seemed fine, it was the size and shape of his fingers that he noticed.  This drew his attention up his hairless thin arms and then to his boobs.  he didn't think there was anything wrong with wearing the bra that supported them, but having boobs on his chest was a new thing.  From his sitted position, he couldn't see his shapely smooth legs or his smooth cleanly shaven crotch with his vagina.  He was too shocked about his breasts to think about not having a penis anymore at this moment.  It was all he could do to not grab his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered Megan saying something about  what happened and he looked over into her direction.  He saw his male body although she was still wearing what he thought were her normal clothing.  \"Oh My God,\" he thought.  \"How did I not realize this before.\"  Megan whose body now fit the clothing she was wearing, was still embarrassed about her clothing, but not her new body which seemed perfectly normal to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the bell sounded and both Thomas and Megan wanted to speak to each other.  Both her terribly embarrassed but not about the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

But for a moment they just eyed each other up, head to foot. \"What the hell is going on? How can this be happening?\" Thomas bellowed...as he finally reached up to grope his boobs through his top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but... it's obvious we swapped.\" Megan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas was unimpressed with that statement of the obvious. \"No shit! I've got friggin' boobs. YOUR boobs!\" he said, as he vainly tried to keep his volume down as other students passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan just frowned at him. \"What are you talking about? We swapped clothes!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only confused Thomas even more. \"What?? Are you crazy? We switched bodies from the neck down from the looks of it.\" he muttered. And it was only then that he became aware of the distinct 'empty' feeling between his legs. \"Oh my god, my dick is gone!\" he gasped, as one of his manicured hands shot down to his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I'm aware, you've never had a dick Thomas.\" Megan insisted. \"Your body looks normal to me, we're just wearing each other's clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas shook his head, disgreeing with her. \"No, these are my clothes.\" he said, grabbing the hem of his skirt. \"But these...\" he repeated, grabbing his tits, \"...are not mine, they're yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys don't wear skirts.\" Megan stated firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" Thomas rolled his yees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stepped back, not sure what to make of it all. All she was sure of, was that this day just got turned upside down in a hurry. And she didn't know what the hell to do next. She didn't feel too weird wearing Thomas' clothes, but the way Thomas was behaving, acting like his own body wasn't his, was unsettling her. Part of her couldn't help but wonder if he was telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a short distance away, a curious James was observing the pair.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mrs. Geller now thought that Thomas was wearing her clothes and that Megan had her body from the neck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thomas what are you doing in my clothes???\" Mrs. Geller screamed not realizing that Megan had her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are my clothes.  Why does everyone think they belong to them?\" Thomas replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they aren't they are mine.

Those are my clothes that Thomas is wearing,\" Megan interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me,\" Mrs. Geller said, \"how can I ever wear anything like that.  It was at this point she noticed the breasts on her chest and realized her body was wrong.  She then noticed Megan.  \"You...you...you have my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have your what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my body.  What am I doing with these breasts.  My god look at the rest of me.  She reached down to her crotch.  \"Where is my penis?\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't your body, it's my body.  I'm the man.  I'm the one who is supposed to have a dick,\" James shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that, this is my hot body.\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it isn't,\" Mrs. Geller and Thomas said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it isn't.  It's my hot body.\"  At that moment to prove her point Megan stuck a hot pose with Thomas' body although she still felt awkward due to the clothing she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look ridiculous,\" Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in these clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trying to look all sexy in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the three were arguing and James was loving it.  Both Thomas and Mrs. Geller thought that Megan had their body.  One of them was right.  On the other hand both, Megan and Mrs. Geller thought that Thomas was wearing their clothing.  Once again only one of them was right.  No one thought that they belonged in Mrs. Geller's clothing or body, not even Mrs. Geller.  There was no class scheduled in this room for an entire period.

In the hall, the school bully, Sylvester was talking to (as he put it) on one of the students.  The other student considered it more of harassment than just a chat.  James decided to help the boy.  But he didn't know what to do.  He didn't want to swap anything between the Sylvester and anyone else because that person didn't deserve it and James was still new at this and didn't make to let any know about what he could do.  He also wanted to make a permanent change this time since if he didn't the bully would just return to bullying after he was returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen James got an idea.  He could swap something inside Sylvester alone.  He didn't know if it was possible, but it was worth a shot.  James swapped what Sylvester thought that he should wear with what Sylvester thought that a girl should wear.  He didn't have to use a real girl to swap, this was just Sylvester's perception of himself.  Suddenly Sylvester became uncomfortable with what he was wearing.  he didn't know how he got into these clothes they seemed so gay to him although he was wearing a normal jeans and T-shirt outfit that pretty much all the boys were wearing.  What he wanted to wear was something frilly and in pastels.  The frillier seemed more appropriate for him.  he was totally embarrassed by what he wore now and had to get out of here before more people saw him.  He ran for the doors and out the school.  Unlike Rick, Sylvester ran all the way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, he couldn't find a stitch of clothing that wasn't totally embarrassing to him.  The closest clothes he could find and they weren't perfect, they were something that an 'old woman' would wear were the clothes in his mother's closet.  He didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at school, James relished the idea that he had a new way to swap people that didn't require two people.  James realized that he could also swap a trait of someone with no one and remove that trait from one person alone.  He could simply do something like swap a persons high school education with nothing and that person would only be as smart as he was in middle school.  That might be fun to try.  Or he could swap a person's modesty with nothing wouldn't that liven the school?  Maybe when he had more practice with his powers would he try such things.</span></div></div>",

The first place to get female hormones was to steal his mother's birth control pills.  Sylvester couldn't just take it, his mom would notice they were gone and start looking for them.  There was no way to get away with that.  Sylvester thought that maybe he could just swap the pills with tic tacs or some mints.  But when he found the pills and saw what they looked like he realized that that would never work.  Then Sylvester got a plan, he told his mom that he had ruined the pills in some way.  That he spilled something on them or they fell into the toilet anything so that his mom would just get more and he could take them.  With that plan complete he hid her pills and started taking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time he decided to do some research so he looked up on google \"What's in birth control pills.\"  He found out that they did have female hormones, estrogen and progesterone, but small amounts.  This wasn't going to be enough so he looked again in google for \"estrogen boosting foods.\"  He found out that \"foods that help boost estrogen naturally include apples, alfalfa, barley, baker's yeast, beets, cherries, chickpeas, carrots, celery, cucumbers, dates, fennel, oats, olives and olive oil, papaya, peas, plums, pomegranates, potatoes, beans, rhubarb, rice, tomatoes, wheat and yams. Seeds such as sesame seeds, flaxseed and sunflower seeds also help to boost levels of this hormone in the body.\"  So he started trying to eat more of these foods.  But this was never going to help.  He has had plenty of apples, cherries and potatoes before when he didn't want to look more feminine and he didn't grow breasts before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't buy female hormones, not without a prescription so he decided he would have to steal some.  He knew which were the slutty girls and knew they must have some birth control pills.  But when he tried to steal them he was caught.  </span></div></div>",

She always dressed in heels and short dresses that showed off her big ass and amble breasts.  Despite being Hispanic however, she spoke perfect English, which was obviously a requirement of being an English teacher\u2026  She was always regarded as one of the best in the school, especially in her ability to get the male students to pay attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the students started filing into the classroom, Mrs. Nazario sat at her desk wearing a pair of black framed glasses and was skimming through a book she would make the class read from today.  She had her legs crossed and was dangling one of her high heeled pumps on the ends of her toes.  James could never get over how attractive she was, and he knew that he would have to include her in a swap for sure.  It was impossible not to at this point, he'd already described her in great detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when James noticed the other main attraction of the classroom come in just before the bell.  It was Natalie McAllister, one of the school's varsity cheerleaders.  She was one of the most empty headed ditzes in the entire school, but of course all the guys drooled over her looks.  She had perfect blonde hair and perfect legs and well, perfect everything for an 18 year old.  She sat down two seats away from James, and immediately started primping herself in the mirror.  James definitely thought she was sexy, but knew that he would never be able to hold an intelligent conversation with a girl like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen class was about to start, James finally had an idea.  Both Natalie and Mrs. Nazario were very attractive, but at least the teacher had an intelligent mind to back that up and she was perfectly capable of teaching a class.  James wondered what would happen if Natalie had to teach the class\u2026  He focused on the ring's power, and felt a tingling in his finger as it activated.  He had swapped Natalie and Mrs. Nazario's responsibilities and occupations.  The teacher was now a student in the class, and Natalie was now in charge of teaching everyone.  He also made sure everyone but himself would think this was completely normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne important thing however, James made sure not to swap any of the knowledge Natalie needed, so she was completely on her own.  The only thing she knew was today she'd have to teach English\u2026  James also thought to top it all off he should swap their clothes as well.  When Natalie walked up to the front of the class, she clicked along in her new high heeled pumps, and strutted her hips in her short dress.  She didn't quite have the Latina ass to fill out the dress, so it was a bit less strained than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026 Julia, you mind, like, taking a seat or something?  We need to get started.\"  Natalie\u2026 or rather Miss McAllister as she was known to the class, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looked confused about why she was sitting at Miss McAllister's desk, and she quickly hurried back to her seat wearing her cheerleader's uniform and tennis shoes.  Julia sat in Natalie's old seat, and quickly opened her book to the page they were going to start from today.  Meanwhile, Miss McAllister stood at the front of the classroom, twirling a lock of bleached blonde hair in one hand, and flipping through pages of the book trying desperately to figure out what she was supposed to teach today\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the new 18 year old teacher took a minute to figure out what to do, James looked around at the classroom, and the reaction seemed no different than before.  The guys were all fixated on Miss McAllister now, drooling over her in that short dress that showed off her smooth lightly tanned legs.  Meanwhile, Julia, the new cheerleader, was already waiting for the teacher to get caught up to the page she was on.  She raised her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, Julia?  Like, what is it?\"  Miss McAllister asked, starting to panic about not knowing what to teach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe we were on page 153, we were going to read the passage from Gulliver's Travels today.\"  Julia informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026 were we?  That sounds good let's do that\u2026\"  The new teacher said, relieved that at least her students remembered what she was supposed to be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had them start reading the chapter, and James saw that she was relieved to finally get to sit down at her desk and started texting on her phone while the students read.  She giggled and twirled her hair some more as she was probably texting some guy she liked.  But it wasn't going to be that easy for her.  The students quickly finished reading, especially Julia who finished first.  She had already read this of course, so she was able to skim through it fast.  She had her hand up again, and this time it annoyed Miss McAllister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what Julia?  Like, you're already done?\"  she said, obviously upset that she had to put her phone down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I was wondering what you thought about the symbolism of the Lilliputian government on modern society?  When I read it the first time I knew there must be some allegory but I still haven't fully worked it out.\"  Julia said, seemingly very excited about reading this book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss McAllister stood at the front of the class, staring blankly at the book in her hands that she was supposed to have been reading along with the class.  \"Umm\u2026 like\u2026  Aren't they those little leprechauns or something?  I think it represents luck, and like\u2026 you know the gold at the end of the rainbow and stuff\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone in the class laughed, and soon the rest of the class was laughing as well.  No one could take that seriously.  It was obvious the teacher had no idea what was going on.  Even the guys who were entranced by her beauty couldn't help but bust out laughing at how airheaded this girl was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Like!  All of you just shut up or you're getting like, detention and stuff!  I don't want any more outbursts like that!  Let's move on to the next subject\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But the next day, James knew that he could use this TSAR for sexual purposes, and practically limitless, consentless sexual purposes at that. As long as it could be done through the secretive swapping of male or female traits, any fantasy was go for him. And the next day he'd be spending the whole day at his girlfriend Lauren's house. So he considered what he could do with his great power without great responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course James had fucked before, but never on the other side of the gender coin. If he could convince Lauren to \"give some\" that day, he could easily swap their entire bodies under no suspicion at all and then experience sex as a straight women for the first time ever. But of course, he'd be doing himself and well, anything with \"-cest\" in the title wouldn't be something he'd want to commit to. But he'd still like being in the body of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were the thoughts eclipsing James's mind while he played around with the TSAR. Just then, he noticed he could lift up part of the TSAR to reveal tiny sliders, and a second mental message told him that he could use one to change the speed of a swap, ranging from seconds to hours, and another to change the amount of simultaneous swaps of different kinds, such as body swap and clothing swap. This only heightened the sexual possibilities for James; imagine slowing down a sexual swap to several minutes, particularly if it was from say, a long penis to a vagina or small pecs to large breasts. Mrs. Tam had some of the latter, and that's when James realized who he should really use it on. He could spend the day slowly but definitively surely becoming Mrs. Tam in several ways. He'd simply tell Lauren to lay off the romantic interaction by lying that he had a cold or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the next day arrived, and James was sure to set the time slider to maximum and simultaneous slider to maximum. He greeted the Tam family at the door, alerted them about a cold and immediately set the TSAR usage on Mrs. Tam with the ring behind his back, and it seemed to start before James specified what to do. James was unsure about just how far the transforming would go, but if one thing was for sure, his mind was focused solely on Mrs. Tam. The ring stayed a \"depressed\" or \"inactive\" state while the long-ass transformation took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour in, and James was playing on a PS4 with Lauren. During which, he noticed strands of hair elongating and threads of fabric materializing over his pectorals, which were also beginning to bud, but these changes were subtle enough to not be noticeable. Even if James's cock was slowly shrinking, it maintained height by being erect in excitement. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tam, out in the garden, was getting a slow but sure breast reduction and shorter haircut, as well as a big shift downstairs and a smaller bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours in, and James was beginning to look feminine, not only having longer hair and more noticeable breasts, but also budding feminine lips and a slight feminine curve. His penis was getting even smaller, even in erect terms. And his thighs were starting to thicken. Even his underwear was changing to be shorter and more like panties. And of course, the swappie herself was looking manlier literally by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours in, and James was really starting to change. His breasts were bordeline impressive, even if they still had a long way to go (and covered at that). His hair was becoming the proper cut of Mrs. Tam's. The curve was elongating, her freckles began to appear as well as other facial features and he would  soon have to say goodbye to his penis, with his balls already gone at this point. Likewise, Mrs. T was becoming the spitting image of James, but to her it was just another Saturday.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They just didn't seem as much fun as they usually were.  By now you looked like you were related to Lauren.  Sort of like a much older sister or maybe her mother who had had her at a 'very young age.'  Your hair was all black, your skin was much softer than it had been but it was also starting to show signs of age too.  Your genitals were completely female by now and your breasts were unmistakably breasts.  Not to mention your clothing was Mrs. Tam's although not necessarily in her size as you still were a bit taller and bigger than she was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to the kitchen,\" you told Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I save your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naaa, you play without me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the kitchen you realized you had to start preparations for dinner.  The vegetables won't cut themselves.  The meat had to be braised and of course you had to start on a salad.  What you really wanted to do was finish your gardening, but that would wait.  Dinner came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tam had abandoned her gardening a short while before.  She knew that summer was just around the corner and she decided to look for bathing suits.  But after looking for a short time, she found that she was more interested in the models more than the suits they were wearing.  One page led to another and she was soon looking at soft core porn instead.  She kept her ears open so she could change the site if anyone approached the room she was in.  Even though, she was fully dressed in James' clothing she was 'scratching her semi-erect penis through her jeans while looking at the sexy images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames used a home-made recipe to create the braising sauce.  It was actually, Mrs. Tam's grandmother's recipe.  He then put the meat into the sauce to allow it to sit for at least an hour and started to cut vegetables.  It was at this time, when he was hard at work that he started to long for getting the garden in order.  The division of his attention between what he was doing and what he wanted to do reminded him that what he was really doing was changing.  He finally realized that his 'desires' weren't his own.  Looking at himself in a shiny surface, James realized that physically there wasn't much left of his original body.  Now he also noticed that his mental state had changed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James took notice of his changes both physical and mental.  He knew that his thoughts and desires had changed and it concerned him.  But he decided he should see this through to the end.  Besides he thought, he had started dinner, he wanted to finish it and see if everyone liked what he was preparing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Tam was feeling horny because of the porn she was watching and so she decided to seek out Lauren.  Once there she joined Lauren at the game she was playing.  She wanted to kiss her, but there were lots of people around so she just moved in close while it was Lauren's turn to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, most of the physical changes were complete for Mrs. Tam and James.  James was almost Mrs. Tam's former height and age.  His meal was cooking and he had completed the dinner salad.  It was at this time, that Lauren came to the kitchen.  \"James, when will dinner be ready?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm about another hour.  Would you be a Dear and set the table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\"  Lauren set the table most of the times for the family when her mother cooked.  Now that James had assumed Mrs. Tam's roll, Lauren would do it as she always had.  James was still Lauren's boyfriend, but he felt more like Lauren's mom.  He didn't have any sexual feelings for her but he loved her just the same.  Somehow in the new reality that the TSAR had created, he was Lauren's boyfriend and lived in his own house.  But he was the one responsible for maintaining Lauren's household including making dinner and cleaning up.  he even had his own garden which he loved in Lauren's back yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had some time while the meal was baking.  He wanted to relax a bit by doing some gardening, but he knew he couldn't.  If he did he would get dirty and he didn't have time to change.  So instead he picked up the romance novel that Mrs. Tam was reading and started to read it himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later, all the changes were complete.  James both looked and thought like Mrs. Tam in virtually all ways.  The only difference is that he knew who he really was and what had happened.  Mrs. Tam looked and thought exactly like James should except that she didn't know anything about the TSAR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the dinner table, James served his meal.  Lauren and Mrs. Tam sat together and acted like they were in a relationship.  Mr. Tam sat at the head of the table   In all respects the dinner was quite ordinary.  Everyone enjoyed the food and the conversation was respectful and family oriented.  As soon as the meal was over. James swapped himself and Mrs. Tam back in an instant.  No one noticed the difference.  No one except James that is.  he realized how differently he now feels and how he thought.    He remembered making dinner and enjoying doing it, but those feelings were gone.  He remember reading Mrs. Tam's book which he now thought was very sappy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tam and Lauren cleared the dishes from the table together as they always had done.  After which, Lauren joined James.  Mrs. Tam washed the dishes in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames enjoined the slow swap.  But he decided that a slow swap would be better if you were doing something in particular while the swap was going on.  It was at this moment, that James thought he had to take a leak.  He wanted to try something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter excusing himself, he did a three minute genital swap with Lauren.  He wanted to see how it felt to start peeing as a boy and end as a girl.  He was going to whip out his dick while his genitals were changing while peeing.  But then he realized if he tried that if he did that he would piss himself as his penis disappeared.  He would either have to take off his pants and position himself over the bowl as he changed or simply pull down his pants sit on the bowl and pee as his penis disappeared.  Either way he would have to move his fingers fast as to not pee on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

He pulled down his pants, pointed his dick with his hands and started to pee.  Everything felt perfectly normal.  After about 30 seconds, he wondered if he hadn't done something wrong since his penis seemed to be the same size and nothing seemed to be changing.  What he didn't notice was that his balls were getting smaller in that time and internal feminine organs were being formed.  After another 20 seconds he did notice his penis was getting smaller but peeing still felt the same.  Then there was a moment of disorientation and for a second he didn't know where he was.  He felt something cold and hard on his butt.  Then he realized that he wasn't standing anymore.  He was sitting and still peeing.  His legs were apart more than they had been.  In front of James was the back wall of the bathroom.  He could see towels hanging from the towel rack instead of the toilet.  He didn't know how it happened, but he had turned around and somehow sat on the toilet. He was still peeing.  It didn't take more than a few more seconds before he was done.  All his genitals were completely female now.  Looking down he saw that his pubic hair between his legs was neatly trimmed.  Instinctively he took a piece of toilet tissue and wiped his vagina.  He did it as a woman did from front to back.  Looking down, he realized the the toilet seat was up.  He was actually sitting on the rim of the bowl.  \"Yuck,\" he thought.  He got up and wiped his butt.  Then he stood up and pulled up his pants.  He found that his pants were the same but he was wearing panties instead of briefs.  He thought, \"Wow slow changes are cool when you are doing something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe liked that his position changed during the process.  It would be hard to pee in the bowl if his dick was gone.  The TSAR fixed that problem by turning him around and putting him on the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cool idea came to him.  What if he made a slow change with a younger person and went to school?  Would he start in one grade and end the school day in another?  If it was a freshman (James was a senior) would he go from grade to grade little by little, starting in 12th and then going to 11 ending in 9th grade?  What about a middle schooler.  Would he end up in a completely different school in a different building?  How about a primary schooler or even someone younger?  He wondered what would happen.  he decided to try it tomorrow.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James decided to go through with his experiment first thing tomorrow, he just needed to find a target.  Someone not too young, but young enough to at least not be in high school yet, if he wanted to fully test this out.  The only person who came to mind was Jacob, the 10 year old fifth grader who lived across the street from his parent's house.  With that settled, James figured he should head home and leave the Tam family alone for the rest of the night.  He looked at the ring, and was about to switch his genitals back with Lauren's, but hesitated.  He thought, <i>you know... I'm curious how this will affect a second slow change if keep myself this way for another day?  Will it change with my age?  I guess I can find out!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, thanks to the TSAR, he already felt comfortable with a vagina, and wearing panties didn't bother him at all.  So the novelty of going home with his girlfriend's equipment between his legs, was already lost on him.  He headed out and wished the Tams a goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night Lauren!  Say, do you think you can come pick me up tomorrow?  My dad needs to borrow my car, and I need a ride to school.\"  James asked Lauren as he was heading out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled, \"Of course, it's no problem!  See you tomorrow!\"  She let him go with a kiss on the lips, and a slap on the butt, which seemed unusually forward for her, but James didn't seem to mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, James woke up early and well rested for once.  It took him half an hour to even remember that his genitals were female, it seemed like no big deal to him now.  He went through his morning routine as usual, and right before Lauren was meant to pick him up, he headed outside to catch the neighbor kids heading to the elementary school.  Sure enough, Jacob was running down the street to catch the school bus, with his Star Wars backpack slung over both shoulders.  James looked at the ring quickly, and slid the time setting to make the swap happen over the course of four hours.  Around lunch time, the swap would be complete.  He focused on Jacob's physical age, and initiated the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames watched Jacob ran down the street towards the bus, but he felt no different.  Of course, he did the mental math and realized that he would be getting younger by 1 year, every 30 minutes or so.  So it might be some time before anything happened noticeably at all.  He decided to set an alarm on his watch to beep every half hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Lauren pulled up in her family's car, right in front of his house.  \"Wow, you're sure eager to get to school!  Cmon, hop in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, thanks sweetie!\" James said as he entered the passenger seat, leaning over to kiss her cheek.  He briefly noticed the bulge in her jeans where his old genitals were, but realized no one would suspect anything, even if the TSAR didn't affect anyone's mind.  Who would suspect Lauren grew a dick overnight?  No one, that's who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride was quick, only about ten minutes to school, and they were early, with plenty of time to hang out.  James kept looking at his watch, wondering when he would start noticing the first effects, and how things would change.  He sat at an outdoor table with Lauren, mostly to kill time.  They spent 20 minutes discussing TV shows and games, all the while James had his arm around Lauren's waist, and she leaned her head against his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when James heard the first beep.  It was quiet, barely noticeable to anyone else, but James knew what it meant.  If the swap was working, he should now be 17, a Junior, while Lauren remained 18.  He felt a moment of disorientation, and looked around to see what'd changed.</span></div></div>",

He looked to his right and there she was, sitting across from him. She looked the same as always, but was looking at her phone, apparently not paying attention to what he was just talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what?\"  She said, looking up from her phone.  \"Ah crap, the bell's gonna ring any second now, I should get going to class.  See ya later James!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without a hug or kiss or anything, Lauren picked up her bag and rushed off to class.  Sure enough, the school bell rang, just as she said it would.  He stood there confused for a moment, before realizing the TSAR must have altered Lauren's relationship to him... As he got younger, he was now considered a minor, and Lauren probably didn't want to get into any trouble with her parents for dating someone... under age.  He would have to get used to that, as he would only get younger as the day went on.  He sighed and accepted that this was partially his own fault for choosing a swap like this, but he knew he would be able to set things back to normally pretty easily when it his experiment was done.  Or at least he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was too busy thinking about what happened to his relationship with Lauren, that he simply rushed straight to his normal first period class.  When he got there, he noticed his seat was taken, and the teacher was staring at James like he had a third eye on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, can we help you Mr...?\"  The teacher asked as James stood in the doorway, looking for a place to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, it's James, sorry I'm a little late, is there any seats left?\"  He felt incredibly awkward with the whole class staring at him, and realized that every single desk was taken...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. James.  Huh.  Are you sure you're in the right class?  This is Calculus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've been taking Calculus all semester, I...  Wait, what class should I be in then?\"  James was suddenly confused for a moment, as conflicting memories appeared in his head.  He was sure he was in Calculus... wasn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class started to chuckle at James, some of them probably thought he was too high to remember what class he was in.  But finally one of the student's spoke up.  \"Hey, aren't you in my brother's Pre-Calc class?  It's right next door I see you over there a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pre-calc... shit that must be it.  Sorry!\"  James sighed, wondering if he was just losing it, or if the TSAR had somehow changed his class.  He couldn't trust his memories anymore it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Language!\"  The teacher scolded, as James left to the room next door in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Pre-calc classroom, James spotted an empty desk that he realized must be his, and quietly snuck in.  But the teacher was more perceptive than he thought.  She had her back turned to the board the whole time, but somehow must have heard him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Late again James?  You know that's your third strike, see me after class.\"  The teacher said coldly, before resuming the lesson.  \"Turn to page 147, if you even have your book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurriedly opened his backpack and pulled out the first book he saw which sure enough\u2026 was a Pre-Calculus book.  He realized something must have definitely changed, because he distinctly remembered packing a Calculus book that morning.  And he'd never seen this teacher in his life, but clearly she knew his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If the swap's already made me 17 years old, then I guess that makes me a Junior now.  This is starting to make more sense\u2026  There was no way I'd be in Calculus in 11th grade, I'm not that advanced\u2026  So as I get younger, the stupid TSAR is making people treat me as though I always WAS that age.  This could get really weird\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his watch again, 10 minutes left on his timer.  He suspected that was about when he'd become 16 years old, and go down one more grade\u2026  James decided to kill time by trying to figure out what else was different.  His body seemed, more or less the same, though he might have lost a pound or two around the waist.  It was no big deal going from 18 to 17 apparently, since he had already gone through puberty by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to start paying attention to the lesson when he heard the beeping of his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone better not be texting in my class!\"  The teacher exclaimed as she turned around, looking for what made the brief beep noise.  \"I hope it wasn't Ja-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off by a sudden distortion of time and space, as James suddenly felt like he'd been punched in the gut.  His vision swirled, and he felt like he wasn't even sitting anymore.  Things around him were rearranging, and he had to close his eyes or he was afraid he might throw up from all the spinning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"James..James...James...\" James heard his name being called.  He opened his eyes and looked around.  It was a classroom like any other, but it wasn't the same classroom.  The teacher in front of him wasn't a woman, it was a man.  Mr. Synder to be exact.  James had had Mr. Synder in freshman English two years ago.  The posters and work on the walls made it quite apparent that this wasn't a math class.  Somehow the TSAR had physically moved him from one class to another without him moving.  Looking at his desk, his book was opened and there was already notes written.  He didn't remember writing the notes himself but they were in his own handwriting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James...\" he heard again.  James looked up and said, \"Yes, Mr. Synder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you are with us.  Can you tell us what is the significance of Ophelia's suicide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia's suicide?  When James had Mr. Synder that was freshman English.  He read Romeo and Juliet then.  He didn't read Hamlet until his sophomore year.  James realized that his classes were all messed up.  He wasn't going back into his own past?  These classes were different than the ones he took before.  This made sense since, his teachers had a different schedule from year to year so it wasn't like he was going back two years into the past.  he was still in this year, he simply was now two years younger and this must be the classes he would have had if he happened to be born two years later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnglish wasn't his best class and he hadn't read Hamlet in the last two years.  James wasn't even sure if Ophelia had committed suicide.  He thought she had died in an accident.  \"Mr. Synder,\" he said, \"Ophelia's death was an accident not a suicide.\"  Then James went off to explain as best he could his position.  James knew he didn't have anything to lose.  He wasn't going to be in this class long enough to take a test or get a grade so it didn't matter what he said.  But James showed that he had read the book in question and that was good enough for the teacher who moved the class forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class went on as normal.  James wasn't sure if he should continue to take notes.  But he decided to treat the day as normal.  Looking at his watch he determined that he would finish the class and get into the next class before regressing into the lower grade.  When the class was over, James checked his schedule and found that his next class was Spanish.  It wasn't his favorite class, but he should be a senior and knew Spanish much better now than he did two years before.  Arriving at his class, he took a seat and then waited for his regression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After realizing that he wasn't following his own past as he aged down, James no longer knew what to expect anymore.  He had some fears of what would come next, but mostly he actually was looking forward to seeing what was in store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his Spanish class, he found himself slacking off and unable to pay attention to the lesson.  Of course, he already knew most of what was being taught, since he had this class before.  At least, that's what he thought, until he noticed the teacher going over words and phrases that he'd never heard before.  He thought maybe this teacher was just teaching some obscure nouns that James hadn't learned in his previous class.  But as the lesson went on, more and more words started to seem foreign to him.  Was the teacher ramping up the difficulty all of a sudden?  No... the class seemed to be following along just fine.  It was like... he was starting to unlearn the things he learned in this class when he originally took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit... I should have known.  I guess that's a side effect of being younger, right?  That must mean I'm continuously losing age as I go, not just once every half hour.</i>  He thought, as he looked at his watch.  Only two minutes to go until the next jump down in grade.  At that point he realized he was about to become a Freshman again, and relive those awkward years... luckily he knew it wouldn't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, mi aerodeslizador est\u00e1 lleno de anguilas?\"  The teacher suddenly asked him.  The whole class was looking at James suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... I'm sorry I... What?\"  James was at a loss for what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mi aerodeslizador est\u00e1 lleno de anguilas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher sighed, \"Miss Barrett... Sorry Mister Barrett, have you not been paying atten-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, as if on cue, the teacher was interrupted by the entire room spinning out of control.  James closed his eyes and wondered briefly why the teacher had mistakenly called him 'miss' at first, but the pain in his stomach reminded him exactly why.  As he felt suspended in a swirling vortex between two realities, he remembered he still possessed female genitalia... And the accelerated, though backwards, time was hitting him especially hard in the uterus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen reality stopped spinning, James felt the disorientation fade, but the pain did not.  He got bearings of his surroundings, and realized he wasn't sitting anymore, hell he wasn't even indoors anymore!  He was on the track field, hunched over staring at the floor, while clutching his midsection.  Boys were running past, many were laughing and making passing comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Pussy can't handle it!\" \"The little twat can't even run!\" Were among the things he heard by the boys running past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked up, even the slower kids who barely tried to run had already passed him, as he stood there in gut wrenching pain.  He didn't understand, why was this happening?  Before he could speculate, he noticed the coach standing over him, with his hands folded, looking pretty annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I don't know, I never had this kind of shit when I was your age... Dudes with periods... it just ain't right. But the school district insisted that you 'identify' as a boy and you need to take boys gym class, so here you are.  Making my life difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames did his best to stand up straighter, and finally noticed just how tall this gym teacher was.  Or rather, how much shorter James had gotten.  He remembered this guy being about the same height as him before, but now James guessed he must be... at least 5 inches shorter than before.  He felt a bit lighter as a result, but due to the pain in his ovaries, he really didn't give a shit at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, sir, I'm sorry, it's not like I wanted this to happen...  But please, can I at least go to the nurse?\"  James said, just trying to get the hell out of this class, and hopefully find somewhere to sit down and wait this year out.  Turned out his freshman year in this reality was a bit different than he remembered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, fine.  Maybe they can get you some Vicodin or whatever, I don't know.  Next time if you want to take a class with boys, make sure you actually are one, got it?  I don't care what you look like on the outside, if you're bleedin down there, then you don't belong in this class. Get going to the nurse.\"  The coach said with a nasty glare.  James couldn't tell if he was just grumpy or just plain bigoted, but as long as he was free to go, he didn't care one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James walked off the track, he headed straight for the nurse, even though he knew any pain killers would never take effect quick enough before he became younger and left this all behind.  For a moment he considered just handing this period off to someone else, and going back to being a male.  But then he remembered... this was his girlfriend's equipment.  If something were to happen with all the reality shifting, and he somehow lost Lauren's uterus in a weird space-time kerfuffle, he might not ever be able to put her back to normal again.  No, he knew he just had to bear it.  If this was what girls had to go through, then he could go through it too.  It was only temporary, he knew.  And within a few hours, he would be too young to even get periods, so he would be in the clear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally got to the nurse, she seemed to recognize James instantly, as though this was a common occurrence.  \"Oh Jimmy... it's that time of the month again?  Haven't they got you on male hormones like we talked about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stood there staring at her dumbfounded.  \"Male hormones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...? You know, testosterone, and such?  Your doctor still hasn't approved it yet? Once you start going on that treatment, the periods will stop, and you'll be able to fit in with the other boys easily.  I know you're already going through puberty, but it's better to do this sooner than later.\"  The nurse explained, very concisely infact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sat down, taking a rest.  \"Wait, this sounds like... Hang on, you're just a high school nurse, how do you know all this about transgender therapy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged, \"I mean I'm not a complete idiot when it comes to medical things, but most of it I just looked up online, the internet is a wonderful tool.  The students of this school are my patients, and that includes you.  Since you're the first student I've had to deal with this particular situation... I had to do some research last time you came in for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't decide whether he wanted to hold his stomach or his head, which was now hurting as well, just from trying to think through all this crap that was going on all at once.  He tried to piece together what the hell was happening to reality, why people were suddenly treating him like a female to male trans.  He saw his reflection in the mirror, and definitely noted that his features were softer and less masculine than before, but he was also barely fifteen at this point, and still falling.  But despite that, he didn't think he looked like a girl passing as a boy... he didn't even have a hint of breasts, or any sign that breasts were removed.  But since James really had no idea how people like this transitioned, none of this information really stood out to him as odd, compared to all the other odd things happening.  He just assumed the TSAR was slowly tying up loose ends, and fixing inconsistencies one step at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Jimmy, just have a lie down, and take these pain killers.  Trust me, they will help.\"  The nurse said with a smile, as she handed him two pills and a glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew it wouldn't matter, but he was in too much pain to care, and downed the pills without a second thought.  As he held the glass up to his face, he caught side of the TSAR on his finger again.  It still looked like a dark metallic ring, and he could have sworn it had shrunk to fit his younger fingers, but there was no way to be sure.  Nevertheless, he toyed at the sliders in his boredom, and discovered they couldn't be moved.  He had hoped maybe to speed things up, but once the TSAR was working its magic, there didn't seem to be any stopping it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at his watch... just a few seconds to go.  Soon he'd leave high school entirely, if things proceeded as he thought.  He shuddered to think what 8th grade must be like now, with the TSAR trying to adapt reality to the exceptionally strange situation he threw at it.  No matter how convoluted, the TSAR was still diligently doing its job as designed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A moment later and another time shift happened.  James was no longer standing but sitting down in class.  The pains he had were gone.  Also even though there was no way for him to know it, but the pills that James had just took were also gone from his body.  The class was obviously Spanish again, but it was a different class than before.  The teacher was different.  James had never seen this teacher before.  She was young and had been hired to the school in the years since James had graduated from middle school.  The room was different and the students were different too.  One of the students was reading out loud from a text book in broken Spanish.  James understood the student was saying.  James did better in the earlier Spanish classes than he did when the work picked up in high school;.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room he realized that he didn't know most of the kids here.  He wasn't in the habit of speaking to middle schoolers.  They all looked so young to him.  They all were barely older than kids.  James couldn't see what he looked like, he didn't have a mirror.  Looking at himself he saw he was wearing pretty much the same things as before, he wore jeans and a t-shirt.  But that was the standard outfit he had been wearing to school for as long as he dressed himself.  He was wearing a Star Wars design on his t-shirt, but he had loved Star Wars for as long as he could remember so that was no big thing.  He knew that he had shirts with a Star Wars design even when he was still eighteen.  That was two hours ago.   All school rooms looked alike so James didn't know that not only was in in a different room but he was also in a different building.  He was now over three miles from where he had been just a few minutes before.  James didn't know it, but in this new reality, Lauren hadn't driven him to school but James had taken the bus.  If James was going to return home from his school, he would also return home in a school bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames hadn't thought that something like this could happen.  In truth he hadn't thought about what getting younger would mean at all.  He sort of thought he would get younger, but stay in high school.  He also didn't consider what was happening to the boy who he was swapping ages with.  At this point James and that boy were in the same grade.  In another half and hour, James would be be in seventh grade and that boy would be back in high school.  But James didn't worry about that.  The other boy who was aging rapidly didn't even know anything was happening at all.  He didn't even know that He had gone from grammar school to middle school and would soon be in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was curious as to what he looked like.  He needed a mirror but there wasn't any way to get one.  So he raised his hand and asked to go to the restroom.  The teacher gave him permission and so he walked out of the class.  Looking at the door he found he was in room 317.  He wasn't sure which way was the restroom, he hadn't been at this school in four years.  But all school really look the same.  So he walked down the hall looking for the restroom.  There wasn't one on this floor.  He went down to the second floor to look, but there wasn't one for the students there either.  It seems at this school all students had to use the restroom at the first floor.  He found them.  The boys and girls restroom were next to each other.  But he didn't know which one to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James took another brief look down at himself, and saw no reason why he should go in the girl's room.  So, quickly he headed into the boy's bathroom and finally caught a look at his reflection.  His new age of 14 was definitely noticeable now: his face looking more youthful, and his skin being almost entirely smooth and hairless.  He noted the Star Wars T-shirt actually wasn't a shirt he ever remembered having.  While before he might have worn a shirt showing Darth Vader or Stormtroopers from the classic trilogy, he was now wearing a brand new T-shirt of Rey from the newest movie.  Despite the fact she was a female protagonist, he shrugged it off, since Rey was a pretty cool character, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was difficult for James to notice however, was how his height had continued to drop.  In the middle school bathroom, he couldn't tell that he was now only 5'3\" in height.  He lifted his shirt up for a second, noticing his waist being thinner and less toned than before, as his weight had dropped down to a staggering 110 lbs.  He felt light and energetic, like he should just run out of this bathroom just to kill the excess of energy.  But he decided not to do that, and simply let his shirt fall back into place, and realized he suddenly actually did need to pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to see that the boy's bathroom had a single stall, and several urinals.  And the stall was occupied...  There was no way he could use a urinal with his female anatomy, so he had no choice but to wait.  The kid was taking longer than he probably should have, and James wondered if middle-schoolers these days all had smartphones and this kid was in there texting or something.  He decided to timidly knock on the door, letting them know someone was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... anyone in there?\"  James said, with a surprisingly different voice than he remembered.  It was a little higher, and cracked as he started speaking.  A sign that he was definitely descending through puberty all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response, but suddenly he heard a flush, and the door unlocked.  A boy stepped out, a little taller than James was currently.  Strangely enough, this kid was also wearing a Star Wars shirt, but his had a picture of Kylo Ren on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smirked, and James caught a glimpse of him slipping a phone back into his jeans pocket.  \"Hey, nice shirt, Jamie.  You like Rey huh?\"  The boy asked, with a hint of tease in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shrugged, not picking up on the sarcastic tone, \"Yeah I guess, she's pretty kickass, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh, yeah right.  Like a chick would ever be better than Kylo.  Why don't you go back to the girl's bathroom where you belong, <i>Jamie</i>.\"  The kid folded his arms, and stood there half-blocking James' way to the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something about this kid seemed familiar... James squinted and tried to think of why this boy might know him.  \"Wait a second, is your name Jacob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yeah, duh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it, you're the kid that lives across the street from me.\"  James pointed out, realizing this was the same kid he was swapping ages with...  By chance, they just happened to both be 14 at the same time, which meant that the swap was about halfway done already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're THAT Jamie?  Isn't your sister the cute redhead?\"  Jacob asked, suddenly looking really embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's James, but yeah, that's my sister, Audrey.  Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just, I don't know, tell her I said hi or something... You can introduce me to her, can't you?\"  Jacob said, still blocking the way into the stall.  James really had to pee now... like, his legs were locked together, trying desperately to hold it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Introduce you... I... sure whatever man.  You know she's only 13 right?  Why would you want to be friends with her?  You know what, never mind, just come over after school.  Can I please use the bathroom now?\"  James said, not really caring about anything but peeing at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob finally stepped aside, \"I'm holding you to that, today, after school, your house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jacob gone, James practically flew into the stall and pulled his pants down.  The plain white panties didn't faze him one bit as he sat down to get indescribable relief.  It was only the second time he'd peed with girl parts, but it really didn't bother him.  All he had to do was relax, and the rest came naturally to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at his watch, surprised that so much time had passed, but he still had ten minutes left as a 14 year old.  He pulled up his pants and washed his hands, wondering if he should just head back to class or kill time in the hallways.  He was feeling rebellious, not caring if he got in trouble, since he'd be shifted in reality again anyways.</span></div></div>",

James certainly didn't want his sister dating him.  James decided he wouldn't tell her when he got home.  Then he remembered he didn't have to, By that time Jacob would be eighteen and not interested in a thirteen year old.  When James swapped back with Jacob then Jacob would be a little kid and not want to hang out with girls of any age.  Of course, he would still be an asshole.  James thought that maybe after the change, he would swap something between Jacob and someone else to teach him a lesson.  He didn't know what, but all that would have to wait until later.  He couldn't risk swapping anything until James got his age back.  He didn't know how that would effect things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was not only getting physically younger, he was also getting less mature as he decreased in age.  James decided to look around the school.  He hadn't been here in a while and didn't know his way around.  he could look through the halls and see where the offices were.  He could see who is in each class.  What did it matter in a few minutes he would be in a new grade anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked around the halls aimlessly without any purpose.  When he passed an adult he would straighten up but mostly he loafed along.  He would sometimes look into a random classroom to look around.  he was looking in one such classroom when he felt a hand on his shoulder.  When he turned around he saw an adult, presumably a teacher was grabbing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here, young man.\" the adult demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames saw it was a man in his late thirties who had a hand on him.  He was wearing a casual suit and tie that is common in schools.  The man was in complete control over the situation.  James was only a little middle schooler and this man towered over him.  The man knew that James was up to no good.  It was obvious.  No student should be loitering in the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just on my way back to class,\" James said hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh were you now?  What's your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is James Barrett.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What class are you in, James Barrett?\"  The man spat out his full name like an insult.  The problem was that James wasn't sure what class he was in.  He pretty much knew he was in the eighth grade, but what class he was in he wasn't sure.  He couldn't say he had to look it up.  Everyone knows what class they are in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in room 323,\" James said.  He wasn't sure if that was it.  He only looked at it for a second when he left the room.  The teacher knew something was wrong, but he wasn't sure what.  Regardless the man decided to investigate. James was feeling trapped and he didn't have the maturity to ride it out.  So when James saw a young girl who was in the sixth grade walk by, James used the TSAR for the first time since starting this slow-motion swap.  He exchanged the girl's authority with the man's.  Suddenly the man's resolved crumbled.  James seemed so much more in control than he was.  The roles had psychologically reversed.  James was the older one in authority and the man was like a girl two years younger than James.  With his resolve broken, hoping to just get out of there, the man said, \"Hurry to class and don't let me see you in the halls again.\"  Then the man hurried off to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl, didn't feel any different, but the next time she has to deal with someone else, she'll have renewed resolve.  How the girl's parents will like the new forceful self-assured nature of their daughter is hard to predict.  James didn't care anyway.  James started back for his class since he had nothing better to do, but then the old uneasy feeling came over him and before he arrived at his 'old' class room he found himself in the middle of seventh grade math..  He was again sitting in his seat, his notebook was open in front of him.  There were problems on the board and his notes were written in front of him.  It was still his handwriting, but not as refined as it was when he was eighteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could do anything he felt another tap on his shoulder.  He looked behind him to find....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James turned around to see a cute girl behind him, who quickly slipped him a folded up piece of paper.  He felt his face get warm briefly as he thought this girl was passing a note directly to him.  He wasn't even sure why it embarrassed him, since the girl was probably only 13, like he was now.  But before he started blushing too much, she rolled her eyes, and pointed ahead to the boy sitting just in front of James, motioning for him to pass it forward.  Now he was really embarrassed at assuming the wrong thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back around, and a strand of his medium length shaggy hair fell in his eye.  Normally his hair wasn't very short, but it generally wasn't long enough to reach his eyes.  Annoyed, he brushed it aside, accidentally banging his elbow on the desk.  He thought no one noticed the sound, so he continued on with the note passing.  He tapped the boy in front of him on the shoulder, and handed the note to him not so sneakily.  The boy turned around, and saw James holding out a note.  He was about to grab it, but he took a double take at James.  To the boy, he honestly couldn't tell whether James was a boy or a girl at first.  He looked like a slightly effeminate boy who had  started puberty late, or a very tomboyish girl.  Either one was not to his liking, and he thought James was the one giving him the note...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late, the teacher had watched the whole exchange since James had called attention to himself with the loud noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister-... Ms Barrett...? JAMIE, passing notes in my class?!\"  The teacher yelled, seemingly also unsure what gender James went by.  Her confusion only served to cause the class to burst out laughing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I...\"  James was at a loss for words.  As a 13 year old, he really had lost a lot of confidence talking to superiors, and just stammered.  On top of that, the constant use of the name 'Jamie' kept tripping him up, and he really wondered why people kept calling him that.  It was never a nickname he had gone by as a boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see this note.  If it's what I think it is, then detention for both of you.\"  The teacher said, grabbing the note out of the boy's hand.  She began to read, with a smirk, \"Hey cutie, it's me! Have a date to the dance yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class's laughter went up to 11 this time, and the teacher didn't even stop them, she got a kick out of it too.  But there were three people who weren't laughing, James, the boy, and the girl who wrote the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked furious, \"What?! Get away from me you gay little... I don't even know what you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was red with embarrassment, and didn't know how to react, \"But I wasn't... I didn't write that, I was just passing it along!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl who wrote the note behind him chirped up, \"No ma'am that's not true I saw Jamie write it just now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the teacher needed in order to pass her sentence, \"Detention for all three of you.  I don't know who wrote it, but you get detention for snitching young lady.  And Jamie and Brad, I need you two to go to the Principal right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was it.  James had been in 7th grade for only a few minutes and he'd already had a more embarrassing experience than his entire middle school life as a boy.  Nobody seemed to know what gender he was, so everyone presumed the worst in him, and ridiculed him.  Or is it 'her' now?  He wondered this himself as he sat there frozen under all the laughter of his class.  The teacher was losing patience, expecting him to leave for the principal, but he was panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized he just couldn't play along with this, anxiety was taking him over, and he needed to get out.  Before a panic attack set in, he made an emergency swap.  He didn't even know what he did, but suddenly the 13 year old note writing girl was sitting in front of him, where the boy had been, and in place of the teacher was the 13 year old boy, 'Brad' he remembered hearing.  That must mean... yes, the teacher was now sitting at the desk behind James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked out of place for a second, standing there looking sternly at James and the girl as though they were in trouble, but he couldn't possibly imagine what they were in trouble for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then\u2026 well\u2026 cut out the chit chat you three.  Now the square root\u2026\"  Brad went on talking as though he was giving a math lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames realized he must have swapped something to do with their roles, or jobs, or something.  But there could be any number of things that he swapped, and he didn't know how to fix it.  But the important thing was that his anxiety was starting to finally calm down.  He decided to lay low for the rest of the class, until his watch finally went off\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few minutes to calm down, James realized that he couldn't leave a thirteen year old in charge of teaching a seventh grade class.  It was plain silly and that might stretch reality to the breaking point.  An adult student in the seventh grade just didn't make sense too.  Since James didn't know exactly what he had done the best he could do was to simply swap the ages of Brad and the former teacher.  It wasn't perfect, but at least it made sense to the casual observed to the classroom.  With this done, Brad continued to teach the class and James was going to ride out his time here and wait for the next shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames felt another tap on his shoulder.  It was the former teacher, James never did get a hold of his name.  The teacher wanted to pass a note just like the girl did.  The teacher had inherited the girl's crush for, well the girl.  But this time, fearing that he would get in trouble again and didn't want to make a scene James refused to take the note.  The former teacher gave James an irritated look, but James refused to get involved.  He just copied his notes and waited for it all to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the usual flash happened, James was just relieved to be getting out of there.  James was getting second thoughts on this whole adventure, but he couldn't do anything about it until it had ran it's course and he swapped back with that Ben kid.  When James returned to full consciousness, he wasn't sitting anymore.  he was standing.  More than that he was running.  It was recess time and he was playing tag with a bunch of kids it would seem.  The problem was was that he didn't know which kids were in his game.  He knew he was playing tag, since he stopped when the transfer took place and a boy actually tagged him and shouted, \"Your It!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll things considered, James decided that running around was just the thing he needed to clear his head.  The last swap or two had been stressful for him.  Now he could run around  without worrying about anything.  The problem was that this swap happened near the end of the class, after he had finished eating and before the next class was to start.  In other words play time.  This was unfortunate since he was getting hungry.  He supposed swapping ages is hungry work.  Not knowing what to do, James just started to run.  He assumed anyone who was running away from him must be part of the game.  There was also the person who tagged him.  he could run after that boy if he couldn't 'tag' anyone else.  It didn't matter, at twelve years old in sixth grade he felt energized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' strategy worked because two boys in response to the direction that James was running, ran in opposite directions, perpendicular to James.  James picked the boy on the left who looked smaller and ran after him.  Not sparing any effort, James finally tagged the boy and said \"Your It!\"  The boy didn't tag James back.  He supposed that this game had a no retag rule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too much later, before a whistle was sounded and everyone headed back into the building.  James looked at his program card and went off to his next class.  James assumed this would be his last class in middle school.  Next stop for James was grammar school.  He would have only two more swaps until he was done.  It was at this point that James realized, that He would be stuck in the fourth grade after the last swap for the rest of the day.  At least two hours.  Only then could he go home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James must have spent longer than he thought running around outside, because before he knew it, he only had a few more minutes until the next age mark.  He sat in an English class for a few minutes, finding it hard to focus on anything, partly due to his younger mind having a short attention span now, and the knowledge that anything he learned would be meaningless in a few minutes.  Sure enough, it was time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, his entire world was spinning again, and he knew this would be a far more drastic change than before, as he was changing entire schools.  The TSAR was teleporting him to a new place, in a new grade, since he was now young enough to be considered an Elementary School student.  The spinning vortex of reality was starting to frighten him, having the maturity of an 11 year old meant that he was having more trouble coping with the paranormal.  He closed his eyes and squatted down into the fetal position, holding his knees and hoping it would all stop soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hopes were granted, of course, when the TSAR finally completed adjusting reality.  He opened his eyes, and found himself standing in line in a cafeteria.  Clearly, it was lunch time wherever he was at, and perfect timing, as James was feeling starved.  As he shuffled through the line, he quickly noticed the unusual weight on the back of his head.  He was about to shrug it off when he started smelling crappy cafeteria food, but suddenly the weight sharply increased for a second, and he felt pain all over his scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww!  What the hell?!\"  James yelled out in a high pitched childish voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around quickly to see what was behind him, and felt the weight shift with the spinning motion, until he was slapped in the face by a long bundle of hair.  His own hair.  The hair came to a rest over the front of his shoulder, and he saw just why it felt so heavy\u2026 It was tied up in a ponytail so long it nearly touched his belly button.  It had been bound together by a loose braid and some ties every few inches to keep the hair from flying in all directions, but could easily be undone at the end of the day.  This was certainly not any hairstyle he'd ever had in the past, but if he had to have super long hair, he'd rather it be contained like this than flying all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no hair pulling!  No pizza for you!\"  One of the cafeteria workers yelled at someone directly behind James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you got me in trouble again Jamie, why are you always such an idiot?\"  The boy snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames caught a glimpse of the boy.  He was a snot nosed little brat, with a buzz cut and a little chubby.  James felt a sudden vindictiveness to get back at this kid, even though it was something as trivial as a little hair pull.  To James, it was violating his personal space, and as an 11 year old, even little things like this created an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? I got you in trouble? Sure\u2026 Just you wait.\"  James mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around for something to swap, and the first thing that came to mind was the grumpy old lunch lady.  Without a second thought, James immediately swapped the old lady's frizzy, dry, mousy brown hair with the boy's buzz cut.  He also swapped her aged skin with the start of wrinkles with the boy's youthful skin.  She likely wasn't more than 50 years old, but to an 11 year old, that was ancient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the swap was complete, James turned back around and yanked on a handful of the boy's frizzy grey hair, and he yelped in pain.  A few hairs even came out in James's fist as he let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fun is it?  Now leave me alone.\"  James said right to the bully's face, getting a good look at his more wrinkled complexion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what James didn't know, was that in his rash swap, he had done the swap so it didn't affect anyone's perception.  Most of all, the boy and the lunch lady were both very much aware of their changes.  The boy looked around in fear, and tears started to well up in his eyes as he looked at his hands and arms, which were no longer smooth and young looking.  At the same time, the old lady felt rejuvenated, with soft, childlike skin, and only a light stubble on her scalp where her hair used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one suspected little Jamie could be responsible for such a thing, it was a freak accident, or that's what everyone thought.  James was able to blend back into the lunch line and finally go find somewhere to sit and eat in peace and quiet\u2026  He didn't really notice any potential friends waving to him or anything, so he just sat alone, and ate the crappy food to settle his stomach.  Everyone else seemed distracted by the rumor that a kid had suddenly got old for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the emotions started to fade, James started to feel like he'd done something wrong.  But since he hadn't got caught, he would repress the guilt and pretend like he believed that kid deserved what he got.  And besides, they were serving cafeteria pizza today\u2026 So that was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames finally was able to take some time to reflect on what had changed this time.  He still wasn't sure what the hair was about, but the TSAR had been making some seemingly random changes so far, as far as he knew.  So he shrugged it off as just quirks of the TSAR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what he did find odd were his clothes.  They were pretty gender neutral, just a t-shirt, some kid's sized skinny jeans, and a pair of sneakers.  But the weird part was that he <i>recognized</i> all these clothes.  They were Audrey's!  Or at least, they had been clothes she wore two years ago when she was in elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister of course had gender neutral clothes, in addition to more feminine clothes, and these were most definitely hers, he was sure.  The tennis shoes were white and dark red with velcro instead of laces.  And they definitely looked and felt worn in, since Audrey had worn these previously before she outgrew them.  His graphic T-shirt had a picture of Finn and Jake and Marceline from Adventure Time, one of the shows Audrey liked; a show that could be liked equally by boys and girls of all ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo clearly since he was now the younger sibling, he was subjected to hand-me-downs from his big sister, which made sense.  He would have rather not been wearing skinny jeans, but he had worn them occasionally in his teens, so it wasn't a huge deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sighed, then he looked to his wrist to check the time, and realized\u2026 there was no watch there.  He checked his other arm, and still no watch.  He didn't really have any idea how much time was left until the swap was finally complete, but he knew it had to be any minute now.  Lunch was over, and the students were starting to file out back to their classes.  He wondered if he should just go wild until the swap was finished!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a big fuss in the lunch room because of the swap between the lunchroom lady and the boy.  The lunchroom lady was in a panic that all her hair had gone.  Then when she got a mirror she was in another panic because her face was smooth.  Fortunately the bones under her face hadn't change so she didn't look like a kid.  People were called and questions were asked.  In the end, James' teacher came to retrieve her students.  Everyone was escorted back to the classroom except for the boy with the woman's hair.  James realized that if he wanted to make another swap he would make sure nobody noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after being brought to a room that familiar dizziness reappeared and soon he were whisked to another room.  He didn't even have time to find out your teacher's name.  This was the last change.  James were now finally ten years old and in fourth grade.  James took stock of himself.  He was wearing Jeans and a t-shirt the same as always.  The t-shirt had capped sleeves, but that didn't bother him too much.  The jeans had a rolled cuff which showed more of his ankle and lower shin that he would have shown as a boy.  He was still wearing sneakers but he wasn't wearing any socks which seemed odd to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering his long hair he found that his hair was still long, but it was a foot smaller only going down to the middle of his back.  Since it wasn't as long as before, it didn't need to be braided to keep it under control.  There was an elastic band in his hair which formed it into a pony tail.  Since he was sitting, he didn't know how tall he was or what he looked like, but his hands did look small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the final stage.  James knew he knew less that before.  But he felt fine.  He thought he knew everything important he just didn't have the book knowledge one gets from school.  What he didn't realize that he didn't know some basic things like what the real differences is between boys and girls.  He could tell a boy from a girl naturally, but the differences he couldn't see (those in his underwear) he didn't know.  But what he didn't realize were how he had changed emotionally.  He was more impulsive now.  If he was chasing after a ball, he might forget to look down the street to see if a car was coming.  He was quicker to anger and frustration.  He could be surrounded by a room of toys and still go to his 'Mommy' and say 'There is nothing to do.'  He also had little patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sat in the class for a little while and did his work.  He thought to himself, \"This is it?  This is all that ten year olds do.  Big deal.\"  The end of this trip was anti-climatic, not that he knew what that word meant anymore.  There was nothing for him to do but to wait for school to be over, go home and swap back his age.  He didn't remember that much about being 'an adult' anymore.  But he reasoned it must be better than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames got antsy in his seat.  he didn't want to do the work.  he didn't want to sit there.  he let his mind wonder.  Maybe he could occupy his time by making swaps.  he could see what it was like to wear girl's clothes (meaning a dress like one of the girls were wearing.)    He could find out what it's like to be the smartest kid in the class.  he could find out what it's like to be the tallest kid.  How about if he was the teacher.  It would be cool with a ten year old teaching.  he remembered doing something like that when he was in an older grade.  Which grade was it seventh??? Eighth??? He didn't remember.  He didn't want to get into any real trouble, since then he could end up in detention and would have to stay longer at the school.  This got him to thinking, how would he get home?  When this all started he came to school with Lauren, but he wasn't even in the same school as she was now.  But he had to do something, he was just so bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he decide?</span></div></div>",

He quickly looked towards her, responding to the name.  \"Jamie, do you know what things a plant needs to grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames thought for a second, and knew for sure this was an easy question.  After all, he had taken this class a long time ago, right?  At least a few years ago...  But he was quickly growing so bored and his mind kept wandering towards using the TSAR again to have some fun.  But he knew the teacher wasn't going to stop bothering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, well they need water.\"  James said, a little unsure of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right!  But it's not the only thing, what else do plants need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap... is that a trick question?  What else would it be?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know, love?\"  He answered, unable to think of anything except one time he remembered his mom telling him plants grow better if you say nice things to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class chuckled, but the other students weren't smart enough to realize how dumb an answer that was, so they were still waiting for the teacher to tell the real answer.  She went on to explain basic plant biology, but by then James had completely tuned her out, since she wasn't singling him out anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead his attention was laser focused on the girl sitting across the aisle from him.  She had long blonde hair, with little cute flowers in it, and she wore a pretty purple dress that went down to her knees.  It was very tasteful for school, but James couldn't take his eyes off her.  Of course, he was a little too young to be attracted to her in any way, what he was really curious about was the clothes she wore, and her hair.  He liked having long hair, but it was so plain and brown, and he didn't know what to do with it other than a ponytail.  His wandering 10 year old mind was just curious how she got her hair to look so good.  And a small part of him thought girls and their clothes were icky, but he was an adventurous kid, and part of him was curious what it was like to wear clothes like a dress.  His logic was, if he thought she looked nice in it, then everyone else would think he looked nice.  And if people liked him, then that would be good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all that logic went by in a few seconds in his head, as he made an impulsive decision to swap hair and clothes with the girl.  This time he remembered what happened in the cafeteria, and ensured no one else saw the change.  As a child if he didn't fully concentrate on a swap, his mind was liable to wander and have unintended consequences.  Luckily, he was focused this time, and a moment later he had a full head of blonde hair which fell all the way down his back.  Around the top of his head was a woven braid of hair like a crown, which tied together in the back.  He felt the hair and it was so soft, much better taken care of than his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was so focused on the hair, he almost forgot he was now wearing a pastel purple dress, and a pair of flat shoes and knee high white stockings.  In his seat, he looked down and the only skin that was showing was his knee caps, and his whole arms were bare.  The dress and stockings covered the rest, yet he still felt free and open.  A breeze from the air conditioner prickled his bare thighs under the dress's skirt, and he liked the feeling a little too much.  Again, as a 10 year old, James really didn't get that cross dressing was a taboo, even though he still thought of himself as a boy.  However, his genitals would still tell a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the science lesson was over, James had enjoyed wearing the dress, but had grown bored of it.  He spotted a boy in the class wearing something he thought was really cool.  He swapped clothes with the boy this time, leaving the boy with the dress, but James wanted to keep the soft blonde hair.  Now he looked down and was wearing a black faux-leather coat, on top of a rock band shirt that he had never heard of before, but the logo looked really action packed with lightning bolts going on either side.  The pants were just beige cargo pants, and he wore some blue tennis shoes on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent a few moments wearing this, but grew bored even quicker than before.  Sure the jacket and lightning bolt shirt made him look really cool he thought, but it wasn't really anything special.  The girls clothes were all so much more varied and interesting, he could experiment with them all day and never see the same outfit twice.  The boys were just simply... boring to him.  In fact, that's what he did.  He began swapping different clothes onto himself, mostly the girl's clothes, and even the teacher's clothes one time, each time leaving another student with the wrong clothes.  Soon the entire class was wearing the wrong thing, often for the wrong gender, but he was careful not to let anyone become aware.  The teacher was actually wearing a pink frilly princess skirt and Frozen T-shirt with Elsa on it, which was one of the outfits James didn't really care for.  He liked the feel of the skirt, but the frilly pink just felt like it had too many cooties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately James settled on a girl's outfit that he just really liked.  The outfit had a short sleeved, beige bolero jacket over a white tank top.  And on bottom he wore a pair of short jean shorts which barely went down to mid thigh, and a pair of tan ballet flats.  He had no idea about fashion, other than the fact that he thought these all went well together, and he liked how his smooth legs felt when they were not covered up by pants.  And the shorts made sure that no one could see his underwear, so it was ideal, he thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his new outfit and hair, he knew he had maybe another hour before he could fiiiinally leave boring old school, so he wondered if maybe he should experiment new instead.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since James was just a kid now and didn't have his watch his perception of time had been changed.  He thought that all the clothes swapping took lots of time, at least an hour, maybe more.  But in reality it only took maybe fifteen or twenty minutes.  James didn't even realize the damage he had done.  Not just to the clothing the kids were wearing, but to the apparel the kids owned and wore on a daily basis.  In the kids closets at home their entire wardrobes were swapped.  Fortunately most of the time, the students swapped clothing with kids of the same gender, but there were a few who were now permanent cross dressers.  The teacher's pretty lingerie was gone.  She just had the underwear of a little girl now.  She didn't even own a bra anymore, not even a training bra.  But James was unconcerned about any of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the students, a little girl had to go to the girlsroom.  She raised her hand and told the teacher.  In fourth grade, no one goes anywhere alone.  So the teacher selected James to accompany the girl.  This was perfectly fine with James since he was becoming bored anyway.  James was instructed to hold the girls hand as they 'carefully' walked to the girls room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two left the room, James deliberately brought up the girl's clothing.  James was fishing for a compliment as to what he was wearing.  He felt proud of it, since he had indeed picked it out...sort of.  In the middle of this conversation., something totally unexpected happened.  The now familiar dizziness which accompanied the age shift happened again.  James had thought the boy he had swapped with was ten years old, but he was in fact nine.  How was James supposed to know for sure.  James now found himself nine-years old and in the third grade.  He was back sitting in an unfamiliar class.  The girl whose hand he was holding just a second before was gone.  The students were different than before and all were 'properly' dressed just like the teacher.  His maturity decreased even more than it had.  He was more impulsive and more emotional.  Even if he was still a boy at this age he could burst out in tears when he didn't get his way.  Looking at himself he saw he was still wearing the same outfit as before.  Although it was in a slightly smaller size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't know what went wrong as to why he regressed again.  If he had more maturity he would have realized that it was a simple mistake.  But at such a young age he started to worry.  He thought that maybe he would regress forever.  Maybe he would wind up a blubbering baby in diapers.  This scared him.  There was hope that this might be the last swap or that he would still be old enough to fix things when he got home.  But his math skills had been diminished too.  He didn't know how old he would be 'at this rate' when the school day ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(On a side note, James didn't know that the boy he had swapped with was so young that he couldn't cross the street by himself.  This would be a problem when he wanted to switch back since the boy lived on the opposite side of the street.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As James thought more about it, his eyes were quickly starting to well up with tears.  He didn't want to keep getting younger, he wanted to grow up!  On top of that, he was in a strange new classroom and he had no time to adjust before he simply had a breakdown.  As a 9 year old, such a sudden unexpected change threw him into complete panic mode, and all he knew what to do was cry like a girl.  He put his head down on his desk and started quietly weeping.  His blond hair fell all over him as he cried into his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this quickly got the attention of the teacher, who looked at him very concerned, \"Jamie?\"  She asked, stopping her lesson and heading towards the crying James, \"What's wrong Jamie?  Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut James was just a blubbering mess and didn't respond, just kept crying with his head down on the desk.  He knew he was making a scene, and wanted to just leave, but he knew it was too late.  He hid inside the safe protection of his arms where he couldn't see anyone laughing at his little fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie!\"  The teacher was starting to get annoyed, \"If you're going to be like this, you have to talk to me or I won't know how to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I just want to go home.  I don't want to turn into a baby.  I want to grow up...\"  James muttered out, not realizing the irony of saying that while crying like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher simply rolled her eyes, not having any response for that which might help.  \"Alright just, go sit out in the hall until you calm down, k?  Come back to class when you can control yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm...\"  James muttered and slowly got out of his seat, shuffling out the door in his ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have the courage to look at any of the other students, but he assumed they were all laughing at how much of a baby he was.  He slumped down against the wall outside and sat there practically in the fetal position.  One hand clutched a lock of his own hair, the softness of it seemed to help him relax.  In about 10 minutes he was completely out of tears, and had a piece of hair curled around one finger, twirling it back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to James this 10 minutes felt like a lifetime, and he wondered why school wasn't out yet.  All he wanted to do was go home so he could grow up and stop being such a baby.  He couldn't remember what age he used to be, but he did remember fragments of his life from this morning.  He knew there was this very nice lady named Lauren who was very good to him, but he was too na\u00efve to understand that they used to be dating.  He just knew she was a very good friend, and a pretty lady who was all grown up.  He wondered if he would be that pretty when he grew up?  But deep down he knew he could trust her as much, or more than he could trust mommy and daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the door to the classroom open, and the teacher poked her head out.  \"Jamie?  Are you feeling better yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wasn't crying anymore, but still shook his head, blonde hair flying to either side as he did so.  \"I won't be better till I'm a grown up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher looked briefly as if she was out of patience, but she held her tongue.  She'd seen kids have tantrums over weird things before, so this was nothing new, but she felt a genuine concern for this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, do you think you can be ok until it's time to go home?  Are your parents going to pick you up?\"  She knelt down to ask, brushing hair out of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno\u2026 Lauren drove me to school\u2026 How am I going to get home?  I don't know if she's coming to this school\u2026\"  James mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher was at a loss.  \"Who is this Lauren, you big sister?\"  When James shook his head, she continued, \"Well, I think we need to call your parents.  You can't be causing such a scene in my class, it's disruptive!  We still have a bit before the day is over, and then we'll call your parents ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't understand what the word disruptive meant, but he felt comforted at the thought of his parents coming, so he simply nodded, and wiped the snot off his nose.</span></div></div>",

I can do it too.  But I promise it'll only be until school ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, stop crying and you'll be a big girl just like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames used the TSAR and swapped himself with the teacher.  He was in her body, had all of her knowledge and her maturity.  James wasn't crying anymore.  But the former teacher turned little girl was scared out of her wits and had renewed (or for her just started) to cry.  James knew that now that he was the teacher that he wouldn't get any younger.  He could monitor the teacher and see if she got any younger.  If she did than he could fix any problem.  He was an adult now.  If he had slipped into the second grade he might be lost.  At least as an adult he could make all things right eventually.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen sweetie,\" James said in a calm tone. James knew exactly what was going on now, unlike the former teacher.  \"All will be alright.  I promise.\"  The former teacher was scared but she didn't know why.  She hadn't any memory of being an adult at all.  She was just a little crybaby who was very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go home,\" the former teacher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do.  You will go home in a very short time.  Just come back to class and wait.  You don't even have to do your school work for the rest of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can see you are upset.  Just sit there and wait for the day to end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have a lollipop?\"  The teacher had lollies and pretzels in her desk which she used as special treats when her students did something that deserved one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, if you can stop crying.  Those are for big girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe negotiation had broken the teacher's crying fit and she returned to the room.  James followed her.  The former teacher waited at the teacher's desk.  \"You can go back to your seat now,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about my lolly?\"  she said in a hushed tone.  The teacher pointed to where the lollies were.  James saw what she was referring to and give her the lolly as promised.  The other kids mumbled that they weren't getting any lollies.  But one strict look from James at the kids quieted them.  The former teacher took James' seat and was quietly sucking on her lolly.  James had the teacher's knowledge and could continue the lesson without too much trouble.  It was late in the day and so the original teacher had left the easiest most fun lesson for the end to make the time easier to get through.  She knew that as the day went on, the children minds would wonder as dreams of returning home flashed through their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class preceded as normal.  James watched the former teacher carefully making sure she didn't get any younger.  But that wasn't going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the class was over.  James personally escorted the former teacher to the office to make sure she would get home.  James would swap back as soon as he was sure he would get home safely.  He would have personally driven the teacher to his house and then swap back if that was necessary.  Getting home was the most important thing.</span></div></div>",

I really think you should come get her.\"  James said to his own mother over the phone, with the voice of the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather, James' mom, agreed to head straight over and pick her child up from school.  But James decided to keep the former teacher company while they waited.  She was a nervous little 9 year old, and now that James had a mature woman's mind, he thought it was a little silly how much he'd been panicking before.  He wondered if it was wise to return to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course it's wise... I mean, that's me, I can't just abandon my life.  I have to see this through.</i>  He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat James didn't realize however, was that for the past hour or so, he'd been thinking of himself as a girl.  Despite acquiring the knowledge and memories of this woman, it didn't suddenly give him his old memories back.  He was currently still a 9 year old, with the knowledge and maturity of this woman keeping him calm and collected.  Through her eyes he saw himself, the 9 year old girl who was still nervous and afraid, with her nice looking outfit that she'd picked out all by herself.  Even through this woman's eyes James approved of the outfit, thinking it really suited this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, ma'am I really don't know what happened!\" A voice from across the office could be heard, as though there were some heated argument going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened is that my son was attacked!  Attacked by some sort of black magic witchcraft that was clearly your doing!\"  It sounded like an angry mother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stood up to investigate, and told his body to stay put for just a minute.  Around the corner he saw two women and a little fifth grade boy.  The boy was the very same who had wrinkly skin and old frizzy hair.  One of the women had a buzz cut, and smooth childlike skin.  James was instantly reminded of the vindictive swap he'd performed just a few hours ago, when he was a fifth grader.  This was the boy that had pulled his hair.  However now as a grown woman, James realized how petty and cruel his punishment had been, especially since he'd accidentally made them aware of it in his anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My doing?!  I am as much a victim in this as your son!\"  The cafeteria lady yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Miss youthful skin and hair?! I bet you're trying to use your black magic to stay young and live forever, aren't you?!!\"  The mother berated the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames knew he had to stop this, it was all his fault anyways.  He looked down and saw the TSAR on his adult finger.  With a thought, he switched their skin and hair back to normal with each other, and made them unaware of any swap.  They all looked around rather confused, with the mother wondering what she was just yelling about.  James smiled, relieved to have righted one wrong today at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he returned to where Jamie was sitting, he realized she was gone...  \"Shit, where'd I... where'd she go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe searched the nearby hallways, checking in doors, and couldn't find her.  His body had run off when he wasn't looking!  After a minute or two of searching, he finally went outside to check the parking lot.  He stopped in his tracks when he saw a familiar car pulling up, and a little blonde girl running straight to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!\"  Jamie called out as she rushed towards the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he saw Heather exit the car, James hesitated.  He'd planned on giving the teacher back her body, but he was afraid now.  Afraid of descending back into the scary world of being so young and vulnerable.  He thought, it would be so easy to just let Heather take little Jamie home and stay in this teacher's life forever.  But he didn't want that.  It just didn't feel right.  She was a good teacher and deserved to have her rightful body back.  Besides, he promised the teacher he would swap back when it was time to go home.</span></div></div>",

But at least James knew where they were going.  James was professionally dressed as a teacher in her body wearing a blouse, slightly tight skirt, sensible heels and pantyhose.  This made him look good and professional, but it did make it hard to run.  James walked quickly to the parking lot that housed the teacher's cars and looked for the one that 'belonged to him' now.  James took out the keys from his purse and pressed the button on the key ring that turned off the alarm of his car.  the car alarm chirped off.  Following the sound, James found this car.  He drove to his former home in the teacher's Honda.  When he got there he parked out front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' heels clicked as he walked up the driveway.  He rang the bell and soon Heather answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Jamie's teacher.  I phoned before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Miss Raposo.  Jamie speaks of you often.\"  Heather knew the name of Jamie's teacher.  James hadn't known what his name was before this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just concerned.  Jamie was so upset when I saw her last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seemed fine in the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she tell you what was wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but you know how young children are.  Sometimes they get into a state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But normally Jamie is such a good well behaved student.  I was just worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know she likes you.  She says she wants to be a teacher when she grows up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know she will be a great teacher,\" James said with a smile.  \"But she scampered away, can I see her to make sure she is alright?  I promised her a lolly but she left too quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" then Heather called inside the house \"Jamie, come here!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Miss Raposo came down and James showed her the lolly that he had brought for her.  When Miss Raposo took her lolly, James swapped their body and knowledge.  James was back to being a little girl standing next to his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say?\" Heather asked Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcomed.  Then Miss Raposo left to return to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames pulled open the lolly wrapper and stuck the lolly into his mouth.  It tasted good.  This was the first lolly he had eaten in four or five years.  James returned to his room to plan how to progress himself back into an adult (or at least an older teen.)  James didn't realize that when he swapped bodies and knowledge back with Miss Raposo that he forgot to also swap back maturity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I cried in class and the teacher said I made a big scene.  I just wanted to be grown-up like her.  But I'm ok now!\"  James said with a genuine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather smiled back, and hugged her daughter, \"I'm glad to hear that honey.  So why were you so upset about growing up?  You know you're going to be a beautiful woman when you grow up some day Jamie.  You're already a very pretty girl for your age.  You shouldn't worry about what grown-up life is like yet, you still have many years to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames just shook his head, \"No, not many years.  I'm going to grow up today!  You'll see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so honey... now... did Miss Raposo give you homework today?  You can't grow up until you do your homework.\"  Heather told James, half-jokingly.  But James believed her.  He may have had an adult's maturity keeping him calm, but he still had a 9 year old's gullible intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... yeah I did get homework today.  Can I go to my room and work on it?\"  James asked very politely, almost too adult like.  It threw Heather off that Jamie was so willing to do homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure! Of course! You know you never have to ask permission for that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom!\"  James said, giving his mom a quick hug, and then running off with his backpack full of papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames ran down the hallway, eager to get his homework done.  He ran straight to his bedroom door, and opened it.  He stood there shocked for a few seconds, as the room was nothing like he imagined...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What... this isn't my room?  Why is there all this art stuff and computers?  Where's all my toys and games?  Where's my clothes?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooom!\" James yelled, \"What did you do to my bedroom?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather hurried over to see what was the matter.  She laughed when she saw Jamie standing there in her husband's studio, looking very lost.  \"Umm... sweetie, you know that's your father's work room, right?  Come on, let's go to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad has a work room?\"  James wondered, as his mother took his hand and lead him to the other side of the hall.  \"But wait... this is Audrey's room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather didn't say a word, but simply opened the door and let James inside.  He expected to find all of Audrey's stuff, and there was some of that, but also much of his own stuff as well!  Where there was once a double bed, was now a large bunk bed.  The closet, which used to be exclusively Audrey's, was now full to bursting with both Audrey's and 'Jamie's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I love this room!  Look at all the stuff!\"  James said excitedly, not caring who heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked in the closet and saw that someone had attempted to draw a dividing line down the middle, but clothing was spilling over both sides as the two sisters had quite the wardrobes.  He could tell what was his by the small size, but he was happy to see that a lot of his clothes resembled the same style that he'd picked out in fourth grade.  It of course hadn't initially occurred to him that this <i>was</i> that girl's entire wardrobe, and he'd left that entire class with all the wrong clothes.  The mature adult side of him realized that eventually he'd have to go fix some of those swaps, but he knew that they would be fine for now.  There were much more important things to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Homework!\"  James said as he sat down at the vanity desk, and moved aside Audrey's makeup products for room to work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James worked on his homework.  He had to finish up fast so he could return to his plan to become his own age.  The problem was he really didn't have a plan.  He knew the first step would be to find Jacob.  The problem was that even though James' old room overlooked the front of the house and Jacob's house beyond, James now shared a room with Audrey which was across the hall that over looked the back of the house.  This was another reason he had to finish fast.  James found his homework challenging.  Not the least of which because he spent the couple of hours either crying or not paying attention.  James had swapped back the knowledge he received from Miss Raposo.  James did the best he could, but he didn't know if all his answers were right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was done, he ran out of his room and headed toward the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going Jamie,\" Heather asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going out to play,\" James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not dressed in your good school clothes.  Go back to your room and change.  Then you can go out and play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames returned to the room he and Audrey shared.  James threw off all his clothes until he was left only in his white cotton panties.  He had made a mess leaving all his clothes on the floor.  Then he went to look for something to wear.  He found a nice pair of jeans that were cuffed at the ankles and had stitching in the shape of a heart on the back pockets.  This was find to play in.  He also found a nice t-shirt with short sleeves and a picture of Spongebob on the front. He originally wasn't going to wear sneakers, but he reasoned that he would need to wear some sort of shoes since he wanted to go across the street to find Jacob and swap his age back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed, James was ready to leave, when Audrey came into the room.  \"Where are you going?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you put your stuff away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but this is my room too and you can't leave it this way.  Pick up your junk and put it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I have to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not cleaning up after you!  Put it away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was in a hurry and was about to run out when Audrey caught him and prevented him from leaving.  At thirteen, Audrey towered over the nine year old James..  Reluctantly, James put away his clothes.  Then he made his way again for the front door and the street beyond.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather asked again \"Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the third time James said to play.  But Heather reminded him that the swing set was in the backyard and that is where she expected him to play.  At nine James couldn't go anywhere he wanted.  Heather wanted him to play in the back where it was fenced in.  Also James wasn't allowed to cross the street by himself.  A wise precaution for any nine year old.  Defeated, James went into the backyard to think.  There he found the swing set and climbed upon one of the swings.  He slowly rocked back and forth trying to figure out a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames knew he couldn't go across the street by himself to find Jacob.  He also didn't know when he would see Jacob again by accident.  Thinking about it a bit, James realized that it didn't have to be Jacob, but anyone his own age would do.  The problem was that James didn't know anyone who was eighteen any more.  Except for Lauren, James had forgotten all his old friends and classmates.  He now had new friends and classmates but they were all pretty much nine years old and in the third grade.  James could call Lauren and ash her to come over and then swap with her.  But he wasn't sure if she would come, she was now so much older than he was and he didn't want to make Lauren a little girl.  It wasn't her fault that James ended up like this, why should she pay the price?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon it was time for dinner and then bedtime.  James had a bedtime of 7:30 now that he was nine.  James tried to protest, but there was no getting around it.  James gave up realizing that when this started he saw Jacob in the morning.  Maybe he would see him again then.  The odds he thought were good.  They weren't since Jacob now took earlier classes than James did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, James woke up and went through his new morning routine.  This included brushing teeth, take a shower and brushing his long pretty hair.  Then he put on the clothes that heather had laid out for him.  After that he came down to breakfast.  Once heather had made sure that James had everything he needed, included money for lunch, Heather escorted James to the stop to wait for the bus.  James kept an eye out for Jacob, but he never saw him.  The bus arrived and James would have to get on.  Then James was going to have a full day of class as a third grader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As his mother left him alone at the school bus, he was tempted to swap with her before she went away, but his maturity made him think twice about that.  He had no idea what kind of strange reality changes would happen as a result of becoming his own mom.  It wasn't worth the risk, and besides, he had homework to turn in!  He knew homework and studying was extremely important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bus, James sat in one of the window seats, and stared out the window as he zoned out.  As the bus arrived at its next pickup spot, the rest of the kids filed in, and eventually someone sat next to him.  James turned to see a slightly older girl, who was probably a fifth grader.  She had dark skin and black hair, and was dressed in a pretty cute outfit, James thought.  She wore a pretty cool plaid shirt, and a black skirt with small floral print, with black tights underneath.  James decided against swapping clothes with her, when he remembered how much trouble that caused his fourth grade class.  Plus he remembered seeing his closet at home, and knew he already had an outfit similar to this somewhere in that closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your skirt is pretty.\"  James blurted out, wanting to compliment her.  He hoped she didn't find it weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she just smiled, \"Thanks!  And your hair is pretty, I love the braid around the top!  I'm Anna, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames beamed with delight, glad that someone else appreciated the hairstyle he'd picked out for himself.  \"Thank you, I did it myself!  My name's Ja-Jamie, by the way.\"  It wasn't a lie, this morning he discovered he really could braid it all himself, he had that girl's knowledge on hair care, and it was way easier than he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!  Jamie huh?  Oh, are you that girl that broke down in tears yesterday?  In the third grade class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, this girl is really on top of the rumor mill huh?</i>  He thought, then said, \"Y-yeah, that was me.  I don't know what came over me, I was just having a really really bad day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expected Anna to be disgusted in his immaturity, but she just patted his shoulder, \"It's ok! It happens! It's not easy being cute like us, right? Some days you just have to let it all out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled, \"Thanks, that's good advice.  I really shouldn't worry too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if I see you at recess today, let's hang out, alright?\"  Anna asked, as the bus arrived at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\"  He was happy that a cool older kid was actually willing to hang out with him! For a second he even forgot about his mission that would leave all of this behind anyway.  But it still made him feel happy and confident inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt class, everyone seemed to be giving James mixed looks.  Some kids snickered when they saw him, others didn't really care, and some kids even had a look of pity.  But James just ignored them, and tried to follow Anna's advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the class grew restless as the Miss Raposo still hadn't shown up, and class started fifteen minutes ago!  Everyone was talking and goofing off, excited that they might be able to go home early if there was no teacher!  But suddenly the classroom door opened, and everyone grew silent as a grave.  A strange looking woman calmly entered the room, and set some papers down on the teacher's desk.  She had jet black hair, pale skin, and darkk makeup around the eyes and mouth.  She looked partially like a goth lady, or perhaps someone who was a goth as a teen, and then only half grew out of the phase.  Her clothes were mostly black, with a long skirt that went down to her ankles.  She didn't look like a wholesome person, but she didn't look mean either.  James didn't understand yet, but if he had been older he would have thought she would be a pretty cool person to drink with at parties, and the type of girl to out drink everyone, and dance all night.  To a 3rd grader though, she was probably quite scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everyone, I'm Miss Pfeiffer, but you can just call me Kat.  I'm your substitute teacher, sorry I'm all they could find on such short notice.  Your teacher Miss Raposo never showed up today,and hasn't called in sick yet, so I'm here to fill in last minute.  I'm sure she's just fine though, so don't worry.  Let's get all the questions out of the way before we begin: No I'm not a witch. Yes I am awesome.  No I will not just play movies for you.  And yes you will learn something today.\"  She said, in a fairly husky voice, like someone who might drink or smoke a lot, even though she only looked to be in her late 20's.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since there was a substitute, James decided that they wouldn't learn anything that he would be tested on later.  Jame's new mature attitude had him worried about what he did to the fourth grade class the day before.  He thought it wasn't nice that lots of the students would be wearing the wrong clothes.  It didn't matter too much if the students swapped with a member of their own gender, but for those boys who would now be wearing girl's clothing that wouldn't be good.  The teacher wearing the clothes of a student was just as bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames raised his hand and said he had to go to the bathroom.  As was the tradition, the substitute assigned another girl to go with her.  Students this young are never left alone to walk the halls.  They had to always be in pairs.  Miss Pfeiffer asked if there was another student who had to go to the girlsroom too.  Soon, James and this other girl were walking through the halls.  They had to hold hands as was also the custom.  But instead of walking straight to the girlsroom, James walked towards the fourth grade class he was in yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, we are supposed to go straight to the restrooms,\" the other girl whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will only take a second.  I have to look in on my sister,\" James lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright, but only for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames found the room he was in before and looked inside.  James could see the the teacher was obviously in the 'wrong clothes.'  She was dressed like a student with a short sleeved blue and white striped t-shirt that said \"WHATEVER\" on it and denim bermuda shorts.  Looking at her feet, James could see sneakers without any socks.  Looking through the class, James saw a girl who was wearing a pretty white blouse.  He couldn't see the tan skirt or the sensible woman's heels that would clinch that this student had the teacher's apparel.  But what the girl did have on was makeup expertly applied.  This must be the right girl who had the teacher's style.  James swapped them immediately.  The girl returned to juvenile clothing befit a fourth grader and the teacher was dressed as at adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at some of the boys and saw they were wearing girl's clothing as he expected.  He had to make it right.  It didn't matter if the girls styles were swapped with other girls and the same for boys, but all girls had to wear girls clothing and all boys had to wear boys clothing.  The trick is to figure it out.  Because girls can wear unisex clothing, it wasn't always obvious.  James swapped responsibilities with the teacher and found himself in front of the class teaching.  The teacher was still at the door, when James looked over.  But the other girl yanked her away and soon they were gone.  James knew that at recess he could walk the halls while his class was eating and return to the third grade by swapping back.  If no one was in the class, then they must be at recess too and he could swap there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow how to figure out who was in the clothing of the wrong sex.  The easiest way to tell is by underwear.  If there was a fly in the underwear or a thick waistband then it was boys.  But James couldn't see that obviously.  So the next thing to check was the obvious things, boys in dresses or skirts.  The next thing to check was shoes.  Boys should all be wearing sneakers, probably blue or white in color.  The girls shoes would be varied.  Girls could wear flats, maryjanes, or sneakers that were pink or made of canvas.  That should narrow things down.  Boys always wore white socks that would be the next indication.  Any tights or 'socks' of a different color or had ruffles on them were girl's socks.  Finally, look at the shirts.  If the student wasn't wearing a t-shirt they were probably wearing girl's apparel.  If the shirt had a girly print or was wearing a shirt in a girly color, then it was probably girl's apparel.  Lastly if the sleeves were anything except short sleeves, such as cap sleeves, pull sleeves, sleeveless or anything like that it was probably girl's apparel.  With this list James walked thought the class, like he was trying to help the students on their work and swapping the boys in obvious girls apparel with girls who were probably wearing boys apparel.  It took a while to make sure, but in the end James thought he had it right.  Hopefully no boy would leave the class in panties.  Of course the one student who was out sick today couldn't be helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames taught the class using the teachers knowledge and notes and all went smoothly.  Hours passed and lunchtime finally arrived.  James escorted the class to the lunchroom and left them with the lunchroom attendant.  Then he returned to the third grade class.  Miss. Raposo was back.  She got up late and didn't want to go to work in the morning.  But she convinced herself she had to so she made it to class to relieve the substitute.  Miss Raposo would have a meeting with the principal when the day was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames saw sitting in his seat the fourth grade teacher.  She was sitting up straight while writing lots of notes.  James swapped back with her and found himself in his seat.  James was proud that he could return all the students to their proper clothes (at least clothes that represented their own gender) and then return to his own class.  He felt grown up.  This reminded him of the maturity swap he had also don't with Miss. Raposo.  James knew he had to swap it back.  But should he wait for the end of the day?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that James was back in his class, and he'd sorted out every swap that he could remember, there was one thing left to fix.  He knew he'd been feeling strange ever since he swapped bodies back with Miss Raposo, almost like he still felt adult-like.  And the fact that she was being irresponsible and coming in late to work was almost child-like.  Even James' 9 year old intellect could follow that logic, he'd definitely got a part of Miss Raposo's maturity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could wait until later but\u2026 what happens if something comes up and I'm not able to put things back to normal.  No, I need to do it as soon as I can, it's the right thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of self-doubt, James let out a deep breath, and swapped maturities with Miss Raposo.  He felt something in his head shift, but in a few moments he no longer cared.  His thoughts paid no mind to fixing anyone else's problems, because as a child the world revolved around him.  And in his world, nothing mattered but the singular goal he focused on, and that was growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright class, that's it for now, time for a recess break and lunch, and then we all meet back here!\"  Miss Raposo called out, as the kids excitedly lined up to go outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames joined along in the excitement, he couldn't wait to get out there and play for a bit, maybe he would even find Anna, that cool fifth grader he met on the bus!  The class was led out onto the playground, where other kids from some of the other classes were already playing.  Some were climbing on the jungle gym, some were playing tether ball, and some were just sitting around talking or playing their handheld games with eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a lot of people James didn't know, of course, since he remembered he didn't belong in this school in the first place.  And he was sad that he didn't have a game system to join in with those kids, who were probably battling Pokemon or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead, James ran over to the grass field where a group of slightly older kids were kicking around a soccer ball.  He wanted to join in the game but a part of him hesitated when he thought of how he might dirty up his clothes.  Plus he figured they wouldn't let a girl play anyways, and at this point, that's how he was seeing himself, since everyone else saw him that way.  However, his spirits were lifted when he noticed there was one girl out there kicking the ball, and it was Anna!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still wearing her skirt and black leggings, but it didn't seem to stop her from getting in there and getting rough with the boys, even sliding in the grass.  James was in awe, she was like his new idol!  The way she moved and darted around between boys with the ball was like she was a real athlete (for a 5th grader at least).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settled it, James ran in and joined everyone in chasing the ball, trying to keep up with Anna.  He found himself quickly running out of breath, and eventually a fifth grade boy knocked into him accidentally, sending James flying off his little feet.  He landed on his butt, which hurt, and his eyes began to water slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Jamie!  You gotta be careful out here, these kids don't hold back.\"  Anna said after kicking the ball away so the group of boys would chase after it.  She quickly jogged over to James and reached out a hand to help him up.  The water in his eyes quickly subsided before any tears fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks Anna!  Yeah, I'm not that good at soccer, and not as cool as you are out here.\"  James shrugged, looking up at the 11 year old girl who was several inches taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hand on James' head, ruffling his soft blonde girly hair, \"It's alright, you just gotta practice!  I didn't get good overnight either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026 I guess.  And you aren't even dressed for sports, how come?\"<br>\r\nAnna simply shrugged, \"I dunno, my parents just kinda let me dress how I want, I didn't really plan to get in a soccer match today, but it just happens sometimes.  I suppose I should stop before I get grass stains huh?  How about we go to the lunch room and get a snack?  I'll introduce you to my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames followed Anna around like a lost puppy after that, heading into the cafeteria.  The lunch time and recess time at this school were the same, so long as kids found the time to eat, they could come and go from the recess area as they pleased during lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna popped two quarters out of her skirt's tiny pocket, and bought some chewy candy for each of them.  James savored the sweetness as they each picked up a tray of food and sat down at a table.  James realized there were mostly older kids here, and they seemed to know Anna, possibly friends of hers.  But not all of them looked happy to see a third grader at their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's she doing here?  This is the fifth grade table Anna, you know that.\"  A snotty looking pale skinned girl said, giving James a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Jamie, she's cool, don't worry.\"  Anna said, trying to stick up for James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the snotty girl was having none of it, \"Uhuh, Jamie\u2026  Right, I'm <i>sure</i> she's cool.  Just don't make any sudden moves, she might wet her pants and run out crying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelsie!\"  Anna yelled, trying to stick up for James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angry tantrum was about to come over immature young James, \"I did not wet my pants!  I was just upset ok!  It can happen to anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'Kelsie' girl, just laughed at James' outburst.  \"Jamie, your mom dresses you right?  If she didn't I'm sure you'd be wearing yellow pants to hide the pee stains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dressed myself, thank you!\"  James blurted out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James was mad at Kelsie.  It wasn't right for Kelsie to treat him like this.  James just wanted to make it through a difficult day and go home and get his life back.  Anna was nice and if all the kids were as nice as Anna, James might not mind staying a little girl for a while longer, but Kelsie was just plain mean.  If James hadn't given up his adult maturity back to Miss Raposo then she wouldn't have gotten so mad, but that was water under the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wanted to make Kelsie pay.  But making her pay wasn't enough, Kelsie had to know that she was being punished.  Kelsie joked about James dressing himself so that would be the first thing that he changed in Kelsie.  James looked for the youngest girl she could find, a first grader or a kindergartener.  There weren't any kindergarteners since they only went to school for half a day and so they didn't have recess.  But there were a few first graders.  James found one and swapped the apparel of the little girl with Kelsie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelsie, you should talk, did you pick out what you are wearing?\"  Kelsie was now wearing a Minnie Mouse tank with matching shorts which looked awfully cute, but still juvenile for a fifth grader.  Kelsie looked at what she was wearing and was horrified.  She hadn't put on anything like this this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ummmm...\" Kelsie said lost for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you pick it out or did your MOMMY choose it for you?\" James continued emphasizing the work Mommy.  Kelsie now remembered that her 'mommy' did pick all her clothing.  But Kelsie knew that shouldn't be right.  She knew she was old enough to dress herself, but she doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing, \"But I guess you need someone to dress yourself, since you are as tall as a kindergartener.\"  James swapped Kelsie's height with a first grader, but the insult worked better the other way.  Regardless, Kelsie was now much shorter than James now after losing several inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this to me!!!\" Kelsie screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did what?  It's not my fault you are the size of a baby.\"  James was exaggerating again.  Kelsie had lost a lot of height, but she wasn't a baby.  She hadn't gotten any younger either.  She was on the verge of puberty and that hadn't changed.  Her chest was a little puffy as breasts were about to develop.  Actually Kelsie was very lucky, because if James didn't change her back and he wasn't planning on it, at least she hadn't started her growth spurt.  If she had, then Kelsie might be considered a 'little person' instead of just short when puberty was done..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, you saw what she did to me, didn't you?\"  But Anna thought that Kelsie had always been this short and her style was juvenile.  Anna didn't notice anything wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hasn't done anything to you, she hasn't left her seat,\" Anna told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She made me short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Short???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she made me Queen of the school,\" Anna mocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsie ran away looking for an adult.  But no one in the school or anyplace else thought anything was wrong.  Kelsie had alays been a short girl.  That's just the facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I hope you know that her mom treats her that way because of her height and she's really insecure about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Rachel, at the end of the day Kelsie's still old enough to get over it,\"  Anna said with a shrug, she clearly wasn't that offended by any of it.  \"And you have to admit, she was being a bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And at the end of the day Anna, your friend here is still a third grader who was also being mean.  She doesn't belong here, she's causing trouble.  Kids her age just aren't ready to grow-up yet.\"  Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am too ready!\"  James blurted out, rather immaturely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no you're not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighed loudly, \"Racheellll, come on.  Why are you like this?  I am here just trying to be nice to the poor girl since she had a bad day and you gotta bring her down like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Anna, you are always doing this!  You always bring kids to this table who all they want to do is be friends with the cool kids, well they AREN'T cool ok?  Yeah I get it, you want to be all nice and happy, but this table has rules you know, and you have to ask the rest of us before you do stuff like this!  First she upsets Kelsie, now you're sticking up for her?  What's next, she's going to be your new bff?  Who's with me?\"  Rachel asked the rest of the girls and a few boys at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever most of them just shrugged, not really caring.  One of them shrugged, \"I dunno, I don't think Jamie did anything that bad, she seems like, whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Rach, why don't you chill out, and go find Kelsie before she gets into trouble?\"  One of the boys told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighed, \"Yeah really, calm down girl.  If we could make Jamie a fifth grader we would, but it doesn't work that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stood up and saw Kelsie on the other side of the cafeteria, \"Hey, what the heck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames watched as Rachel ran past random other students towards Kelsie.  There seemed to be a rather large boy pushing her around.  He was tall, and probably another fifth grader.  Even at 9 years old, James felt a tiny amount of guilt for making Kelsie so small and vulnerable.  He sighed and hurried off after her, dodging students with trays of food as he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave her alone!\"  Rachel said to the boy, trying to hold on to his arm as he was about to push Kelsie again into a wall.  But the kid was big and heavy, and Rachel didn't have any strength to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen James caught up, he saw the boy turn around and now he was angry at Rachel too, and pushed her away, though it took more effort than it did with Kelsie's first grade body height.  James wondered where the teachers were and why no one had come to break this up yet, but they were just around the corner of a wall, and teachers hadn't yet heard anyone over the loud roar of the cafeteria.  A few kids had started to crowd around, but James pushed past and got inside.  He was only 9 however, and the kid immediately blocked James from getting any closer, seemingly having some beef with Kelsie in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of this!\" The boy said, looking back to Kelsie like he might actually hit her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh\u2026 if I was grown-up I could stop this\u2026 If I was cool like Anna I could do anything!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when James knew what to do, he focused on the TSAR and swapped his own age with the bully.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James grew up a couple of inches.  He also didn't notice that his breasts started to get a little puffy as he was on the precipice of female puberty.  The one thing that did change was that under Jame's shirt, he was now wearing a training bra which didn't have any true cups.  The bully lost a few inches along with his age and now he was no match for the older Rachel who was sticking up for her friend.  James was happy that Rachel could handle it, since he didn't want to get too involved himself.  Kelsie had hurt James' feelings.  That didn't mean she would be hurt but a bully who towered over her now.  James was still very hurt by what Kelsie said about letting him stay with his new friend Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here Adam, Kelsie is my friend and I won't let you hurt her.\"  The bully was cowed when confronted by a bigger older person.  Adam started to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Kelsie, come back to the table.\"  Reality had been changed with the age swap of James and Adam.  James was no longer a 'little third grader,' he was a fifth grader like the rest of Anna's group and fit right in.  The whole argument that Kelsie had had with Anna was erased from history.  Or at least from the minds of everyone involved except Kelsie and James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've got to get out of here.  Things are happening.  Weird things.\"  Kelsie was legitimately scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly.  Everything is fine,\" Rachel soothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you something is wrong.\"  James decided to scare Kelsie some more.  He swapped Rachel's gender with the bully along with his clothes.  Rachel was a boy now and looked it without knowing anything had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH My God, It has happened to you too Rachel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"look at yourself, you are a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always been a boy,\" Rachel said insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you are a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who you calling a girl.  I help you out and you call me names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get out of here before things get any weirder.\"  Rachel let Kelsie go.  Kelsie ran out of the room toward the recess playground.  James then swapped Rachel's gender and apparel back.  No one besides Kelsie knew anything had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelsie was running out, you approached Rachel.  \"Why is she running?  She looks like she saw a ghost?\" James said with mock concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, she is acting crazy.  She said I was a boy,\" Rachel told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she needs a head doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...Let's return to the table.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelsie ran out of the building and walked around the yard.  She looked closely at things to see if anything had changed.  Everything seemed normal except for herself.  She was shorter.  Very much shorter.  She didn't know how this could be.  At the height of a first grader, everyone seemed taller than she was.  But when she talked to anyone she knew, they said she had always been this short.  Was that true?  What she always this short.  Kelsie knew people got taller, but was it possible for people to get smaller?  She didn't think so.  She tried to convince herself that she was always this short.  It didn't make sense, but it made more sense than she had shrunk.  Especially since what she was wearing was so childish.  She liked Minnie Mouse, but what she wore seemed too juvenile for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon recess was over and all the children were ushered back to their room.  James shared a classroom with Anna and Kelsie.  James was still livid at what Kelsie tried to do.  James really liked Anna and he didn't want anyone to get in the middle of that relationship.  James decided Kelsie hadn't paid enough.  James was going to use the TSAR to play a trick on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class started up.  The teacher, Mrs. Dietz was picking up from where the class left off before lunch.  \"Who can answer the first question?\" Mrs. Dietz asked.  A bunch of students raised their hands.  Mrs. Dietz selected one.  You swapped Kelsie's name with the boy who was selected.  \"Kelsie, what is the answer?\" Mrs. Dietz inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer is 26,\" the boy whose name was now Kelsie said.  Kelsie hadn't raised her hand.  But her name was called and a boy answered it.  But that boy's name is Xavier.  Then she realized that that wasn't the boys name that was her name.  But how can it be, she thought her name should be Kelsie, but it was Xavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher moved onto the second question and asked for more volunteers to tell the answer.  This time she selected a girl.  \"Yes, Kelsie,\" Mrs. Dietz said as she acknowledged another student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is 67.\" the new Kelsie said.  Xavier's name had been returned to him.  Now Kelsie thought her name was Tamika.  Kelsie remembered that she had thought her name was Xavier just a moment ago, but it still should be Kelsie and she thought her name had always been Tamika too.  How is this possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor every question, the student always chosen was named 'Kelsie' and Kelsie thought her name was that of the student.  Even when her friend Anna answered a question.  Soon, Kelsie remembered having six names.  Finally, Kelsie decided to raise her hand.  When the teacher acknowledged her, her name was like everyone else's 'Kelsie.'  The problem was Kelsie had been so distracted by what was going on she didn't know the answer at all which was very embarrassing.  Another two questions were answered, by students named Kelsie of course and then the teacher moved to another lesson.  Kelsie's name had returned to herself and she tried to convince herself that everyone was playing a mean trick on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, Kelsie was back to herself.  At least the shorter version of herself.  She was so happy and relieved until she looked across the room and saw herself sitting there.  Her body had been swapped again.  But this time when she looked at herself her body had returned.  Looking again at the boy who had been sitting there was back to normal.  Then she looked again and she saw herself again in a different seat.  Then she moved across the room and saw herself again in a different seat.  Every time she looked at herself her body was normal, but when she looked at the students one of them had her body.  It was a different one every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsie was totally confused.  Things got worse when she saw herself teaching the class.  Her body had been swapped with the teacher.  She now had the teacher's body.  Her clothing had adjusted to fit the new body, but her boobs sagged since she wasn't wearing a bra.  No one seemed to notice that anything was wrong, just like no one noticed when everyone was named Kelsie.  The students for this lesson were put into small groups and the teacher who had the shortened body of a fifth grader walked around the class as if everything was normal.  Kelsie asked the students if they noticed anything wrong but even though she now towered over them, no one thought that anything was wrong.  Although even children could tell that Kelsie was really starting to panic.  She knew something was wrong but she couldn't convince anyone.  Kelsie used all her will power to not cry although she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsie couldn't take it anymore   She had to get out of the room.  She raised her hand and the teacher acknowledged her.  Her name was still Kelsie she was glad of that.  \"Mrs. Dietz, I have to go to the bathroom,\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, take the pass and you may go.  Fifth graders were old enough to go to the girlsroom alone.\"  Kelsie got up and walked to the teacher's desk, picked up the pass and headed toward the door.  before she got there she found herself sitting and another girl was continuing her journey out the door and presumably to the girlsroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsie raised her hand again.  \"I have to go really bad,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Mrs Dietz said, \"as soon as Candice comes back.  You may go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened while Candice was out.  But soon, Candice was back and when Kelsie took the pass again, she found herself in Thomas' seat.   Thomas was about to leave the room on the way to the boysroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsie couldn't stand the strain and started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

When she opened her tear soaked eyes, she was somewhere else in the classroom once again, but now she could see the whole class from a different perspective.  She was standing up near the front of the room where the teachers usually stand.  She still had the mature body of Mrs Dietz, and was now even dressed in her clothes, including a skirt and heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Dietz... are you ok?\" Anna asked quietly, seeming very concerned for her teacher.  A few of the other students mumbled to eachother, not sure what to do with the teacher in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body of Mrs Dietz slowly started walking towards her desk, stumbling in her heels as she walked, as though she'd never worn anything like that before.  She avoided eye contact with the class, and just sat down as soon as she was able.  She buried her face in her arms, and a muffled weeping could be heard.  James slowly started to realize that maybe he'd gone too far.  This girl had absolutely learned her lesson, if there was any lesson to be learned here anymore.  He stood up and walked towards the teacher's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Dietz... are you ok?\" James muttered, trying to lean in close.  There was no response, so he continued, \"Should you... you should go take a break, ok?  We'll stay in the class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe murmuring amongst the classmates continued, but no one dared speak up.  Suddenly Mrs Dietz just nodded, and slowly headed out the door, leaving the classroom.  James poked his head outside to see her leaning against the wall crying some more.  He saw Thomas walking back from the bathroom, but he stopped in his tracks seeing the teacher in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, what'd I miss...?\"  Thomas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, she just needs a minute...\" James said, holding the door open for Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Thomas was finally at his seat, James decided to swap Kelsie back to her own body again, and leave her alone from now on.  James quickly hurried back to his seat just as Kelsie realized she was once again at her desk.  Mrs Dietz stayed outside of the classroom for a few more minutes, fixing her makeup from all the tears, and wondering just what she was crying about in the first place.  Once everything was fixed, she entered the classroom expecting the kids to all be out of control in her absence, but they were mostly quiet.  She smiled and tried to pick up the lesson where she left off, but the class seemed very subdued and helpful from that point on.</span></div></div>",

He knew Jacob wasn't going anywhere, and there was still plenty of time to swap back later.  Plus if he grew up now, he would probably not be friends with Anna anymore, and might not ever see her again.  He couldn't just leave such a cool girl behind so easily, could he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he debated this, Jacob was quickly disappearing down the street, maybe visiting someone in the neighborhood, or just going out for some exercise, who knew what grownups did?  James sure didn't.  He sighed and decided to wait for Anna, and headed inside to work on homework.  This time however, he had the maturity of a fifth grader, and he knew he wouldn't stay this old for long, so he really didn't give much effort into the homework, just kind of rushing through it.  Afterwards, he went to his room (still shared with Audrey) and changed into something more comfortable and casual.  A pair of light blue jeans and a white tank top would suffice.  James once again noticed the training bra that he had on under his shirt, but left it on cause he wasn't quite sure what to do with it.  A part of him thought it was unusual, but when he peeked underneath it, he definitely noticed some puffiness in the area around his nipples, so he supposed it was just something that was necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the doorbell rang.  James sprang out of his chair and saw through the window that Anna was here.  Suddenly he was a nervous wreck.  What would she think?  Would she criticize James' choice of casual outfit?  Would Audrey somehow screw everything up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's fine, she's just a friend right?  I mean I only met her today...  I just can't remember having girl friends over to play before, weren't most of my friends boys?  Why am I so nervous about her being here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he got the courage to open the door.  \"Anna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jamie!\"  She seemed genuinely happy to be here, and even initiated a hug that James wasn't expecting.  Something'd definitely changed since he became the same age as her. James thought she was acting like they'd known each other a lot longer than a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent a moment talking, and were about to head to James' room, but they were stopped by Heather, \"Oh hey Anna, Jamie was telling me about you.  How long have you been friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since this mor-\" James started but was interrupted as Anna said, \"For a few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  James looked confused, but no one seemed to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather seemed to believe it, \"Well that's great!  Always nice to have Jamie's friends over.  Let me know if you girls want any snacks or drinks, and try not to make a mess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing mommy!\"  James said, as he hurried Anna along down towards their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got inside, Anna didn't seem unimpressed, she stood there and looked around in awe at all of the stuff.  \"You share this room with your big sis?  Wow she has such cool clothes!  Does she let you use her old stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded, \"Sometimes, but I've got a lot of my own clothes that I picked out myself.  But we share a lot in this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be cool to have a big sister, I only have a brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be jealous, trust me, she can be really annoying too.  I just hope she is busy today.\"  James said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, you have a way bigger selection of stuff than I do\u2026\"  Anna began rummaging through your closet.  She pulled out a red pleated skirt from the dresser.  \"This is pretty cute, you should put it on!  Or do you want me to?\"James felt a little embarrassed at her going through 'his' stuff, which didn't originally belong to him anyways, but was the fifth grade equivalent of the girl's outfit he'd swapped with.  Everything was slightly more mature than when he'd originally swapped, but not much had changed in 2 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-why?  If you wanna go outside that will get all dirty and stained.  I like that skirt\u2026\"  James wasn't sure why he'd said that last part, but he did.</span></div></div>",

Want to play?\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's go\"  It was apretty day the perfect day for playing outside.  The two got on adjoining swings and pumped themselves back and forth.  After a while James asked, \"I am really worried about Kelsie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did seem awfully upset today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  She seemed scared too.  We should check on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.  I mean we are friends but you know how she can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighed, \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we should go and see how she is doing,\" James was a good person at heart.  He didn't want to hurt anyone, but Kelsie was being mean to him.  James didn't want to hurt her too much.  After thinking about it for a while James thought that he had gone too far.  It was just supposed to be a trick.  But when James saw her really crying in Mrs' Dietz body it had gotten to him.  James didn't do anything else all day, but what James had done was very mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not too late, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm going to walk Anna's home,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey be back for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I just want to see her house and then, I'll come right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna and James walked towards Anna house, but then veered to Kelsie's  They knocked at the door, Kelsie's mother answered.  They asked if they could see her, but her mom said that Kelsie came home from school sick and she was in her room.  They should come back tomorrow.  There was nothing else to do but continue to Anna's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Kelsie is sick.  She didn't see sick when she got off the bus,\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't know if it was his fault or if Kelsie had truly gotten sick.  There was nothing he could do anyway.  The guilt weighed upon James though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they were at Anna's house and walked in.  Anna showed James her room.  Anna regretted that she didn't have all the extra girly stuff that James had since James had an older sister not a brother.  \"I'm sure your brother is nice, can I meet him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure he is in his room, I think.\"  Anna escorted James to her brother's room.  The room was typical for a fourteen year old boy and her brother seemed just as typical. James wanted to do use the TSAR to do something nice for Anna.  A way of making up for the awful thing he had done to Kelsie.  This made sense in the logic of a fifth grader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, this is Jamie.  She's a friend of mine from school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Jamie,\" the boy said without much enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames needed a female to swap genders with Bill.  It didn't matter which one.  James knew he couldn't do it with anyone in the house so James asked and he moved to the window, \"Does this look over the front lawn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does.  But I'm busy with something. I...\"  Bill didn't want to seem too rude, but he wanted the girls out of his room.  If it was just Anna alone, he would kick her out, but James was a stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames saw a woman in her thirties in the street.  James was going to swap genders so it wouldn't matter what the woman's age was.  Just now Anna would have a sister which she wanted.  James used the TSAR to perform it's magic and the woman was changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was too young to consider what might had happened to the random woman who happened to be walking by Anna's house.  The scene didn't change too much.  The woman was now a man although he wore similar clothing and much more makeup than before.  The woman had been married with two children and she worked in a beauty salon.  The TSAR changed her but tried to keep the disruption to her life at a minimum.  The woman was now a flaming gay man working at the same salon as before.  He and his partner were married.  They were among the first to be gay married anywhere.  Their two children were adopted. But there were also numerous changes (too numerous to count) in the life's of the newly gay man's family and friends to accommodate the change.  James never considered any of these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen James turned around to see the room he found that....</span></div></div>",

It had changed a lot.  The walls were still painted white, but there was the slightest of pink tint to the white walls.  There were two beds in the room instead of one and both were neatly made.  There were pink and pale yellow accents everywhere.  There wasn't any clothing on the floor as there was before and on the desk and drawers were cute little lion figurines.  Since James hadn't seen anything like that in Anna's room, he assumed that Billie had thing about lions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the walls were posters of boy bands and pop-stars.  James seemed to remember seeing something similar in Anna's room at least when it came to pop-stars.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anna was more dumbstruck than James was, looking around at the strange alien room, and a girl who was apparently her brother bill, but completely female.  The new 'Billie' as she was now called, looked and dressed a little girly, but nowhere near as much as the salon woman she'd acquired her new gender from.  She honestly looked like just an average fourteen year old girl, and if James and Anna hadn't known any better, they wouldn't have thought there was anything unusual about her.  She had been sitting on her bed with a laptop, doing who knows what until she stood up to hug James.  Anna watched this all happen, but tried to keep cool for the moment, so she could figure out what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!  You two share a room too, just like me and my sis!  But yours looks way cleaner than mine!\"  James said, trying to start conversation with Billie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm!  Yeah that's Anna's bed over there, and most of her stuff is on that side of the room.  The closet is a bit of a mess right now, but we try to keep it organized!\"  Billie said, giving the grand tour of the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna had been about to say something when she got a look into the closet.  Bill being the older sibling, had the bigger room before, and the bigger closet.  Now with two girls sharing the same room, the closet looked no bigger than Anna's old one, but that was only due to the sheer number of things packed in it.  It quite resembled Jamie and Audrey's closet, in the way it was all crammed inside.  Anna was suddenly in love with this room, the closet, all the new clothes she might inherit.  And she didn't know this Billie sister of hers very well yet, but she seemed way cooler than Bill.  Bill always would keep to himself and ignore Anna before, but Billie seemed way different.  That isn't to say Billie and Anna hadn't fought and had arguments over the years, as any sisters would, but this was a much better start than Bill hiding away in his room alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... yeah!  Yeah this is, my, our room Jamie!  What do you t-think?\"  Anna stammered nervously, still trying not to freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks so nice!  I'm glad you have a big sister who seems pretty nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... I'm glad too.\" Anna looked at Jamie suspiciously.  \"Alright Bill...ie.  We'll go run to the kitchen for some snacks ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Ann!\" Billie said with a smile, before she hopped back on her bed and flipped open the laptop again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were finally out of earshot in the kitchen, James started saying \"Wow your sister seems really cool, it's like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Anna grabbed him and pinned him against the wall, a little hard.  \"What the crap is going on Jamie?  You had something to do with this didn't you?\"  Her eyes darted between paranoid glances at Jamie and looking back fondly at the door to her new bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something to do with what?  What are you talking about?\"  James bluffed.  His 11 year old poker face wasn't very good though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?!  You didn't see my brother suddenly grow boobies and his whole room turn girly in like 2 seconds?  Am I losing it or is this really happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames squirmed trying to get out from between Anna and the wall.  \"Ah, well...  I uh... Look Anna I just wanted to help.  I thought if you had a sister you'd be happier, and you're my friend so that's what I'm here for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him knew he'd only met Anna this morning, but another part of him felt like he really had known her for months.  And that was the reality that Anna knew, the one in which 11 year old Jamie and her were close friends, if not almost best friends.  She trusted Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can do that?!  Like... change entire people like that?  Are you like a witch?  Is this like your inviting me to Hogwarts?! Oh my god!\"  Anna started to get way too excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh keep your voice down!  You can't let the muggles hear!\" James smirked, \"No but seriously, there's no Hogwarts as far as I know, it's just me.  And I didn't just change your brother into your sister, I can apparently change reality too.  Your parents will hopefully believe Billie has always been a girl.  And everyone else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... how come I know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked away for a second, and lied, \"That's uh, because I wanted you to know.  I thought, what's the point of a gift if you don't even know you have it?\"  In truth, he'd just messed up and accidentally made her aware.  It had happened once before in the cafeteria, with far more disastrous results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... this is all so crazy...\"  Anna's imagination was beginning to go wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... look I'm really sorry, if you're mad, I can try to put it back to normal and all that, but it might take a while-\"  James stammered a premptive apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna shook her head, black hair fluttering to the sides.  \"I'm not mad, I love it.\"  She said simply.  She was suddenly so OK with this that it began to scare James.  He knew he had to put a limit on this before Anna started asking him to change more stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... whew, I'm glad!  I was worried you'd be all mad at me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, but ... what were you saying about it might take a while to fix?\"  Anna seemed a bit worried suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you see,\" James started to come up with a lie, \"The magic takes a while to prepare.  I can't do it all the time, you'd have to wait at least a few days before I could put your sister back to being your brother.  Or... I could just leave her like this if you prefer.  She'll be like this forever if you want, it wont take any effort.\"</span></div></div>",

We'll talk about this then.\"  James left.  Anna went back to her room to see what it really was like to have a big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames walked home alone.  He had plenty of time to think.  James wonder if he screwed everything up.  He wasn't sure if he should have let Anna know about the change.  James wanted it to be a gift.  An anonymous gift was OK, but if gift that no one knows about what's the point.  Thinking about it now, maybe he shouldn't have let her know or hadn't done anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got James to thinking.  \"Was Kelsie just sick or was it something else?  Did he make Kelsie sick?\"  James was really mad at Kelsie, but he didn't want to get her really hurt.  At first James was just having fun.  He was trying to scare her a little, but when she started to cry James wondered if he went too far.  He wasn't mature enough to know that type of psychological damage that his 'trick' could cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't know it, but if he didn't swap back soon, his old life might be a thing of the passed no matter what he did.  With all the changes James had made, reality might not spring into shape the way he remembered it, even if he remembered it as it was.  The only way to get things exactly as they were was to undo all the changes.  And even then that might not be enough.  Kelsie was physically and mentally the 'same' as she was before.  There weren't any swaps that to her that weren't reversed.  But the horror of all that had happened to her might have scarred her for life.  She might worry that at any time, she could be a totally different person.  She might lose herself without knowing why and that might undermine her entire ego and emotional structure.  If you can't be sure that you are yourself that would lead to horrendous mental stresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were the things that he knew about.  There was a woman who was now a gay man so that Anna could have a sister.  James didn't even know who this woman was.  But because of the change, lots of things were effected.  Could one of those things effect James's real life?  James not only didn't know, he hadn't considered this at all.  One thing was true, James couldn't return Billie to normal since he didn't even know who the woman was that happened to be walking by Bill's room.  James could make another random man into a woman to put Bill back to normal.  But that would cause other consequences that James didn't even think to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention the bully who was now two years younger than he should be.  Even if James returned to his own age, Jacob would end up two years older than he was.  This could effect things too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home, James wasn't paying attention to the street.  Even if he was he probably wouldn't notice that Lauren was in a car with Jacob.  Lauren and Jacob were now dating.  Jacob liked a girl who always wore skirts and dresses.  Lauren wasn't made 'girlier' since she lost her genitals to James.  But now that she had a penis it was hard to hide when she wore 'tight' clothing like pants.  If she wore a loose fitting skirt or dress, then no one would tell that she had a penis underneath.  Lauren hardly even knew James name anymore.  To Lauren, James was just a little girl that lived in the neighborhood.  James was now no longer an option, so Lauren fell in love with Jacob, who had grown into a handsome man. James memories of Lauren were fading too, now that he had 'friends his own age' to play with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James completely missed the car driving by containing Jacob and Lauren, who had just recently started dating in this reality.  But he wasn't so concerned with that right now as trying to make sure he didn't screw anyone else over.  He felt horrible about Kelsie now, if he really did mess her up permanently, that was his own fault.  And the woman that lost her gender to Anna's brother, now sister, was likely gone forever.  He he knew he could never fix that 100%, even if Anna did want her brother back.  But fortunately Anna seemed to like this, and so James accepted that he would leave that situation be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got home and his mother greeted him as he came in, \"Hey Jamie!  How'd visiting your friend go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good mommy!\"  It was a slip of the tongue, still calling her mommy.  A lot of the other girls in fifth grade said 'mom' now, and he had to remind himself that 'mommy' made him sound too childish.  It was a reminder that he was still younger than he should be.  \"I met her sister, and saw her house, it was nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good honey, I'm glad you had fun.\"  Heather said as she was half paying attention to a TV show, and half listening to her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames headed straight for his room, barging in and jumping onto his twin bed, immediately grabbing a big stuffed rabbit for comfort.  He knew he should be older and more mature, but right now he didn't care. He just wanted to hug his bunny and feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow sis, you still hug that thing?\"  Audrey's voice sounded from the other side of the room.  James looked up and noticed her bed was barely out of sight due to a dresser in the way, but she still saw him dive for the bunny.  \"Aren't you a little old for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames pouted, forgetting that Audrey might be in here...  He had just wanted some alone time for a while.  \"No I'm not too old for it!  I'm not old enough yet!  If I was I wouldn't be hugging this stupid bunny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, jeez sis chill out.  You get your first period or something?\"  Audrey teased.  A light tapping noise could be heard, as she was texting her friends at blazing speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I'm only what... 11?\"  James said defensively, as if he even knew what a period was... He'd lost that knowledge when he regressed and hadn't yet had 'the talk' with mom.  He had just heard the word before and knew it was something bad that happened to Audrey when she reached a certain age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey shrugged, \"Hey, it wouldn't be the first time someone got it young. You could get it next week, you never know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God I wish, at least then I would feel like an adult.  I hate being a kid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?  Well periods suck, trust me, but I guess being a kid sucks more.  If I had to chose I'd probably stick with periods.  Sucks to be you sis.  Maybe you should grow up faster or something?\" Audrey said, seeming very apathetic of Jamie's childlike complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to James this is what he needed to hear.  He realized he should stop worrying about trying to fix all the other people who he'd randomly targeted before, because there wasn't much he could do for them.  Instead he needed to focus on what was most important, returning to his original age!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea sis!\"  James jumped out of bed and rushed over to Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a sec!\"  James ran out of the room and looked out the front window towards Jacob's house.  There was no car in the driveway, and it seemed like no one was home.  \"Crap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie?\"  Heather asked, \"Don't go outside, dinner's going to be ready in just a bit.  You can play with your friends tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... there's no time for that mom!  I gotta grow up!\"  James said, hurrying back his bedroom.  Heather simply chuckled and went back to preparing dinner and watching her TV show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey!\" James exclaimed as he came back into the room. \"Do you have any friends coming over tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hope was, maybe, just maybe he might be able to swap ages with someone slightly older.  From there he could step his way up in age swapping with different people without completely regressing one person at once.  Otherwise he'd have to wait until Jacob was home, and he had no idea when that would be.</span></div></div>",

Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, nevermind...\"  James sighed, but he was already formulating a new plan in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mom won't let me leave the house this late, but Audrey might be able to, at least before her curfew.  I wonder...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames decide to use his own sister as a way to move his plan forward.  He would put her back to normal when he was done, but there was no time to worry about that now.  He focused on swapping ages with Audrey, and when he opened his eyes, he was now 13 years old!  He looked around and notice he'd definitely had an impressive growth spurt in the past two years.  He stood up from his bed and noticed he was actually standing on Audrey's side of the bedroom, at an impressive 5'1\".  His blonde hair had steadily grown longer over the years, and was now styled differently.  He currently wore it with long bangs swept partially over one eye, rather than braided around the back.  A typical style that teenage girl might find cool and not childish.  He also noticed he was wearing a tank top that definitely showed off that 'he' was maturing into a lovely young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my god I have boobs!  I mean they're not big but... yeah!  Suck it Audrey, I'm the big sis now!</i>  James giggled, as he poked the little A cups through his top.  Of course, he was fascinated by them more from the perspective of a young girl who'd just gone through puberty, not as a former boy.  To James this was just a normal part of growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also looked around the room and noticed that even though he was on Audrey's side of the room, most of the stuff looked the same.  The difference was as the older sister now most of that stuff was his, with little Audrey getting the hand me down stuff.  The little makeup kit on the desk, the cellphone in his jeans pocket, and the more teenage looking clothes: all which once belonged to Audrey, were now Jamie's.  <i>Also, didn't we used to have bunk beds at one point?  I guess that got changed when we grew older...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he knew this would all change soon enough, as he had a plan to use his new 13 year old identity to his advantage!</span></div></div>",

As a 13 year old, by now he knew the logistics of where babies came from, and wondered how on earth the TSAR was dealing with him being older than his own son, Jacob.  He decided that was a line of thought best not explored, or his head might explode.  For now he just had to wait until Jacob got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he heard a car pull up into the garage, and the door unlocked.  James looked up excitedly, wondering if this was finally it?  The door opened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob, is that you?\" James called out from the living room, muting the TV.  His voice clearly still sounded like a 13 year old girl's, but he knew no one would care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the sound of heavier footsteps made it clear that it was probably not Jacob.  \"Nope, just me honey.\"  A middle aged man said, as he quickly headed towards the living room and set down his coat on the back of a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was tall and had quite an impressive beard, so James assumed correctly that this was Jacob's father.  The man probably weighed at least twice as much as James, and when he sat down on the couch, the cushion raised up, causing James to lean into his 'husband'.  He put his arm over James's shoulder, and let out a long sigh, he was clearly exhausted.  Needless to say, as a teen girl, James was really freaked out about now.  He tried to squirm away but the man was quite strong, and didn't seem to even notice his 'wife's uncomfortableness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man what a day... Seriously Tara, Disney channel?\"  The man said with a hearty chuckle, grabbing the remote and changing it to the news.  James also learned that apparently his name was Tara now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yyeah... I mean not all the shows on there are bad.  I was just seeing what was on.\"  James said meekly, arms straight to either side, trying not to touch the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob's not home yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was hoping you knew where he was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the man just laughed again, \"Our son is hopefully off becoming a man.  Didn't he have a date with that cute girl?  Lana was her name?  I don't remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A date, really?\" James was shocked that Jacob had only been an adult for a few days and already had a date.  He had few memories left of his life as an adult, but he couldn't recall going on very many dates.</span></div></div>",

He had to wait for Jacob to come home and swap ages with him and go to his own house.  It was still early in the evening, but according to Mr. Cooley Jacob would be out very late.  Although what Mrs. Cooley had said to him before he swap heartened him.  She said he had better be home or he would be in trouble.  James didn't know if that meant ten PM or midnight, but it shouldn't be too late.  James would stay up and wait for him.  As a thirteen year old he was used to a bedtime that was closer to nine though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Cooley put his arm around James' shoulder.  James felt a little uncomfortable, but as Mr. Cooley's wife he felt he should support his husband too.  It was his 'wifely duty' to snuggle with his husband.  But that didn't mean he had to get frisky with him every time the man wanted it.  James had a good reason not to this time, he was waiting for his son to get home and that would be good enough if the real Mrs. Cooley had been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't enjoy watching the news and he didn't want to fool around.  But he had to wait there on the couch and that is what he did.  When Mr. Cooley said, \"Let's go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames said, \"I think I'll stay up a little while longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob is a big boy,\" Mr. Cooley said knowing what his wife meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I just want to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want for me to have a talk with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, as soon as he gets home I'll come to bed.  I just want to see that everything went fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's eighteen, not fourteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" James said with a small laugh.  James himself wasn't even fourteen.  But yet he was Jacob's mother and everyone knows mother's always worry about their children.  Mr. Cooley went to bed and James continued on the couch.  When Mr. Colley was out of earshot, James put on the Disney channel again.  It was 10 PM and \"Bizaardvark\" was on.  James had never seen the show before, when he was eighteen he was too old and when he was eleven his bedtime was too early.  But he watched it and enjoyed it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuck in the Middle\" was on Next and then \"Liv and Maddie\" was on when Jacob finally arrived home.  Finally the moment had arrived.  James was so excited that Jacob was actually within his sight.  Jacob was in the middle of saying \"Hi Mom,\" when James quickly swapped their ages back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he did James instinctively said as an adult who was the mother of a thirteen year old, \"What are you doing up so late?\"  Reality had changed, Jacob hadn't just gotten home, he simply was up past his bedtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob didn't know.  So he made something up, \"I'm just getting a glass of water.\"  This was fine since Jacob's clothes had changed and he was now dressed for bed in blue pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then get it and it's back to bed with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boy was back in his room.  James looked at his chest.  His breasts had grown to a size 'D'.  He knew they had changed, but he didn't dare look at them until Jacob was gone.  The ruckus woke up Mr. Cooley.  Who called down to him, \"Darling it's late come to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I'll be right up!\"  Jamie called back to the man who was currently her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, relieved that she was finally back to 'normal', but she knew it was going to take some getting used to.  Jamie had lost all memory of what it was like to be an 18 year old, so she'd have to start by building new ones.  Unfortunately she still had her wifely duties to attend to, and she was mature enough to know what she absolutely DIDN'T want Mr Cooley doing tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie flipped the TV off and headed upstairs to the master bedroom.  It was already very late and the lights were all out, with Mr Cooley lying alone on the bed getting comfortable.  A part of Jamie was compelled to go through her usual evening routine, washing her face, brushing her teeth, and all that.  But she realized that was <i>Tara's</i> evening routine, not hers.  She had no intention on staying in this life, and just wanted to get to sleep as fast as possible to wake up early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she sat down on the bed, Jamie started to undress.  She noticed the clothes she'd been wearing, which were actually Mrs Cooley's clothes, had noticeably resized to accommodate Jamie's new womanly curves.  She wore a sensible v-neck red blouse and a white cami underneath, which did a decent job containing her impressive, but proportional bust.  When she took the blouse off over her head, she saw her chest bounce slightly under the camisole, and once that came off, there was a supportive blue bra with a subtle lace trim around the edges.  In the dim lighting from outside, she could see long shadows being cast into the depths of her cleavage, and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So this is what it's like to be myself again.  Being grown up feels quite different..</i> These idle thoughts crossed her mind as she unhooked her D cup bra, and simply tossed it aside.  She felt so relieved to be rid of the constricting underwire, and hoped that her own bras were more comfortable than Tara's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she squeezed out of Tara's tight fitting jeans, amazed at just how wide her hips were, and how much harder it was to get the jeans off.  Puberty had definitely hit Jamie like a ton of bricks, and she had come out very fortunate.  She wasn't a super model or anything, but she was certainly nice to look at, and would make some guy or girl very happy.  Underneath the jeans were a pair of matching lacy blue bikini panties, which had also belonged to Tara.  She decided to just leave these on and throw the rest of the clothes in the laundry basket, instead of on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything was cleaned up, Jamie crawled into bed and spooned up against her husband, who she still didn't even learn the name of.  He still seemed partially awake, and pulled his 18 year old wife closer to his body.  She hoped he was too tired to want to do anything, but then suddenly she felt a cold hand cupping one of her bare breasts, softly kneading it, and then letting go.  If there was a light on in the room, someone might have seen that under the mess of blonde hair, Jamie's face was bright red.  <i>I... wow... I didn't... didn't think that would feel like that.  I guess this is what it's like to be a grown woman finally.  I mean, I shouldn't feel weird, right, he's my husband for the night.  As far as the universe is concerned, it's completely expected that he would... fondle... his wife.  Hopefully that's all there is though...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie prayed that her husband was too tired to continue, and she was right.  After several minutes passed, and only a few breast fondles, he seemed to be out cold.  He must have had a long day.</span></div></div>",

She had to make breakfast for everyone.  make sure Jacob got ready for school.  Make him his lunch and pack it in a paper bag.  At nine Jacob had a lunchbox, but at thirteen he carried a bagged lunch.  In the exchange Jacob had ended up four years older than he was three days ago.  Regardless, before everyone else woke up, Jamie took a shower and then put on her robe.  She brushed her teeth.  She was ready for the day.  She woke up her husband and then started breakfast for everyone.  When breakfast was ready, she awoke Jacob.  He was still in his pajamas.  She went down to eat and Jamie chose his clothes for the day.  This was the morning routine for her now.  It would stay the routine if she didn't swap life roles.  It was a nice life but it wasn't hers and the whole point was to get back her own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie just had to wait for Mrs. Coolie to come out for the bus and then she would swap back life roles with her and everything would be exactly the same as it was.  It would be as if she had never used the TSAR at all or though she thought.  At least for herself.  Well, Anna would have a sister instead of a brother, but that is the only difference.  Jamie didn't know that she should be a man not a woman.  Of course there were a lot of changes that she had forgotten.  For instance her hair shouldn't be this cute shade of blonde.  There was a bully somewhere that was two years younger than he should be.  There was a gay man who should be a woman.  Lauren was completely different too.  Growing up with a penis had changed her life in many ways.  But none of that mattered, at least Jamie would be back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was time before she had to meet Mrs. Cooley at the bus stop. Jamie used the time to get dressed, put on her makeup and fix her hair.  When it was time, Jamie escorted Jacob to his bus stop and waited.  The time was now, she could see Mrs. Cooley approaching the bus stop.  She was happy to be going to school and looked forward to seeing her friend Anna who would get on the bus soon.  But before she could get on the bus, Jamie swapped back her life role with Mrs. Cooley.  Mrs. Cooley was now standing with her son waiting for his bus and Jamie wasn't at either place.  She was still in her house.  She was going to drive to school in her own car.  she hadn't owned a car before, but as a girl instead of a boy she was more mature and so her parents bought her a car last year.

After switching back to her real life, she found herself back at home, no longer trying to take the bus.  She wasn't in elementary school or middle school, or even a mother, but a normal high school girl at last.  This was what she had wanted to return to wasn't it?  It must be, since this was the same age that Jacob had been, 18 years old, and a senior in high school.  Problem was, Jamie still didn't have many memories of high school left.  She remembered a few faces and names here and there, probably friends, but who they were was hazy at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat at the kitchen table, and realized there was a small breakfast quickly getting cold, so she finished that off and went to her room to see what was different.  \"Oh my god...\"  Jamie nearly squealed in giddiness, as she saw how her bedroom had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill it was shared with Audrey, who was now only 11, but Jamie's side of the room was drastically different.  Where it had once been Audrey's boy band posters, amateur makeup kits, and tween clothing.  It now looked like she really had grown up.  Instead of corny boy band posters, were now more posters of famous movies, video game characters in awesome poses, and even attractive athletes, both male and female.  Sports jerseys that said \"Barrett\" on the back, her last name, hung on the wall.  It appeared she played for the girl's soccer team one year, and the volleyball team another year, but she couldn't tell which.  It was no wonder she felt so athletic, all these after school sports really get someone in shape over the years.  She wondered if this was how she was always like, or if her time building a friendship with Anna had influenced this in any way.  There was no way for her to know for sure, but she loved it regardless.  It was better than being the scrawny weak little girl that got knocked down trying to kick a ball (what felt like) all those years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut moving on from the wall of sports related things, Jamie finally caught sight of something she hadn't expected: a full blown laptop PC on her desk by the bed.  It probably wasn't very high end, but it was hers.  She just hoped she knew the password to it.  She felt an odd connection to the PC when she looked at it however, as though she had memories associated with it.  This was strange, because none of the other things in the room made her feel this way.  But she would have to investigate that later, since she had school to get ready for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly headed towards the bathroom, not sure how much time she had.  When Jamie got there she was shocked by the sheer amount of <b>stuff</b> that was on the counter, in the shower, in the medicine cabinet, it was all just full to the brim.  As a younger girl she'd never had to use so much stuff in the bathroom, and she realized it might take her some time to learn what it was all for.  But luckily today was not that day, since the mirror revealed she was already made up and ready for school!  Thankfully her naturally blonde hair was already done, straightened it fell to the small of her back, and styled in the front to have fringe that curled slightly inwards to frame her face.  The bangs weren't quite as emo as they were when she was 13, now being cleanly controlled to the side, without covering up her entire eye.  Occasionally a bang would fall out of place and obscure her vision, but a simple flick of the head and it obeyed for a while longer.  She loved the look so much, she had already forgotten this wasn't even her original hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor clothes, she wasn't as dolled up as she expected, but it was just a casual school outfit, not the prom, she reminded herself.  She wore a simple violet off the shoulder top which was loose enough around the neck to reveal her entire right shoulder, but everywhere else was nearly form fitting.  It showed no cleavage, but the shape of her D cup chest was clearly visible, and it made her smirk when they bounced.  She realized she was wearing a strapless bra so you couldn't see it on the revealed shoulder, and it didn't exactly hold them in place all too well.  But she found the bouncing effect rather amusing, so she let it slide.  Below that she wore a simple pair of grey shorts which revealed a lot of leg, and a pair of barefoot tennis shoes with no socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Jamie realized she couldn't stop beaming a smile at the mirror.  She worried she had become vain, but it was the reaction of seeing herself grown up for what felt like the first time, and being so happy at the result.  It seemed like years had passed since she was just a little girl who wanted to grow up to be pretty like...  <i>Lauren?  Was that her name?  I wonder if that wish came true or not?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer daydreaming was interrupted by her mother, Heather.</span></div></div>",

It was perfect to carry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie took a bite of the sandwich as she headed towards her car.  She got in and drove the small distance to Lauren's house.  Waiting outside was Lauren, Kim and Jody.  The three girls got into Jamie's car with Lauren taking the front seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now that we are all together, I'll ask,\" Jody said, \"How did it go?\"  Jody was referring to Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It went great!  I liked him a lot,\"   Lauren gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he going to ask you out again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us about him, Jody continued.  The girl's in the car were just listening to the conversation, but they wanted to ask the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we met on this dating site on the internet and he finally asked me out.  We went to that Italian restaurant..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren continued to describe the date in glowing terms.  When she was done.  Jody asked the obvious question, \"What's his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Jacob.  He said he would call me soon.  I hope he calls me back tonight.  But you know guys, that's probably three days in guy speak.\"  Jamie doubted that Jacob would call back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation touched on many topics until Kim asked, \"Jamie are you sure you won't join volleyball with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my girls how can I play volleyball?\"  Jamie said referring to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they do have sports bras you know.  Besides it'll be fun.  We need one more for the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have Me, Lauren and Jody of course.  Then there is Sasha, Bri and Katie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's six, that is all you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need an alternate.  What if someone gets hurt or tired.  Or just can't make it to the game.  Without an alternate we would forfeit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I'll think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally arrived at school and after parking the three walked towards the school.  The conversations continued.  Eric seeing his girlfriend from afar ran up to her from behind covered her eyes and said, \"Guess who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ujmmm, Chris Pine?\" Kim said.  Kim was a big Star Trek fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I will take you where you have never gone before.  At least when I get you alone,\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when Eric sees Jamie?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Throughout the morning so far Jamie had been running more or less on autopilot.  She just tried to go with the flow, learning who were her close friends, and who she had no memory of.  Lauren she definitely felt there was a connection there, stronger than everyone else around, stronger than any connection she'd felt yet with anything.  But it was frustrating to not be able to remember why.  It was almost like she had amnesia, but was just going through life pretending like she knew what was going on.  Jamie was smart enough to know that she couldn't keep that up for long, before she was lacking some critical memory of a person very important to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren hadn't really said much directly to Jamie today, mostly gushing about her date with Jacob to Kim and Jody, as Jamie drove the car and listened, trying to pick up details.  She wondered what would happen now that Jacob was only 13?  Why hadn't the TSAR caused her to forget the date ever happened yet?  Maybe it wasn't important enough, who knows.  But it bugged Jamie as everyone else talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Kim she felt a connection as well, albeit a much weaker one than Lauren's.  She felt comfortable around Kim, but only to a point.  Howver, with Jody she felt no connection with.  It was almost like she'd never met her before...  But everyone around seemed to believe that they were all friends together.  If everything in Jamie's life had been put back to normal, then why didn't she feel any sort of recognition around Jody?  She seemed like a nice girl who would be easy to befriend, but there was nothing there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess who?\"  A guy's voice said, as he grabbed Kim from behind.  Kim giggled and played along, as this was apparently her boyfriend.  They laughed and flirted for a moment, and Jamie caught a glance of the guy's face.  <i>Yeah I feel something around him too... I think his name's Eric.  Why did I remember his name and not Jody's?  I seem to feel like we were very close once...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie started wondering why she felt closer to Kim's boyfriend and not to Kim.  A part of her suspected that she might actually have feelings for this Eric guy.  He was cute after all, and she could see herself dating him.  But she could also see herself dating Kim, or Lauren even.  This in itself startled her, since as a girl it never occurred to her that she might be bisexual, but now that she was grown up again, it didn't seem that far fetched anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to introduce me to your new friend?\"  Eric asked Kim, while looking curiously at Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim gave a confused laugh, \"New friend?  Uhh who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The... other blonde one?\"  He pointed towards Jamie.  \"I'm not seeing double today am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was referring to Kim, since she had blonde hair as well, though it was shorter and in a ponytail, as opposed to Jamie's longer, carefully styled approach.  Kim was looking really confused now, and was about to answer, but Jamie decided to save her the trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  I'm Jamie, nice to meet you!  I'm gonna play as an alternate on Kim's volleyball team soon.\"  Jamie blurted out, having apparently come to a decision.  She remembered seeing the volleyball jersey in her bedroom, so she knew at some point in the past she had been on a team.  She was confident the skills to play would come naturally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!  Yes thank you Jamie!  I know you haven't played since sophomore year, but I'm sure you'll be our ringer, you've still got it!\"  Kim seemed delighted to hear Jamie's choice, but then she furrowed her brow.  \"But come on, you've met Eric before, haven't you?  I could have sworn Eric was around last time we all hung out together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie looked at Eric, who simply shrugged.  She wasn't sure what was going on, but since Eric seemed to have no idea, Jamie decided to go along with him.  \"No, I mean, I've heard you talk about him plenty of times of course, but I think this is the first time we've talked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded, \"Come on Kim, I'm sure I would remember a nice girl like this.  Anyway, it's nice to meet you uh... Jamie.  You seem familiar but... well maybe we were at the same party and passed by without talking, I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really found it strange how he seemed so unsure of himself now.  First he was insistent he hadn't met Jamie, but after a minute or so, he said she looked familiar?  And Jamie still had the feeling that she did know him from somewhere, quite well.  Something was definitely unusual, and Jamie's worry fell to the TSAR.  If it had somehow screwed up this Eric guy... that could turn out to be a mess after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group broke up to head to their own classes.  Jamie's first class was math.  She got to class early and took out her phone.  She found her Facebook account and started reading.  She had over a thousand friends.  Jamie discovered she was a social butterfly on the internet.  But to Jamie she didn't feel like she was discovering it, it felt more like reminding herself of something that had always been.  She read the first few messages and felt like she had to post replies to several.  Then she realized, that it wasn't only Facebook that she did everyday, but Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest.  On-line she knew everyone and everyone knew her.  Each post reminded her of another friend.  In fact it reminded her of the people in the class she was actually sitting in.  She looked around and saw, Tom, Alice, Jarred, Ed and the people she knew.  Some were real friends, some were just on-line friends but it made the casual 'hi's more intimate than it would otherwise be.  James had never been this popular on-line, but it seems the 'new' Jamie knew everyone and she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie's grades were also well above what James had been.  In fact, since this was her senior year and had done so well in the lower grades, she didn't have a full schedule anymore.  She didn't need it to graduate.  She only had five regular classes and a study hall.  This gave her time for all her online social networking.  Today, she would even have to stay an extra period after her classes were done just to drive Lauren and the gang back home.  This is why, Jamie wasn't usually in the early morning carpool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird period was study hall for Jamie.  Jamie used the time to read the Facebook posts, the Tweets, the Pinterest pictures and the Instagram stuff.  By the time the period was over, Jamie had remembered her entire life before using the TSAR.    All-in-all Jamie loved her life.  She wouldn't want to change it.  She even wondered why she would try that age change experiment with the TSAR.  It was just the TSAR was new and she wanted to try it out.  But if anything had screwed her happy life she could never forgive herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one thing she wouldn't regret was her time with Anna.  Anna was a great person and Jamie wished she was still her friend.  Jamie wished that Anna would still be her friend, but that could only happen if they were the same age.  Jamie could never be eleven again.  That was his sister's age.  But maybe Anna could be changed to be eighteen.  That would be great.  Anna could be friends with everyone: Lauren, Kim, Jody, Sasha, Bri, Katie, everyone.  They would all love her just like Jamie did.  Jamie remembered that Anna was her sister Audrey's friend.  Jamie didn't know why she had grown so close to Anna so fast, but she did.  She wondered if Anna had a Facebook account so she could see how Anna was doing.  But she didn't think so, Anna was only eleven.</span></div></div>",

We had such fun together and got along so well, it would be a shame for her to never really know that friendship we had.</i>  Jamie was determined to make Anna the same age as her, but she just needed time to think how she could do it.  Clearly she would have to find an 18 year old and swap their age with Anna's.  But Jamie knew her powers only seemed to work when she could see someone, so they'd both have to be in the same place.  There was the option of using herself as a go-between during the swap, but she honestly didn't want to touch her own age anymore, and possibly risk changing anything about her life.  No, that was way too risky, and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her study period, she finally caught up on most of her social media updates, and reminded herself that she could use some of this time to get a head start on her math homework.  She had to get used to getting back in the swing of things, since the past few days she didn't have to worry one bit about homework.  But back in her real life, her grades were real and mattered, and she didn't want to ruin her GPA so close to graduation.  So for the next 20 minutes she flew through the homework assignment from math.  The knowledge from the class came quickly to her, and it felt nice to not have to stress over it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between math problems, she looked around at some of the other students in study hall.  She knew most of their faces, but didn't really feel a connection with any of them.  They weren't true friends like Lauren and Kim, but just acquaintances.  Yet when she saw someone like the boy the next table over, she knew his name was Rob, and she knew that he had an eerily similar schedule to hers.  They always ended up in the same classes every year, probably by pure chance, but the two never hit it off.  He was quiet and kept to his studies, but she remembered catching him steal glances her way now and then.  It was flattering, and she decided to leave him be.  Someone else in the room was a girl named Becky.  For some reason she had taken study hall, but never actually studied.  The difference between her and Jamie, was that Becky actually needed to study.  She was on the hairy edge of failing half of her classes, and was considering dropping out of school entirely.  Jamie knew this simply from seeing her face and remembering reading her Facebook updates once or twice.  She did seem to stress over school a lot, but didn't have the drive to fix her habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That girl definitely needs a few extra years to sort her life out.  Seems like life has caught up with her quicker than she expected.  Wonder what the consequences of making her 11 years old would be?  If anything it'd give her a second chance at school all over again.  And if swapping ages with Jacob was any indication, she would still keep her same personality and identity as she does now, but she'd just get a chance to live her teens all over again.</i>  Jamie wondered, but then considered that Becky might make all the same mistakes over again if given the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie just made a mental note to consider Becky as someone who might be a swap target for Anna.  Finally study period was over however, and people casually started to file out of the room and chitchat in the halls.  Jamie caught up with Becky before she ran off to wherever.  Becky was dressed plainly in a simple pair of ragged jeans and flip flops, and a rock band T-shirt.  She had plain brown hair that was straightened but clearly not maintained frequently.  Jamie could tell just by her appearance that she didn't really come from privilege...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Becky right?\"  Jamie greeted her with an approachable smile that seemed to come natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi there, Jamie.  What's going on?\"  Becky seemed a bit surprised to be spoken to so suddenly, but went along with talking while walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uhh,\" Jamie started in a lower volume voice, \"I heard you were looking for a math tutor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky stopped and looked puzzled at Jamie, \"No, not really.  I mean, I wouldn't be able to pay for one.  And who told you that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one, but listen I could tutor you this weekend for free.  A few of us are getting a study group together, and we're gonna help people with the stuff they're stuck on.  And it's not one of those lame study groups that says they're going to study and then just messes around.  We really want to get everyone prepared for the test.  And then party after we all pass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette looked at her suspiciously, \"I don't know, I mean what's the big deal if I pass a test anyways?  I'd still probably fail the class.  And why are you doing this for free, you trying to run for student president or something?  I bet you'd win no problem, everyone loves you huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie sighed, \"Not really...  It's just... Nevermind, just let me know if you want to come or not.  I'm going to be at volleyball today after school so, you know, I might be busy, but I'll see your message!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Jamie felt she'd overstayed her welcome, and they went their separate ways to their next respective classes.  The whole way, Jamie was buried in her phone, responding to texts and tweets, amazed that she hadn't walked into a wall or a person yet.  Yet, as she handled her social life, she still couldn't stop working on trying to find a possible age donor for Anna.  Becky seemed like a good candidate, but she might not even show up for the opportunity to swap.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jamie's school day was over, but she had to wait for her friends classes to end.  Having nothing better to do, Jamie decided to take a few selfies of herself in front of the school.  She looked at herself through the screen on her iPhone and decided she needed to freshen her makeup.  New lipstick, touching up her eye shadow and reapplying her blush was in order.  Then she took her hair of of it's ponytail for the picture, left the school and then positioned herself so she was in front of the school doors and took several pictures of herself in several poses.  She decided which were the best and then posted them on several social media sites such as Facebook, Pinterest and Instragram each with the caption of \"I'm Back!!!\"  This was an inside joke for her, since no one knew that she had been gone for three days on that magic adventure through time.  The memories of exactly what happened were fading fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first few jumps in age regression, James didn't make any impact on the world in general or the school.  Actually there weren't any changes to the high school at all.  James (as he throught of himself back then) didn't use the TSAR again while he was regressing thought high school but when he reached middle school and his maturity and self-control diminished he started to use the TSAR to make changes and those changes had indeed changed some of the events and people who had been in the middle school.  There was now a teacher in middle school who had almost no self-confidence and a little girl who had it in abundance.  The teacher's life had been changed profoundly.  With out the self confidence of an adult, he married a different type of person that he had before meeting James.  He needed a woman who would take charge of his life and so his life had changed in many ways.  The little girl with the confidence of an adult would rise to the top of popularity in the middle school and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the sixth grade the lives of a teacher and a student who had swapped ages and positions within the class cause ripples that totally changed both their families although inside the school not too much had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incident with the lunch lady and little boy in the grammar school was set right by James using the TSAR to fix things.  Which was a good thing since it avoided a lawsuit that no one could have predicted the outcome.  Whereas in the fourth grade, the personal styles of many students were changes.  That didn't make too much of a difference, although there was one boy and one girl who ended up wearing 'unisex' clothing of the other.  The boy now wore panties all the time and the girl liked underroos not that the casual observer could tell.  But there were occasions that the boy wore a skirt and that girl never wore a dress nor a skirt again.  The girl with the lovely blonde hair had to put up with James' hair although she did grow it out eventually.  There were also changes in the lower grades that James wasn't aware of and that James now didn't rem,ember now either since he had a lower attention span when he was 'just a kid' of nine or ten.  But what James always remembered was his friendship with Anna who took him in when he was a stranger in a younger class.  He would never forget what she did for him.  Even when he had already forgotten that he had been a him at one time and now she was a she forever...unless she used the TSAR to change it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie got several replies from his social media friends asking \"What do you mean you're back?\"  James didn't have time to reply because class was over and Kim and company had come to fetch him up for volleyball practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After school was finally out, Jamie headed out to the school's volleyball court to meet up with the rest of the ladies who wanted to play.  Several of the girls were actually on the school's varsity team, and were just looking for a fun game to practice.  But Jamie, Lauren, and Katie were just friends who were invited to come along and participate.  Kim, Jody, Bri, and Sasha were all pretty good players, so they decided to break it up into 2v2 varsity players, and then each team would get a third lesser experienced player to round out the 3v3 match.  With seven ladies total, it meant that you'd have to sit out a few games until one of them needed to drop out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on the bench, along with several spectators who were mostly just friends, or the boyfriends of the girls playing.  Eric was actually there, watching his girlfriend Kim kick some ass.  However, Kim's team along with Jody and Lauren, were not doing so well...  Lauren in particular seemed very uncomfortable with the whole thing.  She was the only player who insisted on not changing clothes, and was wearing a knee length skirt that she'd worn to school that day.  Every time she had to jump to hit the ball, her skirt would encumber her, and she was already short, so she would tend to miss the ball completely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Lauren, just hang in there, we still have this!\" Kim yelled encouragement as she dove to return a serve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe return was good, but a few moments later the ball headed Lauren's way and she completely wiffed, letting the ball sail past.  \"Ah... Dammit I'm really sorry guys.  I think I'm done for the day, this is just not my thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren straightened out her skirt and headed over towards the bench where Jamie sat.  \"Well now's your chance Jamie, if you want to go save the game.\"  Lauren said with a smile, sitting down next to her.  She put her arm on Jamie's opposite shoulder, in a friendly hug gesture.  \"I'm sure you'll be better than me anyways, at least you're dressed for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, Jamie had changed into a pair of shorts and a tank top, and was ready to jump in there.  \"You sell yourself short Laur, you did your best!  I would say you're a brave girl risking ruining that adorable skirt, braver than I am that's for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie winked at Lauren before getting up to head onto the court.  The last thing she did was tie her blonde hair up in a long ponytail, using a scrunchie from her pocket, \"Alright, it's been a while let's see how this goes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first set went fairly well, as Jamie got warmed up and memories of playing volleyball in the past started to trickle up to the surface.  She was never a star player by any means, but she remembered the basics.  Kim, Jody, and Jamie actually ended up winning the first set, just barely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now we're not going to go easy on you guys, let's go!\"  Sasha yelled from across the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second set started off blazingly fast, and Jamie was starting to have trouble keeping up.  Her team relied on her to save the right corner a few times, and she just couldn't predict where it was going to land next.  It had been a few years since she last played, and these girls were seasoned varsity players!  The second set was a complete disaster, and if they lost one more, the match would be done.  Jamie was running out of breath, and simply unable to read these girls as they kept getting the best of her.  She needed to level the playing field...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her hand, she saw the black ring TSAR on her finger, and briefly focused on Brii's skill at volleyball.  Jamie swapped their skills, but focused on not swapping Brii's status off the team.  She knew that Brii could take these skills and build herself back up to where she was, but Jamie needed those skills this minute!  The third set started, and Jamie started seeing the game in a whole new light.  Suddenly she was making jumps she didn't know she was capable of making, leaping for long shots in the corners, and making close saves.  She had a much better sense of the other team's tactics, and where the ball would end up now.  Before long, Jamie's team pulled out a close victory in the third set!  Now they decided to do one last set as a tie breaker, and then call it a day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jamie had a great deal of fun playing volleyball, but she felt bad for Bri who she swapped her skills with.  Bri was in varsity and it wouldn't be fair for Bri to have to 'get good' again.  Especially since she was a senior and how she played her last year was what she would remember.  Not to mention what if Bri wanted a scholarship for college.  It wouldn't be fair to her.  Jamie decided when the match was over to return Bri's skills back.  Jamie thought that she could swap it back just when she needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jamie drove everyone home, she decided to return to her social media exploration.  She wasn't sure of everybody and wanted to read up on them.  She looked at post after post.  Then she went to the actual timelines of the people to read up more about them to 'remind' herself of her friends.  It was on one such excursion that Jamie ran across a guy at her school named Jeff Dean.  Jamie found the man gorgeous and funny, she liked him a lot instantly.  The more she saw of him the more she liked.  The only problem was that he was in a relationship with Alicia Hiltrand.  According to both their timelines they had been dating for over five months.  Jamie wished that she was 'In A Relationship\" with Jeff.  She was eighteen years old a senior in high school, she wanted to have a boyfriend.  There were lots of dances, picnics, the prom and of course graduation where she would be alone if she didn't have a boyfriend.  But this great guy was taken.  It made her envious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie noticed on Alicia's timeline that she had posted where she was going to be tonight, Jamie decided to go and see her.  Jamie got appropriately dressed, got into her car and drove to the spot.  There she searched for Alicia.  She knew that it was an event that Jeff wasn't going to be at.  When she saw her, she swapped her relationship with Jeff with Alicia's.  Instantly without Jamie doing anything, Jamie's status on Facebook was changed to \"In A Relationship.\"  Many pictures were added to her photo album showing her with her boyfriend Jeff.  Jeff's phone number appeared on Jamie's contact list on her phone.  With her work done, without saying anything to anyone, particularly Alicia, Jamie left to return home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was alone, Jamie phoned Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, snuggle bunny,\" Jamie said coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\":I just called to hear your voice,\" which was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always love hearing from you.\"  The two made the small talk that lovers make.  They talked fore over a half an hour really saying nothing.  Jamie then got back in her car and drove home after arranging to see Jeff tomorrow after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jamie phoned Kim to tell her she couldn't play volleyball.  That she just didn't have time, because of Jeff and all.  Kim knew that Jamie had been seeing Jeff for several months and understood.  Jamie apologized, but she said that she would find someone to take her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat someone was going to be Anna as Anna was progressed from eleven years old to eighteen.  It wouldn't be hard to progress Anna once she found someone to regress in her stead.  Jamie knew that Anna was good friends with her sister Audrey and so she would see her all the time.  Jamie would just have to decide who she was going to make eleven again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jamie checked her phone again, and noticed that she had a message from someone she hadn't had a conversation with on her phone before... it was Becky.  She sent a Facebook message asking about the tutoring, and if it was still going to happen.  She seemed interested after all, but Jamie knew that no amount of last minute studying was going to save Becky's grades before graduation.  She was already long past saving that... And that was why she was the best candidate Jamie found so far for an age swap for Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you should come to my place after school tomorrow.  If no one else shows up I'll still help you.\"  Jamie sent back in a text reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie grinned as her plan was finally coming together.  She had a boyfriend finally, and her friend Anna would finally be back!  Of course she had no idea if Anna was any good at volleyball, but Jamie had a feeling she'd be good at some kind of sport at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat at her desk with her laptop, she continued browsing through her many friends online, and checking out people's Instagram photos.  She checked out her own, and noticed... it was incredibly full of photos.  She had taken a selfie probably every day of high school, and many of those recent ones included Jeff and her making cute lovey faces together.  There was one of them on the beach with Jamie in a very revealing bikini, and Jeff looking very nice with just swim shorts on.  Jamie felt a little ashamed of herself... for the stupid duck face she did with her lips in some of these, and realized that was out of fashion now, everyone hated that.  She resolved to stop making that face in selfies from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Audrey wandered into the room, flopping down on the bed.  She looked over at Jamie and mumbled, \"Hey sis... you doing anything fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right this minute, but how'd you like to hang out with some of my high school friends tomorrow?  Jeff's going to be here, and at least another person.\"  Jamie said, smiling at her little sister.  She had a sudden memory of how little Audrey always loved when Jeff was over, since the two of them got along great together.  Jeff was kind of a kid at heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's eyes lit up at the offer, \"What? No way? Here?  Why do you want me to hang out anyway?\"  Audrey suddenly grew suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not a party or anything, we're just gonna hang out and maybe play some games.\"  Jamie lied, knowing exactly how to string her sister along.  \"But... you are gonna need to bring Anna over too.  I really want Anna to be there, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey thought for a minute, \"Anna?  Alright sure, I can ask if she can come I guess... But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause you two are like, super good friends right?  I wouldn't want to leave your friend out of the fun we're going to have!  Jeff might even sneak in some alcohol from his parents and I'll let you have a taste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey was just a kid, but she knew that drinking was this super mysterious and supposedly fun thing that only the really cool kids could say they've done.  She wanted to be able to brag to her friends that she'd tried it.  \"Sure thing!  Anna and I will be there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, Jamie decided to invite over some of her other friends, and Lauren was the first on her list.  This really was quickly turning into a party even though she hadn't planned on this many people showing up.  But it was going to be far easier to rationalize it to everyone, if there were more people hanging out.  If only one person showed up, it might be suspicious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next school day went by like a breeze.  Jamie flew through her classes, and spent most of her off time networking and tracking her friends whereabouts on social media.  She knew Jeff would be over tonight, and Becky had said she was definitely looking forward to studying.  Lauren was for sure coming, and Kim was a maybe, depending on her schedule.  Audrey hadn't yet answered back about whether Anna could be there, and that concerned Jamie.  The whole point of orchestrating this was all for Anna... and if she couldn't come, what was the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the last period of the day, and she was considering postponing the whole event if Anna wasn't coming.  She had already started working through in her head what excuses she could give Becky and Lauren and the rest.  Her final class got out finally, and she quickly drove home, staring at her phone in case of a message from Audrey, the whole time.  Finally as she was about to call the whole thing off, with only an hour left before it started, Audrey burst in the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis I'm home!\"  Audrey called out, and headed for the bedroom.  Jamie was the only one home at the moment and she rushed out to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, you didn't answer a single one of my messages all day, what-\" Jamie was freaking out, but then behind Audrey, she saw the little 11 year old, tan skinned girl with black hair, Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello?  I don't have a phone sis, how did you expect me to get your messages while I was at school, what's the big deal?\"  Audrey replied while rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jamie was already ignoring Audrey, and greeting Anna, \"Hey Anna!  Good to see you again!  Glad you could make it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like seeing an old friend again, but this time Anna didn't really react quite how she'd hoped.  She still had memory of Jamie changing her brother into her sister, but in this reality Jamie had been the 18 year old sister of her friend Audrey, and they weren't all that close.  She smiled politely, but was still a bit unsure of why she was here.  \"Hey Jamie... yeah, Audrey said I should come hang out today.  What's... what's going on?  Is this about my sister again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, this is going to be way better than that.  I'm having some of my friends over today, and we're gonna hang out and maybe get a liiiitle crazy, but just a little tiny bit.\"  Jamie held up her fingers indicating the tiny amount of crazy they would be getting.  \"I thought you girls would enjoy hanging out with the big kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile normally Audrey was very apathetic about her older sister, today Jamie as her idol.  She finally got to feel like she was growing up, and her sister was being really cool for once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, Jamie's friends started appearing, Jeff, Becky, Lauren, and even Jody stopped by.  Kim couldn't make it, as expected, but it was certainly enough people for a fun night together...</span></div></div>",

People invited friends, the friends invited their dates, strangers heard about the party and soon the house was full of people.  There was music, alcohol.  Someone sent out for chips and stuff.  Pizzas were delivered it was really getting out of hand.  You apologized to Becky saying that this wasn't what you intended and that you would tutor her another time.  Becky who was a party girl (in the good sense of the word) didn't mind too much.  She loved a good party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave you time to worry about something that had been bothering you.  You wondered if you should tell Anna about making her eighteen or do it without her knowledge.  If you told her and she said no, you couldn't do it.  But then she wouldn't know what she was missing.  You knew how much better it was to an an 'adult' you had just gone through year nine years in a day and being eighteen was much more fun.  At this age you were nearing the end of puberty.  You could drive.  College was a stones throw away.  But were you robbing her of her childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to spend some time with Anna before progressing her.  You didn't think she should tell her.  You maneuvered yourself to chat with Anna.  Anna was with Audrey.  But Anna and Audrey weren't alone.  When Audrey found out you were having a party and 'she was invited' she and Anna called Kelsie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\" Jamie asked although she knew exactly who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one of my friends, Kelsie.  She has been feeling very down lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I thought a party would pick her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a party to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean.  I mean it's not a party for kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you invite us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, I mean, I thought you would...\" Jamie was at a loss for words.  What could she say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then Kelsie could stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure.\"  Jamie was intrigued about Kelsie.  Jamie sort of thought that when she returned to normal that everything would be fine with her.  Jamie was dying to know.  Maybe she was depressed for another reason.  Not for what she had done.  But that could wait, Jamie had to swap ages of Anna and Becky.  Jamie saw Becky enjoying herself in the party and then swapped Anna's age with hers.  After the swap, Becky found herself with a bunch of people much older than herself and began to feel self conscious.  She spotted Audrey and Kelsie and instinctively joined the people at the party who were her age.  All was going smoothly at least for the moment until...</span></div></div>",

The 11 year olds, Anna and Lauren were all who were left, and they looked unsure of whether they should go too or not.  Meanwhile Jamie looked heartbroken that Jeff would just ditch so easily like that, and take the party somewhere else without even a goodbye.  They were in a relationship weren't they?  Did he even care about his girlfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie suddenly felt an unprovoked flood of tears start to leak out, and she hid her face with one arm.  \"Dammit!  Dad this was supposed to be a small thing but... Jeff and... I don't know, they figured it was a party and invited a bunch...  Look I don't even care about it anymore, I'll be in my room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Jamie get back here!\"  Nick called out to his daughter, but she just stormed upstairs, ignoring him.  Heather put her hand on his shoulder and shook her head, hinting that he should leave it be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining people watched quietly as Jamie quickly retreated upstairs.  Audrey and her friends Becky and Kelsie, all looked at each other and shrugged.  Audrey stood up and went up to her dad, \"Since everyone else is leaving, can we head over to Kelsie's house tonight?  I'm really not even sure why Jamie decided to have a party on the same day we were all supposed to play here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick had his hand on his forehead, and simply waved them off, \"Sure fine, just as long as it's not here...  Make sure you get back before dinner at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather approached Anna and Lauren, the only two of Jamie's friends who had stuck around, they stood near the front door, quietly discussing what they should do.  Heather quietly told them, \"I don't know what is going on here, but Jamie's dad is just really upset right now and it's probably best if you two come back another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lauren stepped forward, \"But... Look around, the party is gone, we weren't even here for a party.  Jamie just told us it'd be a small little get together.  Our best friend is up there crying her eyes out right now, I think we should go talk to her at least... With your permission Mrs Barrett.\"</span></div></div>",

Both Lauren and Anna sat on Jamie's bed to comfort her.  They patted her shoulder and rubbed her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, Honey, It'll be all right,\" Anna said.  She knew she had to say something although no words would help very much.  Jamie continued to cry.  Her friends continued to soothe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought he loved me,\" Jamie said weeping.  The betrayal of Jeff hurt Jamie so hard because she felt like she had been in a relationship with him for several months, when in reality she had been in a relationship for about a day.  Alicia wasn't as strong willed as Jamie was.  She was so happy to have a boyfriend that she put up with all the shananagins that Jamie just couldn't live with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what Jeff did Alicia would eventually forgive him.  Sometimes, Jeff would convince Alicia that it was her fault.  But Jamie was a more secure person and so her sadness eventually changed to anger and then to rage.  But Jamie decided that unlike Alicia it was her fault.  Alicia thought that she loved Jeff, but that really wasn't the relationship at all.  The relationship wasn't really love, it was more like codependence.  Alicia needed a man her life to validate her own worth.  Jeff on the other hand was so self-centered that he felt like he deserved to have a girl.  Alicia would do anything that he said and never complain no matter how much he hurt her.  This relationship worked for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie shouldn't be in this relationship at all, it really belonged to Alicia and she was going to give it back to her.  This is what calmed her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna and Lauren saw that their concern was working and suggested they have some ice cream to brighten their spirits.  Dinner would be ready soon, but when Anna talked to Heather and explained what had happened, Heather relented about having ice cream so close to dinner.  Jamie was eighteen and it didn't really matter too much.  Little kids would eat ice cream all day, but that wasn't a problem with Jamie who wanted to keep her figure.  Lauren could eat as much as she liked, since she burned it off playing Volleyball.  Anna had to watch what she ate, but she would treat herself to a little ice cream too.  Soon the topic was changed from Jeff to the usual gossip and Jamie's spirits lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple days later, Jeff phoned Jamie.  He acted as if nothing had happened.  He didn't know how he had hurt her.  he was a self-centered creep as it turned out.  Jamie couldn't understand how someone could put up with a guy like this.  Jamie decided that if Alicia could put up with Jeff then she can have him back.  Alicia wouldn't even know that she had ever lost him in the first place.  Jamie did what she did before to get Jeff and looked through Alicia's Facebook posts to find out where she would be.  Jamie made sure to arrange not only for herself but Jeff to be there.  She wanted Jeff there when she gave him back to Alicia like an unwanted puppy.  This would make Jamie feel good.  It would feel like she could just give him away like he meant nothing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA time and a place was set and when Jeff and Jamie got there Alicia was there just as expected.  Jamie swapped her relationship with Jeff back to Alicia.  \"Good Riddens\" she thought.  Alicia being and insecure emotionally needy person, immediately found Jeff and snuggled protectively under his shoulder.  It looked sweet, but it was in reality a toxic relationship.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But that wasn't enough for Jamie.  She was still sour from the way she perceived Jeff treating her the night before, and wondered how his relationship with Alicia would fare if the roles were reversed.  With little hesitation, she swapped Jeff and Alicia's entire personalities.  Alicia was now a bit uncaring and self centered, and only was in a relationship with Jeff because she felt like it was a status symbol.  And Jeff now was very insecure about his identity, and felt that he needed a girlfriend like Alicia to validate himself socially with everyone around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't just their relationship that was changed, but their entire personalities.  Their clothing preferences, favorite foods, favorite movies, and the way they carried themselves and spoke, were all swapped with eachother.  Jeff now wore tight skinny jeans with rolled up cuffs above the ankles, and a pair of purple not so masculine sandals.  He wore a button up white shirt with the top two buttons undone, and nothing underneath, but no curves to provide any sort of cleavage that might look good with that outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia on the other hand was wearing loose cargo pants and sneakers, and a plain black T-Shirt over a tank top.  Her hair was a total mess, like she just rolled out of bed and didn't use a single product in it, despite it being as long as before.  On the other hand, Jeff's hair looked like he just got back from a salon, where it was trimmed and styled very meticulously.  He was a little flamboyant while his girlfriend just seemed like she didn't care about her appearance one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They're perfect for eachother, I guess.</i>  Jamie thought, as she decided to cut her losses.  Even with a swapped personality, the two of them seemed just fine in their toxic destructive relationship.  It was best to just leave them be before she got too crazy with more swapping...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Jamie picked up Anna on the way to school, and for the first time she was alone with her old friend from elementary school.  But Anna had no idea that she was just 11 years old the day before.  To her, she and Jamie were always the same age, and knew eachother for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a weird night last night, I can't believe so many people showed up.\"  Anna said from the passenger seat while Jamie drove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't supposed to be like that... But it wasn't a complete disaster, I guess.\"  Jamie sighed, remembering that her mission had at least been successful getting Anna up in age.  But was it worth it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, you seemed pretty distraught about it last night.  Something really got to you.  Do you still want to talk about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... someone there I kinda liked,\"  Jamie started, realizing that in this reality she hadn't been dating Jeff, but she still felt the emotions left over from what had happened.  \"They were being kinda a dick and it really upset me.  I... I think I'm completely over them now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, does Jamie have a crush?\"  Anna teased, trying to lighten the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!  Not anymore!  I'm a single lady now, no one can stop me!\"  Jamie proclaimed, feeling a bit better saying it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna smiled, \"Not for long I bet.  Lots of guys, and some girls even, would kill to get on a date with you I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally this would have been a nice thing to hear from a friend, but Jamie felt uncertain about that.  She still wasn't used to being this... popular.  She knew she could easily have the pick of anyone at the school by using the TSAR, but after Jeff, she wasn't sure that would ever end well.  No, if she was going to find romance, she would have to find the right person, and do it the hard way.  She didn't want another repeat of last night ever again.</span></div></div>",

She had a killer body, a cute face and had a refined fashion sense.  Jamie was proud of what she had done to Anna.  Anna skipped all those awkward teenaged years.  This reminded Jamie of Anna's 'sister' Billie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how's you sister?\" Jamie inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how little sisters are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she is at that boy crazy age.  She falls in love with boy after boy although she hardly dates any.  It's mostly in her head.  You know how it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.

She didn't have to commit to a relationship, but she could give him a date, sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, It's a date I guess,\"  Jamie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't act so excited, jeez!  Come on, it'll be fun!  Look, we should go to the mall today, and each get a new outfit.  I'm sure you have something you could wear already, but a new outfit will help you feel fresh and confident!  It's like a new you going on this date, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Jamie smile, \"Yeah, I do think a new outfit would help.  Maybe something to grab his attention huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're already thinking that far ahead?  Well if you insist, girl, but maybe take it slow as you get back into the dating world.  You don't want to get in over your head.\"  Anna advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie sighed, \"You're right... Maybe I need a second opinion on this outfit shopping thing... We should see if Lauren wants to come along?  She always seems busy when we go shopping, and I don't want her to feel left out, she's been a good friend to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nodded, as they pulled up to the school finally, 'It'll be good for that girl to get some new outfits herself, she always dresses so... conservatively, I don't know.  Always with the long skirts and never anything adventurous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool went by quickly, and the three girls all met at the mall as soon as they could get there.  They weren't sure if they could convince Lauren to come, but for once she seemed fine with coming along.  Jamie was glad that the girl was finally coming out of her shell, and wanting to spend more time with friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everyone, sorry I'm a little late...  You said we were going to go shopping?  What for?\"  Lauren asked nervously as she approached Anna and Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna smiled, \"Well... Jamie here has a blind-ish date, and she needs something to wear.  And you my girl are a fashion disaster, no offense.  So I figured I would treat you both to some shopping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie just rolled her eyes.  Lauren looked unsure, \"I mean... sorry my outfits aren't very good.  I know they're not.  I just... I never find anything that really suits me, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry!  This is all about improvement, so, let's find you both something nice!\"  Anna declared as she led the way inside, making a beeline straight to the dress section.  Anna had a great sense of style, and knew just what to look for.  \"So, Jamie, I know you want to dress to impress, but let me tell you that on a first date you don't want to go too overboard, alright?  You don't want guys to get the wrong impression of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie chuckled, \"Sure, I guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna continued, \"And Lauren, you were on a date recently right?  What did you wear to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Lauren looked up in deep thought, \"It was a long maxi skirt I think.  Really comfortable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm... mhm... Right, but you know people can't even see your ankles when you wear that, right?  Let alone your knees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I know that I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! So what's the harm in wearing something like this?\"  Anna said as she pulled a cute white and purple flowery dress off a rack, and held it up to Lauren.  The hem came down to several inches above the knees, still completely tasteful as far as Anna was concerned.  \"I mean, you are going to have to start shaving your legs if you want to wear this out, but believe me it's worth it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren frowned at the dress, \"I... already do shave my legs, come on Anna.  I'm not that clueless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!  Then you'll have no problem looking amazing in this, go on, try it out!\"  Anna handed her the dress and motioned for her to head to the changing rooms.  She was enjoying this way too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie watched all of that with amusement, and enjoyed seeing Lauren awkwardly scamper off towards the changing room.  But finally her attention was snapped away when Anna pulled her by the hand to another rack of dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jamie, you have a big date coming up, and you want to impress him, but you don't want to look too easy.  It's a fine line, trust me.\"  Anna rifled through the dresses looking for something suitable.  \"What's your favorite color, what do you look good in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie gave it a good thought, \"Well red is pretty nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, red is too flashy for a first date...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about purple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren just got a purple dress, come on!  Be original!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting frustrated now, \"Well what else do you want me to say those are my favorite colors!  What about black?  Black is always a good color for dresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna rolled her eyes, \"Sure, if you want to be lazy about it, I guess black is nice...\"  She stopped to give Jamie a quick look from head to toe.  \"You know... with your blonde hair I want to say blue.  Yeah, it will match perfectly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But blue's a boy's color!\"  Jamie protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, really?  You really need to grow up\u2026  It's a dress.  In no way does that imply 'boy color'.  Besides it's the 21st century, we can wear whatever color we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie shrugged as Anna finally picked out a dress and handed it to her.  It was a light blue, almost cyan, and was very different from how Jamie expected.  She sighed and decided to trust Anna's judgement, and hurried to the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stripped down to her panties, and took off her bra because it would definitely show underneath this dress.  Quickly and easily she slipped into the dress and it fit perfectly.  Her toned waist was just narrow enough to not feel constricted, and her bust was only slightly too big for the ruched and wrinkled chest area.  The dress was held up by thin string straps which wrapped around the back of her neck, and left her shoulders completely bare.  She could see a modest amount of cleavage, just enough to catch someone's eye, but not enough to keep them staring non-stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie grinned at herself in the mirror, liking how the color contrasted with her blonde hair.  She had to admit\u2026 Anna was right.  The hem of the skirt was just the right length, but she worried that with heels it might be a little too short.  Which was a problem, because a dress like this would look awful when combined with flats\u2026  But for now, she walked out of the dressing room barefoot, to go see what Lauren's dress looked like, and to see what they thought of this!</span></div></div>",

This isn't the time or place to talk about this!

You're right. I shouldn't talk about that so openly in public.  Just keep what I said in mind, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren folded her arms, almost looking cute despite her annoyed expression.  And it didn't help that the dress she wore made her look even more adorable to Jamie.  She couldn't take Lauren's frustration seriously anymore, and just smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Anna came walking out of the dressing room, in a black dress which hugged her hips and rear tightly, forming to her curves but flaring out near the hem to give it a more retro look.  The color black really went well with her dark tan skin color, giving her skin a bit of a shine in contrast to the dark material.  And the top of the dress had a plunging neckline that went so low as to even show a bit of underboob in the cleavage.  Anna looked confident as fuck in this dress, and Jamie was simply speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...  Anna, you're wearing THAT to the date?  You told me it wasn't good to overdo it on the first date...\"  Jamie said, her eyes constantly being drawn towards Anna's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but this isn't my first date with Scott, so I get to have some fun.\"  She said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren seemed impressed as well, and seemed to forget all about being annoyed at Jamie suddenly.  But that quickly turned to envy, as Lauren dearly wished she looked that good in a short dress and didn't have to worry about anything slipping out.  \"It's incredible Anna, you look beautiful in it, but how come yours is so much nicer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna laughed, \"Cause I'm paying, duh!  I'm picking up the tab for everyone, it's my treat.  Maybe next time you can buy me something cute, and get yourself something tight and sexy.  I mean, if that's your thing, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was sure Anna was just teasing Lauren about the tight and sexy thing, but it occured to her that maybe Anna wasn't aware of Lauren's secret after all?  She was still trying to figure out Anna's social standing among her friends, ever since she became 18, but if Lauren never told Anna, then maybe they weren't as close friends as she was with Jamie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you so much for buying me this, I really don't mean to sound ungrateful, it's actually quite cute...\"  Lauren backtracked fairly quickly upon learning it was free.  \"Besides, I wouldn't look good in the dress you have anyway, this is better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie nodded, \"You look just fine Lauren, don't sweat it!  And thanks again Anna, both for setting me up with this Casey, and for the dress, you're amazing as usual!\"</span></div></div>",

Yesterday Anna was a little eleven  year old girl and today she not only was arranging double dates but she was treating everyone to dresses.  Where did she get all this money?  How did she get dates so quickly?  Anna was a very friendly girl at an eleven year old and as an adult she was equally as popular.  Jamie tried to think about what she knew about Anna.  Not the old stuff when she was eleven but in this TSAR changed world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly Jamie realized that Anna was one of the most popular girls at school.  She was even more popular than Kim who is a star athlete.  Anna was involved in several clubs.  She ran the bio and geo-scence club.  She was part of the global navigators club.  She was asked to be a cheerleader but she turned that down because she didn't have time.  She of course was part of Arista and was on the ping pong team.   She was vice-president in student government was working on a project that would be submitted to the Intel Science Talent Search.  She was making money through her on-line blog too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone knew Anna and Anna seemed to know everyone.  But with all that Jamie was proud that Anna was still her friend.  Jamie wondered for a moment whether Anna would be just as successful if she had aged 'the normal way.'  Or if Anna and her would be as good friends if Anna was actually born seven years before she had been.  But that didn't matter, Anna was her friend and she was successful and Jamie thought it couldn't have happened to a nicer person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, I just wanted to say I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean it.  I treasure your friendship.  I just wanted you to hear the words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut that out,\"  Anna said with a smile.  \"You are going to make me blush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love when you blush too.\"  Which caused Anna to actually blush as she said she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break it up you two,\" Lauren said breaking the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\" Jamie said.  The three girls hugged each other in the store in a very warm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey let's get home.  We have dates to prepare for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not me,\" Lauren said half jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry.  I have a guy for you too,  He's perfect for you.\" Anna said.  Anna did know everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you later.  Tonight is for Jamie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Anna was just so conveniently on top of everything, she couldn't have thought that far ahead could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anna, you know, so Lauren doesn't feel left out, why don't we make it a triple date tomorrow night?  You have a date for her right?  So it should be no problem to see if he can come too.\"  Jamie pointed out to Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Anna looked caught off guard but went into thinking mode.  \"Yeah, it might work, depends on if he can change his plans last minute, but I'm sure I can convince him.  For a girl like Lauren most guys would, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked embarrassed, \"Oh come on, if they really knew me, they wouldn't bother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren,\" Jamie sighed, \"You just have to find the right one, don't get so down on yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter discussing boys for a while longer, the night was already late, and the three girls split up and went back home to get ready for the next day.  Jamie gave her new dress a quick wash and iron just to make sure it was as fresh as possible for tomorrow.  And she spent the rest of the night getting freshly shaved and exfoliated.  She wasn't sure why she was preparing so hard for a date with a guy she'd never met before, but first impressions should always be good, she believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile getting ready for bed, Jamie browsed her social media one last time as she always did, right before falling asleep.  She got onto Anna's Facebook and found this Casey guy that she was meant to date tomorrow.  It turns out he was already in Jamie's friends list, but as one of those 'friends' she'd never really talked to, but had merely friended just 'cause.  After studying his page for a few minutes, she decided that this might not be so bad.  He was nice looking and in shape, and seemed to have a lot of female friends who thought highly of him.  Now Jamie just wondered what kind of guy Lauren was going to get set up with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow was Friday night and date night, so Jamie tried to go to sleep on time, so she would be prepared...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Friday went by like a whirlwind, with Jamie running through her classes like she was on autopilot.  As soon as she got home, she spent the remaining time she had left, getting her hair just right, and putting the finishing touches on her makeup.  It wasn't long before it was time to pick up Anna and Lauren and the three of them would meet the three boys at the restaurant they were meeting up at.  Jamie wasn't quite sure where the evening would go after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she picked up Lauren, who was neatly cleaned up and looking very cute in her new dress.  She hadn't put in as much effort as Jamie had on her hair, but it was naturally straight and shiny, so it would certainly look just fine.  When Jamie complimented her appearance multiple times, Lauren just clammed up and got all embarrassed, avoiding eye contact with Jamie the entire ride to Anna's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna, of course, looked stunning.  Her short black dress and curly black hair blended in almost a sea of black, framing her expertly made-up face perfectly.  Jamie suspected she went to get a professional makeover because it was just too perfect.  Or maybe Anna just was that talented?  She certainly didn't look this hot on an average day at school, but of course, this was a date, and she surely wanted to look her absolute best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you all ready?\"  Anna asked as they pulled up to the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie shrugged, a little nervous, but mostly just wanting to get it over with.  \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was quiet, aside from a weak moan of confirmation.  She didn't sound all that excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright Laur?\"  Jamie asked, putting her hand on Lauren's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, just a lot of people going to be at this date thing huh?  6 of us..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighed, \"It's going to be ok hun, that's why we're going as a group, it's safer and more comfortable this way.  Just remember half of the people here are your friends, and the other half could be new friends very soon!  Don't worry about the rest of the people in the restaurant, tune them all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lauren seemed like she was psyched up enough, the three girls got out of the car and saw two boys standing outside the restaurant, looking around anxiously.  When they saw the three ladies approach, looking fabulous, they stood up straighter and adjusted their clothes to look more presentable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeyyyy Scott!  Good to see you again!\"  Anna called out as she met up with her date, giving him a friendly hug.  They seemed to be on familiar terms already.  Scott was well dressed and charming, and didn't seem nervous at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boy standing there looked much less prepared.  His shirt was untucked and a little wrinkled, and he wore jeans and sneakers like he'd just came straight from school.  He didn't look unattractive, but he also didn't look like he put much effort in either.  Standing next to the three ladies who'd all spent hours over the last few days, getting outfits and makeup prepared for their date, he looked like he was almost in rags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not... Casey?  He's not here?\"  Jamie asked, not recognizing this boy as her date.  She remembered Casey's facebook picture, and this was definitely not him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na, I'm Aaron, sorry it was kind of a last minute thing, I was asked to show up.  You both look incredible tonight, by the way.  I guess, you're Lauren huh?\"  He said, answering Jamie, and then turning to Lauren with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well at least he's attempting to be charming, even though his outfit doesn't reflect it.</i>  Jamie thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren nodded with a nervous smile, \"Yeah, that's me!  Nice to meet you Aaron.  Sorry Anna dragged you into this, it was kinda sprung it on me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool!  It looks like it worked out in the end, I can already tell this is going to be fun.  Oh yeah and Casey should be here any minute, we're just waiting for our table to be ready and then we can go inside.\"  Aaron told Lauren, and loud enough for Jamie to hear too.  But the boy was most definitely focused on charming Lauren, and she was slowly trying to break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if on cue, a car pulled up with a bright green paint job, and neon lights underneath, tricked out like some kind of street racer.  It parked and a guy casually got out and headed their way.  Jamie hadn't connected it yet, but slowly realized who this must be.  He wasn't dressed anything like his Facebook photo, but he still had the same blonde hair and charming look to him, despite the flashy clothes.  He wore a very clean looking blue blazer with the school's logo printed on the front, over a white T-shirt and slacks.  Everything looked carefully picked out and color coordinated.  For a second Jamie admired his appearance, but a part of her thought maybe he was trying a bit too hard with the whole flashy entrance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everyone!  I see everyone's got their dates already, very nice.  Oh, except you, my lovely Jamie.\"  Casey said with a smirk, taking her hand and lifting it, and giving a polite tilt of his head while maintaining eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie had no idea what he was doing, but this boy's confidence was quickly rubbing off on her.  \"Well, looks like I have my date now, Casey?  Nice to uh, officially meet you.  But I've seen you around already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  Well I've certain seen you around, many times.  Gotta say, you're probably the second most popular person in the school, it's hard not to see you around.  Not that it's a bad thing by any means.\"  Casey said with a shrug, letting her hand go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do know a lot of people, that's for sure.  Umm yeah.  So I guess our table is almost ready then?\"  Jamie wasn't sure how to respond to being called the 'second' most popular person in the school.  She wasn't sure who he was implying was the most popular, but it was an odd backhanded compliment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James was still changing during all of this, and still had some physical and mental changing to go. But he tried to bang on the TSAR to stop the changes. The buttons went back up, but he and Mrs. Tam were now in a weird \"in-between changes\" state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, he continued to make changes. He didn't want to give back his lady parts yet, but since he knew the special interests and cooking knowledge and such wasn't his, he had no desire to retain them and promptly gave them back. He wasn't aware that his sexuality had changed however; he retained some attraction to women as the change in sex drive hadn't fully completed. He also liked having her clothes, because it fit his current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames also went to look at Mrs. Tam, who hastily switched over from the porn site, to see what the case was on identification. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi there James!\" She said. Surprisingly, the identification hadn't quite switched despite their appearances near completely having been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mrs. T! Nice look you've got there!\" James chuckled to himself a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks very much! Same to you! Lauren's very lucky to have someone like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, please don't say that.\" James thought about getting his rocks off already, and surely enough Mrs. Tam was having similar thoughts while her hormonal teenage body was totally there. James thought to himself \"Should I really masturbate in another person's bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tam was thinking \"All right as soon as he's out of this room, I go memorize some lesbian porn and head off to the bathroom!\" James considered if he should still swap identities, and conveniently enough, Lauren walked right into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James! Are you going to come back to this game or what? Also, Mom, where's dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tam begrudgingly went to the kitchen without questioning the early existence of some of the meal preparation and went to work on the dinner, postponing the wished wank for a later time. This gave James the bathroom time he needed, but before he went, he pondered any last swaps before beating the meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not playing the game anymore! I need to, uh, go to the bathroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames swapped his clothes with Mrs. Tam so that he could access Mrs. Tam's wardrobe within the Tam residence and hide some female clothing under his regular clothes. He immediately left to the Tam parents' bedroom and opened up the master wardrobe. He went for underwear and bras as a \"starting point\". He picked a simple lingeraie combo. There was also a box of sex toys in there. James picked up a dildo and took it with him without realising the homoerotic nature of it, having been turned bi by the TSAR. James quickly undressed and slid the lingeraie on, managing to quite impressively put the bra on despite not even retaining the knowledge of how to do so from Mrs. Tam. With no place to inconspiciously place the dildo, in a quick hurry, James put it down his panties.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was who he was thinking about by the time he had an orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames decided that one orgasm was enough.  He couldn't spend all day in the bathroom.  He justified the thoughts about Mr. Tam not that his sexual desires had changed, but simply he had a woman's body so he needed to think of a man to use it properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of the bathroom he rejoined Lauren.  They played the video game for a while, but James was still intrigued about the slow change he had just went through.  He wondered what it would be like to watch someone else go through a slow change like that.  So he decided to swap Lauren with her father.  He set the TSAR to make the change although he decided to make it go faster, say at twice the speed it took him.  He wanted to watch her change right in front of his eyes.</span></div></div>",
