She was now playing host to the parasite, an unruly mop of demonic hair with incredible power. With no memories or anyone to turn to for help, wanting to piece together her forgotten past and survive the inevitable clash with the Skullgirl, Filia needed to trust this mysterious being... and his monstrous appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night Filia was sitting in a diner, enjoying a milkshake she ordered. \"Ah you done yet toots? I'm getting bored!\" whispered Samson loudly as he could underneath Filia's hat. Filia was trying to a keep a low profile as her new-found friend seemed to always get them into trouble. Suddenly Filia was approached by someone near the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well... what have we here? What say I buy you a real drink, sister?\" said the man who started rubbing Filia's left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're already got a drink, thanks,\" Samson answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... that's quite the deep voice you've got there, little lady-\" before he could finish Samson shot out from the hat and immediately flung the man away far across the diner. Everyone inside the place started to panic and flee, leaving Filia and Samson alone in the diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samson... You've got to stop doing that. You're drawing too much attention to us!\" Filia said gloomily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, that creep was asking for it, no one lays a hand on my hos-HEY! ALL YOU CAN EAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombining his strength and powers, Samson lifted Filia over onto the other side of the counter, and started pulling out all the cakes, pastries and the barrels of milk/drinks underneath and began wolfing and guzzling them down in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilia could only sigh as she knew she wouldn't be able to stop his feast frenzies and what they were doing to her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Samson was done with the food, he ripped off the lid of the milk barrel and poured the whole thing into his mouth. While this was happening Filia began to slowly fill up. Soon her slightly pudgy belly began expand out and hang as it filled up like a water balloon. When Samson was finished with the barrel, he threw it away and lipped his mouth. \"Aaaaahhhh... that hit the spot,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you're <b>*UUURRRPPP*</b> telling me,\" said Filia who was poking her bloated stomach, as it jiggled like jello.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

Her body is getting restless... Though, she does seem well fed... What could she be eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the body was getting a bit soft, a very noticeable muffintop had formed, which it's hands seemed to ashamedly fondle, as every few hours it's size seemed to increase.

No one said you could stop eating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bluis green haired lady with a star mark on her cheek and a getup that looked like it was made for a preformance was tapping the cheek of a feline girl's severed head, just gently enough not to slap the food out of her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm-*COUGH* I'm sorry! *HACK* Maybe if a certain goon would-*COUGH* slow down a little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortune's head stood on a table, held down by the freakishly large arms of her captor's living hat as food was constantly shoved into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more than some random thug!

She alost started choking again, but managed to chew and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"from what you've told me in our last encounter, your body is now the physical embodiment of the life gem. The same gem you STOLE from the Medici family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the encounter where I gave you the PURRRfect beating~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer terrible pun was rewarded with another fish for her throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing as you defeated the Skullgirl for us, saving us a lot of trouble and lives, I decided instead of squeezing the gem out of your body-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to have dreams!\"<br>\r\nand another fish<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to take your head so I can turn your body into the perfect trophy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your plan is to fatten me enough so that even you could FELINE-ally beat me?

Three days of nothing but being shoved in your face, and not even cooked, her appetite was starting to wear thin. She never imagined she'd ever have to have the thought of throwing up fish, but she seriously started to feel a bit queezy. The rate at which they were forced into her mouth didn't exactly help either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no more fish... I... think I might h... hurl...!

The catgirl has to stomach whatever goes into her mouth, and what better option than to feed her her favorite meal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\" Fortune said in disbelief at her torturer showing some sort of sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your stomach is clearly not getting used to the fish diet no matter what I do, and I especially don't want to clean up after any potential mess you make, so I'm deciding to lessen your punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And make it easier for you to make a fat cat out of me?

You should be happy I am giving you a choice on what to eat.  Even executioners let death row inmates decide what their last meal should be before they die, except you can't die in your case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, give me the VIP treatment.  How about giving me an embroidered cat-bed for my weary head to rest on while you're at it?\" Fortune reluctantly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see we could agree on something, surprisingly,\" Cerebella said, \"Now let me ask you again: What DO you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortune, out of disregard of thought to piss off Cerebella, blurted out the most cliched cat-related food she could think of:</span></div></div>",

The usual hustle and bustle of humans of ferals all heading from one place to another was running along at a steady pace as the sun continued to rise high in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for someone like Nadia Fortune, or Ms. Fortune to those that had only connected with her claws, a Tuesday morning was usually spent constructively. Of course, in her vocabulary the word \"constructive\" usually meant something along the lines of either taking a stroll around town or \"taking a well deserved cat nap\" as she liked to call it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she would have been perfectly fine to sleep in all day for now since the Skullgirl had was no longer a threat, and the Medicis were currently posing no threat as of late funnily enough, but the sunlight peeking through her windows was starting to make staying under the thick covers a bit too uncomfortable for her liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a futile attempt to hide under her pillow from the sunlight, she let out a sigh of defeat and wormed her way out from under the covers. After stepping onto the floor she let out a yawn and drowsily rubbed her eyes before beginning to stretch her back. (After all, she was a feline feral, and even though she didn't like to admit to it most of the time, her cat-like nature sometimes impacted the way she acted more often than she thought.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was a pawsitively delightful sleep! Too bad the sun had to go and ruin it...\" she muttered, a little annoyed at the prospect of having to wake up. \"Guess it wouldn't be good to miss lunch though! I remember Yu-Wan saying he was gonna make my favori-\" she stopped herself as she suddenly felt a strange sensation in her stomach at the prospect of eating lunch. She was puzzled by this at first, but waved it off as it left as quickly as it came. \"Huh, guess I was just finishing digesting dinner from yester- oh boy...\" she found herself sprinting to the bathroom as a sudden wave of nausea overtook her and her hands leapt up to cover her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her she managed to make to the bathroom before anything came up, but the next couple of minutes for her were spent hunched over the toilet having a miserable time. After she spent a little more time hugging the toilet she heard a knock on the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nadia? Are you alright in there?\" The feral woman swiveled her ears as an anxious voice called out to her from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Minette...\" Ms. Fortune groaned weakly, \"I think I'm good now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? You don't sound so good...\" Ms. Fortune sighed softly and couldn't help but smile despite the horrible knot in her stomach at her friend's concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...just give me another minute and I'll be down for lunch Minette.\" She called out reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alright if you're sure then.\" Ms. Fortune listened as she heard foot-steps grow softer as they left the vicinity and shakily grabbed the sink counter in order to pull herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...what a Cat-astrophic start to a purrrrfectly good day...\" she grimaced as she looked in the mirror, an obvious case of bed-head adorned her hair and the earlier bout of nausea left her pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where the heck did that even come from?</i> The thief thought to herself as she began to groom herself, <i>it can't have been from food poisoning of any sort since I always eat here at Yu-Wan's and he always makes sure to cook his food properly...</i> She thought about it as she continued the morning routine of taking a shower and brushing her teeth twice, the smell of vomit on one's breath is pretty potent after all, and after all was said and done she decided to dismiss it as a freak occurrence since during her shower the feeling in her stomach had left as quietly as it had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed  in her usual outfit, she walked out of her room and headed down the stairs to the main part of the restaurant. Since it was a Tuesday afternoon the number of customers in the diner was at the bare minimum since at around 2:00 the lunch rush had already petered out and everyone had already headed back to their respective jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, despite this Minette was still busy taking orders from the few customers that were there while wiping down tables and sweeping the floor. Yu-Wan himself was also present, though he was manning his usual spot in the kitchen, simultaneously cooking while taking inventory while the lull in business was present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afternoon guys!\" Ms. Fortune called out. \"How's business today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been pretty good Nadia!\" Yu-Wan called back with a hearty chuckle, \"though you missed the most of it while napping straight through breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, sorry about that Yu-Wan...\" She said while sheepishly scratching her head. \"I guess time got away from me. Though I <i>am</i> pretty hungry since I did skip breakfast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew without even looking that the restaurant owner had rolled his eyes and smirked at her not-so-subtle plea for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I did happen to make an extra order here today by mistake...\" she heard him reply teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well even if it's a mistake I think it'd be a cat-tastrophe to just let it go to waste...right Minette?\" Ms. Fortune gave the female Dagonian across the room a hopeful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...what?\" Minette looked up from the order she was taking and gave her friend an apologetic look, \"sorry Nadia I was busy here, what'd you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh forget it.\" The feral huffed as she heard a laugh echo from the kitchen. However, though she'd lost the small little battle of persuasion she was happy to find that Yu-Wan still gave her the free lunch anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the food was set down in front of her she felt a hungry grin develop on her face as she let out a pleased purr after only <i>smelling</i> the delectable meal. After a few moments of gazing at her lunch an audible growl from her stomach told her to hop to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Wan could only shake his head and chuckle as he heard Ms. Fortune utter a murmur of thanks from somewhere in between her second or third mouthful of food, and made a note to make sure not to let her skip breakfast ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinette on the other hand was a bit worried for her friend. Though of course worrying about the ones close to her was a fairly normal occurrence for her, she thought back to how she'd heard the disturbing sounds of what sounded like vomiting coming from her friends room this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Nadia?\" She nervously squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, whurt's urp M-nerte?\" The young dagonian woman girl had to stifle a laugh as her friend turned toward her with a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's just I'm not sure if it's alright if you should be eating like that since this morning well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinette couldn't help but trail off as her friend swallowed the huge amount of food in her mouth and let out a small belch of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that hit the spot!\" Ms. Fortune exclaimed before turning towards her, \"don't you worry about it Minette I'm feeling way better now than I was earlier, besides, it was probably a hairball that brought up a lot more with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinette cringed at the choice of words, \"Um, yeah I guess that's one way to put it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is!\" Ms. Fortune purred as she finished the last bite of her lunch before getting up, \"well anyways, I'm going back to bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bed?!?\" Minette parroted incredulously while waving her arms, \"but you just slept all morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I got nothin' to do today Minette, so until I do there isn't much else to do. Welp, night guys!\" Ms. Fortune gave a small wave to both dagonians before heading back up to sleep. She hadn't told Minette this, but she'd been feeling unusually tired for the entire day, which for someone of her lifestyle was quite odd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eh I'll probably be out of this weird thing by tomorrow.</i> She thought to herself before getting settled in for bed once again. As she drifted off to sleep however, her instincts still made her wary that something was off, but she decided that she would face it when it came and curled up before finally letting sleep overtake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the sun stealthily rose up in the early hours of the morning Nadia Fortune felt her eyes flutter open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...what time is it?\" She wondered while letting out a huge yawn. Sluggishly rolling over to the nearby nightstand she reached around for her clock and squinted at it for a moment before recoiling with a light hiss of disapproval. \"Eight-O'-clock in the morning? No way I'm getting up right now!\" She huffed and curled up underneath her covers once again, but try as she might she just couldn't fall back asleep for some reason. She growled in annoyance before getting lethargically crawling over to the bathroom to at least try to start her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a slightly longer time of almost falling asleep in the shower, she almost fell asleep in the tub a few times after all, she stepped out onto the rug waiting for her and started to get dressed in her usual attire. However, as she looked at herself in the mirror she recoiled and let out a small gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Uh...either I've let myself go a little bit or my metabolism is starting to slip...</i> she thought to herself as she looked at her stomach. Now by no means was it large enough to be called a pot belly, but in comparison to her normally lithe figure the fact that it was now at even with her ribs was a bit alarming to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...maybe I bit off a little more than I could chew yesterday with lunch?\" She wondered as she brought a finger to her belly and poked it, only to bring it back immediately as there was no give to it like she was expecting it to have. Instead of the squish she knew most people should have had on their stomachs it was completely firm. \"Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat-like heroine had no feasible explanation for this. Eventually after running through different reasons in her mind she shrugged and figured that maybe she was getting worked up over nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's not like anybody'll really notice anyways...\" She muttered with a frown. However, whether she cared to admit it or not she felt like something was very wrong, but she stubbornly reassured herself that perhaps the problem would resolve itself by tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her morning routine she went down stairs only and greeted Yu-Wan and Minette who were both attending to their usual duties. Ms. Fortune did order some food for breakfast fishing out a little of the cash she had on her. (After all her friends were still running a business and she would feel bad if she couldn't pay back all they'd done for her at least a little at a time.) Of course, this time she kept it light since she was still a little wary about her figure after earlier this morning, though if Minette or Yu-Wan had noticed they didn't comment on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quickly gobbling up her meal she decided to go outside for the day and walk around for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after a few minutes of wandering that she decided to go for some exercise at the park. Luckily it looked as though not many people were there so she had free reign over what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she got into a good run she began to feel very drained after an unusually short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- *huff* H-how am I this tired a-already?\" She mumbled tiredly in between gulps of air. \"There's no way adding a little weight should get me this tired...\" She took a large swig of water from the bottle that she'd brought with her while finding a park bench to sit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of rest she got up and decided that a little fatigue wasn't going to best her, and continued to run and test her agility as much as she could. Fortunately, even though she was a bit shaky on some parts she managed to hang on for the rest of her workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, getting through the workout was only half the battle, as she quickly found out. Post-workout of course was a whole new animal ironically enough as she collapsed in a heap on the park bench, sweat running in rivers down her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo-boy!\" She huffed tiredly, \"what a rush! Knew I could still get through to ol-\" she stopped mid sentence and emitted an enormous yawn, finally feeling the effects of adrenaline wearing off. \"Huh, I guess that left me pretty beat...guess a little cat nap wouldn't hurt...\" she murmured before stretching back into a comfy position on her bench and dozed off...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well well well, didn't expect to find <i>you</i> of all people taking a nap somewhere out in the open like this.\" A voice brought Ms. Fortune back to the land of the living as she blearily opened her eyes, squinting at first at the large form in front of her. Funnily enough it was an acquaintance she'd only recently met through a detective that had been working to solve the kidnapping of Minette earlier in the year. As her vision began to come back into focus she confirmed that standing there in his usual worn trenchcoat and battered yet classy hat with an eyebrow raised in curiosity that the person, or rather augmented person was none other than Ben Birdland, known to most only as \"Big Band.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could say the same about you tin man,\" She playfully shot back, \"not often I find someone in your line of work in a park during the daytime, unless you're here to take me in?\" Big Band chuckled at this and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know perfectly well that I've been out of the force for years kitty cat. Besides,\" he smirked, \"if I wanted to take you in I would've done so pretty easily based off our last scuffle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Ms. Fortune growled, though it was more in annoyance than genuine anger, \"just because of one time I bit off more than I could chew I never hear the end of it? Nya-ow that's what I call rude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be fair I wasn't the one who started the whole thing.\" He stated simply, causing the feline to scratch her head sheepishly and shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I might have been a little eager to start things, but in my defense I wasn't in the mood to deal with anyone suspicious after Minette got kidnapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I figured that much after you seemed a lot less riled up after Irvin explained everything,\" Big Band replied with a shrug of his shoulders, \"but hey, at least you guys figured everything out in the end.\" Then the serious look was replaced with a smile, \"well enough about old times, what's been goin' on around your alley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's been pretty boring lately to be purrrrfectly honest.\" Ms. Fortune sighed while stretching out with a light meow. \"No Medici's to take out and nothing to steal that's worthwhile at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it kind of shows too huh?\" Big Band teased with a light chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Nya-ow just what's that supposed to mean?\" Ms. Fortune hissed, giving him a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sayin' kitty cat that maybe you've been raidin' the pantry one too many times there.\" He said, while poking her exposed stomach for emphasis. However, he was a bit surprised at the firmness of the paunch that his furry friend had developed, but managed to hide his reaction well enough that she didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Now just because I've been out of work for a little bit doesn't mean that I've let myself go in anyway!\" She growled back while holding both hands over her stomach, only to hiss in recoil as she looked down and saw something very alarming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly had grown once again, and this time instead of giving her an average waistline, this time it clearly stood out in a small curve, though it wasn't really that noticeable from a distance, or even if she were to wear a full shirt that covered her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ok, this is definitely not normal at all. There's no way I could be getting that much of a belly this quick!</i> She thought fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you alright there hon'?\" Big Band asked tentatively, eliciting a slow shake of the head from the furry feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" was the only reply he received from the thief, who now looked very anxious about some problem unknown to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it was the crack I made about the whole weight thing I didn-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not that!\" Ms, Fortune snapped, scowling as she cut him off before taking a deep breath to calm herself down. \"Sorry Big Band, it's just that this,\" she prodded her distended abdomen, \"wasn't there a few days ago, and now I'm kind of worried that something is definitely wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...well were you feeling sick at all before it showed up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Ms. Fortune scratched her head in thought before a lightbulb lit in her brain, \"yeah...actually now that you mention it I was pretty sick about two days ago in the morning, but it passed really quickly and never showed up after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh...that's strange,</i> Big Band mused to himself, <i>the way she's describing it almost makes it sound like,</i> he shook his head dismissively, <i>nah that can't be it, there's no way she'd be showing this early with signs like that, and with her lifestyle she doesn't seem like the family type anyways.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Earth to tin man!\" Ms. Fortune yelled, knocking Big Band out of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry kitty, just thinking about what might be ailing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you think it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have a theory...\" Ms Fortune perked up at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty far fetched, and I don't like being wrong with things like this. So I'd like to at least get a doctor's opinion on this.\" Ms. Fortune groaned at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww c'mon I hate going to the doctor! They always give you shots and I've never gotten candy out of any visits ever!\" The aging detective snorted in amusement at her small tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna find a cure for what you've got or not?\" He asked her, offering an ultimatum. The cat-burglar pondered this for a moment before finally sighing and following her new companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I swear if I don't at least get dinner out of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fighters walked from morning until sunset, only stopping once to eat at a small diner before they finally arrived at a building that looked as if it had seen better days, but was clearly still being maintained as signs of repair on the doors and windows were shown. Once Big Band let them inside Ms. Fortune looked around in awe at the technology around her. Many different screens were lit up and flickered in many shades of white and blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the newly renovated Lab 8 kitty cat!\" Big Band said, gesturing to the area that surrounded them with a mechanical claw, \"It's still a work in progress, but we'll be able to at least crash here until tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, where is everybody? I thought more people would at least be running a lab as big as this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, right now everyone has odd jobs to at least help pay for repairs. I track down the materials we need to get this place up and running though, since not many people are gonna hire someone like me.\" He explained with a tired grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So no one else is here right now then?\" The feline asked curiously, before grinning, \"so that means I get to mess around with all this stuff right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" Big Band shook his head and picked her up by the tail just as she had begun to leap towards the nearest computer. \"That's pretty sensitive equipment and the researchers here don't take too kindly to anyone messin' around with their gadgets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no fun.\" Ms. Fortune said with a huff as he dropped her back on the ground unceremoniously. \"Besides, it's not like there's anyone else here to yell at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually there is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say old man is that you?\" A childish voice rang out from behind the two, cutting off the cyborg. \"I hope you got some grub from out there, I'm starv- what the what!\" Turning towards the source of the voice, Ms. Fortune was surprised to find that the owner of the voice was none other than Peacock, a child who had been mechanically altered in the same manner as Big Band, though her abilities that she used were more...eccentric. \"Saaaay what's the furball doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too Tiny Toon.\" Ms. Fortune teased as she stuck out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I oughta-\" Peacock pulled a pie from her sleeve and was about to throw it at Ms. Fortune, before she could however, Big Band deftly smacked the out of her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peacock! Manners!\" He warned with a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw c'mon, but you know I'm nothing like that rabbit and the duck on that show, and she called me short!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't mean you have to throw your pie at em' like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw fine! You win!\" Peacock said, waving a white flag in resignation. \"Anyways, you never did explain why she's here though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, we happened to meet up and catch up on old times, time flew by and I let her crash here for the night.\" The older man explained briefly, knowing quite well that too much detail would bore Peacock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, is that so? Ah well none a' my business\" The child said before heading back to her room. \"Anyways, if you need me I'm gonna be watchin' t.v. in my room old man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not even in my fif-\" Big Band tried to protest before he heard a door slam, \"that kid...sometimes I just can't get a word in edgewise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she does have the ability to teleport in and out of places, so purrsonally I think you should be glad that she takes the time to at least talk to you at all.\" Ms. Fortune pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" Big Band rubbed his chin in thought, \"you do have a point there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, it's getting pretty late big guy, so I'm gonna hit the hay,\" Ms. Fortune yawned tiredly, \"see ya in the morning\" she mumbled before she began to snore softly. Big Band looked around before shrugging and trudging off to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was gonna offer her my old bed but I guess if she's comfortable.\" He said to himself. \"Just hope we can figure all this out soon, especially if my first intuition was actually right...\" He pondered that for a few moments, before he reached his room and sat in his personal chair, the only one that was custom built for his large frame. At first he wondered if he would actually be able to sleep, but soon enough he felt his eyes beginning to close and shifted slightly as he drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Or rather, to feel a deep romantic or sexual attachment towards someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to the host of the ancient skeletal Parasite Sekhmet, Eliza... The feeling was quite nostalgis, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as continued to relax herself within her lavish bathhouse and place of residence, The Bath of Tefnut, Eliza's thoughts kept referring back to that girl she was entranced by at one of the usual nightclubs she performs at. In appearance, the young girl Eliza met was approximately in her early 20s, had long wavy red hair, an attractive curvaceous body, and a stunning pair of beautifully golden hazel eyes. To Eliza, it was as if she was seeing her old lover from the ancient past reincarnated into the modern era. However, when Eliza used her charismatic charm to allure the young woman, known as Camilla, to her bathhouse for some \"privacy\", Camilla stopped Eliza  dead in her tracks when she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I appreciate your generous offer, Eliza. But...the truth is...I happen to be into \"larger\" women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, this left Eliza in a completely dumbfounded state, as she rubbed moisturizing soap along her right leg, then dunking said leg back into the warm water to rinse it off. \"...Hmph! Stupid Camilla. Who does she think she is? Trying to turn down a generous offer from me. From me!\" Eliza angrily scoffed, ranting a little about what Camilla had said to her back at the nightclub. And yet, despite being turned down by who she assumed was most likely her lover's reincarnation, the Parasite hostess easily couldn't stay mad at Camilla forever, as she then heard the audible footsteps of one of her loyal servants, financial advisor, and bodyguard, Horace, enter Eliza's private bathing chamber, carrying what appeared to be several magazines in his avian hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Eliza slowly exited out of the warm bath, wrapping her naked form in a soothing towelette. Now, as for why Horace was carrying several magazines to present to his immortal mistress, Eliza had to deduce what exactly Camilla had meant by \"larger women\", so she asked Horace to investigate this for her and report any findings to her immediately. \"...Well, what did you find out, Horace?\" Eliza asked, as she calmly approached the overweight anthropomorphic avian with a seductive sway in her step, just as Horace gently placed the small stack of magazines upon the limestone table before them, where Horace then turned toward Eliza to speak with her and replied, \"I've discovered what that Camilla woman was referring to, Mistress Eliza. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--But what, Horace?\" Eliza quipped, demanding to know what exactly the overweight avian servant was talking about. So, in response to his mistress's demands for answers, Horace exhaled a deep sigh and picked up the magazine on the top of the stack, displaying it to the immortal songstress and answered, \"...It's best...if you see this with your own eyes, My Lady.\" From there, Eliza swiftly grabbed the magazine out of Horace's talon fingers, where she then turned the magazine around to look at the front cover of the magazine. However, what brought such an expression of shock to the immortal woman's face was that...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
