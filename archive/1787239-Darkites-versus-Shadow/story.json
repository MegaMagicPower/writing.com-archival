Mavis also rides a dragon, who he calls, Nightmare and the dragon has the power to confuse and control its enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe settings begin in a Cathedral where Dark stood in front of an iconic structure of Jesus. Now, Dark wasn't worshiping the statue, but instead he was admiring its artwork and significance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow the people who made this really paid attention to detail,\" Dark thought, \"Hmm... another example of God's handy work through people.\" he smiled and then turned to walk out of the cathedral. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood on the sidewalk, relaxed and lifted his wings to his sides and flew off in the direction of a cave<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMavis was patroling around on his dragon, Nightmare high above the ground, planning the perfect invasion against the Shadows. However he needed to study the area to see the status of the Shadow warriors first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

We must leave.\" Nightmare growled in a deep voice. <br>\r\n\"Relax, it's probably just a sleeping crystal monster.\" Mavis replied while looking out into the Cave of Wonders where in the distance where he spotted Dark landing in front of the cave.<br>\r\nMavis: Look! A Shadow! <br>\r\nNightmare:(purring) Yes. Yes...

Trek could already tell what he and his dragon friend was planning... that wasn't to hard to figure out by the look they gave each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait for it. Trek told himself as he kept huddled behind a large rock. The brightness of the new day emerged the outside of the cave with so much intensity that he had to plan his attack on the inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited for Mavis's command before getting up, careful not to make a sound, and walked to the entrance of the cave where they resided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, let me fill you in on a few things... first of all, Trek was a shadow, yes, but he carried one thing that the others didn't. And that was the ability to shield his scent. Dark would always usually pick him when they went out 'hunting' as some would call it... being part human and part wolf, there was things about themselves that they still didn't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrek straddled the cave walls with his back. His eyes watched them. They were fixed on Dark in the distance... a nice distraction, Trek thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's give him a very nice welcome shall we.\" Mavis laughed and stood to his feet, Nightmare following quickly behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was his chance... it was now or never... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Surprise<br>\r\nLet me explain a little first.Trek was Mavis' assistant. Trek wasn't after Dark and didn't know about the invasion. However he wasn't supposed to come with him on the reconnaissance mission. When Mavis was sent on the mission he was only told to scan the area and return to base. He is a wolf that can change into a human, but still remains a wolf most of the time. <br>\r\nTrek had the ability to shield his scent because he was part human. This ability wasn't the reason why Dark couldn't sense him though. <br>\r\nMavis Knew he was there and decided to change plans. He knew that this could lead to severe consequences if his master found out, but decided to go forward with the new plan. However Mavis didn't know what he was about to witness when he entered the cave.<br>\r\nDark was in the cave looking for his arrows and power crystal. While he was looking he heard a small footstep in the distance. Dark turned around spread out his wings and prepared for a fight. <br>\r\nTrek saw Dark and jumped off the wall to let Dark know that it was him. Dark put his guard down. He said, \"Trek there is someone coming. Get behind me now!\" Trek dissappeared in the darkness. <br>\r\nMavis stepped in and slowly walked towards Dark. Dark spotted his power crystal and absorbed it. Mavis started to tranform. He started to grow spikes all over his body and began looking more like a crystal monster than a hedgehog. Mavis raised his arm a began firing spikes at Dark. <br>\r\nDark shot them with a laser from the power crystal and the crystals shattered. Mavis charged further into the cave. Dark shot a laser at Mavis, which would have burned him, but his spikes protected him. <br>\r\nNightmare came into the cave. He saw Dark and Mavis fighting. Nightmare was waiting for a command from Mavis, but Trek jumped from the ceiling and kicked the dragon in the face. Nightmare was surprised and reacted by blowing a blue ice ball. Trek pulled out a shield which he found in the cave and blocked the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?         </span></div></div>",

Trek tried to turn to see Mavis, but he was distracted by Nightmare which was in his fighting position. Trek knew that Mavis would attack him for disobeying orders. He also knew that Dark trusted him as a new Shadow. With all of this in mind Trek also knew that he was about to fight a powerful dragon. Trek knew that there was alot going on and it was going to get interesting.<br>\r\n Trek was fighting Nightmare. He was surprised that he found the shield in time to block the fire. He looked at Nightmare and prepared for another attack. Nightmare was watching Trek as he too was preparing for another attack. This staredown didn't take long as Trek saw the opportunity to attack. Trek jumped and rolled at Nightmare. Nightmare put his head down to block the attack since he knew his skull was like a shield. Trek saw this headbutt attempt and threw the shield at Nightmare. Nightmare saw the shield coming, but he couldn't move his heavy, armored head in time and was hit by the shield. Trek saw the shield get stuck in the dragon's head and followed up with his previous attack. Trek jumped toward the shield in an attempt to hammer it into the dragon's skull. <br>\r\n Nightmare saw Trek coming and knew that the sheild also had an advantage. He swung his head just as Trek was coming in for another blow. Trek missed but was thrown into the air by Nightmare. Nightmare roared and swung his head again. Trek was thrown off guard by this attack, but before he could react his was smacked by the hard metal shield. Trek was cut slightly and rolled on the ground. Nightmare wasn't trying to kill Trek, but was merely defending himself.<br>\r\n Nightmare saw Trek just laying on the ground and began moving toward a nearby tree. He managed to pry the shield out of his head using the tree and went to find Mavis.Nightmare's only injury was a cut from the shield.Trek on the other hand got up slowly and began walking the other way. Nightmare went inside of the cave and saw Dark and Mavis in thier same fighting positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Mavis was preparing to shoot a fireball at him when suddenly he heard someone else enter the cave. <br>\r\nThis someone wasn't Trek but it was a new character. This character was a purple hedgehog with a strange crystal in his forehead and a target like symbol on its fur. He walked in obviously aware of Dark and Mavis' presence in the cave. <br>\r\n He looked at the two and he wasn't looking too nice. His eyes were glowing red as well as his crystal and he carried a bow and some strange looking arrows. Dark and Mavis had already stopped their fighting because of the newbie's presence. <br>\r\nMavis said, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\nDark knew who it was because he had experienced this character before. He replied, \"This guy's name is Bullseye. He is a well known archer and assassin from the Eastern region where the rebels live. (they are a group that has banded together because they don't want to be apart of another group.)<br>\r\nMavis replied, \"I think I remember him.\"<br>\r\nBullseye looked at them with his glowing eyes and said, \"We meet again, Dark.\"<br>\r\nDark replied, \"Why are you here?
