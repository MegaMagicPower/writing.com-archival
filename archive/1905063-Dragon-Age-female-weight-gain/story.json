She was a more skilled warrior than the two of them put together, yet she had to stay in the castle like always. <i>I could kill every last darkspawn if they would just let me.</i> Elissa thought to herself as she munched on the sweet rolls she nabbed while getting her dog from the larder. It felt like all she did these days was eat and swing her sword at training dummies, strengthening her muscles while a thick layer of fat grew over them. She started up the stairs to her brother\u2019s room to give him a message from father, and at the same time she began eating the fifth to last sweet roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, here comes my daughter now, and what a supprise, she\u2019s stuffing her face again.\u201d Ellissa\u2019s cheeks turned red at her mother\u2019s remark. She quickly swallowed what was in her mouth and hid the rest behind her back, hoping her mother and the three with her didn\u2019t notice. Ever since she had started gaining weight, her mother would chide Elissa for every extra pound she put on, regardless of whether it was mucsle or fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh, Elissa, you will never get a husband if your belly is so big!\u201d</i> She had the gall to say to her once. As if she even wanted a husband. What was so great about them? What was so special about this stupid idiot here with his dumb face? <i>Okay, that\u2019s not fair, he\u2019s probably not stupid. And his face probably isn\u2019t dumb. It could be. I don\u2019t know.</i> Elissa couldn\u2019t help feeling a little testy that day, and her father refusing to acknowledge her as a warrior and not just a daughter was just tossing wood onto the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother introduced Elissa to the people she was no doubt bad mouthing her to a few moments ago. There was Lady something-or-other who was her mother\u2019s age that Elissa vaguely remembered, the Lady\u2019s son with the maybe stupid face, who Elissa\u2019s mother no doubt wanted to set her up with by the way she talked about him, and the woman\u2019s lady-in-waiting, Iona. The other two were probably nice people, but Elissa was not in much of a mood for <i>people</i> today, especially after having to deal with Nan and Barkspawn. Pretty girls like Iona, however, were a different matter entirely. She was always in the mood for pretty girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIona and Elissa talked again later in the castle study, but not before she sat through another tounge lashing from her mother. When they did get together they spoke of Iona\u2019s daughter, and her position as a lady-in-waiting. She didn\u2019t notice it before because her hair covered her ears, but when Elissa learned Iona was an Elf they had a polite and civilized conversation about Elves and how they were treated in Human society. There was also some definite flirting between the two, and when she felt she might get a yes out of her (or at least not too harsh of a no) Elissa asked Iona up to her room.</span></div></div>",

Instead they had a little family gathering in her brother\u2019s room. The subject of Elissa taking Iona to bed came up, as much as she tried to avoid it. Her mother and sister-in-law didn\u2019t approve, but Fergus congratulated her. Elissa could sometimes get jealous of her older brother, but he was so nice she couldn\u2019t be mad at him. By the time everyone went off to bed for the night, Elissa almost felt too tired for her night with Iona. That changed when she saw Iona sprawled out on her bed in nothing but her small clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiece by piece the slender Elf helped the plump noblewoman out of her armor, until she, too, was only in her bra and underwear, and those came off soon after. Elissa stood naked in front of Iona with an obvious blush on her face; this was her first night with a woman since she started putting on weight, and she was more than a little nervous. The way Iona looked her up and down gave her butterflies in her stomach. Was she having second thoughts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her fears were washed away, however, when Iona placed her hand on Iona\u2019s tubby gut and said, \u201cYou\u2019re even more beautiful than I thought.\u201d She then led Elissa to bed. They intertwined for a night of passion, with Iona taking a more assertive role than Elissa would have expected. The relatively small woman seemed especially interested in the areas Elissa\u2019s body that had become soft from her over eating instead of the parts of her hardened by her training. Having the beginnings of her second chin kissed, or her soft abdomen caressed was more pleasurable than Elissa could have imagined. By the end of their love making, Iona had shed new light on what Elissa thought of her added pudge, allowing her to think of it in a not so negative matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second round was out of the question, much as they both desired it, as Barkspawn decided to join them in bed. Elissa forced him to sleep at the foot of the bed, so at least they could cuddle together while they slept. However their time together was further interupted by the mabari when he began barking at the door in the middle of the night. Iona reluctantly got up to check what was causing the hound to act in such a way. When she opened the door, Iona was met by\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything else felt like it happened so fast. Iona hit the floor. So did Howe\u2019s men. The castle fell and everyone Elissa knew was dying, and she left her parents to die as a Grey Warden recruit, with only Fergus and Barkspawn being her only living family. The travel to Ostagar was long and quiet with few words spoken between Elissa and Duncan, the Grey Warden that had \u2018saved\u2019 her. She got to meet the King of Fereleden, and he swore to her that Howe would pay, and that she would be reunited with Fergus after the battle. It did little to help, but it was something. Duncan told her to get some rest, and maybe something to eat before her initiation before her left, which she did. Elise helped herself to plenty of food from around camp, and met the two other recruits, as well as a Junior Warden. All three nice, but Elissa was still in shock, and couldn\u2019t talk to them much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed in shock through the four\u2019s quest in the Korcari Wilds, after meeting two Witches of the Wilds, all the way up to when she went through the Joining, and then Elissa finally came back. She got the thrill of a battle she wanted! She killed Genlocks, Hemlocks, and an Emissary as she charged up the Tower of Ishal with the Junior Warden, Alistair and Barkspawn to light the beacon at the top! It would signal the armies, and she would have been an instrumental part in stoping a blight before it began! She felt unstoppable when she killed an Ogre with her great sword and lit the signal fire! Then Teyrn Loghain Mac Tir told his armies to retreat, and everyone started dying again. All becaus of another betrayal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she knew she was in a bed with a beautiful woman standing over her; one of the Witches she met in the Wilds. \u201cGood, you\u2019re awake.\u201d She said as Elissa sat up at the edge of the bed. She noticed she didn\u2019t have any clothes on, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother the other woman. \u201cYou should find all your wounds healed. There were many.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Elissa tried to talk but her mouth was to dry. The witch gave her a cup full of what Elissa assed was tea and began to drink it. It tasted wonderful and felt good flowing down her throat and into her belly. It was warm and filling; like thick soup broth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Elissa drinking the liquid, the witch the time to explain to her what happened. Elissa took the news better than if she had heard it before what happened to her family, but now\u2026well, she wasn\u2019t used to it, but it didn\u2019t make her want to curl up into a ball and cry. On the brighter side of things, both Alister and Barkspawn had also survived. Once she finally did finish the liquid, Elissa\u2019a voice had returned. \u201cThank you for taking care of me, and my friend, and my dog, Morrigan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Twas my mother who did most of the work, but you are welcome, none the less. \u2018Twould seem you also have some of the fat on your belly to thank as well. It stopped an arrow that would have otherwise been the end of you.\u201d Morrigan said, then poked her index finger into Elissa\u2019s tubby middle, causing the noble to blush. \u201cNow, get dressed and go outside, Mother wishes to speak with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElissa nodded, and began to put her armor back on, noting that it was a big more snug than when she previously wore it. Morrigan turned to attend a stove, and Elissa stepped outside the hutt, and was reunited with Barkspawn and Alistair, and met again with Flemeth. The three put together a plan (Barkspawn had little to offer on the subject) to gather an army, to stop both the Blight and Loghain. When Morrigan came out to ask Flemeth if they would be having guests for dinner, Flemeth offered to have Morrigan go with Elissa. At first Morrigan was reluctant, but eventually resigned to having to go with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, at least now we have someone other than me to cook now. Unless you like all your meals to taste like grey.\u201d Alistair jested as the four began their journey towards a town Morrigan suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan \u2018tsked\u2019 and rolled her eyes. \u201cI do know some recipes, if that is really how you want me to use my time.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She wouldn\u2019t say it, but Morrigan greatly preferred Elissa\u2019s cooking to her own. Even something simple like rabbit stew tasted better than anything she or her mother had ever made when prepared by the noble. Another thing she wouldn\u2019t admit to was that she had been helping herself to a few too many extra servings. The two Wardens would look to the dog when there was no food left in the morning, after all one lithe woman couldn\u2019t eat the whole batch. Though, lithe was not a word she could use to describe herself if she kept eating like she had been. While nowhere near as large as their leader, Morrigan was beginning to get a bit of a belly, but her choice of clothing kept it hidden for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLothering\u2014the town Morrigan had told the party about\u2014soon came into view as they walked down the Imperial Highway, with so shifty looking characters between them and the city. They presented themselves as toll collectors, but Elissa didn\u2019t buy it, and they switched from trying to swindle them to robbing Elissa and her party. Once the thugs were sufficiently beaten, Elissa asked their leader a few questions before forcing the bandits to turn over all they had stolen and leave. Apparently Loghain had been busy since Ostagar; declaring himself regent and blaming the Grey Wardens for the loss at Ostagar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there it is, Lothering. Pretty as painting.\u201d Alistair commented as they walked down a ramp off the Imperial Highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so, you\u2019ve finally decided to rejoin you us, have you? Falling on your blade in grief seemed like too much trouble, I take it.\u201d Morrigan said back, prompting Elissa to sigh. She\u2019d only known the two a short time and already Elissa could tell they would not be getting along better than absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlistair turned and glared at the witch. \u201cIs my being upset so hard for you to understand? Have you never lost someone important to you?\u201d He said spitefully. \u201cWhat would you do if your mother died?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore or after I stopped laughing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiiiight, very creepy, forget I asked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElissa cleared her throat to get the attention of her companions. If she didn\u2019t they probably would have kept going until the Darkspawn arrived. \u201cIf you two are done, I think it\u2019s about time we talk about where we\u2019ll go first\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlistair nodded and scratched his chin. \u201cRight. I think Flemeth suggested the best plan. Have you checked the old treaties?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did. And I think I\u2019ve got a good idea how to go about using them.\u201d Elissa said as she pulled out her map and showed it to her companions. \u201cWe have a treaty with the Circle of Magi, and of the three they\u2019re the closest. We pick up so mage and maybe Templar support then head south to Redcliff to get Eamon\u2019s support.\u201d Elissa explained, hoping that Alistair and Morrigan wouldn\u2019t disagree simply because it would mean they agreed on something. This quest would be one involving lots of travel, and as more time passed, Elissa found herself less and less fit for long journeys. Especially now that her thighs rubbed together as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, it\u2019s better than anything I could come up with.\u201d Alistair said simply after thinking it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan stared at him with disgust. \u201cDon\u2019t insult the poor woman; the dog could make a better plan than you. Hers required actual thought and planing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself, Elissa shook her head. To think she actually wanted to go on an adventure like this back before this had all started.</span></div></div>",

They had returned to their ancestral home, and sat in the lap of luxury. What\u2019s more, Gianna Hawke could also use the money she had earned as a shield to protect her \u2018precious baby sister bird\u2019, Bethany, from the prying eyes of Templars that would have the Mage placed in the Circle. If not worse for her long years of apostasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGianna had always been extremely protective of Bethany, but ever since the death of Carver, the redhead rouge hardly ever let her sister out of her sight. Of course Bethany understood; Gianna placed the sole blame of his death on herself, and their mother only served to cement that idea in her mind, but it could become more than a little annoying. The only time she did in recent memory was during her expedition into the Deep Roads. The eldest Hawke sister insisted Bethany stay home with their mother and uncle, and keep her head down until she returned. Their were a few close calls with the Templars, but Bethany had stayed out of sight long enough to see her sister return, her pockets lined with ancient, valuable treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the constant fear that the Templars would snatch her up the second she looked away, Gianna loosened the short leash she kept Bethany on. She was allowed to walk the streets of Hightown and Lowtown without her sister tagging along, though that didn\u2019t apply to Darktown. Of course, no one went to Darktown alone. She\u2019d visit Aveline at the keep, listen to Varric\u2019s stories, and go shopping for hats with Isabela. In fact, now that she had money, Bethany would do lots of shopping. At first it was only at the behest of Varric, saying that she should be \u201cfrivolous with her wealth\u201d, but it had become something that she greatly enjoyed. Sometimes on warm, clear days, she would spend the entire day browsing the markets. She\u2019d buy herself anything from exquisite Orlisian dresses, to exotic Rivaini fruits. If it caught her attention, even for a moment, she\u2019d purchase it for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never thought it possible that she would, but she actually felt like a proper noble woman. More than that, she actually liked it. One could even say her new lifestyle agreed with her as well. As she indulged in the decadent ways of a noble, pound after pound of soft pale fat had begun to creep onto her once trim form. The Mage tried adjusting her diet when she first noticed her gain, but ended up putting on even more weight when she began cheating on it. The fact she wasn\u2019t regularly in life threatening situations that forced her to get a work out didn\u2019t help her keep them off, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile every other girl she knew had firm, flat tummies, Bethany\u2019s had become round and squishy, with soft pink stretch marks. There was no longer a gap between her thighs, and her hips had become too wide for her to sleep in a twin bed without feeling like she was going to fall out; thankfully that was no longer required since the moved out of Gamlin\u2019s house. Even her face had become softer, with her cheeks becoming puffier, and her chin gaining a friend. The only upside she saw was that her bust and rear had grown to sizes that rivaled Isabela\u2019s generous proportions, something the pirate was eager to point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in Gianna\u2019s little group had made some comment or another about Bethany\u2019s weight at that point, aside from Gianna herself, and Merrill, who seemed oblivious to it. Some of them were simple observations, like when Aveline pointed out how tight her clothes looked on her. Some were less so, such as when Sebastian recounted the verse of the Chant of Light that called gluttony abominable. Anders simply warned her of the health risks of having a high weight. Fenris was was just Fenris. She had taken to wearing baggier clothing when going out with them, and hiding away in her room when they came to visit to avoid hearing their comments. The entire thing was mortifying for her\u2026</span></div></div>",

It had been nearly, what? Three years since she became Guard Captain? It had been three years since Hawke\u2019s expedition into the deep roads, and she had become Captain of the Guard a short while before that, so three years and a few months. And by the Maker was it boring. Aveline had assumed that Jeven hardly even left his office because he was lazy and corrupt, but there was actually a crippling amount of paper work that kept her trapped in her office most days. Most days she had to take her meals inside her office while going over reports. The only times she ever went out in the fields was when she went on one of Hawke\u2019s \u2018adventures\u2019, and the last \u2018adventure\u2019 she went on was the Deep Roads Expedition\u2026 three years ago\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree years of doing justice behind a desk had certainly had an effect on Aveline\u2019s body. Her cheeks had filled out a second chin had formed under her first, rounding out her face. She had to have her armor modified several times as her stomach needed more and more room, and more and more space needed to be covered. She had even broken her desk chair just by sitting in it, and she wasn\u2019t even wearing her armor! If Aveline had to guess she would say she had put on at least a hundred pounds, though she didn\u2019t know since she hadn\u2019t had the courage to step on one in over a year, when it told her she had gained seventy pound. She has seen recruits sign up larger than her and finish training thin and fit many times, and it embarrassed her greatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of giving up the position so she could get back in the field and lose the weight, but she didn\u2019t trust anyone else to be Guard Captain. It felt like she was going to spend the rest of her life behind this desk getting fatter and more out of shape until she was no longer fit to be a guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, hello~\u201d Hawke greeted, knocking on the office door only after she had entered. It\u2019d been far to long since Aveline saw the raven haired woman with crystal blue eyes, but it didn\u2019t look like she had aged a day since they had first met. The rouge had a wide smile on her face that just screamed that she was about to get herself into trouble, or do something dangerous. No doubt Hawke would want Aveline to join in on whatever misadventures she was about to go on. And Aveline couldn\u2019t have been happier to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made some small talk, first, of course. About Hawke\u2019s new wealth. How Aveline was settling as Captain. The Viscount and the guards, the Templars. Just about everything except for Aveline\u2019s added weight. Either Hawke didn\u2019t notice, or she was too polite to bring it up, and both were unlikely. There must have been some other reason. However the topic of going out with her, Merrill, and Isabela came up, and she jumped (figuratively) at the opportunity to go with them before she figured out what it was.</span></div></div>",

Not only was she panting like a dog, but she was also sweating in hear heavy armor, and her aching, underused muscles were killing her. And all this after only a small skirmish with a handful of thugs! She used to eat punks like them for breakfast! Now, if it were\u2019t for Isabela covering her back, she would have been completely overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve fallen out of practice, Big Girl. I suppose that means I can start stealing in front of you again.\u201d The Swashbuckler teased the Guardian with a mischievous grin. Just like Hawke, Isabela had yet to say anything about Aveline\u2019s weight. Sure, there were plenty of comments on how out of shape she was, on top of the normal jabs, but it seemed even she knew a woman\u2019s weight was a touchy subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry it, whore, and I\u2019ll have you clapped in irons!\u201d Aveline threatened between labored breaths. She may not have been able to do it herself, but she could order another guard to do it for her. Though, it\u2019s actions like that which are largely to blame for how out of shape she\u2019d become. There were certainly times where she could have gone into the field, but there was always paperwork that needed to be done that she felt just couldn\u2019t be pushed off. Though, she didn\u2019t let that felling stop her from leaving with Hawke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an amused laugh, Isabela placed a hand on her jutting hip and looked at the Captain of the Guard. \u201cYou sure are eager to get me in cuffs, aren\u2019t you? You could use a pair of mine if you like. Much more comfortable than the normal kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, whore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I never wear the gag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarlot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSovereign!\u201d Marian suddenly yelled excitedly, holding up the golden piece of currency triumphantly. Finally done with her looting, Hawke stood up from her crouched position over the body of the thug she found the coin on, then walked over to her three friends. \u201cLooks like these fine men will be paying for our lunch!\u201d She declared with a smile before wiping her enemies\u2019 blood from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Aveline didn\u2019t have much of an appetite after being splattered in very persistent gore, but today she had worked up a strong hunger fighting and lugging around her heavy armor. The thing was, Aveline felt like she\u2019d end up taking in more calories than she burned if she ate now. \u201cI think I\u2019ll skip lunch today, if it\u2019s all the same to you. Besides, I should be getting back to keep.\u201d She doubted her legs even had the strength left in them to carry her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawke pouted. \u201cAww, but we haven\u2019t even gone on our adventure yet!\u201d The grown woman whined like a spoiled child, even stomping her foot in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabela sashayed over to Hawke and draped her arm around her fellow rouge\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s probably for the best, sweet thing. She wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with us anyway.\u201d The promiscuous pirate said, obviously trying to taunt Aveline into coming anyway. After all, how could she annoy her if she wasn\u2019t there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAveline hung her head and sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s right\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAtta girl, let\u2019s\u2014wait, I\u2019m what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at me!\u201d Aveline cried out, gesturing to her body. \u201c I\u2019m more out of shape than most nobles in Hightown. At best I\u2019d slow you down, at worst I\u2019d get you killed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the sovereign into her purse, Hawke moved from Isabela over to Aveline, and placed a hand onto her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad! With the right help you could get back to normal in no time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAveline perked up. \u201cAre you volunteering?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawke held out her open palm. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not.\u201d Shaking her head but still smiling, Aveline placed a small pouch full of coins into Hawke\u2019s hand. \u201cGreat! We\u2019ll start right after lunch!\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve seen toddlers waddle faster than you!\u201d Martian berated her friend publicly as they walked the streets of Hightown. Hawke kept a paces in front of the over fed Captain of the Guard, jogging backwards so that she could keep an eye on her, practically taunting Aveline with her physical fitness while she was panting like an old Mabari. It didn\u2019t help that she was lugging around her weight in \u201cvaluables\u201d Hawke had picked up. What would anyone ever need with this many pairs of tattered pants?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, when you said you would help me, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed if I knew you were just going to make me carry your junk!\u201d Aveline as she readjusted some of the things the noble was forcing her to carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarian scowled at the ginger as she walked in reverse. \u201cHush, ye of little faith! The is simply endurance training! You paid me to help you get back in shape, and by Andraste\u2019s thong, I always do what I\u2019m paid to!\u201d Sometimes Aveline wondered if Hawke was the same kind of Andrastian as Varric, or if she simply liked the sounds of the blasphemous turns of phrase. \u201cPlus, you\u2019re my best friend, so I\u2019m at least doubly obligated to help you.\u201d And with that comment, Aveline was red in the face from more than being out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawke may have been greedy, money-grubbing, penny-pincher, but her friends still meant more to her than gold. She just preferred it when she could make money helping them. There were actually several occasions where she asked for money to do a job, was denied coin, then went ahead and helped anyway. She also had at least some morals, as she would never steal (except from criminals and those so rich they would never notice) and wouldn\u2019t kill for coin (unless they really deserved). All things considered, Aveline would have to say Hawke at least tried to be a half decent person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, bubble butt! Get your head out of the clouds! If we don\u2019t get to the market before they close and I get a chance to hock all this crap, I\u2019m going to make you run another three laps!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawke\u2019s \u201cendurance training\u201d only happened two other time, all ending with Hawke treating to a hearty meal. After that, the real workouts began. Hawke used some of the money she got from pawning her junk to buy some training equipment, and turned an unused room at her estate into a training room. Every day, Aveline would come to Hawke\u2019s home, and she would be treated to a substantial amount of food to fuel her through the twenty lunges, jumping jacks, and windmill stretches that would immediately follow. All of that would just be a warm up for the exercises to come. The first day Marian had the obese former soldier go at a punching bag for twenty minutes without rest just as a start; her freckled cheeks red the entire time from the sensation of her loose arm fat and belly bulge wobbling about with each punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo two workout sessions were the same, but they were always brutal, exceedingly physically demanding, and followed up by a large meal with the Hawke family. At first Aveline thought Hawke was just torturing her, until she saw the results. Her once loose flab gained firmness, no longer wobbling as much when she moved. The muscles that had been lost beneath excess flesh began to reappear. Armor she had outgrown fit her better. Best of all, she no longer became winded easily. In fact, though she would never admit it, Hawke\u2019s endurance training seemed to have worked, and now she felt like she had more energy to burn than even before she put on weight. Never before had she felt such confidence in herself, or her abilities. She even felt good enough to\u2026</span></div></div>",

She did not misuse blood magic. She could not be tempted by any demon, like one aforementioned broody Elf. All schools of magic can be mastered, and Merrill had performing blood magic down to a science. Taking a dagger from her side and putting it against her already scared left wrist, she gently applied just enough pressure to cut the skin, Merrill the brought the dagger across the width of her wrist to get the desired amount of blood. She needed the perfect amount; having to account for the difference in the power of blood and lyrium. When she had enough she bandaged her arm to keep blood from going where it wasn\u2019t supposed to. It would likely heal by the time she was done with the ritual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her blood to power her magic, she began to repair the Eluvian. She had to keep her mind clear and emotions in check, or else she might attract the unwanted attention of demons. Feeling happiness with her progress could attract a powerful Pride demon. Wanting it to be done could attract a Desire demon. Frustration with the slow pace: Rage. Get tired? Sloth. Anxious? Fear. She had some trouble before, but nothing she couldn't\u2019t handle, and this time Merrill had accounted for everything, and was sure no demons would bother her this\u2014<i>groooowwl</i>. Had she forgotten to eat today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>You hunger\u2026</i></b> Came a low, brooding, sinister disembodied voice. <b><i>Many in this place hunger\u2026</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerrill knew it was a Hunger demon. It made itself very obvious that was what it was, but she also recognized the voice and presence of it from the one Hawke\u2019s party had encountered in the Deep Roads. She immediately stopped the ritual to keep it from fully breaking through the Veil while it was weak, and to keep from attracting any other demons.  \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll go to the market and get some bread later.\u201d Merrill said, trying to dismiss the demon. It would leave her alone if it didn\u2019t think it could tempt her with food or cunsomption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Bread? Flour, water, yeast; mixed together and baked. So simple, so dull, and it is what you and many in this place have every day. If you have anything at all. Don\u2019t you want more? You could all have so much more\u2026</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Elves in the Alienage were fairly poor, and some days would go without eating, and this demon knew it. There was the possibility that it had always lingered here, pressing against the other side of the Veil, and all of Merrill\u2019s magic had only made it weaker. \u201cOh, no, really, bread is fine. I like to watch it rise when they bake it. It makes me think of a big brown wave rising over the horizon.\u201d If she could get the subject far enough away from hunger and food the demon would lose interest and go. Then her stomach growled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Bread is such a deceitful food. It gets bigger, promising you more food, but it fills itself with empty space. Don\u2019t be like bread. Don\u2019t let yourself be filled up by EMPTY space. FILL YOURSELF.</i></b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerrill put her hands against her head over her ears, pressing against it hard. She could feel the demon clawing, digging, and worming away at her mind, trying to get her to do what it wanted. The constant sound of her belly grumbling for food didn\u2019t help either. \u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026I don\u2019t want to eat too much\u2026\u201d Merrill struggled to speak her own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Too much? There is NO SUCH THING. These are things you and the others in this place tell yourselves. That something is enough. That something is too much. There is only more. And MORE. AND MORE. AND MOOOORE!!!

The mysterious plague came and went through in less than two months, claiming thousands upon thousands of Nevarrans, and all but erasing the Pentaghast bloodline. It was highly suspect how quickly the next in line to the throne attempted to claim it after the plague had passed. Rumors ceculated that he had caused the plague to usurp the throne, but all attention shifted away from him when another successor was discovered. Vladimir Pentaghast\u2014the \u2018usurper\u2019\u2014was one hundred twenty-third in line to the throne, while Cassandra Pentaghast, who was serving the Inquisition at the time of the plague, was seventy-eighth in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra was promptly brought back to Nevarra, and, however begrudgingly, was made queen of the devastated country. Leadership was needed, and no mater her distaste for her countrymen, she was the only one fit to offer it, and she knew it. So she sat on the throne her distant relatives once sat upon and presided over the people through the harsh times of recovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still helped the Inquisiton, offering aid whenever she could, but Cassandra\u2019s main focus was on restoring order in Nevarra, so she could hopefully return one day. However, the people were not making it easy. The simplest caugh would cause mass panic, the people frightful of the plague returning. They were all to caught up in being paranoid to rebuild. Agricultural took a serious hit, with entire fields being burned to eliminate infestations of plague spreading rats. Trade came to screeching halt with merchants to afraid to come and go. The healers and surgeons were too afraid to treat people out of fear the plague still remained. In short, Nevarra was in bad condition and was only getting worse; the country was facing collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part was that the few people who were doing something about the state of living in Nevarra were only trying to restore the way of life for the nobility. While the rich and powerful mostly went back to life as normal, the common folk were dying out due to preventable disease, and famine. The Inquisition returned Cassandra\u2019s favors by lending her some much needed support, but it was up to her on what it would be used on. Her first act as Queen of Nevarra would be to Use the support to resolve one of two issues: relief efforts for the common people, or restoring agriculture and trade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the support was used to help the common people, food, medicine, and other essentials would be brought in by the Inquisition, slowing recovery, but very few would die. (Estimated death toll: a few dozen. Popularity: 25/200 Rate of weight gain: average. Nevarra\u2019s stability: 5%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the support was used to restore agriculture and trade, the Inquisition would work the fields and do the trading for Nevarra, speeding up recovery, at the cost of many lives.

She blushed brightly, then growled. \"What are you all looking at?!\" She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked away and started talking amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra looked down to shake her head, then noticed the bulge that protruded from her figure where her flat stomach once resided. She gasped quietly, having only just noticed this. She looked around nervously, then bolted up from her chair and dashed out the door. She sped by the same Elf that she previously yelled at, who was carrying a platter of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most Holy! Your food!\" She called to the Divine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDivine Victoria sputtered. \"Deliver it to my chambers!\" She called back before continuing down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran until she reached her quarters. She opened the door, went in ,and slammed it shut. Once inside, she put her hands on her knees and panted to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... *pant* is just... *pant* disgraceful!\" She said, then fell backwards onto her soft bed, just before someone knocked on the door. \"Who is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A s-servant... I've got your food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra's strong desire to cram her mouth full of food forced her up. She opened the door, snatched the food from the servant, then slammed the door and locked it. Since she was now all alone, she stripped down to just her undergarments, her bra tight around her slightly bigger breasts, and her panties barely covering her softer backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I allow this to happen?\" Cassandra asked herself as she looked at herself in the full-body mirror. She then noticed her sword, shield, and armor, which were collecting dust in the corner of her room, the platter of food that sat at the end of her bed, the sweet roll in her hand. \"Oh... that explains everything....\" She said guiltily.</span></div></div>",

With a new name, position, and responsibilities that dwarfed anything she was ever tasked with before, Cassandra Pentaghast and Devine Victoria shared little more than a past, body, and mind. Even the physical resemblance were starting to fade as Cassandra\u2019s figure filled out.

Even after spending so much time with the gray skinned giant, she still makes the mistake more often than she wild like to admit.

Servants were scurrying about setting up tables and sweeping the dirt from the hall. There was even a servant high on the rafters shooing birds that have made their nests in the hall's high ceiling. At then end of the hall, servants were cleaning Herah's throne. It was a large throne and its design was heavily influenced by Herah's Qunari background. It was impressive and intimidating. <br>\r\nThe guard ushered Cassandra the rest of the way to the Inguisitor's quarters. <br>\r\n\"A servant will come to fetch you once the preparations are complete.

Cassandra sighed and began rummaging through her many trunks for something to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra was still getting the hang of the whole \"dressing formally\" thing but she managed to pull together a nice dress. She looked herself over in the mirror. <br>\r\n\"Oh how I hate this thing,\" she said as she tugged here and there. \"I'll have to have a word with my seamstress. She sewed another dress that's too small again.\" Cassandra pulled at the middle of her dress as her potbelly squeezed it tightly. <br>\r\nAfter fussing over her dress, a knock came at the door. <br>\r\n\"M'lady, it's time for the feast. I will guide you to your seat at the Inquisitor's right hand.\" <br>\r\nCassandra sighed once more, \"Let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she arrived at the great hall, she was greeted by a deluge of foreign nobles and noblewomen. They chatted in little cliques mostly likely gossiping about the noble right next to them. Cassandra couldn't stand them. While she walked to her seat, the nobles began noticing her and bowed respectfully until she took her seat next to Herah. <br>\r\nHerah leaned over, \"Talkative bunch aren't they?\" <br>\r\n\"Perhaps a little too much,\" Cassandra replied. Herah smiled and rose. <br>\r\n\"Lords and ladies,\" her voice boomed, \"Welcome to Skyhold. You will have no doubt heard of our triumph over Corypheus and his minions. It was a great victory but it was not without its losses. So today, we celebrate that victory and we celebrate Skyhold's newest rise as the most formidable fortress in all of Thedas. So without further adue, LET THE FEAST BEGIN!\" <br>\r\nOn que, servants poured out of the kitchens bearing platters large and small. They expertly placed platters on each and every table and in front of each person. <br>\r\nCassandra was taken aback by the shear amount of food Herah had acquired. The servants lifted the lids off the platters and all sorts of foods were revealed. Cassandra's mouth began to water. <br>\r\n\"Now before we begin,\" Herah started, \"It is customary that our guest of honor should taste each meal before it is passed along.\" Cassandra's eyes widened. <br>\r\n\"Every single one?\" she asked Herah. <br>\r\nHerah laughed at her clueless friend, \"Yes, Cass, every single one.\" A servants hands her the first plate and . . .</span></div></div>",

She lost count after the first twenty, and on top of it all she still had her own meal to eat. At one point the Inquisitor had to come in and feed her when she was too full to do it herself. As forkful after forkful was forced into her gullet the Divine began to feel more stuffed than the roasted stuffed pig; of which she sampled more than her fair share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoasted nug melted in her mouth. Succulent druffalo stake with thick, tangy sauce was chewed thoroughly. Freshwater fish from lake Calenhad seasoned with lemon pepper. Soft breads. Assorted cheeses. Juicy fruits and fresh vegetables. Eggs, rice, meat pies, corn, caviar, beans\u2014all the different foods became too much for her and it soon became an orgy of divine, changing flavors moving over her tongue and into her overfull stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all the tasting was done Cassandra was allowed to test while the other, apparently less honorable guests began to stuff themselves. Her one tight dress was much less constricting on her belly, because several tears had formed, taking the pressure off of it. The former Seeker of Truth couldn\u2019t even think about eating anything else while her belly pulsated with pain, however the Inquisitor would remind Cassandra every other minute that she still had her own food to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get cold!\u201d She chided her. \u201cIf you don\u2019t eat dinner you won\u2019t get dessert!\u201d She spoke as if she was a doting mother. \u201cThere are starving people in the Anderfels!\u201d After that Cassandra starting eating on instinct, shoveling even more food into her strained belly against her will. She just couldn\u2019t help herself. The sensation was indescribably painful, but almost orgasmic at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike too many times before, Cassandra ate like she was possessed by a hunger demon, not stopping until there was no food left, and, again, like too many times before, demanded more food. The nobles attending the feast had all heard rumors of Divine Victoria\u2019s monstrous appetite, but seeing it in action was another thing. Reactions to her feasting ranged from disgust, to embarrassment, laughter, shame, and possibly even arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Cassandra finally had her fill, the other guests had already been finished for quite a while. Leliana thought it best to remove Cassandra before people could begin to talk, taking her up to Herah\u2019s room with the excuse of needing to speak with her about Chantry maters. As the Left Hand to the Divine, everyone one believed the excuse, or at least if they didn\u2019t were smart enough not to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen placed upon the Inquisitor\u2019s soft bed, Cassandra immediately fell into a deep food coma, and Leliana was unable to rouse her. After spending enough time waiting in the room long enough for them to have an important conversation, Leliana descended the stairs and rejoined the festivities. She informed everyone that the Divine had retired for the night, having been worn out by her long trip to Skyhold.</span></div></div>",

Some could be very stealthy and agile. The Inquisitor was not one of them. She had only wanted to sneak in her room to grab something that was totally not something cuddly and bear-shaped before sneaking back out without waking the sleeping woman in her bed. Instead, she stumbled around in the dark, bumping into just about everything except what she was looking for. It didn\u2019t take much for Cassandra to be woken up by Herah with her waking so much noise. However, unable to see who was fumbling about in the dark, the former Seeker of Truth reached for the blade she would usually keep beneath her pillow only to find it absent. She must have been too full to remember to place it there before passing out, she realized. Still, Cassandra was not going to be taken off guard by the potential threat, which was actually her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though several forces such as gravity, her still over-full belly, and her tiredness were working against her, Cassandra managed to get herself up and tackle the figure cloaked in shadow. Both women went down, landing on the floor with a thud, and the much heavier of the two landing on top of the other. All of the air in Herah\u2019s lungs was forced out with a pained groan as she felt her body practically get flattened. At the very least none of her bones were broken by the impact, though a little more force and a few extra pounds would have lead to a very different outcome. \u201cWho are y\u2014oh, Maker!\u201d Cassandra began to yell, but now that she was up close to the \u201cintruder\u201d, and her eyes had had some time to adjust to the dark, she could see that she was crushing the life out of the Inquisitor. She quickly began scrambling together off of her horned friend before she caused her any permanent damage. \u201cHerah, are you okay?! I am so sorry, I did not know it was you!\u201d The Divine asked with great concern once she was off Herah and on her plump behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up with a pained groan, the Vashoth woman replied, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m fine. My insides needed a good ironing, anyway.\u201d She chuckled with a smile. \u201cBetter safe than sorry, especially now that you\u2019re so important. Not that you haven\u2019t always been important, but now you need body guards.\u201d It was very endearing how hard Herah tried to be polite, with only truly despicable people earning her ire. That combined with her sincerity and sheepishness off the battle field added to her cuteness. That, and her cute face.</span></div></div>",

She snatched the jar out of the Dalish elf's hands and stowed the recipe on her shelf. \u201cThanks, love.\u201d Sera kissed her cheek and sat back down on her couch, then began eating the fresh batch of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavellan sat next to her and rubbed her chubby belly. \u201cYou look so adorable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSera blushed, then looked down at her belly, which hung out of her pants that had previously busted open. \u201cIt's gonna be real friggin' awkward getting new pants from the tailor\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don't be silly! I'll handle that for you, sweetheart.\u201d The Inquisitor got up and left Sera alone in her room once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSera got up, jar in arm, and looked at her reflection in the window glass. She hadn't yet taken time to think about whether or not she liked her gain. She looked over herself: chubby cheeks, armpit fat coming out of her top, bigger boobs, and a belly\u2026.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The only sound that could be heard in massive and empty dining hall was the sound of Elissa rapping her fingers on the table. At the other side of the needlessly long table sat her wife, Anora, eating her dinner in silence. Elissa had already finished her food, in record time in fact, but figured she\u2019d stick around to keep Anora company. Even if they weren\u2019t close, Elissa didn\u2019t think that a person should be alone in such a big space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, one after another, Anora raised spoonfuls of stew up to her mouth. Up and down. Up and down. <i>Tap-tap-tap-tap. Tap-tap-tap-tap. Tap-tap-tap-tap.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can talk to each other, you know.\u201d Anora said, suddenly breaking the silence. She usually never said anything when it was just them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElissa almost jumped out of her chair from the sudden outburst. At least that was what it felt like with how quiet it was. \u201cO-oh, I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnora \u2018tsked\u2019 and look down at your stew, moving the pieces of meat and vegetables around in it with her spoon. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. You never do.\u201d Elissa heard that a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a drained sigh, Elissa leaned back in her chair. \u201cLook, I know we don\u2019t love each other, I know this is all for show, and I know we have a sordid past together. I don\u2019t, however, know why that means we can\u2019t get along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither do I, yet here we are. Struggling with small talk. I may be your wife and you may be mine but we do not belong to each other. No one is making you sit across from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m making me sit here! You know why? Because I\u2019m a decent person who cares about other people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and I\u2019m not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. You never do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the room fell into complete silence. The estranged couple simply staring back at each other. A minute passed and Anora resumed eating. Two minutes later Elissa started tapping her rapping her fingers on the table again. Up and down the spoon went. Up and down. Up and down. <i>Tap-tap-tap-tap. Tap-tap-tap-tap. Tap-tap-tap-tap.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I have died instead of your father?\u201d Elissa said, staring down at her empty plate. \u201cI could have made the sacrifice instead of him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnora was quiet for some time, and Elissa assumed that Anora hadn\u2019t heard her, and was grateful out of fear of the answer. Then, \u201cNo.\u201d She answered. \u201cMy father\u2019s crimes\u2026 he could never have atoned for them in life. I hate that this is the way it had to be, but this <i>is</i> the way it had to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElissa cracked a half smile. \u201cWell, at least we both prefer a world where I\u2019m still alive.\u201d She almost couldn\u2019t believe it, but that actually got a laugh out of Anora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I suppose we do.\u201d Anora replied, looking down so that Elissa couldn\u2019t see her smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching forward toward the middle of the table, Elissa grabbed herself another dinner roll. She took a bite out of it, chewed, and swallowed. \u201cEnjoying your stew?\u201d She asked. This was the closest they had ever come to an actual conversation that wasn\u2019t in the public eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerelden needed a leader. Loghain was dead. Alastair wanted to stay with the Wardens. They didn\u2019t trust Anora to rule alone. So, Elissa offered to rule beside her. She was of noble birth, and was going to save Thedas from the Blight. Eamon spoke on her behalf, vouching for her noble deeds to save both his family, and all of Redcliff. So it was decided that they would be wed, and jointly rule the kingdom. Elissa didn\u2019t think that Anora actually needed supervision, and trusted her to rule on her own, but this was the only way she could rule at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn public they played the part of the loving couple; holding hands, sharing the occasional kiss, but when they were alone they were little more than perfect strangers. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly a fan, but it tastes good enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElissa had eaten another two dinner rolls by this point. Her dress began to squeeze her tight around the belly, but that was nothing new. Since the wedding, Elissa had been packing on the pounds since she spent most of her time lazing around the castle. \u201cI know I\u2019m just a princess-consort, but do you think I have the authority to have this table switched for one that\u2019s more practical? I mean I can hardly see you from over here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can be very persuasive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink I could persuade you to push our beds together tonight?\u201d It was a silly question, since they didn\u2019t even sleep in the same part of the castle, let alone the same room, and the answer was always no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot tonight.\u201d Anora answered.</span></div></div>",

At least it is for Ellana Lavellan. Just the thought of the ambassador brought a blush to the typically collected Elf\u2019s face. Talking to her like a normal person was fine, but when she opened her mouth to say something romantic, and all that would come out would be a jumbled mesh of Elvish and the Common Tongue. She wanted to be with her more than anything, but the only way she could show her affection was by, well, not being anywhere near her. Whenever she had the chance, Ellana would sneak into Josephine\u2019s office and leave gifts for her. However, though she didn\u2019t what they did like, she did know that a Human would like what the Dalish would consider a gift. So, she went with the only thing she knew Josephine did like: sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Ellana is leaving another one of these treats for Josephine on her desk while she spoke with the other advisors at this very moment. Until she hears footsteps coming from the war room, that is. Panicking, Ellana drops the basket of decedent pastries and bolts for the main hall, chastising herself for her cowardice as she runs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josephine enters to see the basket on the floor with the red ribbon her secret admire tied to gifts they left, the Antivan woman can\u2019t help but sigh. One hand goes to her stomach as she picks up the basket. Though her stomach had never been rock hard like Cassandra or Lelliana\u2019s, it had also never been as soft as it was now, either. The once flat, smooth surface marred only by the scar of her navel is now a round, squishy orb with stretch marks caused by its rapid growth. The rest of her body had softened considerably (her thighs are so close to touching, now\u2026) it was her stomach that was expanding fastest, likely due to her stuffing it full of sugary treats so often. The damage is far from irreversible at this point. A few weeks exercise would have her back down to size in just a few weeks. Provided she lay off the sweets, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the basket down on her desk, Josephine inspects the pastries inside.

Her guts gurgled, her taut middle rounding out her frilly dress, but Josephine ignored the discomfort and gently reached out with her hand and lifted the Inquisitor's chin. \"Since revelations are coming to light this evening, I also wish to confess to you, Ellana Lavellen, that I-what is that? Is that...my family's old standard?\" Ellana nodded and Josephine took the item from the Inquisitor's hand, fingers running over the item. \"You did this...for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Josephine, if the sweets weren't indication enough, let this show you that I have feelings for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosephine leaned forward then, kissing Ellana deeply, the elf's body going tense until she relaxed into the kiss and wrapped her arms around Josephine's body, the softness found there very compelling.</span></div></div>",

However, that didn\u2019t stop a plate of cookies, a basket of fresh fruits, or other such treats and goodies from being left by Ellana for Josephine to find. It Antivan ambassador\u2019s heart swell to know that her beloved thought of her so often, but she felt more than a little apprehensive when eating them, knowing that they would further bloat her already expanded figure. That was not enough to stop her from eating them, though, and it wasn\u2019t just her appetite compelling her to eat anymore. She once tried to turn down Ellana\u2019s offer, but the utter look of rejection on her adorable face made Josephine\u2019s fat clogged heart break so she ate it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeliana could be very over protective of Josephine, and had threatened the Inquisitor with some very unpleasant things should she careless with Josephine\u2019s heart, though Josephine felt that it was her who needed to be careful. Josephine knew that Ellana had nothing but pure love for her, but between Ellana\u2019s trouble expressing it, and her ineptitude in fields such as kissing, and other\u2026 activities, it was very clear that the noble was Ellana\u2019s first love. While Josephine may not have had much experience in maters of the heart, the Dalish Elf had none whatsoever. If anyone\u2019s feelings needed to be protected, it was Ellana\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Josephine kept eating whatever Ellana would leave for her, no mater the effects they would have on her figure, to spare the Inquisitor\u2019s feelings. Her curves filled out even further, getting to the point that her corsets could hardly contain them, a second chin of soft fat began to form under her first, and even her arms were getting softer. Thankfully, Ellana hadn\u2019t seemed to notice yet. She hadn\u2019t brought up her weight once, and only ever had nice things to say about her. The most repeated was how much she adored Josephine\u2019s skin. Just the thought of how the Elf would move her dainty finger gently across any patch of exposed skin while they cuddled by the fire sent a chill down her spine\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Josephine returned her attention back to the papers on her desk, and absentmindedly started eating from a box of assorted chocolates. On top of everything that the Inquisitor left for her, her normal meals, and her snacking, Josephine had now taken to stress eating to help cope with all her work, especially since her parents had informed her about her engagement to Lord Otranto. Something she had intentionally neglected to tell Ellana about, which only added more stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, the nagging sense of guilt from keeping her lover in the dark about the engagement became too much for Josephine, and she began to search Skyhold for Ellana. However, due to her being so out of shape, she didn\u2019t get far. By the time she had searched the first floor of the keep, she was red in the face completely out of breath. Thankfully, Ellana found her before she fainted from exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are! I\u2014\u201d Josephine had to stop to take a few deed breaths before she could continue after she quickly trotted over to her beloved. \u201cExcuse me\u2014I\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you! I\u2019ve just received the most terrible news!\u201d If she told Ellana that she had been sitting on this information for a while she feared it would only make it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?!\u201d Ellana asked with a tone of both worry and urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosephine hesitated before finally saying, \u201cI\u2019m engaged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo\u2026 me?\u201d It was very obvious that Ellana was <i>very</i> confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosephine sighed in frustration, and began to explain the events that had led to Josephine being married to the Antivan Lord. \u201cI must deal with this,\u201d Josephine said when she had finished her explanation. \u201cbut until then, we cannot be seen in a compromising situation. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana was completely stunned. She had no idea what to do or say. After a long moment of silence, Ellana\u2026</span></div></div>",

For a moment a flush of desire filled her at the contrast between her larger body and Ellana's slim frame before looking into Ellana's eyes. It had taken just under an hour of argument before she was finally getting through to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I will allow you to handle this in your own fashion. I'll send a few baskets of treats to your desk. You need your energy if you're going to extricate yourself from this,\" Ellana said, hugging Josephine tightly.

She controlled the urge to squeeze just a bit of that gloriously round rear and broke apart to look into Josephine's eyes. \"I love you Josie, and I know this will work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair hugged once more and Ellana took her leave. As she exited the room, she placed a hand on her well-defined muscles and imagined them softening, her lithe form packing on the weight, maybe even eclipsing Josie.

The elf managed to keep her aloft, the adrenaline coursing through her along with the joy in her heart fueling her efforts and she spun her vast soulmate around before bringing her down into a deep kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtrano ended the engagement, wishing them well but the words were barely heard by Ellana, so content in this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening found the pair back in Skyhold, in Ellana's room, Josephine's tubby face resting on Ellana's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The world my want my time, Josephine, but you have my heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I count myself happy. Beyond compare,\" Josephine murmured to Ellana's declaration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana hugged Josephine tighter then and allowed her dainty hand to sink fully into one of Josephine's fat sides. \"Josephine, what if I told you that, once we're done with fighting off Corphyeus, that I wanted to...well...get larger, what would you think of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosephine looked into her eyes then, face flushing for an entirely different reason than exhaustion, and answered her.</span></div></div>",

Known commonly throughout Thedas as the capital city of Antiva, Antiva City was also one of the nation's largest port cities, perfect for trading both common and rare goods from the Rialto Bay, across the ocean and back. But to the local Antivans who are proud to call the coastal city their home, Antiva City was also budding and teeming with culture and entertainment. However, to the Elf woman, Ellana Lavellan... She became quite fond of the city that her beloved Josephine Montilyet calls home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the sun's rays glimmered through the open balcony doors leading into their private chambers of the Montilyet Villa, Ellana slowly but surely stirred from her peaceful slumber, sluggishly sitting up on the lavish bed, groggily rubbing the sand from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once she finally cleared her vision, Ellana was greeted by a sight that she was now all-too-familiar with at this point: A billowing blubbery paunch of a belly, which was mildly hidden underneath a plupm pair of cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she and the other members of the Inquisition finally defeated Corypheus once and for all, Ellana fulfilled her promise to Josephine about fattening herself up for the Antivan woman, along with taking an extended vacation with Josephine by spending time with her in her home country. And boy, did the female Elf Inquisitor pack on the pounds! At first, the two lovers initially encountered some difficulty involving an Elf voluntarily gaining weight due to their accelerated metabolism. Fortunately, Josephine was able to help her Elven lover in finding a solution to such a conundrum, which came in the form of special herbs that slowed down one's metabolic rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd over the course of nearly an entire year, Ellana's lithe and agile Elven physique was coated all over in thick ample layers of adipose and cellulite. Her once flat stomach now bulged and billowed outward with a hefty paunch of a belly and a scrumptious muffin top. Her waist and hips blimped outwards to accommodate for Ellana's blubbery behind, with each buttcheek now equally the size of ample watermelons, all whilst such girth was supported by a thick pair of bulbous thunder thighs. Meanwhile, her upper body prospered as well, now sporting a pair of hefty perky breasts, which were now freely displayed with no hinderance whatsoever. Along with a pair of doughy arms, Ellana's sharp Elven facial features were nowadays softened up by a pair of slightly fuller chubby, which now stretched her Dalish tattoos, and a developing double chin. If any individual would have to wager a guess, Ellana would most likely now weigh approximately 320 pounds in total weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Ellana was lividly enjoying every second of her newfound weight and girth, as she propped herself up from the bed, which caused her burgeoning fat-laden belly to jiggle and wobble from such a quick jolt of movement, momentarily looking back at her beloved Josephine, who was currently sleeping soundly with a smile on her somewhat cherubic face, as Ellana walked toward the balcony doors, noticing that she now had a slight waddle in her step as well as a hefty but seductive sway in her hips. Upon opening the balcony doors with both plump hands, Ellana looked out at the cityscape and noticed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon first glance of the beautiful cityscape before her, Ellana noticed that the citizens of Antiva City were gleefully celebrating in the streets below, participating in numerous festivities along with being quite merry. Of course, Ellana was very much aware why the Antivans were celebrating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, this was the Satinalia Festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the lands of Thedas, whether you're from Ferelden, Orlais, Rivain, Nevarra, Antiva, or even Tevinter, this holiday - once dedicated to the Old Goddess of chaos, Zazikel, but now attributed more to the Second Moon, Satina - was always accompanied by wild explicit celebration. Although she never truly experienced Satinalia due to her duties and responsibilities toward her Dalish clan, Ellana was always quite curious enough to want to participate in the Shemlen festivities and customs, as she witnessed the numerous Antivan celebrants all wearing masks and lose their inhibitions, giving in to their emotions and impulses, as well as wearing the most beautiful and most colorful clothes she has ever seen in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst she watched the Antivans party and celebrate from atop the balcony (despite the fact that she was still very much nude), the corpulent Elf displayed a curious but eager grin on her plump rounded face, thinking to herself as she thought, \"*giggle*...Well, I definitely can't wait to join in on the festivities.\" Moments later, Ellana's elven ears perked slightly, as she heard the soft mumblings of her beloved yet equally large lover, who was beginning to awake from her slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if on cue, Ellana calmly but giddily walked back inside the lavish bedroom to greet her beautiful Josephine Montilyet, who's only item to cover her blubbery nude form were the golden silk bedsheets that were covering most of her physique. As Josephine slowly sat up from the bed (which was now currently reinforced to support both her and Ellana with their current weights and girth), Ellana sat next to the dark skinned plus-sized beauty before, where she then calmly straddled Josephine with her thick blubbery thighs and legs. In turn, both of the naked rotund lovers smiled at one another, each having a beautiful glimmer in their eyes, as Josephine spoke first and said, \"*giggle* Good morning, my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too, my sweet Josephine.\" Ellana replied, where she then promptly kissed Josephine on the lips, their tongues interlocked with one another in a sense of passionate love and romance. After all, this was the reason why both women were naked as newborns: all because they were making love in the middle of the night. However, just before the two blubbery lovers could proceed any further, they both heard one of the double doors leading to their private chambers swing wide open, causing both Josephine and Ellana to swiftly stop their love-making, turning their heads to see that it was none other than Josephine's younger sister, Yvette, who had a look of shock and surprise on her face, covering her mouth with a silk gloved hand as she yelped, \"...Oh sweet Andraste! I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yvette!!\" Josephine whined, becoming greatly embarrassed from having her childish sister see her in her current position, as her plump fuller cheeks blushed a deep crimson hue in response. Of course, Ellana couldn't help but blush some as well, which caused the Dalish tattoo parts on her fuller cheeks to turn a slight tinge of purple from the mixed coloration. Fortunately, Ellana was able to reassure her beloved Antivan woman that it was nothing to exaggerate over, despite the abrupt interruption on Yvette's behalf, as Ellana calmly dismounted herself from Josephine and stepped off the bed as the corpulent Elf looked back at Josephine and said, \"Its alright, sweetie. Besides, I can think of much worse people than Yvette who would've barged in on us while we were \"busy\". *giggle*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ellana; Always the optimist.\" Josephine replied, her Antivan accent not so subtly hinting a flirtatious tone in her voice, as she unfurled the bedsheets from her blubbery frame, then somewhat sluggishly dismounted from her bed, where she seductively approached Ellana, causing both their bellies to press against one another. From there, Josephine whispered into the rotund Elf woman's right pointy ear and said, \"...That's what I love about you so much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Ellana administered another loving kiss upon Josephine's plump lips once more, which made the fat Antivan woman almost forgot the fact that Yvette was still all the more present before them. Of course, witnessing the two nude but blubbery lovers that was her sister and the Inquisitor made Yvette feel somewhat squeamish, as she spoke toward to two rotund women and sheepishly said, \"I'll, um...I-I'll see you downstairs, sister.\" And with that, Yvette quickly closed both doors behind her, just as both Ellana and Josephine severed their passionate kiss, where Josephine displayed a tender smile toward her equally large lover and said, \"...Well, we should get ourselves dressed for the day. After all, we don't want to miss the festivities.\" \"*giggle* I can hardly wait, my love.\" Ellana answered, easily agreeing with her beloved Josephine, as both rotund women began to get themselves properly dressed for the Satinalia Festival. </span></div></div>",

While she wore the puffy long-sleeve orange blouse, Josephine was also wearing a pair pink silk pantaloon shorts, as well as a pair of yellow and blue striped stockings, along with a pair of mauve low-heel shoes. Finally, the entire ensemble was topped off with a purple dress overcoat covering the torso of the orange blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she calmly paced/waddled back and forth throughout the bedroom, Josephine exhaled a deep sigh and  spoke toward Ellana, who was currently inside the spacious wardrobe room with the door closed behind her, as the flabby Antivan woman asked, \"...Ellana? Are you done in there, my love?\" \"...Yeah, I'm done getting dressed. But, Josie? Are you sure about this outfit? It feels so...revealing.\" Ellana answered, obviously a little uneasy on coming out of the wardrobe room in the outfit Josephine had specifically chosen for her. And besides, even though she has made some significant strides when it came to expressing her love towards Josephine, Ellana was still somewhat hesitant when it came to showing and flaunting around her fab and blubber to anyone else besides the Antivan woman she is deeply in love with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being quite the understanding and compassionate individual, Josephine easily understood her corpulent Elf lover's \"predicament\". After all, both Josephine and Ellana made an agreement regarding them celebrating Satinalia: Ellana would pick Josephine's outfit, while Josephine would pick out Ellana's outfit. Besides, when it came to celebrating Satinalia in Antiva, one must wear an outfit with a variety of colors in both the fabric and the seams. However, once she laid her jade green eyes upon the outfit that Josephine bought for her, well... One would say that the Elf Inquisitor was beginning to regret a little on agreeing to such a deal. So, in response to her lover's shyness, Josephine spoke toward Ellana from the other side of the double doors and said, \"*giggle* Is that why you're a little fussy on coming out? Because the outfit I gave you is a little revealing? ...Ellana, I can understand your hesitation, but didn't you say that you wanted to wear something to build up your confidence, sweetie? Now... Why don't you come out and let me see you? I promise not to laugh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a few moments of silence passed by, Ellana eventually mustered enough courage to come out of the wardrobe room, as she replied, \"...*sigh* Oh Dread Wolf take me... Fine. Alright! I'm coming out.\" From there, Ellana opened both doors wide open, stepping out into the light, which revealed the appearance of the outfit she was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the outfit that Ellana was currently wearing consisted of a green top and green booty shorts. The green top had these ruffled edges of soft white fur, both around the neck collar of the shirt, the ends of both short sleeves, and the bottom lining of the top. However, the green top did nothing to cover up the Elf woman's blubbery paunch of a belly, and while it did cover up most of Ellana's cleavage, the green top barely concealed the underside of her mammaries, giving any onlooker an avid description of her breast size and volume. Adorned around the bottom of the furry neck collar, there sat a pristine shimmering golden bell, which was approximately the same size as a softball. And while the sleeves of the green top did little to conceal the flesh of her pillowy doughy arms, Ellana's slightly plump hands were now equipped with a nice pair of green silk gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as for the lower half of the Elf Inquisitor's outfit, it was just as revealing as the upper half, only the outfit's lower half made her flabby hips, waist, butt, thighs, and legs all the more pronounced and apparent, whether they be commoner or noble. The green shorts easily highlighted Ellana's billowing hips and blubbery butt, as the short's leggings did nothing to cover up even her bulbous thunder thighs. Fortunately, that was compensated with a nice large but comfy pair of red and white striped stockings, which easily showed of just how thick and fat her thighs and legs were now. Finally, to top it all off, Ellana was now wearing a pair of ankle-high green pointed jester shoes, which were actually soft and comfortable on the Elf woman's chubby feet. And last but not least, Ellana had done her light blonde hair in a flowing braided ponytail which just about reached her shoulder blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, despite the outfit's comfortable fitting and quality fabric, the entire outfit didn't exactly sit right with Ellana, but...it was \"a necessary evil\", as a scholar once said. \"So, um... H-How do I look, Josephine?\" Ellana nervously asked, her plump rounded cheeks blushing profusely from being in such an embarrassing and revealing outfit. However, Josephine had this expression on her chubby face, which was akin to seeing something absolutely adorable, as she then spoke toward her equally large lover and answered, \"...Oh my goodness! You look so adorable in that outfit, Ellana.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You think so?\" Ellana asked, as Josephine waddled toward, and she felt Josephine's chubby left hand grasp her plump gloved right hand, where the rotund Antivan woman lightly squeezed Ellana's hand out of reassurance. \"*giggle* Absolutely! Now come: We have some festivities to celebrate!\" Josephine answered, as she began to pull on Ellana's pillowy arm, gesturing her to follow the blubbery Antivan woman. Of course, Ellana willingly followed close behind Josephine, as they waddled out of their private chambers, and proceeded down the grand staircase.</span></div></div>",

Josephine assumed that the petite Elf was alluding to something along the lines of, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t like me if I was fat, so you should lose weight\u2019. Of course the thing was, Josephine didn\u2019t care about Ellana\u2019s size. The size, shape, and sex of a person didn\u2019t matter to her, and while looks certainly mattered, it was far from the most important aspect of a person to Josephine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA kind, caring heart, intelligence, strength, a sense of humor\u2014these were things the Antivan valued in a mate more than appearance, and things Ellana had in spades. Not to say that she found Ellana unattractive. No, far from it, she thought the Dalish woman was the most beautiful woman in all of Thedas, and no amount of fat could change that. All in all, she was head over heels in love with Ellana, nothing short of her completely inverting her personality could change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarling,\u201d Josephine began, taking Ellana\u2019s dainty hands in hers, and stared deep into Brown eyes with her hazel ones. \u201cI love you with all of my heart, and nothing i this world or the next could change that. If after Corphyeus is defeated you started to put on weight, I would still love you.\u201d She hoped that confession would get Ellana to feel the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly able to contain contain her excitement, Ellana pressed her soft lips against Josephine\u2019s, and warped her toothpick arms around her lover\u2019s ample hips. The couple had long since given up any hope of keeping track of time while they were together, so the kiss could have lasted anywhere between a minute or an hour, but when it ended, Ellana looked down at her flat stomach and smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to start getting softer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a light went on in Josephine\u2019s mind. <i>Wait, she said if she</i> wanted <i>to get bigger. Not if she did. Maker, she wants to get fatter!</i> Josephine had never heard of such a thing before. Sure, there were affluent nobles who used their girth as a status symbol, but actively and intentionally adding weight to their frame\u2026? Then, more thoughts came to her mind. Thoughts of the Elf being bigger than her. Thoughts of Ellana using her pale, meaty arms to hold her. Thoughts of Ellana being her big, powerful protector. Thoughts of herself being the small one, being enveloped by her lover\u2019s warm, squishy embrace. And she loved these thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither can I.\u201d Josephine said, almost lustfully. \u201cMaybe\u2026 you could get even bigger than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elf grinned from ear to pointed ear. \u201cSo long as you\u2019re still getting even more adorably chubby, that\u2019s fine by me~\u201d</span></div></div>",

And boy, was this individual a killjoy to the mood: The massive looming threat to anyone and everyone in Thedas, whether they be Human, Elf, Dwarf, or Qunari. The Darkspawn Magister, Corypheus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ellana exhaled a deep frustrated sigh, Josephine easily noticed her Elven lover's recently changed mood, where she then looked at Ellana and asked, \"...What's wrong, Darling?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*deep sigh* ...I'm terribly sorry, my dear Josephine. As much as I am eager to go all-out and become fatter than you, it's just that... That damn Corypheus... He's still out there. Somewhere. Waiting in the shadows to strike.\" Ellana answered, obviously very disappointed that the threat of Corypheus still loomed over Thedas like a great shadow. After all, as the Inquisition, they needed to avert whatever nefarious schemes Corypheus had concocted and put an end to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to such a dreadful thought, Josephine placed her slightly plump hands upon her plush belly, calmly kneading it like rising dough, as she then spoke toward the petite Elf and said, \"*sigh* That Corypheus. Always such a killjoy to anything good in Thedas.\" However, upon hearing Josephine saying the word \"killjoy\", Ellana became greatly confused in response, as if she had never heard of this Shemlen word before until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What's a killjoy?\" Ellana asked, cockin a confused eyebrow at the somewhat rotund Antivan woman. And in response, Josephine was actually surprised that her beloved Elf had never heard of the word before, as she then looked back at Ellana with a surprised look on her plump face and said, \"Wait a minute, you've never heard of the word killjoy before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana shook her head in confirmation and replied, \"...Can't say that I have, Josie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well, um... A killjoy is someone who ruins the mood of, well, anything really.\" Josephine explained, just as she then raised a slightly plump left hand to move Ellana's head to look directly at her and said, \"But... That doesn't mean you should get really fat right from the get-go, Ellana. In fact, why not gain just a LITTLE bit of weight. You know? To start you off once you defeat Corypheus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about it, Ellana eventually came around to liking Josephine's idea of getting a little fatter all the more, expressing a gleeful but loving smile towards the somewhat rotund Antivan woman and replied, \"Now that's a plan I can most definitely agree with, my love.\" From there, the two lovers began to kiss one another in front of the open fire.</span></div></div>",

Win over the Orlesian Court and prevent the assassination of Empress Celene at the same time? Child's play! Stare down a High Dragon and slay it? No problem. Flirt with an adorably attractive woman whose voice sounds like how honey is deliciously sweet? Now that...was nearly impossible. ...Or at least, it is for Hela Adaar. The mere thought of the Antivan ambassador tended to cause the battle-hardened mage to blush profusely, which was atypical for the typically levelheaded and charismatic Qunari. Talking to Josephine like a normal individual was perfectly fine, but when Hela opened her mouth to say something truly romantic, all that would come out from her lips would always be an embarrassed jumbled mesh of Qunlat and the Common Tongue. Although she was the Inquisitor, the leader of the prestigious Inquisition, Hela was embarrassingly hesitant toward her beloved. After all, in Qunari culture, Josephine Montilyet was considered her \"Kadan\", her lover. And yet, despite her shyness, she wanted to be with her beloved Josephine now more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Well... One would say that Josephine has recently been \"packing on the pounds\", so to speak. At first, the extra weight wasn't noticeable by the residents of Skyhold, but over the course of an entire month, it truly showed on the Antivan woman. And let's just say that the extra curves were a turn-on for Hela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while she was preoccupied reading Varric's novel, The Tale of the Champion, in her private quarters upstairs, she invited Josephine to her room for some \"private intimacy\", as she put it. The sun had set over the mountains just a few hours ago, as the moon began to rise above Thedas, Hela continued shifting her gaze from the pages of the book to the staircase that led to her chambers. A few minutes passed by until Hela heard the audible footsteps of someone ascending the flight of stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she thought it was probably Iron Bull, judging from the heft of each footstep pressing against the stairs. However, upon seeing glimpses of a golden silk blouse with a set of puffy sleeves, Hela swiftly stood up from her desk, instantly recognizing it as none other than Josephine Montilyet herself. And boy, has the young Antivan noblewoman changed. In physical appearance, Josephine looked the same as she always has. However, upon looking at her body, there was a definitive change in her physique. Her upper body consisted of Triple D-Cup breasts, arms coated in a thin layer of adipose and cellulite, a slightly fuller face, and a small but noticeable paunch of a belly, only held back by the leather sash wrapped around Josephine's abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when it came to the Antivan woman's lower half, that...was another story. Her waist was almost two feet in widith, but it was her hips, butt, and thighs were truly the largest and fattest parts of her body. Her hips billowed out to being approximately 3 feet in widith, easily noticeable underneath her silky baggy pantaloons. Josephine's butt jutted out an entire foot behind her, as each buttcheek was around the same size as a Buckler shield, where such buttocks would wobble and jiggle with each step the Antivan woman took. And like her hips and behind, Josephine's thighs were just as thick as the rest of her lower half, as each thigh fit snugly against the fabric of her baggy blue trousers, one would swear that her thighs would also be touching one another should they have a keen eye for the smallest of details. Overall, Josephine had a legitimate Pear-shaped physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpoin gazing at the Qunari Inquisitor, Josephine displayed a flirtatious smile upon her slightly plump face. From there, both Hela and Josephine gently collided into a loving embrace and participated in a passionate kiss. Moments later, Josephine severed the kiss, looked up at her physically taller lover and said, \"So... How is my favorite Qunari Mage in all of Thedas?\" \"Oh! I, um... I-I just wanted to see how you're faring today, my Kadan (Lover).\" Hela replied, her cheeks blushing slightly against her pale white skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response to such an expression on the Qunari's face, Josephine couldn't help but giggle aloud, finding it rather adorable that Inquisitor Adaar had such a chink in her otherwise flawless armor. Nonetheless, it was nothing bad per say. But then, just as Hela and Josephine were about to get more intimate, Josephine noticed a package on the Inquisitor's desk, which made her all the more curious as she said, \"Ooh! And what do we have here?\" \"...Shit.\" Hela mentally said to herself, realizing that Josephine just became aware of the parcel on her desk, with her blubbery hips and butt wobbling and swaying from side to side with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to divert her lover's attention, Hela quickly spoke up and said, \"Oh, um... I-It's nothing, Josephine. Just some stuff delivered to me from my mercenary band.\" \"Oh? And I wonder what that might be, dearie?\" Josephine replied, picking up the packaged parcel in her hands, as she began to untie the strings and peel back the wrapping paper. Of course, this made Hela extremely nervous, considering that Josephine was about to uncover something uniquely different to the Antivan woman. And upon fully unwrapping the paper, the parcel was revealed to be...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What was revealed in front of Josephine was quite...unexpected, to say the least. The truth is, what Josephine had unveiled brought a sense of embarrassment to the female Qunari Inquisitor, for it was more than just an average masterly portrayed painting. In appearance, the portrait portrayed a female Qunari priestess, and quite a rotund one in fact, complete with an enormous apron belly splayed over her thick fatty thighs and dimpled knees, as well as a wide butt and billowed hips, along with thick meaty arms, and a bulging pair of Triple F-Cup breasts, all finishing off with a portly plump face with a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the Antivan woman's reaction was set to understandably surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...my goodness! I...I didn't know that you had a portrait of someone of such a, um...curvaceous stature, my love.\" Josephine quipped, trying her best not to sound offensive toward her beloved Qunari mage. However, upon looking back at the Inquisitor, Josephine could easily see that Hela had this look of utter embarrassment upon her face, akin to unburying an old long-forgotten family secret. Noticing her lover's current expression, Josephine spoke toward Hela and asked, \"...Is something wrong, Hela?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Josephine's honey-sweet voice and Antivan accent was more than enough to snap the Qunari mage out of her embarrassed stupor, causing her to swiftly respond to her beloved Josephine and replied, \"Oh! Um...Sorry about that, Josie. It's just that...I-I was contemplating, that's all.\" Although, despite Hela's best attempts to cover up the truth, Josephine easily noticed that her beloved Qunari was hiding something. After all, the Antivan woman was a former Bard an expert at the deceit and scandals of The Game, so it was no small coincidence to Josephine Montilyet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in response to Hela's failing excuse, Josephine placed a hand on her cellulite-padded right hip, her voice displaying a serious tone, as she then sternly spoke toward the Qunari Inquisitor and said, \"Hela Adaar: I know when you're lying to me. After all, you of all people besides Leliana should know that I'm a proficient player of The Game.\" From there, Josephine calmly approached Hela, and sat beside her beloved Qunari on the couch, which caused the furniture to creak and groan slightly from the extra padding and weight on Josephine's physique. Then, the Antivan woman's tone shifted from serious to compassionate, as she lightly shuffled an inch or two closer to Hela, which made Josephine's fat-laden hips and butt to jiggle and wobble slightly from the quick jolts of movement. \"...Look, I understand your...willingness, to not share anything about your secrets, but...\" She said, where Josephine gently leaned her body against Hela's, then continued to speak and said, \"...But you can trust me. If it's something that important to you, I promise not to bother you any further on the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it took a few long minutes and a hell of a lot of courage to muster, Hela eventually decided to disclose what she held secret from her beloved Josephine so far, letting out a deep sigh in response, then turning her head to look at the Antivan woman she fell in love with and answered, \"...*sigh*...The truth is, Josephine... That large Qunari painted onto the canvas... She...so happens to be my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosephine's reaction to such a revelation from her Qunari mage lover was nothing short of surprised. After all, outside of distinctly remembering hearing of Hela's time as a member of the Valo-Kas Qunari mercenaries, this was legitimately the first time she's heard of the Qunari Inquisitors' life before even becoming a mercenary. In response to such a discovery, Josephine spoke toward Hela and asked, \"Oh? Really? I...I honestly didn't know, my love.\" \"*sigh* Yeah...The truth is, Josephine: She, um...She wasn't just my mother, She...She's the Ariqun. ...Or, WAS the Ariqun.\" Hela explained, divulging on who her biological mother truly was to the curious Antivan woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Josephine was nonetheless surprised from such a huge revelation. After all, from what she remembered from her time studying whatever books were available on the Qunari government and culture, the Ariqun was one of the three de facto leaders of the Triumvirate, the top of the Qunari government hierarchy. The Ariqun was the leader of the Qunari priesthood, striving for scientific progress and ensuring that the Qun was being taught in both Seheron and Par Vollen. Overall, this was definitely most surprising and interesting to Josephine, especially considering her beloved Qunari mage's family lineage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, this raised more questions than answers to Josephine. After all, even though she clearly understood why Hela kept this certain aspect of the Qunari's life secret from her, she had to know one thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although there were shiploads of questions she wanted to ask Hela regarding the Qunari's mother, Josephine eventually decided to go with a single specific question that initially popped into her subconscious thoughts, as she calmly spoke toward Hela and asked, \"...But why? Why keep this all a secret from me, Hela?\" In response to such a question, Hela slowly stood up from the couch, exhaling deep sigh in some semblance of internal stress, circling around the lavish piece of furniture, attempting to sum up a reasonable explanation to her beloved Josephine. Once she finally collected her thoughts, the female Qunari Inquisitor sat back down onto the couch alongside the Antivan woman, where she then spoke toward her and answered, \"...*sigh*...Look, I'm truly sorry for keeping this from you, Josephine. It's just that...the truth is: I didn't want anyone to find out about this facet of my life. And with very good reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...With good reason? And, um... What reason would that be, my love?\" Josephine asked, seeking answers for such secrecy coming from the Qunari mage. Of course, Hela responded in kind and quipped, \"...Back when we were in Haven, do you still remember when I told you how mages like myself were treated far less equally under the Qun?\" \"Why yes, I do. But...what does this have to do with your mother?\" Josephine asked, becoming slightly confused from what you said moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while Hela keenly stared into the flames within the fireplace, the female Qunari mage then spoke up and explained, \"...Everything, Josephine. Everything. When a female Ariqun has given birth to a child, the infant undergoes a test by the priesthood to determine if they are capable of using magic, to see if they would potentially become a Saarebas in the future. At first,II passed the test, but... Shortly after the trial, I...manifested a fireball in my hands when I was merely 2 years old. Of course, this made my blood mother and father panic, worried that I would be killed should anyone under the Qun learn of my \"abilities\". So, to keep me safe from the Ben-Hassrath and the Arishok, I was given to a Tal-Vashoth Qunari couple who were friends with my mother. I...I still remember crying out to my mother, begging and pleading to stay with her, despite my inherent \"gifts\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon keenly listening to Hela's tragic tale, Josephine couldn't help but feel saddened and sympathetic toward her Qunari lover's turmoil as a child. After all, it must have been quite traumatic for someone of Hela's age at the time to be truly separated from their birth mother. \"Maker's Breath! Hela, I...I-I am terribly sorry. I should've known better than to pry you for answers on such a...delicate topic.\" Josephine said, apologizing for bringing up some bad memories for the Qunari mage. However, Hela spoke back toward Josephine, reassuring her as she replied, \"It's...It's fine, Josephine. Besides, this is an old, well-healed wound, and I'm not going to be gushing out tears anytime soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, um... Not to sound so rude, but... Why is your blood mother so, um... Fat?\" Josephine asked, being cautious as to not offend her beloved female Qunari. But in actuality, if anything, Hela seemed to be more embarrassed from such a question than anything, as the Qunari's pale bony cheeks turned a deep red in hue, easily noticeable to the plush Antivan woman. Of course, as much as she was hesitant to elaborate on such an awkward topic, Hela inevitably spoke up and answered, \"My mother... She was, um... She was once of the Tamassran. They're priestesses who educate the young about the Qun, along with interviewing captives, and assigning the Qunari their roles in society. But, they were known to be, um... Large, in both girth and stature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it was there that Josephine took notice of her own additional weight, gently pressing a hand against her much thicker thighs, moving her digits onto her billowing hips, and then onto her equally padded rear. In response to this, she...</span></div></div>",

What you're saying, Hela, is that you happened to be attracted to someone who is more, um... \"statuesque\"?\" Josephine asked, twiddling her thumbs a little in the process. Of course, the Antivan woman wasn't the only one in the room who was blushing, as the pale-skinned Qunari mage was blushing a great deal as well, where she then spoke toward the dark skinned beauty beside her and replied, \"*nervous chuckle* Well, I, uh... Yeah, I'm...attracted to \"larger\" women, Josie. Especially you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what is it that you like about me then, my love?\" Josephine quipped, as she slowly stood up from the lavish couch, having almost little difficulty due to the excess weight and bulk on her lower half, as the plush Antivan diplomat gave Hela this playful romantic look in her light brown eyes whilst she walked toward the lavish Orlesian bed, with the body fat on her lower half causing her wide hips and butt to sway from side to side with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this motioned Hela to accompany Josephine onto the bed, as the Qunari mage stood up from the couch and accompanied the dark skinned beauty on the bed, administering a passionate kiss upon Josephine's lush lips. Moments later, Hela swiftly but gently pushed Josephine down onto the bed, landing back first on the soft silky mattress. \"...You're sweet, kind, understanding, and...\" Hela replied, her tone of voice sounding tiniest bit lustful but sweet as honey at the same time, just as she then leaned forward to speak into Josephine's left ear and sweetly whispered, \"...You've got the fattest, most beautiful set of hips and buttcheeks I've ever laid eyes on in all of Thedas.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, upon hearing those words coming from the Qunari Inquisitor, Josephine swiftly retaliated by wrapping her arms around Hela, pulling her in closer, then delivered a long romantic kiss upon the female Qunari's lips, their tongues twisting and interlocking around one another in a state of lustful euphoria. Needless to say, they were both vividly enjoying each other's \"company\". However, the enjoyment between the two lovers soon began to turn risqu\u00e9, as Hela began to deliberately but carefully strip Josephine of her lavish garments, while Josephine did the same to Hela. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Hela began to unfurl the sash around Josephine's abdomen, thus causing the Antivan woman's small paunch of a belly to freely pooch out with no restraint to hold it back, while Josephine unbuttoned Hela's blue doublet, beginning with the most bottom buttons, and then moving upwards, all whilst they were still interlocked in their Orlesian kissing. From there, Hela then unbuttoned Josephine's blue vest and golden silk, puffy sleeved blouse, casting the lavish garments off to the side, thus leaving the plus-sized Antivan woman topless, which easily showed off her plump Triple D-Cup breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Josephine finally unbuttoned the last clasp on Hela's doublet, casting it onto the carpet floor, as Hela was now topless as well, which easily showed off her slightly muscular Qunari physique. Of course, the two lesbian lovers didn't stop there, as they continued stripping themselves of their clothes until they were in nothing but their birthday suits. Then, Josephine climbed further up onto the bed, with Hela closely behind, as they continued to kiss one another. But then, Hela grabbed a large handful of Josephine's fatty buttcheeks, groping the adipose-coated buttocks with enticed intimacy. However, this caused the Antivan woman to incite a lustful moan in excitement, obviously enjoying Hela's lewd groping. Both the Qunari Inquisitor and the Antivan diplomat continued their persistent sexual intercourse for a few more hours until they slumbered from exhaustion, still locked in a lovers' embrace.</span></div></div>",

Neither of them, however, were so attractive that Maryden felt compelled write a song about them. Sera was. The Elven archer had only been at Haven at short while before she captured the minstrel\u2019s heart, and on a whim Maryden wrote the song and began to preform it. Sure, she knew some might think it was a little creepy, after all they were acquaintances at best, but Maryden knew that music was the only medium through which true emotion could manifest. A song could be complex, dark, and serious, or simple, pure, and fun. Like Sera, and she felt Sera Was Never perfectly captured that. Plus, she was shit at flirting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was far a bumbling fool, but all her pickup lines either fell flat or completely went over people\u2019s heads. They were closer to bad jokes than what anyone would consider a pickup line. Still, Maryden felt she should have stuck to flirting than writing the song, since it only seemed to make Sera feel uncomfortable; she would stop playing it if she didn\u2019t get a sovereign from patrons requesting her to play it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one hope for Maryden if she wanted to win Sera over. At the end of every day she would sit down and write in her journal, and leave it on a barrel outside her room when she was done. Maryden didn\u2019t want to read it. She knew it was wrong to invade something so private for personal gain. But she was going to do it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day while Sera was out in the field with the Inquisitor, she snatched the book and started to look through it for anything that would help her woo Sera. It was mostly filled with short sentences; thoughts written down the second they entered Sera\u2019s head. It was also filled with cute little doodles along with impressive sketches. <i>-I think that minstrel Maryden is chatting me up. The song is creepy.</i> That wasn\u2019t a good sign. It was the only place she was mentioned and it was in a negative light. Then she started to notice a pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-Baldy says Dalish don\u2019t get fat. Didn\u2019t think I could hate them more.<br>\r\n-Selling and buying people so you can get fatter? Instant bitch. Nice arse though. Won\u2019t save her.<br>\r\n-Kerm should get fat. Don\u2019t need to bind if they\u2019re moobs.<br>\r\n-Met a lady Qunari. Tall. Fat. Woof.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she read it became very clear that Sera had fat on the brain fairly often. One might even think she admired it. An idea then popped into Maryden\u2019s head, and she put the book back in it\u2019s place and sprinted to go carry it out.</span></div></div>",
