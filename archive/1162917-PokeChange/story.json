Kimble butts in and says you will be fighting alongside him for now.\" Now you swich your persona to a commander and say quite loud, \" Report soldier!\" he says back in the same tone, \"Genral Aggron reporting for duty, Sir!\" You think that this is going to be really fun. </span></div></div>",

You turn and dash towards where the scent is coming from, causing your riders to be thrown around. Three seconds later you come apon a campsite, with three people and a pikachu sitting around a fire, food in their hands. \"It's the twerps!\" Meoth exclaims when he sees them.

You're trying to steal a pokemon?!\" I bark out. Meowth turns to me, \"yep that's what team rocket does!\" He says smiling. I get up and take a few steps back, crouching, hackles raised, snarling. Meowth is worried, \"hey james, what does it mean when an arcainine is snarling?\" \"Ummm oh, it means he finds you an enemy and will attack if you don't leave soon, why?\" I the release a powerful flamethrower, burnning and sending them flying. \"That's why, well easy come, easy go.\" \"Were blasting off again!\" Once they're gone I turn to leave when one of the trainers runs ahead of me, cutting me off. \"Arcainine want to battle?\" He asks me pulling out a pokeball. I shake my head and walk past him and right into the path of a seviper, which attacks with poison tail. The attack hits me right in the face, knocking me out and poisoning me. The group chases the seviper away, while brock examines me. \"This is bad, he's been poisoned, and there are no pecha berries around here.\" \"Foretree should be just up the road we should be able to get there before anything else happens.\" Ash says, just before a torrential rain begins.

It was definitely a dream land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the humans came.  At first, we had no idea what they wanted.  They didn't want the pretty rocks from our home, nor did they want the land.  Yet they came in the dozens.  But soon, we learned of their selfish plan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile nobody was around to watch, the humans snuck into the Forbidden Grotto and stole something very important to our king.  They stole the blue orb, and our king was angered by this.  Kyorge cast a spell over the humans, banishing their bodies into a cold winter state.  However, the spell didn't turn out as planned, and now our entire island has been cast into an eternal winter\" the Nidoqueen finished with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way to break the spell is to locate the blue orb and return it to Kyorge so the spell can be reversed.

Your stomach suddenly gave off an angry growl and you felt a slight twinge from your midsection. You look around awkwardly, both seeking food to silence your belly and watching to see if your outbursts had attracted attention, survival instincts starting to kick in now that your initial shock was calming down. You spot no real food, but you do see some dry twigs on the ground nearby, presumably having fallen from the large oak tree just in between the tall grass and the river.</span></div></div>",

That's not what I mean! it's just ah, how do I put this...\"<br>\r\n\"Do you like me?\"<br>\r\nAriel instantly went completely silent at his words. It was a minute before she spoke a soft \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"...Gee, I never thought you would actually like me...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just...When I watch you battle, I thought you were really strong. So I just started feeling...\"<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry, but honestly, don't get me the wrong way but, I don't really feel the same toward you...\"<br>\r\nAriel and Jordan stared at each other for a while. It was only after tears began to build up in Ariel's eyes before she began to speak.<br>\r\n\"So...You don't like me?\"she said, a slight sob evident in her voice.<br>\r\n\"No, no, of course I like you, I just don't like you like how you like me.\"Jordan said, holding her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"B-but, why? Am I ugly? Or am I too weak?\"<br>\r\n\"No, you're beautiful. And you're also very powerful too. It's just...I have this secret.\"<br>\r\n\"What secret? Can you please tell me?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, can you keep it? From everyone else? Including Katie?\"<br>\r\nShe gave a slight nod before Jordan whispered something into Ariel's ear.<br>\r\n\"I...I think I used to be a human.\"<br>\r\n\"...What? What do you mean? You're a pokemon, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n\"I know, but I have this really strange memory. All I know is before I first met Katie, I remember being a human before. After that, I was a squirtle.\"<br>\r\n\"So, is that why you don't lo- ah! I mean, like me?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I guess so. I need to find out what's up with this memory of mine, but I don't wanna abandon Katie and everything she did for me.\"<br>\r\n\"...How about you think it over before you make a decision.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Let's get some rest. It's getting late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next morning, all three of you wake up and begin to pack your camping things.

Katie glances at Ariel, who also has a sad look on her face.<br>\r\n\"Do you...wanna leave the team?\"<br>\r\nYou give a nod, and look at Katie's face. She gives a warm smile,but tears start to fill her eyes.<br>\r\n\"...Jordan...You've been so helpful to me for all this time...But you wanna face the world on your own now, don't you? Don't worry, I don't blame you. You must be tired of all this fighting, right? Well, I won't force you to stay, but you can leave now, if you really want to.\"<br>\r\nYou give Ariel a glance, who gives you a smile as well.</span></div></div>",

Have you heard of Suicune?\" she asked.\"Yes,\" you say still a little angry. \"She will die in a week unless someone does something. If she dies, the worlds water supply will become toxic. So I chose someone to help me save her,\" Cresselia explains. \"That's me isn't it?\" you ask. \"Yes, I chose you for your pure heart,\" she explained, \"But being a Gyarados changed you a little. It made you a bit hot-headed,\" you felt embarassed for losing your temper, \"But it did make you strong. But I would never have predicted this happening, a gold Gyarados. Suicune is over near Victory Road. Have you heard enough to be ready to save Suicune?\" You nod your head. \"Good,\" she replies.

The dampness, the mud, the wilting trees. It all felt so familiar, yet so different at the same time. Your family continues to walk around aimlessly and comment on the most boring stuff, not even noticing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get their attention with a long monologue, but all they manage to hear is \"Mudkip, mudkip, mudkip! MUDKIP MUDKIP mudkip, mudkip.\" Everyone turns around to face you and your mother runs up to you squealing with delight. \"Oooo, a mudkip!

Did you bring some pokeballs?\" she yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face gets rather pale at this comment. \"No, sorry mom,\" your brother says semi-sarcastically, \"I forgot all of them at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, darn,\" she says pouting, \"I guess this'll have to wait some other time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on mom, this is boring, let's just go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment dear, I still have to take some more pictures!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh a sigh of relief, but realize that you just missed your chance to be able to go back home. You quickly formulate an idea; writing a message in the mud! You quickly dig your paws-- flippers-- whatever they are into the mud spelling out your message. \"Mud, mudkip mudkip kip kip kip!\" You yell at your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turn around and look down at you, seeing your message in the mud. \"Oh my,\" your mother says, \"It says...</span></div></div>",

You see a winding dirt pathway lined with trees, as the grass ripples with the wind. \"I see you are awake, Pidgeot! Such a relief, it is....\" You look up into the smiling face of Nurse Joy, clicking your beak again. Nurse Joy dips her head and leaves the room, leaving you to rest some more. As you wake up one more, you see the moonlight cast shadows upon your bed and the floor. You decide to silently slip out of your bed and escape into the outdoors, where you belong. You successfully make it out of the room you were in. \"Pidgeot, get back in there!\" You hear Nurse Joy's voice cry out as you turn, looking up into her stern face and clicking your beak sadly.

The cave is pitch-black, almost as if light is just absorbed into the emptiness. Gardevoir is feeling uneasy about this whole thing now.

A yellow zig-zagged mouth appears below and a red dot appears centrally above the eyes. A dark, low, reverbed voice answers back from the cave.<br>\r\n\"You have no business here.

He suddenly realised that you spoke the truth and immediately released his grip on both you and Gardevoir. He now understood that he was wrong and he has unjustly harmed two innocents. A Dusknoir is bound by a code as they take up their duty as the reaper. A code only known by a Dusknoir. One that is not permitted to be heard by any other pok\u00e9mon and so they must accept what others think of them. The code is as follows:<br>\r\n     A Dusknoir must only take those whose time has come.<br>\r\n     A Dusknoir is not permitted, under any circumstances, to harm a soul.<br>\r\n     A Dusknoir is only permitted to use non-lethal force if the soul resists. They still must not be harmed.<br>\r\n     A Dusknoir must protect the soul until it is safe, in the spirit world.<br>\r\n     A Dusknoir, above all, must not harm an innocent. Regardless of how they act towards them. Just leave them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusknoir knew he did wrong. And know knew, he had to set it right.</span></div></div>",

Three months pass in an instant and you find yourself hiding in tall, near neon green grass from a trainer you spotted walking into your area.

You also seem to be at the foot of someone's bed and by the looks of the surrounding walls, a teenage girls bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up. Or at least attempt to stand up but stumble and fall back down onto your stomach. \"Brilliant. Can't even walk right anymore.\" You think to yourself. You eventually gain control of your balance and begin to walk around the room. It was a very tidy room. Shelves filled with books and collectibles, a very expensive looking computer in the far corner, a TV with a Playstation 4 and a set-top box (cable box) hooked up to it, a desk with thick books and a shiny silver lamp resting motionless on top of it, and a closed closet in the corner opposite the computer. The, what you believed to be, girl began to stir around a bit. Naturally, you quickly ran back to the bed and jumped back to where you fell asleep at. You closed your eyes, not knowing if she was truly awake or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear more stirring and a loud yawn before this person's voice came out of his or her mouth in a soothing tone. \"Hey there Umbreon, I know you're awake so there isn't any point in pretending you aren't.\" It was a girl. She sounded nice enough so you opened one eye and returned her gaze. \"There's my little patch of darkness. Did you sleep good?\" Her tone didn't change but she began stroking your head. After a second you nod back at her. \"Great! Now come on, let's go get some breakfast.\" She said, carrying you along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of you arrived at the kitchen, she set you down and who you assumed to be the girls mother was at the stove cooking breakfast. \"Hey mom.\" The girl said. \"Whatcha cookin'?\" \"Oh, just some scrambled eggs and bacon sweetheart. Get your Umbreon some food then sit down and I'll dish some up for you.\" The girls mom replied. \"Ok, c'mon Sable, let's get you some food.\" She said, motioning for you to follow her. Sable? Was that her name for you? Whatever, it doesn't matter, you were starving. She grabbed a blue, black speckled fruit out of the fridge and cut it up, took out the seed, put it into a bowl, and slid it over to you. \"Eat up.\" The girl said before sitting down at the table and beginning to eat her own food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fruit in the bowl before you didn't smell bad, in fact, it smelled sweet. \"C'mon, it's Oran berry, your favorite.\" She says, noticing you haven't eaten yet. You took a nibble, It tasted delicious. You immediately begin to stuff your face with the blue fruit until there is none left. \"Oh well weren't you hungry?\" She sounded surprised. She went into the kitchen, put her dishes in the sink, and began to walk back down the hall. \"Sable. C'mon.\" She said, motioning for you to follow her once more. The two of you went back to her room and she shut the door when you arrived. She opened up her closet and she seemed to be getting dressed in her day clothes. Once she was dressed. She said to herself \"What to do now...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The door frame is darkened by an imposing figure, silhouetted by the bright light streaming in from the hallway behind them. At first the figure seems unnaturally tall, however you quickly realize that's more due to how small you are now relative to your former height as a human. You guess any adult human would appear imposing to a Pokemon less than one foot tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... still an Eevee I see...\u201d the figure mutters in a low masculine voice, while taking a step into the room. As he moves closer you can make out more of his features; a young man wearing a red jacket and cap with the Pokemon league insignia embroidered on them. He's clearly a Pokemon trainer; could this be the master the others hand spoken of earlier? The trainer looks you over with a sour expression and sighs. \u201cI was hopping to have another Espeon or Umbreon for next month's tournament. Maybe I was expecting too much from such a tiny Eevee,\u201d he says placing a hand on his forehead, unable to hide his disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrink back under his gaze, your ears folding back instinctively. \u201cIt's not my fault...\u201d you squeak, though all the trainer hears is a faint \u201cEevee...\u201d You didn't chose to be a 'tiny' Eevee; you just found yourself here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't a Pokemon expert when you were human, but you seem to recall Eevee only evolved into Umbreon or Espeon when they were very happy or with someone they were friends with. After the day you had yesterday, suddenly turning into a Pokemon and then running a marathon in the agility course, followed by a fitful and restless sleep, you weren't exactly the happiest you've ever been. And as for being friends with this trainer? Well, he certainly hadn't made the best first impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of you could say anything else, a faint chime begins sounding from the Pokegear on the trainer's left wrist. The trainer taps the device twice and answers the call, his responses punctuated by long pauses when the caller you cannot hear speaks  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello... <br>\r\n...Yes<br>\r\n...No, not any more, I-<br>\r\n...A trade? <br>\r\n...Well I do have an Eevee, but- <br>\r\n...Really?<br>\r\n...Well alright then. We'll be right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer taps the Pokegear one more and then turns his attention back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell little Eevee, it looks like you'll be getting a new owner,\u201d he says, smiling for the first time since you met him. \u201cI've just arranged the trade and we'll be leaving right away.

Lets get going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can react, your trainer scoops you up in his arms and starts carrying you through his home. You briefly consider trying to struggle your way out of his arms, but you quickly suppress that urge. Even if you got away, you'd likely end up facing the other eeveelutions and you knew that wasn't a fight you could win. Plus the others seemed to talk rather highly of this trainer. Perhaps they had seen a side of him you hadn't yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, you were placed in the passenger side seat of a small car. You wondered why you were being transported this way. Didn't most trainers keep their Pokemon in Pokeballs? Did you even have a Pokeball?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trainer slides into the drivers seat and the car begins traveling down the road. \u201cThe Lockwood family moved here from Kalos 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d He says, presumably to you, though his attention seems fixed on the road before him. \u201cThey say Mr. Lockwood throws around more money daily than most people see in a lifetime. I've never met the man, though I've dealt with his butler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou zone out as you watch the trees and rolling hillsides passing by the car. The journey seems to take forever, but you do eventually arrive at your destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car begins climbing a large hill surrounded by a dense forest. At the top of the hill is a structure the likes of which you have never seen. A huge manor at least four stories high sits atop the hill, surrounded by a complex of smaller buildings. The expansive yard around them looks like it has been heavily landscaped, with fountains, lush green gardens, topiary and statues carved to look like Pokemon and people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the road you can see a man standing in front of the entrance gate. The man is wearing a navy dinner jacket and has a curly mustache. He seems to be awaiting your arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trainer stops the car.

The man observes you for a long moment, his stoic expression unchanging save for raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis Eevee is rather small-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Grady interrupted, \u201cThis Eevee is still young. It's father was a Rhydon and the breeder told me there was a Hippowdon and Snorlax somewhere way back in it's family tree. You treat this Eevee well and it will grow into a big Pokemon for sure. I just don't have the time to spare. Now are we doing this trade or what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is spinning. A Rhydon and an Eevee? Hippowdon and Snorlax? How was that even possible? Pokemon breeding was really strange. Your transformation into a Pokemon now seemed more complicated than you had ever imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can contemplate your strange linage any further, Jeeves withdraws a Pokeball from his jacket and summons forth a Pokemon. In a flash, a dark-purple squid-like Pokemon appears. Its long body is covered with yellow almost glowing stripes and just looking at it gives you an uneasy feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMalamar. A Dark and Psychic Type,\u201d your trainer says to no one in particular. \u201cNow I won't need to choose between Umbreon and Espeon. Alright Jeeves, let's do this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as quickly as it arrived, the Malamar is returned to its Pokeball. Jeeves and Grady shake hands and after a curt nod, Jeeves gives the Pokeball to your former Trainer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright!\u201d Grady says smiling widely \u201cA pleasure doing business with you. Give Mr. Lockwood my best.\u201d He hurries over to the car. \u201cGood bye! Take good care of Eevee!\u201d Grady calls as he hops in his car and drives away. You are left standing with Jeeves as you both watch the car disappear from view down the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Jeeves looking down at you and beckoning you to follow him through the gate. You also notice the treeline is not that far away. You could go with Jeeves and see what this Lockwood Manor is all about. Alternatively, you might be able to escape into the forest if you start running now.</span></div></div>",

Two life size stone statues of Gyarados and Steelix flank the cobblestone path leading up to the Mansion's front door. You can see other statues of Lugia, Dialga and Reshiram further into the gardens that seem to extend out all around the complex. The front porch of the mansion is lined with ornate Corinthian columns and on the roof above stands a statue of Arceus looking down on all who enter the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeeves quickly ushers you into the large foyer and begins leading you through the mansion.

It seems Jeeves notice's this as well, as he hastily continues. \u201cYour father regrets being unable to attend your tenth birthday party last week. He has arranged for me to give you this belated birthday gift and hopes you will accept his most heartfelt apologies.\u201d Jeeves gestures down to you. \u201cI present you with your very own Pokemon, Eevee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the girl's expression change from one of sadness to confusion until she looks down and locks eyes with you. A wide smile forms on her face and she scoops you up in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! My very own Pokemon? This is great!\u201d Cassandra shouts squeezing you tightly, causing you to let out a little squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeeves bows again, looking visibly relieved. \u201cCongratulations, My Lady. I will now take my leave. Do not hesitate to call should you need anything.\u201d With that, he turns and disappears down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl puts you back onto the floor and crouches down to your level. \u201cHi there, Eevee! My name is Cassandra, but my parents call me Cassie. Pleased to meet you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to respond hello, though a single \u201cEevee.\u201d is all that can be heard. Cassandra giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour so cute! What should we do first?\u201d Your new trainer pauses in thought a moment and suddenly exclaims \u201cLet me show you around your new home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra leads you on a whirlwind tour of the Lockwood estate. Some of the highlights include a massive multi-level library, a fully stocked infirmary, a hair-styling and grooming salon and a full size theater. You are surprised by the fact most of these facilities appear to be manned by the manors waitstaff. You also notice many of the doors seem to have large pet doors built into their lower halves. When Cassandra see you looking at them she explains her father had them installed for a Luxray he once owned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra finished the tour by leading you through a large kitchen. At the back of the room stands another door. \u201cThis is the pantry,\u201d your trainer explains while flipping a couple of latches and bolts around the edges. \u201cIt's stocked full of Pokemon food for when my dad's Pokemon visit. We usually leave it locked up to keep Chester out when he's here.\u201d She opens the door revealing a massive room filled with crates and canisters and walls lined with cabinets and containers. Appetizing aromas waft from all directions and you find your mouth watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHungry?\u201d Cassandra asks. Before you can respond, your tummy answers for you, letting out a low growl. Your trainer giggles and fills a small dish from a dispenser. She places the dish in front of you and you take a small bite. Whatever this is, it's the best thing you've tasted since becoming a Pokemon. It's also the only thing you've tasted since your transformation, so you quickly devour the bowls contents. Cassandra smiles \u201cI'll leave the pet door unlocked in case you get hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Cassandra,\u201d You hear one of the waitstaff in the kitchen call, \u201cIt's getting late, my child. Shouldn't you and Eevee retire for the night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trainer looks to her watch and sighs, \u201cI guess it is getting late. Come on Eevee.\u201d and with that she picks you up and carries you back to her room. \u201cYou can go wherever you like when I'm not around,\u201d She says as you travel down the hall. \u201cIf you get lost, one of the staff will be able to help you find me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the lavishly decorated halls of the rest of the manor, Cassandra's room looked like a normal kid's room, with a simple bed, desk and a number of Pokemon plushies. Your trainer set you down on a life-size Snorlax cushion. \u201cI can't wait to play with you some more.\u201d she says before she goes to bed. \u201cGood night, Eevee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay on the comfy cushion you contemplate everything that has happened today. Your situation has been drastically improved in the past twelve hours, at least by your estimation. You doubt you would have had this level of autonomy with your previous trainer. Your thoughts turn to the question of what to do next. With the ability to move around the property at your leisure, you might be able to start your own investigation into how you became a Pokemon. There was a library full of books which might hold clues to reversing the process. You then think about your new trainer. Cassandra seems like a nice enough kid. Maybe you should try living as an Eevee for a while and see what it's like. The library isn't going anywhere if you change your mind. As you drift off to sleep you decide to...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, your first few days were a little rocky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you had managed to get walking as a quadruped down pretty quickly after your transformation, walking down stairs was a whole other matter entirely. There was just something weird about having your tail-end at a higher level than your head while moving down stairs. That disorientation resulted in a few unceremonious face-plants, which fortunately only damaged your pride, and evoked a few giggles from Cassandra. You did eventually get it down and could now race down stairs with the best of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also learned to be more mindful of things that had been inconsequential to you as a human. Nothing brought this point home quite as acutely as when you stumbled into a burdock plant while playing with Cassandra on your second day together. You quickly discovered it was much more... <i>inconvenient</i> to remove burrs from your fur than it had been to pull them out of your socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the rough start, you quickly settle into a routine. Cassandra wakes you up every morning, (often earlier than you would like), and takes you down to the kitchen where there is a meal waiting for you. After breakfast, Cassandra meets up with her tutor, and they spend the next few hours in the library. You had accompanied your trainer there a few times, but you found your presence tended to distract her from her lessons, so you usually spend the time napping or exploring the manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround noon you reunite with Cassandra and, after lunch, the two of you spend the afternoon together. From simply reading or brushing your fur, to running races and playing pranks, Cassandra always had some activity she wanted to do with you. She never forced you to do anything you didn't want to do, though it was hard to say no to her puppy dog eyes, so you did find yourself completely covered with bows or drenched from playing catch in the rain on more than one occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Cassandra reviews her lessons for the day and you usually rest and recover from the crazy antics you participated in during the afternoon, and preparing for the next days activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne activity you found yourself enjoying more than you thought you would was Pokemon battling. Every few days you and Cassandra would take on some of the wild Pokemon in the tall grass on the edge of the manor grounds. It became apparent early on that your trainer didn't know much about Pokemon battling. Nothing underscored this fact more than when you were knocked out by a Nidoran \u2640's <i>Poison Sting</i> and <i>Double Kick</i>, after being ordered to preform your third consecutive <i>Tail Whip</i>. Eventually, you and Cassandra find your rhythm. Your trainer tells you how she wants you to fight, (Offensively, Defensively, etc...), and gives you the freedom to choose which moves you feel would best suit that style. In this way you are given more flexibility to quickly adapt to your opponent and Cassandra is able to observe how different moves work in different situations. You are <i>Swift</i> enough to <i>Take Down</i> most wild Pokemon with ease and the two of you become the bane of Pidgey and Rattatas throughout the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps the thing you enjoy the most about living at the Lockwood manor is the food. There are roast, grill and pastry chefs as well as several sous chefs on the manor staff and the works they create can bring a tear to your eye. The end of every meal leaves you eagerly awaiting the new and wonderful flavors of the next. Also, Cassandra and many of the staff carried a number of Pokepuffs with them and it didn't take much of an excuse for them to give you one or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of months you have come to the conclusion that you rather like your new life as an Eevee. While being a Pokemon wasn't without its drawbacks, you decide the pros far outweigh the cons at this stage. You enjoy your time spent with your trainer until...</span></div></div>",

You hop down from her lap, where she had been brushing you for the past thirty minutes, and she rises to her feet. As winter approaches your fur seems to be getting thicker and you were getting itchy as the new hairs grew in underneath your existing fur. Fortunately, Cassandra seemed to pick up on this and had been brushing you more frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully, your winter coat is all grown in now.\u201d Cassandra says, and then turns to look out the window. \u201cWe should get out there and see if we can find any new Pokemon while the sun is still high.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your trainer grabs her jacket and a gloves, you take a moment to admire yourself in the room's full length mirror. In the past 3 months your height had almost doubled, putting you close to two feet tall. Back when you were human, you seemed to remember reading that Eevees typically didn't get much taller than one foot and you wondered why you were different. Perhaps it had something to do with the lineage your former trainer had alluded to when he traded you, or perhaps all Eevees eventually grew this big and no one knew, since they were always evolving them so quickly. You can see the hair of your furry collar and tail are looking longer than they were in the height of summer, and the rest of your coat appears a bit fluffier, particularly around your midsection. Before you can further indulge your vanity, you hear your Cassandra calling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Eevee, let's go!\u201d your trainer says, heading towards the door, so you quickly fall in-line behind her. The two of you are met by the brisk autumn air as you exit the mansion and make your way to the forest at the edge of the manor grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn recent days, Cassandra has begun catching Pokemon. While she is certainly not an all-star pitcher, her throw and aim have already improved greatly. With your help, she already has three confirmed catches, two Rattata and a Nidoran \u2642. Jeeves had made it quite clear from the start that Mr. Lockwood did not want his \u201cestate turned into a Pokemon zoo,\u201d so Cassandra has released all the Pokemon she's caught so far. She's told you she's only going to keep Pokemon that are \u201creally special.\u201d You are not really sure how she's defining 'special'. Perhaps you'll know it when you see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear movement in the woods ahead of you. You share a quick glance with Cassandra who nods, confirming she's heard it too. Something is coming towards you, from inside the forest. You can tell by the rustling and snapping of twigs that this Pokemon is...</span></div></div>",

The quadrupedal Pokemon's sharp fox-like features and six curly tails give it's identity away as a Vulpix. You can almost feel the <i>sunlight turning harsh</i> as the Pokemon approaches. The sun's bright warming rays are a sharp contrast to the cool autumn air all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Vulpix! Let's try and catch it!\u201d Cassandra calls excitedly behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod to your trainer and begin charging towards Vulpix. You move <i>swift</i>ly, closing the distance between you and your target. The Pokemon doesn't seem to react to your advance. She stands her ground and stares at you intently. Vulpix's big brown eyes turn a milky white color and they take on pale glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you realize what's happening, you are hit with a series of flashing lights that seem to overload your senses. Your vision blurs and you to loose sight of your target. You can hear your trainer shouting behind you, but her words are unintelligible. The disorientation causes you to lose your balance and you trip over your own feet, crashing painfully into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle back to your feet, when a sudden impact almost knocks you off of them again. It feels as if a ball of fire has just struck your left side. You feel the singeing of your fur and the flames licking across the now exposed skin of your back, as small<i> Ember</i>s rain down from the ground from your burning coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden searing pain is enough to bring you back to your senses and you <i>snap out of your confusion</i>. '<i>Confuse Ray!</i>' you think to yourself. You had forgotten Vulpix could learn that move and it had almost cost you the battle. You catch sight of your opponent once more and drop into a defensive stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee, are you alright?!\u201d Cassandra shouts, clearly worried. \u201cMaybe we should fall back...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've got this!\u201d you shout back as a resolved sounding \u201cEevee! Eevee!\u201d while keeping your eyes locked on your opponent. The two of you being slowly circling each other along the edge of the clearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you're OK?\u201d Your trainer calls again, obviously unconvinced. You frown. Your burn must look pretty bad. As you wonder if you dare take your eyes off your opponent long enough to reassure your trainer, you have and idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away from Vulpix towards your trainer and giver her the widest, goofiest grin you can muster and wink. Cassandra's expression shifts from one of worry, to confusion and then back to worry, as she watches Vulpix take advantage of the opening you've given her by turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix shoots like lightning across the field, and in an instant slams into your exposed flank. You, however, anticipate the <i>Quick Attack</i> and instead of bracing for it, you roll with the hit and fall to the ground. Your opponent, clearly expecting more resistance, loses her balance and tumbles over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you roll across the ground, you reach out with with your foreleg and, catching as much dirt and sand with your paw as you can, you fling a <i>Sand Attack</i> at your opponent's face. Vulpix yelps and scrambles back to her feet. She falls back to the edge of the clearing and desperately tries to rub the sand out of her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, nice one Eevee!\u201d Cassandra shouts as your get back up to your feet. \u201cHurry, use Take Down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but smile a little; that's exactly what you were thinking. You need to follow this up quickly or you'll lose your opportunity to strike. You begin darting across the clearing towards your opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix stops rubbing her eyes at the sound of your approach and fires another <i>Ember</i> in your direction; however, it's clear her accuracy as taken a hit, and you narrowly avoid the projectile. Alarmed, Vulpix starts staring intently at you again, even as you continue to close the distance. You shut your eyes tightly, expecting another <i>Confuse Ray</i>, and run the rest of the distance blind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulpix gasps as you arrive within striking distance and you can hear her starting to move out of the way, but it's too little, too late. You shift your trajectory and leap towards the shuffling sound. You open your eyes just as you slam into the startled looking Vulpix and you <i>Take Down</i> your opponent. The pair of you crash hard into the ground, with Vulpix taking the brunt of the impact. The Pokemon wheezes a little, having had the wind knocked out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can take any further action, you see a red and white object arc through the air above you and strike the weakened Vulpix. In a flash of light the Pokemon vanishes, and in it's place lies the pokeball. The ball shakes and vibrates for several seconds before finally settling, losing it's faint glow and capturing the Pokemon inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe did it!\u201d Cassandra yells running up to you and picking up the pokeball. She kneels down next to you. \u201cGood Job, Eevee! You were amazing!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back at your trainer. While defeating a Vulpix was hardly a heroic deed, you do take a certain amount of satisfaction in having taken down such a strong opponent. Your chest swells with pride at your trainer's praise. That lasts for all of about five seconds, when the adrenaline from the battle finally wears off and the pain from your wounds and exhaustion come crashing back. You grit your teeth as the pain from your burn assaults your senses once more, and you find it hard to maintain your balance as exhaustion sets in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee! I'm sorry! We need to get you patched up!\u201d Cassandra says, realizing the extent of your injuries. She scoops you up in her arms and starts carrying you back to the manor. When you arrive back inside out of the cold, your trainer takes you to...</span></div></div>",

You and Cassandra were never more than a fifteen minute walk from the manor's staffed and stocked medical facility. It seemed cruel to berate a ten year old child for not over preparing when she knew full well there was a safely net close by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not the one you should be apologizing to,\u201d the doctor says, returning from the cabinet with a tray of assorted bottles and jars. Setting the tray next to you, he grabs a plain looking purple vial and administer its contents to your left shoulder. You instantly feel your strength returning as the potion's medicine enters your bloodstream. You let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra leans in close to you. \u201cI'm sorry, Eevee,\u201d she says, the melancholy in her voice is mirrored in her facial expression. You can't bear to see your trainer looking so sad, so you do your best to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry about it!\u201d you say, trying to replicate your wide grin from earlier, while placing your paw on her nose. Your happy sounding \u201cEevee!\u201d and goofy expression seem to have the desired effect and you watch your trainer's face brighten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow to do something about that burn,\u201d the doctor mutters to himself as he unscrews the cap of a small jar of salve. \u201cThis may sting a little,\u201d he warns, as he takes a gob from the jar and begins applying it to the singed skin on your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he works, you idly wonder why Dr. Brown was even here. A job in a major city hospital or clinic would surely be a better use of his skills. Perhaps remaining on staff in the at the manor was just his way of stay busy during retirement; (more of the infirmary's space looks to be dedicated to lab equipment than beds or medical supplies), or maybe he tenure here had more to do with a sense of loyalty to the Lockwood family. A significant portion of the manor staff were quite elderly and, from the few conversations you had overheard, held a high opinion of the Lockwoods, so it didn't seem that far fetched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason, you can't deny his treatments are effective. Moments after applying the salve, the stinging stops and and the skin of your back, (what little you can see looking back), looks as if it had never been burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, all treated,\u201d Dr. Brown says, putting the cap back on the jar and placing the used items back on the tray. \u201cJust try not to scratch at it too much as the fur grows back in.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou're the Doc, Doc,\u201d you mutter, hopping off of the table. Your response is unintelligible to the doctor, though he doesn't see to be listening to you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow exactly did Eevee get burned?\u201d The doctor asked, turning his attention back to Cassandra. \u201cI didn't think there were that many fire types around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Your trainer gasps, having been so worried about your injuries that she had briefly forgotten the events that had led to them. Cassandra reveals the pokeball and holds it high. \u201cWe caught a Vulpix!\u201d she beams before another realization dawns on her. \u201cUm, you should probably heal her up too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Brown just shakes his head. \u201cAlright, lets have a look,\u201d he says gesturing to the table once more.

Through all of this training you had become a girl mentally as well as physically. You found yourself giggling all the time and your previous love for battling and running around the forest had been replaced by the more feminine qualities of gossiping and making yourself look pretty. Your sister was overjoyed that there was another girl in the family and constantly chatted with you about girl stuff, something she had never been able to do when she had been the only female in the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother umbreon however had been noticeably absent since you had transformed, as he still felt guilty for turning you into a girl. He had only returned to you and your sister once in the past week, coming back to give you a pink bow he had found in the forest, which you have worn ever since then because you think it makes you look cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister I'm worried about umbreon, he's been gone for days now and I'm afraid he still guilty about turning me female.\" you tell your sister during one of your many chat sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little sis, I'm sure he's fine.\" your sister tells you, nuzzling you and giving you a playful lick on the cheek in an attempt to comfort you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sister but I just don't get why he'd still be guilty, I mean I already told him I forgave him.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Rose; guys are weird like that sometimes. Which reminds me...\" your sister says, covering her mouth with her paw to contain her giggles. She then stares you in the eye and tells you \u201cRose, you've made me so proud this past week watching you transform into a girl in mind as well as body, now I have my own little sister to talk about girl stuff with! But you see sis, there's still one more thing I have to teach you about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is that?\" you ask innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister giggles and replies \"<i>Boys...</i>\"</span></div></div>",

I wasn\u2019t thinking about kissing a boy!\u201d you stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell first of all I never said anything about kissing a boy\u201d she says, causing you to mentally kick yourself for having a Freudian slip \u201csecondly you have that look in your eye that all girls get when they\u2019re thinking about a boy, and lastly your currently blushing so hard that your face looks like a tomato.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe I was thinking about it a little bit\u2026\u201d you mumble, knowing you\u2019ve been caught red-handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you\u2019re thinking that way because I\u2019ve already signed you up for a little double-date with me, my boyfriend and his little brother!\u201d she squeals in delight, making it obvious that she\u2019d been planning this for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, are not so overjoyed with this news, and the color drains from your face as you scream \u201cA date already!? But sis I\u2019ve only been a girl for little more than a week now, I\u2019m not ready to go out with guys yet!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Rose, didn\u2019t you say a week ago that you\u2019ll eventually have to find a mate?\u201d you sister asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sis, <i>eventually</i>, not in just a week!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t get your bow in a twist Rose. I\u2019m not saying you have to mate with the guy, I just think it\u2019s time you got a little snuggle-buddy of your own. Now let me grab some perfume and combs and we can help each other get ready\u2026\u201d she says before you quickly run off into the woods as fast as you can, leaving a trail of dust in your wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone has cold feet.\" your sister giggles as she starts to groom herself for the date. \"You're going to have to come out of your shell eventually Rose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprint through the trees as fast as your legs can take you, checking over your shoulder every few seconds to make sure your sister isn\u2019t following you. Suddenly you see a furry blur running towards you out of the corner of your eye and you quickly brace yourself right before it runs into you head-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d you groan, your head dizzy as you try to get up onto your paws \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d you hear a male voice call out above you \u201cI was running away from my brother and I didn\u2019t see you! Let me help you up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to focus on the furry blob helping you to your paws but you eyesight is blurred from the collision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go\u2026Are you okay?\u201d you hear the voice say.

I ran into you pretty hard...\" he replies worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay, trust me. Besides it's just as much my fault as it yours,I wasn't watching where I was going either.\" you assure him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you say so. Heh, my brother always said you'll never never know who you'll run into around the forest, but I didn't think he meant it literally!\" The two of you share a laugh at his joke for a minute or two before settling down. The Jolteon then outstretches his paw towards you and says \"My name's Jason.\" You shake his paw with your own and reply with a smile \"My name's Rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you shake his paw you can't help but stare at Jason's body. While the little part of your mind that remains male is disgusted with you \"checking out\" another guy, it is quickly overwhelmed by the feminine mind that surrounds it. Your eyes trace over every inch of his body, noting with delight his handsome face, strong physique, and beautiful black eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so entranced with Jason that you fail to notice that Jason is doing the same thing with you. Inside Jason's mind all he can think about is the beautiful Espeon in front of him. \"<i>She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen!</i>\" he thinks to himself, \"<i>And that smile of hers! I don't know why but every time she smiles I just want to smile back!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to talk together for a few hours, telling each other about your families, your favorite hobbies and activities, even throwing in a couple of funny stories to further lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Jason's such a nice guy!</i>\" you think to yourself as you continue to talk to each other, \"<i>He has a great sense of humor and doesn't seem to have any of the ego that the other males around here have. *Sigh* If only there were more guys like him, then maybe I wouldn't mind it so much when my sister tries to set me up with someone.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, meanwhile, was having similar thoughts. \"<i>Not only is she pretty, she's super nice too! She's not one of those girls you usually see that are all looks and no personality. She tells funny jokes, she likes a lot of the same things I do and for whatever reason I just feel super happy whenever I hear her laugh! Why aren't there more girls like her around?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you continue to chat until you both notice the sun is starting to set. Reluctantly Jason tells you, \"It's getting kind of late Rose I better head home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I better head back too.\" you reply but before you leave you tell Jason \"It was so much fun hanging out with you today Jason and I was wondering if you wanted to meet up again next week? If you don't want to I completely understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,no it's fine.\" He replies, \"In fact that's great idea! Let's meet at Rainbow Lake next time at say, noon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great!\" you say and then, acting purely to the egging on of your female hormones, you get on your hind legs and give Jason a big hug. At first the Jolteon is surprised but he soon starts hugging you back. You stay in that hug for a few more seconds, loving the feeling of his strong arms wrapping around you and of your head resting softly on his warm chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the two of you break the hug and go your separate ways, both of you glad you have made such a great friend and secretly hoping that in time they might become something more.</span></div></div>",

A part of you knows how natural and easy it is to run. Another part of you doesn't have a clue how to move these limbs. You settle for a compromise and look like a wobbly, drunk Eevee trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know where you're going, but you only care that it's away from here. Clearly, these Pokemon were being chased by something or someone. Well, maybe not so clearly, but they definitely had a baggage of trouble that you don't want to have around. You start to dodge trees and run faster as your movement encodes itself into your muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you run far enough that the trees become sparse and the landscape transforms into a plain, with a small pond in the distance. It's still night, and you take a break. On second thought, maybe this was a bad idea. But then again, they were random strangers who you didn't know and were forcing you to evolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you're beat and you just stayed up half the night. You find a spot: a small cove in a tree that you can wedge yourself in. You're not a survivalist; you don't know if this will actually keep you safe, but it sure feels like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snuggle with the warm fuzzy rest of your body and appreciate just how comfortable you must feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up. It's fairly late in the morning, and the sun's starting to reach high. You hop out of your little cove and ready yourself to head out. You still don't really know where you're going, but at this point, you're going to be starving soon. The pond's still there, a bit far away. As you head closer to it, you notice a man-made trail to the side. People must travel through here! That's good, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You realise this must be her uncle so you stand on two legs and salute along with her. \"At ease.\" he says saluting back with a smile. \"You've done well Amelia. So well that I want to challenge you to come after the Thunder Badge.\" says Surge with a grin. \"You really mean it Uncle!\" she asks excitedly. \"Yes I really mean it, but you should tend to you Pikachu today and come back tomorrow to battle.\" says Surge. \"Yes, of coarse!

For some reason you felt more intense than you've ever been before. \"Yes Uncle, Let do this!\" says Amelia excitedly. \"Alright then lets get it started then. Raichu front and center!\" says surge throwing the poke ball. You see a large Raichu emerge from it. \"Alright then lets go.\" you say to the Raichu. \"Ha, please, you don't stand a chance.\" responds the Raichu. \"Don't underestimate me.\" you say. \"Oh don't worry, I'm coming at you with everything!\" say the Raichu getting ready to fight. \"Alright that\u2019s just the way I want it.\" you respond doing the same. \"Let the battle begin.\" says the ref. Amelia doesn't waist any time and orders, \"Shocky, use quick attack and combine it with tackle!\" You do exactly that and ram the Raichu... but what\u2019s this, the Raichu doesn't move an inch. You couldn't believe it as Raichu grabs you by you arms, picks you up, and throw you away from it. \"How did you...\" you start, but are cut off Raichu's laughing. \"Ha ha ha ha! I told you, you don't stand a chance.\" it says laughing some more. \"I'll show you!\" you say as you run at it and give Raichu a shot with your Iron Tail. Raichu falls to the ground after that shot. \"Ha! Whose laughing now tubby.\" you say with a laugh. \"Impressive, I may have to fight seriously for the first time in a while.\" Raichu says as he climbs back to his feet. \"Raichu, use take down!\" orders Surge. Raichu comes at you and nearly flattens you as it tries to belly flop you, but you manage to dodge it. \"Shocky, use Iron tail again!\" orders Amelia. You do and knock it backwards, but it doesn't fall. \"Raichu, use Thunder!\" orders Surge. \"Shocky, block it with your Thunder!\" orders Amelia. Both you and Raichu use Thunder and they negate each other, causing smoke. \"Raichu use Take Down now!\" orders Surge. And with that, the Raichu comes out of the smoke into a belly flop. You try to dodge, but it's to late, Raichu lands on you burying you under it's body face down. \"Oh no, Shock!\" yells Amelia in fear and concern. \"I told you, you can't beat me.\" says Raichu confidently. You try to get up, but it's to heavy. \"Just give up.\" mocks Raichu. \"Looks like your Pikachu is done Amelia. Might want to give up before your Pikachu is flattened.\" says Surge with confidence and laughs. \"Shocky?!\" Amelia yells even more concerned. You look to see she has tears in her eyes. When you see her tear you reach deep inside yourself. Suddenly Raichu find your lifting it. \"Amazing, it's totally tapped of energy, but yet it's finding the strength to lift Raichu. He's certainly the perfect partner for Amelia.\" thinks Surge with a smile. Your on all four and finally you push yourself onto two legs, sending Raichu flying, but it just does a back flip and land heavily on two feet. \"Why wont you just give up?\" asks Raichu, a little frustrated. You don't give it an answer. You just stand there ominously. Then something happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?...</span></div></div>",

This can't be good. thinks Surge. \"Special.\" you say. \"What?\" asks Raichu, confused. \"You think your Special. You do. I can see it in your eyes. I can see it when you laugh at me, look down on me, and walk around on me. I've had enough of this, and now I'm ticked off!\" you respond angrily, looking into Raichu's eyes. Raichu is a little frightened, but it refuses to back down. You charge it with your quick attack combined with tackle once again and you ram into Raichu and manage to push it several inches backwards, but it refuses to fall. Raichu grabs your arms again, but before it throws you it gloats at you, \"Ha! You aren't stronger than me.\" says Raichu gloating. \"Oh yeah, well I've got something you don't.\" you say before it can throw you. \"Oh and what\u2019s that?\" it asks bringing you close to it's face. \"THIS!\" you say as you head butt Raichu. Raichu stumbles a bit, but doesn't fall. You head butt it again and again. On the third try it lets go of you, but you grab it's arms and keep head butting it, over and over and over again. You head begins to grow red as well as Raichu's, but it still wont fall and you wont stop head butting it. Finally after ten head butts, Raichu falls and you jump back and land on your feet. Raichu begins to climb to it feet and is on all fours. \"Oh no you don't. You say as you run at it on all fours with quick attack and head butt it one last time. You both stand there on all fours a second and the suddenly Raichu fall down unconscious. \"Raichu is unable to battle. The winners are Amelia and her Pikachu, Shocky.\" says the ref ending the match. You stand up and fall on your rear shaking your head from the soreness of it. Amelia comes over to you ecstatic. \"You did it Shock, we won!\" says Amelia happily. She picks you up and hugs you. Her soft body feels good against your sore head. \"You sure did.\" says Surge, calling back his Raichu to it's poke ball. \"You two did a great job. It takes a lot of skill to defeat me. You earned this Thunder Badge.\" says Sure handing Amelia the badge. \"Alright I got a Thunder badge!\" celebrates Amelia. \"I guess that means you'll be leaving on your own journey hah. I feared this day would come. My little niece has grown up into a fine young trainer.\" says Surge, placing a hand on her shoulder. \"Uncle, thanks for everything.\" says Amelia, giving her Uncle a kiss on the cheek. \"Well, if your going to be going on a journey, you'll need your rest. You've got one heck of a partner to go on your journey with Amelia.\" says Surge, turning his attention to you. \"You take good care of my Amelia, you here.\" says Surge rubbing your head with his hand totally forgetting your sore. You don't mind really, you just nod you head. \"So, when do you plan on leaving Amelia so I can get things prepared for you?\" asks Surge. \"I guess the sooner the better. Probably the day after tomorrow.\" Amelia responds, not completely sure. \"Well then I guess I had better get preparing the stuff you'll need then.\" says Surge as he goes to get thing prepared. Amelia carries you outside and you both head home. The sun is shining and the winds of destiny are blowing as you head and Amelia head home to rest.</span></div></div>",

I didn't think it was possible fore a Pikachu to learn Thunder Punch!\" says Surge surprised at the sudden new attack. \"Something\u2019s wrong.

Raichu is definitely beaten, but you can't stop yourself from attacking. You body picks him up and hits him again and again. \"Stop it! Stop it now!\" you yell at yourself. Suddenly you stop. You here the other voice, the voice from before speak to you, actually it yells at you. \"Keep out of this! It's no longer your fight! I'm in control now!\" yells the voice angrily. \"You!

Stay away from there! The amount of energy he's letting of is enough to fry us all!\" yells Surge, trying to get Amelia to stop. She wouldn't stop. She couldn't stop. She could feel something was wrong with you and she was determined to help you. When she got close enough, she reached out for you slowly, trying to avoid the current of the electricity flowing through you. Finally she grabs your hand/paw firmly, but gently. You turn and look at her with you ominous glowing eyes. You didn't want anything to happen to her so you to her to \"Get Away!\" but to her, it sounded like an almost demon like \"Pika!\". \"It OK Shocky, I'm here.\" she says gently with tears in her eyes. She gently pulls you to her and hugs you tightly to her ignoring the electrical burns on her hand from grabbing you. Slowly, but surly the electricity dwindle until it's nothing more that a few sparks in you cheeks. Feeling safe and more relaxed you close your eyes.</span></div></div>",

Your safe.\" Amelia says gently with a smile, patting you on the head with her bandaged hand. \"You gave us quite a scare back there.\" says Surge just entering the room, he seems pretty calm and he's smiling. You look away in shame. You can't bare to face him after what you did. \"What\u2019s wrong?\" asks Surge a little curiously. You look down at Amelia\u2019s electrically burnt hands. \"Oh don't put all the blame on yourself. You didn't try to hurt her so I doubt she's angry with you and Raichu is tough so don't worry about him either, he's going to be fine. Anyway Amelia's hands weren't burnt that badly at all. They should be fine by tomorrow morning.\" says Surge petting you. \"Oh, I nearly forgot. Amelia, I believe this belongs to you.\" says Surge with a smile as he hand her a Thunder Badge. \"A Thunder badge? Why? Lets face it. I couldn't do anything to control Shocky while he was like that.\" says Amelia confused. \"Oh, but you did. Not only did he still defeat Raichu, but if you hadn't done what you did to stop him, he would have either seriously harmed himself or someone else and that entitle you to that Thunder badge as far a I'm concerned. You two have a deep connection with each other, cherish it.\" says Sure smiling and placing is hand on Amelia's shoulder. You both look at each other and smile. \"Well, I've got to get back to the gym. Tell me when you plan on leaving for your journey.\" says Surge waving goodbye. Amelia waves goodbye to her Uncle and turns to you with a smile on her face. \"Well, shall go home?\" asks Amelia and kind and gentle as ever. \"She is so kind, so pure. She's an Angel.\" you think as you hop onto her shoulders and you both head home. As you both went home you could help think about that other you...</span></div></div>",

I never thought my case of Schizophrenia would cause me so many problems. Now it seems he wants out for good.\" you thought to yourself sitting on the windowsill of Amelia's room looking up at the dark gray sky. That's when it came back. The events of earlier, of Amelia crying for you... and of how it's your fault her hands are burnt. You begin to cry. \"How could I have hurt the one whose been so kind to me? How could I hurt someone so pure?\" you thought as you cried. Amelia watches you from her bed. She can see your in deep thought. \"What could he be thinking about?\" Amelia wondered to herself. Then she saw you start crying. She immediately stood up and came over to you. She couldn't believe what she was seeing. You were crying for the first time. You hadn't cried since she first met you, no matter how much physical pain was inflicted and yet here you were crying and you weren't even battling. \"What's wrong Shocky? Why are you crying?\" she asks as she leans on the windowsill with her still bandaged hands so she was right next to you. You look over at her and you look down at her hands and then look back up at her with a sad look on your face. Amelia almost immediately realized you were crying over what happened to her. \"I'm glad you care so much about me, but you need to stop blaming yourself. Whatever happened is over and done with.\" she says with a reassuring smile picking you up and bringing you back to the bed with her. She sits on the bed and holds you against her gently. You two sit like this for nearly ten to fifteen minutes before the voice of her mother calls her for supper. As you both go to supper you can't help, but think, \"I wish I could be as positive as you Amelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you were both in her bed snuggled together, but you couldn't sleep. You were still thinking about the other you. You kept asking yourself, \"What if it happens again? What if he takes over completely? What if you couldn't stop him?\" Then the worst question of all revealed itself, \"What if he tried to hurt Amelia?\" You can't take it anymore you have to decide once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to stay with Amelia, but dare I risk staying with Amelia or even though she will be sad do I leave to protect the one I care for most?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich will it be?

Of course, Amelia doesn't know that. She just hears a tired \"Pika\" and assumes you are just that.<br>\r\n\"You must be really tired little guy\", she says, picking you up softly,\"Don't worry, we can easily fix that\", and with that, she climbed under the covers, laid you by her side, and the both of you drifted off to varying degrees of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Amelia slumbered peacefully, thinking of what to do now that she had the Thunder badge, your dreams were less serene. In your head, a violent and bloody war was unfolding. The two sides were the stayers and the fleers. You wanted to stay more than run, so the stayers had a larger army, but fleeing was a more logical choice, so they were more advanced. The battle raged on all through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy morning it was down to the two commanders, fighting it out with swords and shields. The skirmish was paused for a moment, as you looked around and saw that Amelia was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, not again\", you shouted, as you thought you had switched bodies again, but then you realised you hadn't, as Amelia skidded into the room to see why she had heard the loud \"Pika Pi\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sleepy-head\", she said softly, as she came over and patted your fuzzy head. \"You must have been more tired than I thought\". It's then that you saw the clock, 11:30am, and hear your stomach rumble, well it was 15 hours since you last ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd be hungry by now Shocky, here you go\", and she fed you a poke treat. I could never leave someone as kind as her you think to yourself, as the fleeing commander in your head is killed, and you leap into the air to hug her. Or, try to hug Amelia, but with 6 inch arms, it was never going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you liked that\", she said hugging you back, blissfully unaware of the scene in your head. \"My friends have come over, and they've all got Pikachus, which is why I wanted to catch you so badly. Do you want to go and meet them?\" she asks, \"just nod or shake your head\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oak snaps out of his dumbstruck stare and reaches out and slowly shakes your hand. \"Well the rumors are true, so is it also true that you were human?\" Oak asks. \"As far as I know, yes.\" You answer. \"How did you become a pokemon.\" Ash blurts out. \"To tell you the truth, I don't know, I just knocked out and woke up a pikachu.\" You respond  \"Amelia, we need to take this pokemon for questioning, he could provide some vital information about the pokemon world.\" Oak urges Amelia. \"I-I don't know,\" Amelia is shortly interupted by a huge explosion that knocks down the wall. \"It's team rocket!' Ash shouts, pikachu attack with thunder bolt. Obediently Ash's Pikachu fires a thunder bolt, but it is quickly deflected by an unknown force. \"Shocky, use quick attack.\" Amelia command's, as you rear to attack you hear a dark voice in your head. \"You know you can't beat them alone, you must join with me to destroy them, it'd be doing the rest of the world a favor.\" Then you hear another voice. \"Please don't listen to him, you can fight him, embrace the power of light and do what you know is right.\" it says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do? </span></div></div>",

Think carefully on what you want.\" You point at the one about pok\u00e9monthen jirachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to understand what pok\u00e9mon say! Can you do that?\" \"Of course, I can grant anything silly, but I shall grant your ability to understand pok\u00e9mon talk! Take care with your destiny!\" Jirachi glows a bright yellow as Amber starts to glow it soon stops. \"Can I have the wish tag also so I can send it else where in the world it is rare someone finds it more than once. If we meet again you will be super lucky.\" Soon the whole area is back to normal you then break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" \"Yeah I guess you said Did it work?\" \"It worked that's cool you can understand pok\u00e9mon now!

You try to let this sink in as you wait in the darkness for your new Trainer to call you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like hours of wallowing in self-pity, you feel a strange sensation and are released from your tiny prison. You look around, expecting to pop out into a fight, but don't see an enemy. Instead, you're sitting on the desk of a Pokemon Center looking at Nurse Joy.<br>\r\n\"Take care of him Nurse Joy!\" your trainer calls out. Nurse Joy nods and looks at you.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad Johnny caught a new Pokemon, but look at you! Covered in scrapes and bruises! It's a wonder you're allright!\" she exclaims. She picks you up and places you on a machine and fiddles with a few settings before disappearing through a door. A Chancey walks through it and walks up to you. <br>\r\n\"Well, good afternoon! I'm Chancey, and I'll be your attendant until my mistress returns!\" it said with a smile. You sigh and look away.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well, I'm not so happy right now.\"<br>\r\n\"Aww. Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I've just been captured. You know- freedoms taken away and replaced with the little urge to obey.\" This seemed to discomfort the cheerful medicine-minded Pokemon, and silence soon followed.<br>\r\nAfter some time had passed, Nurse Joy came back to check on you. A little while longer and Johnny returned to pick you up. He put you back in your Pokeball, and you waited for your next small taste of freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to lose all sense of time in your little world of darkness. It was overwhelming. The only thing you felt were the swaying steps he took. Madness was always on the brink, always delayed with little mind games you invented to keep your sanity and help pass the time. Just as you began to question whether or not keeping your mind was worth it, you suddenly felt the strange sensation of being released from your minuscule cage.<br>\r\nYou looked around, again expecting to be summoned in the heat of battle. But, once again, you weren't needed to fight. Instead, you were in a small coffee shop, surrounded by people you assumed to be friends of your master.<br>\r\n\"Check it out. One Pikachu captured in the forest outside of town!\" Johnny bragged. You wanted to run, to try to escape, to do SOMETHING, but that nagging little feeling in the back of your mind soon overpowered your dreams of freedom. As Johnny droned on about your capture (which was extremely exaggerated ), you decided to lie down and look out the window. You stared freedom right in the face. The outside was mere feet away, but it had never felt farther. One of Johnnys friends was asking about you, which caught your attention. <br>\r\n\"When did you catch him?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, a while ago.\" came the vague reply.<br>\r\n\"How long, exactly?\"<br>\r\n\"Um...one or two weeks ago.\" Small talk followed. You had just about dozed off when they started talking about you again.<br>\r\n\"What's with your Pikachu, anyway? He's been staring out that window the whole time.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It seems to me like he's kinda...depressed.\" Your trainer looked at you. An awkward silence followed.<br>\r\n\"It's about time somebody noticed!\" You said to yourself.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"Johnny asked.<br>\r\nThe group was quiet.<br>\r\n\"Uh...Johnny?\"<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n\"Did you say that? 'Cause, we didn't!\"<br>\r\nYour trainer stood with a quizzical look. They all looked down at you. Then you realized something: apparently, you didn't entirely loose your gift of human speech. At least, that was how it seemed to be.<br>\r\nYou looked up at them, your mind unable to comprehend this incredible ability you still possessed, despite your new form.

Eventually, at evening, you had figured out to make a cast for Chikorita, and you were about to lay down to sleep when:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello??\" Avoice rings out, female, \"I'm lost! Is anyone here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" You ask Chikorita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs, \"Why don't you go and investigate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree, and follow the yells until the trees slowly turn up less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How did she get lost on the smallest- wait.' You think, then chuckle to yourself. 'We got lost here.' You eventually break into a clearing, where a young girl, about 12 years old, is sitting next to a tree, crying softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to her and she looks up, still crying, just a bit. \"Are you okay?\" You ask, only to remember you can't speak English. (Really, it only sounds like \"Pi Pikachu?\") <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello.\" She says, hiccoughing. \"Oh!\" She exclaims, as if only really noticing you, \"Hi!\" She says, jumping up. She was wearing ripped jeans, probably because she got in a fight or something, and her T-shirt was ripped at the sleeves and she had a scar on her face. \"Do you have a place, a cabin or something, I can stay at?\" She asks. You shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then.\" She says, a bit depressed. It is night, and you better hurry back, but you don't want to leave the poor girl alone. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Feeling much better you decide to walk towards a nearby lake, and start to take sip. You instantly spit-take as you see your own reflection, waiting for the ripples in the water to fade away, you hope for it to be nothing. As the water stops moving, you gaze in horror at the reflection of a pichu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStranger than that, was that you didn't look like a normal pichu. Your eye's were blue, along with your ears!. Not only that, but it seems that eveything that was supposed to be black was blue.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://lollypopkid.deviantart.com/art/Pichu-colored-Blue-125852466\" target=\"_blank\">http://lollypopkid.deviantart.com/art/Pi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA personal pic I made for this story.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed an ear, and started playing with it. You thought about how to get out of here and get back home, all the while you played with your ear as it seemed to calm you.<br>\r\nLooking around you notice that you were in a feild of sorts.<br>\r\n\"Great, were am I?\" You ask yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it came from over here! Hurry up guys!\" A young boys voice could be heard from in the woods.<br>\r\nA boy with a hat came charging through the woods towards you, followed by a girl wearing black and pink, and another boy wearing a green vest like shirt.<br>\r\nStartled you start to run, you head for the woods dirrectly behind you. Your body took off so fast you got a whole five feet before crashing to the ground, and running on all fours was very new to you.<br>\r\n\"Hey look isn't that a Pichu?\" Asked the girl.<br>\r\n\"No...It looks more like a Minum, but I can't tell.\" Said the other boy.<br>\r\n\"Well lets catch it and find out!\" The boy with the hat said. \"Go, Buizel!\" <br>\r\n\"Wait Ash!\" The girl yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weasle-like pokemon came out and got ready to attack you.<br>\r\n\"Buizel, Aqua-jet!\"<br>\r\nThe weasle jumped at you aand water formed around it. It tackled you and you flew through the air, landing next to tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hurt so bad, you were tougher than that, but you couldn't help but cry at the sudden attack.<br>\r\nThe weasle backed off with a sad look on it's face, while the girl ran up to you.<br>\r\nShe picked you up and craddled you in her arms.<br>\r\n\"It's alright, calm down, your not going to get hurt anymore...\" She whispered soothingly.<br>\r\n\"ASH!!!!!! You should be ashamed of yourself, attacking a deffense-less pokemon, how dare you!\" She scolded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found the girl's arm to be quite comfy, but also made you realise that you were also smaller than any other Pichu, youl'd say about half that size. You can fit rather comfortably in one of her arms. She turned to you, and smiled and you melted into her arms. You felt safe in her care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy with the hat came rushing over to you two, he reached out to touch you, saying,\"I'm sorry, I just wanted-\"<br>\r\nYou jumped from the girl's arms and run a couple steps away, befor tripping,.... Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go, it doesn't seem to want us around anymore.\" The other boy said.<br>\r\nWaving good-bye, the girl turned around to leave with the other two.<br>\r\nAutomaticly getting that alone-feeling again, you chase after them. Catching up to them allowed you to get used to slow-running, without falling. <br>\r\n\"Wait!\" You yell. (Yes, it's still pokemon talk to them!)<br>\r\nThey didn't hear you but the Pikachu on the boy's shoulder did, so she got their attention for you. They turned to face you, while you were still a couple feet from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Dramatic run and hug scene*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy with the hat got on a knee and opened up his arms, ready for a hug.<br>\r\nYou zoomed right by him, and jumped straight for the girl. She caught you, and you nuzzled her affectionatly, If you were going to be stuck like this it might as well be with someone who cares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to like you, Dawn!\" The other boy said.<br>\r\nShe was too busy playing with you to respond, she was trying to tickle you. <br>\r\n\"Well?....\" She ask through laughing spats, \"Do you want to come with us?\"<br>\r\nYou nodded, as she took out a pokeball, and tapped on your head.<br>\r\nYou went without a fight, but there was a problem.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n'It's dark in here!!!' You yell.<br>\r\nIt was pitch black, and you were afraid of the dark.<br>\r\n'Too dark...'<br>\r\n'Get me ot of here!!!' You yell<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\nYou were caught, but the ball was sparking. Dawn backed off, as the ball rolled around sparkling. It popped open, and you shot out. Landing on the ground, you shook off the cramped, darkened feeling you got while in there.<br>\r\n\"Whats the matter?\" Asked Dawn quizingly, slightly sad. \"I thought you wanted to come with me?\"<br>\r\nYou kick the ball away from you, and looked at Dawn.<br>\r\n\"He does, but he soesn't seem to like the pokeball, like Pikachu.\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but how am I going to carry you?\"<br>\r\nYou answer her question for her, as you hopped on top of her head. Laying down on the top of her beanie, you let out a sigh of releif.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking around a little more, Ash said, \"Well, he's definetly a Pichu, but why is he blue?\"<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter, he's cuter this way.\" She said with a smile, tickleing you again.<br>\r\n\"We should make camp, It's getting dark.\" Brock said.<br>\r\n\"Alright! Everybody out!\" They all yelled.<br>\r\nAll sorts of Pokemon came blasting out of balls, and you immediatly rush behind Dawn's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who's the new guy?\" The giant turtle thing asked.<br>\r\n\"Crap.....I know.\" The weasle from earlier said, \"I was forced to battle him earlier, and I'm sorry about that. He made me.\" <br>\r\nSuddenly a blue penguin popped in front of you.<br>\r\n\"Why are you hanging onto her like that?\" She asked.<br>\r\n'Too many!' You think as you race up to her head.<br>\r\n\"Hey come down here! I want to play!\" Some squirrel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get it!\" Dawn said with a giggle, \"Introductions first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\nafter the introductions you all had dinner. Then you all talked more, While Pachirisu never let go of you, and nudged you playfully the entire time.<br>\r\nGoing to bed, the all were sent into their pokeballs. You laid down under the covers with Dawn and got comfy. She held you close and whispered goodnight into your ear, as the lights went out. Being in the dark again, you squeeked in fright. Dawn understood almost instantly, and brought you even closer to her, in an unyeilding hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe once again said,<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhh.....It's okay now, nothing will ever hurt you again......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Author's note~ Admit it, If you were in this guys shoes you would so want to be a Pichu.}</span></div></div>",

The Legendary Deoxys, who fell from space and was accepted into the Legends by Arceus...according to the stories you had heard. By now, you're awake enough to comprehend some other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the earlier mentioned test tube, and that the Deoxys was you. You start turning about frantically, unable to take deep breaths due to an insufficient ability to breath. You count instead, which seems to work, and focus on what was happening outside. You float over to the glass, pressing your face and would-be hands against it. There is a group of scientists talking, so you try and hear them through the glass. If you focus, you can hear them easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It was a success. Congratulations, everybody! We've finally replicated a Legendary Pokemon with near-perfect results. I think this is a far better result then the previous Mewtwo, wouldn't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was pretty easy, though. After all, we had Mew and Deoxys DNA already. It would have been more challenging if we cloned, say, Raikou. And we even had to use the mind of that kid instead of making one from scratch like we wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we try that later. We just had to use it to put thoughts into the brain, anyways. No transplant needed. It's body's still self-sustaining at one of our labs, and the longer it's away from it the closer it'll need to be to go back to normal. By the time it finds it's body, it'll have to touch it to go back to human, and that's never going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you calling the kid an it..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I'm talking about a human. It's just a Pokemon now, right? It can't even understand us anymore, I bet. Even if it could, it's far weaker then a simple Tale Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel bubbling anger. Tale Pokemon were weaker versions of Legendary Pokemon, so you were still pretty strong. You could take them on... The conversation fizzed out as you changed your focus, moving back and swinging your tentacle-like arms. You could see that the scientists had noticed your awakening, but that wasn't important. You start pounding on the glass walls with all your strength, the glass eventually starting to crack. The anger was getting stronger. A scientist calmly pressed a button, and you felt the water change as a sleeping chemical was released. With no time left, the anger overflowed into an attack. You darken several shades, creating a shadow around you. The shadow shoots out towards the scientists as though the glass wasn't there. The scientists, to both your horror and amusement, start screaming in terror. The one calling you an 'it' hits a button in his panic, opening the test tube. You fall to the ground, catching yourself as the water in the tank goes everywhere. You're tired, but the chemical is wearing off. You get up, feeling a bit unstable on your legs. Can you even get out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you can. You're speed forme, right? They'll never catch you. You start running. They try and catch you, but they would never stand a chance. Eventually you get out, and find yourself far, far away from the lab. Where were you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Icicles were all over, right above the snow-covered floor, but you were focusing on your friends and decorations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of frozen bodies, Pokemon and Human alike, were connected to the ceiling or walls. Some were sad, others scared, and others looked to be asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have smirked again if you could, running your small hands over the walls as you headed ever deeper into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you find?</span></div></div>",

She was sitting on a tree stump and singing with a beautiful voice, which you probably wouldn't have known to be so beautiful if you weren't a pokemon yourself. Suddenly, the vulpix stops her singing and looks toward you with a smile. She jumps down from the tree stump and approaches you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings human... Er, well... I guess that you aren't exactly human anymore, now are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because my mother is the one who brought you here! There were some... Unfortunate complications along the way, however...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why I'm a ditto now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why did your mother bring me here in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know the full reason myself, but I'll take you to her so that you can ask her yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, lead the way Miss Vulpix...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, call me Kitsune!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay. Then lead the way Kitsune!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitsune then nodded and began leading you into a forest. It took a while, but eventually you arrived at your destination: Kitsune's home. It was apparently nothing more than an enormous tree!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Kitsune? Am I missing something here? Isn't this just a tree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the untrained eye, it would appear so... Follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitsune then proceeded to walk toward the tree trunk. You thought she was going to bonk her head on the wood, but she simply passed through it and went <i>inside</i> the trunk! You decided to follow her lead and walk into the tree as well. As you had hoped, you simply passed through it and appeared inside what appeared to be a massive living room. The first thing that you saw was Kitsune, who was standing next to a shiny<span class=\"clgrey\"> silver-furred </span>ninetales. You assumed that said ninetales was her mother. You were about to say hello to her, but she beat you to the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">former</font> human, My name is Kyubi. I believe that you have already met my daughter Kitsune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss Kyubi. My name is [your name], Nice to meet you. If you don't mind me asking, why did you bring me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes... The reason I've brought you here... You see [name], while most humans are kind to pokemon, not all are. There are those who care only for capturing rare pokemon and selling them for  profit. I brought you here so that you could be the bridge between pokemon and humanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Umm, Kitsune said something about 'complications' in bringing me here being the reason why I'm a ditto now. What exactly went wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well [name], when I brought you here, I attempted to give you the ability to speak our language. I failed, however, and this is the result. As long as you remain in this world, you shall be bound to that form forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so when I finish my mission and you send me back home, I'll go back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. However, being a ditto could work out for the better. You will be able to transform into any person or pokemon that you've seen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does that mean that I can also turn back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've looked in a mirror during your lifetime, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then yes, you can. Keep in mind though that a ditto cannot remain permanently transformed. Eventually you will tire from prolonged transformation and return to the form of a ditto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... I figured that it wouldn't be that easy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things never are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right! Okay Kyubi, I guess that I'll do this for you. It's not like I have much choice in the matter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,[name]. Your support is greatly appreciated. I suggest that you do some preparations for your mission first, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what do you think that I should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that you should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sitting in the grass no a blanket, munching on sandwiches with a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the girl you were following you notice for the first time just how pretty she is, her golden red hair falling down over her shoulders like sunlight spun into threads.

So lost were you in your thoughts that you had missed the fact that you were now literally almost to town, only a small bridge separating you from it, though on that bridge stood a figure who obviously was a point of concern for your companion.

They looked tough two, and for a second you thought you might have made a mistake wanting to fight them, but then that girl started laughing again. So full of herself, so sure of victory, that you just started burning with rage, your eyes closing tightly to hold back the flash flood of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you opened them again your body was shifting already, though you soon figured out that you weren't becoming either of her two pokemon, as you grew a tail, and you could literally feel your body growing hotter as it changed.

How'd that thing become a Charizard?\" asked Clara, and you shared her expression as you looked over your new form, and then down at the Venusaur, who was still facing her pokemon, getting ready for the coming battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus new guy. You don't want her to win do you?\" it asked, or rather she asked, the voice from this one about the same as that of the Charizard, Bombshell, though a bit less deep.

Studying her face as you looked over your shoulder you decided it was her eyes, which were brighter, and had more warmth to them than Clara's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Venusaur, use Solar Beam!\" she shouted, and the pokemon beside you hunched down, the flower on its back vibrating a bit as it started to collect light inside it. Clara, still off balance from the twin shocks that you gave her, issued no orders to her Machamp, who literally stood there, flexing his muscles in an attempt to intimatdate you, before your partner kicked her legs up and a beam of concentrated light blasted the thing into the creek beside the Magnaton, giving it a bit of a shock itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\" Clara cried out as she noticed the battle was already over.

First we find you snuck out of your room again, then Grandpa tells me my pokeballs are missing, then to top it all off someone says they saw you walking out of town into the woods!\" he shouts the last part, obviously the woods being a place that was off limits to Anna for some reason, yet you remember your famous trainers, and one of them was Prof. Oak's grandson, Gary, who, though he looks quite a bit older, in his mid to late thirties, this guy obviously is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you come back into the lab carrying a pokemon in your arms. Tell me, did you pick it up in the woods?\" he demands, and makes a grab for you, but Anna turns, protecting you from his grasp, and he seems almost ready to hit her for a moment, though then he closes his eyes and curls his hand into a fist while taking a deep breath, calming himself down. You notice that he holds it in for a ten count, a common anger control technique, before letting it out with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I won't yell at you anymore Anna, but you're in big trouble. Now drop that Ditto off for your Grandfather and return the pokeballs you took.

Looking up at her you peer around the lab several times, seeing it to be a place full of sharp angles and shiny surfaces, exactly like one would expect for one of the premier pokemon labs in the country, though it felt, cold to you, and you weren't sure you wanted to spend a night here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't get a chance to say anything else to you though, as her father puts his arm around her, and then guides her out the door, as if he were afraid that she might try to run away again just on the walk back to her house. Following her with your eyes you can actually see her home out of one of the windows near the front of the lab, Gary obviously having chosen his house based off it's location being very close to his grandfather's lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to yourself you start to take a closer look at the pokeballs beside you, and realize that there's six of them in total, all of them having come from inside her pouch, meaning she had three others that you hadn't seen yet. Or rather, her father did. These were his pokemon, not her's, she'd taken them for whatever reason and then run away, likely trying to get as far away as possible from home, only to run into you, a pokemon with abilities far beyond the norm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down on the hard counter you start to curl up, making your already tiny form even smaller as you sort of fold your body into itself. All in all it had been a tiring day, and outside you can see the sun just setting over the horizon.

He seemed to be worried about something too, as he looked around with a gaze that was searching, and then, staring at his hand in his pocket, you realized there was a needle in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, where's that new pokemon Anna brought in,\" said the assistant, and you wondered for a split second what he meant by that. Had someone seen her put you down on the counter beside the tray, or had Anna's little outing been sanctioned by her great grandfather, which would of course explain why her father was so infuriated, his whole family working against him to get Anna out into the world of pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you another second or so after this to realize that the needle in his pocket is likely meant for you, a standard procedure at the Lab in your town being to get a blood sample from new pokemon when they first come in, though with some, like Muck or the metal and rock pokemon it was a chiseling rather than an actual blood sample.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on this you are torn between several emotions. You hate needles, never been able to stand them, and you certainly didn't want to get pricked as a Ditto, when it felt like a good breeze could tear your body apart. But Anna was expecting you to stay here, and if you left she was the only one you could go to for the night, which might get her in even more trouble with her father if he found out about it.

Did Anna not catch anything today?\" asks the lab assistant, scratching behind his head with the hand holding the needle and pricking himself, which caused him to squeak a little bit, and then laugh at what he'd just done. Sighing in defeat he grabbed the tray and took it away, walking back down the hall. Waiting until you heard three slams of the sliding doors you made a run for the front, which slid open for you, despite your stature, and allowed you to run outside into open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking several deep breaths, feeling like some sort of spy, you start to look around, interested to note that this town seemed quite dead at the moment. There were lights on in houses, and several of the lab windows glowed, though you couldn't see inside them. However, there was no foot traffic. No one making moving outside. Not seeing any reason to stay outside yourself you start to move over towards Anna's house, which you remembered seeing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding up to the wall you closed your eyes, hoping that your sixth sense worked with humans too, and indeed it did. You can feel Anna moving towards the back of the house, to a room that had an open window. Of course, the front door is hanging open too, and it offers an easier entry, though more possibility of being seen by Gary.

Probably very good really, considering a head of a company could deem anything to be the sort of discovery that changed the world, though this was a chance you couldn't dare to pass up, and looking at Anna you saw the whole train of thought follow it through to the end in her mind as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I guess this guy and I are going after Oak, Victor. If you could give me a new pokedex then we'll set off today. We should be in the city by the middle of next week,\" she told him, and he looked at her for a moment, then at you, probably trying to guess just how long it would take her to get there from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the pokedex you got for specimen gathering? Why won't it work for you now?\" asked the assistant after a moment or two, nodding his head as he spoke, agreeing with her travel time assessment, though it also put Anna in a position to lie and make something up, or tell him the truth of the other day, and looking at you she seemed to ask you if she could, after all, it was your secret.</span></div></div>",

You were riding, comfortably in her pouch towards the edge of town, the top of it open so that you could look out on the beautiful day outside, with the sky blue as could be, with only a stray fluffy white cloud here and there in it, as the pidgey chirped somewhere in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, it just feels so liberating to be going off like this,\" she said as she made her way across the bridge, her foot steps clanking on the wood. You had to agree with her. You had never felt like this before, never having taken a pokemon journey yourself. It was quite a rush, though you wondered if she had any money on her, as food would be a problem if she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still the child, huh Anna?\" came a familiar voice, and your view whipped around back towards the way you had come, tossing the contents of the pouch about, before you looked out on a scene that caused you some serious deja vu. Standing on the bridge was Clara, that smug grin on her face, and you remembered how much you wanted to hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word is you're going off today on your pokemon journey. At least, that's what your dad told mine, and guess what, my daddy's said I can go too. He even gave me one of his old pokemon as my starter, as a going away present, and of course, some money to start me off too. Since I know your dad didn't give you any, I thought I might offer to battle,\" she said, though you and Anna both looked at her in a distrustful manner, knowing she was getting at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win, I'll give you half of my money, but since you don't have any, if I win, I get that little pokemon you used on me yesterday,\" she declared, and then flashed a few coins in the air. Anna, caught between her need for funds at the moment, and her fear of losing you this quickly, opened the flap of her pouch, and voicelessly asked if you wanted to.</span></div></div>",

The pokeball leapt into the air, and a bright light shot out from inside it as it cracked open, soon resolving itself into a nearly seven foot tall weasel like creature with a mane of flame around its neck, roaring as it looked down at you, knowing somehow that you were its opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nervous yet?\" taunted Clara as Typhlosion stepped off the bridge towards the two of you, and in response you leaped forward yourself, sailing three feet forward and holding yourself in front of Anna protectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't get past me,\" you tell the opponent, as you focus yourself inward again, and soon your body glows with power, shifting and rearranging itself as it assumes a new form, a more powerful looking one than your normal tiny body, as you focus your mind on the pokemon form you think will be able to fight this creature best.</span></div></div>",

Use Quick Attack Typhlosion, and end this in one shot!\" she shouted, and you had to commend her on strategy. Another trainer might have tried to still use one of their pokemon's more powerful, but less effective attacks, considering your types. This was the sign of a good trainer, though you kind of wished she weren't so good as you suddenly felt a hard blow to your chest, falling backwards and off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Down in one strike, good work Typhlosion,\" Clara told her pokemon, who had never appeared to move, his speed during the attack faster than the blink of an eye. Still she was highly overconfident. The attack, thanks to your defense had done very little damage to you, though she assumed that you being on your back meant you were down for the count, which certainly the case here, though you felt strangely winded, which you hadn't expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his lab, Victor was again staring at your screen, obviously trying to enhance it a bit farther to get an exact reading on your stats when he scrolled over the rest of your data, suddenly looking at the top statistic, and then scratching his chin, obviously having trouble accepting what he was seeing on his monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stats that high, and an HP score of only four?

Okay, since he took that attack so well, how about you hit it with a Flame Wheel this time?\" asked Clara, and Typhlosion looked over his shoulder at her for a moment, before nodding.

That's a victory Clara. Your pokemon's unable to battle,\" declared Anna as she wrapped her arms around you neck, and kissed you on your cheek, causing you to blush for a second as you put one clawed head behind your head, scratching your hard skull, just before your own body became suffused with light, and you changed back to your tiny, handheld form, sitting on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph,\" responded Anna's beaten rival as she walked over. Her face was easy to read, as she wasn't trying to even cover her distaste with her defeat. Still she didn't object as she stood right in front of Anna, and then held out one fist in front of her.

Then, defeated, but not beaten, Clara stalked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our first of hopefully many victories.

I'll pick up some food there too, since in a small town like this they carry both pokemon and human supplies,\" she told you, and then placed you back inside her pouch. You didn't doubt her word either, even though the sign reading Pokemart was the only one visible on the building. Several smaller towns along certain Routes combined a pokemon store with a general store, just to save space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking inside Anna started to grab what she needed from the shelves of the store, including a small backpack to carry her supplies in, taking her pokeballs and pokedex out of her pouch and placing them in press designed pokes while smiling down at you, leaving you with a now open carrying case. She even grabbed three small pads, designed for clothes, and slipped them in there around you, for your comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditto,\" you say, both to yourself and her, knowing she can't understand you anyway.

Instead, I'm going to wish you luck. I'm sure that's what your mother would have wanted me to do.

Anna, giggling, moved it closer and almost shoved it into the things mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, go on, eat up. There's plenty more where that came from,\" she told it, and you watched an immediate effect in the creature as it got some food down its throat, leaping into the air it trilled as it flew around, working the food into its system. Absently, Anna withdrew another treat from the box, and you thought she was going to give it to Lightwing, but then, suddenly, she held it out to you, and you realized then that you hadn't eaten since the night before, your belly giving off a growl.</span></div></div>",

Anna, watching you eat, laughs again as she walks over to a tree and leans back against it, setting her pack beside her and drawing out one of the wrapped sandwiches to munch on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, keep eating like that and we'll have you nice and big in no time,\" she says through a mouth full of bologna and cheese, poking you in your stomach and then setting her attention on her meal as Lightwing lands beside her. Looking up at Lightwing you are a bit struck by the size difference, with her head almost four times your height off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are pretty small for a Ditto. And you sounded weird before too. Tell me, are you not from around here?\" asks the Pidgey, and you stare at it. Considering it was only a low leveled pokemon, you had expected it to sound like a child, but the voice that came out of its beak as it looked down at you was that of a grown woman, at least half again Anna's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's because I'm not a Ditto,\" you tell her as you smile, and she gets an odd expression on her face, leaning down, causing you to move back a bit, afraid she was going to snap you up to taste you, but instead getting a deep sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell like the Ditto's around here,\" she tells you as she leans back, regaining her full height and you consider for a moment. Lightwing seems bright, but would she really be able to understand you being human. It might be best to just make something simpler up, and face consequences later if she figures it out.</span></div></div>",

Looking over at her, you find she's still eating her snack, watching the two of you talk. You grin at her, and she returns it, likely having no idea what thoughts are going through your head, or even what you're telling Lightwing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before that I was a human boy. I went to school, ate, slept, and lived with my parents. That was the sum total of my life for the most part. I wanted to go on a pokemon training adventure of course, just to see how far I could go with it, but I didn't have drive to go do it,\" admitting that, you sigh, as you really hadn't though about it like that before, merely having pushed it aside every time it had come up in a discussion with your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After running into Anna, she tried to battle me, but I took down several of her dad's pokemon, who were fully leveled, and then, after she started crying and I went over to comfort her, I turned into her too, and got my story out, or at least, enough of it,\" you now realize she didn't even know your name or where you were from, just that you were human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you wished you'd told her your parents phone number, so she could call them and tell them you're all right, but then you shake the thought aside. You don't want your parents to see you like this, and just telling them you're alright would only make them worry even more. Heck, they might even think Anna kidnaped you somehow, and send the police after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, together we went to her home, tried to find her great grandfather, who's the most famous Pokemon Prof. in the world, only to discover he was gone. So now we're on a pokemon journey, with me as her starter, and we're gonna go find Prof. Oak and set everything right again, or so I hope,\" you finally finish, and look at Lightwing, wondering if she understood all that, and, probably more importantly, whether or not she believed it all.</span></div></div>",

Listening to her words, you sigh and turn away. Not like you really expected her to believe such a wild tale, even if she understood it which, considering her words, you think she must have done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, that story's just a bit too wild to be something someone makes up. Especially since there are much easier lies to tell that would have had the same effect,\" she says at last and before you really know what you're doing you leap over on top of her beak and give it a hug. Of course, when you come back to yourself you instantly let go, and back off a bit, blushing as you turn your back to Lightwing's stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks Lightwing, that means a lot to me that you believe me,\" you say at last, trying to calm yourself down, and then you suddenly feel a pressing coming from behind you, and spinning yourself around, you find that the Pidgey is nuzzling into you with her beak, almost in a motherly fashion that gets you to hugging her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, now I really wish I understood pokemon,\" came the voice of Anna, and looking over you see that she's been watching the two of you this whole time, and placing te last bite of her sandwich into her mouth she smiles at the two of you, getting up and crushing the wrapper of her snack in her hand before placing it inside one of the pockets of her pack, designed for just such items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well I guess you should go back in your pokeball for now Lightwing,\" she said, returning the Pidgey to the ball and placing it inside her pouch, before leaning down and scooping you up. Smiling at you she seems to be about to give you an affectionate kiss, but holds off, slipping you into the pouch beside the pokeball, and then starting to walk. Luckily, her pouch was designed to hold the orb in place, and so it doesn't come any closer to you as you snuggle into the pads, wondering what Anna will run into next.</span></div></div>",

You can of course sense the other pokemon, all along the trail, and sometimes you tense when one starts to move closer, but then they always back off, running back into the woods literally just before they come to the path. You know they're no scared of the road through the woods either, because when you're on it you can feel pokemon both behind and ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, guess they're still scared of me, even without Daddy's pokemon,\" she comments to herself, though the comment answers your question. Of course the pokemon avoid her. They're smart enough to recognize this girl as a hunter of sorts, capturing specimens for Oak's lab along the route. Heck, she'd probably been doing that for months now, and after a while the pokemon learned to recognize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, maybe we'll have more battles along the next route,\" she says at least and you look out of the pouch to study the scene before you. Ahead is a town, cast in the light of the dusk, and the setting sun no longer visible on the horizon, though it's light continues to wash over the area for the moment. This place, though bigger than Anna's hometown, is still not really a city, though in plain view you can see a Pokemon Center, and almost right next to it, a Gym, with three odd curved symbols on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Mac's Gym. The three symbols represent Earth, Wind, and Fire, his three Elements of Life,\" she explains, this time you know it's to you as she opens the flap to the pouch and stares in at you with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda figured you wouldn't know that. It's not a very famous Gym, but Mac's supposed to be one of the strongest Gym Leaders in this region, and that means that beat him is gonna take everything we've got, so how about we go rest first?\" the last is actually a question, and you smile up at her, sliding over to the edge of the pouch and looking towards the two buildings, trying to decide what you want to do for now. Both appear to be open, and after a second of consideration you point towards.....</span></div></div>",

As I walked up to the door I got shoved aside by a group of other trainers who must have wanted to get the strongest Pokemon so after standing up and brushing myself down I took a deep breath and stepped inside, I took a second for my eyes to adjust but when they did there were the Pokemon being surrounded by the trainers but that's not what I was looking at, I was looking at a tall figure at the back of the room leaning against the back wall which gently nodded its head at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen officer Jenny came in to the room and had all the trainers gather round her and since I was a trainer I joined them \"okay listen up most of you have chosen you partner but their is one more Pokemon that you can choice from\" \"ha I bet it's a weak Pokemon for that kid over there\" a big fat trainer said to his mates clearly pointing at you. \"This is the last Pokemon we have so if you don't get one today you come next week\" all around you saw the trainers who didn't have Pokemon make their way to the front \"well I guess I'll have to come back next week as I can't really push past all these people but let's see what it is\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw officer jenny turn around to face the figure in the corner and made a hand signal to tell him to come over and as this tall figure stepped in to the light people were shock at what this Pokemon looked like but soon all the trainers which didn't have Pokemon started running towards him like he was the last toy on the shelf but they were all stopped in midair as this figure walk past them and up to you, he then got down on one knee and bowed his head in front of you and said telepathically to you \"will you please be my partner kind trainer\" you stood there thinking while everyone stared at you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

As you travel around, you can always embrace  this wonderful gift, or try and get back to normal and away from this horrible curse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The character can understand  both pokemon &amp; humans, but only other pokemon can understand him.<br>\r\n-No killing the main character<br>\r\n-Vore, Sex, exc. is allowed if it isn't overdone.<br>\r\n-Try to add atleast 2-3 sentences, and don't add anything too large(10 paragraphs 10 sentences long)<br>\r\n-I do edit, but only minor things.<br>\r\n-If you add pokemon with the \"Other\" Option, atleast make the first chapter of each pokemon you add. If not, You Will NOT get GP's.<br>\r\n-Please, Please, PLEASE, Try to make the character Gender nuetral. Gender before becoming a pokemon is irrelevent, and it can turn people away from adding if the main character is male, while they are female, or vice versa. Even in situations with single gendered pokemon (For example, Miltank is female only) either make it nuetral, or the starting gender is the same as the pokemon's gender. This is NOT a transgender story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDISCLAIMER: I normally give out gift points for additions. However, it's the time of the month again that I'm forced to renew my Paid membership. I need to save up 199,500 Gift Points or my portfolio and all my interactives go bye bye.</td>",
