Ruled by infamous underground organizations, this beacon of defecation had little hope of recovery. Freaks and mobsters alike waged war over the fate of the city, and there was little resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne man however, stood up for justice. That one man was the legendary <b>Batman</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman waged his own war against crime and injustice, battling to save the city from desolation. Soon the criminals of Gotham recognized the dark fist of purity, and only a few notorious figures stood to rebel against this ever-growing shadow of justice. He was soon joined by others willing to place their own lives on the line for the restoration of their beloved city. It looked as though Gotham city would finally be cured from the disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst its revival, the city had witnessed many remarkable stories of strength and courage, but few were more bizarre than those that can be found in this interactive story. No one was spared from humiliation, and few were provided the power of domination. Whether it be for better or worse, the dark knight himself was amidst the list of victims of such weird circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which story type would you prefer to follow?</span></div></div>",

Whether it be three feet tall or one foot tall, or even a mere three inches in size, the dark knight struggled to cope under the watchful, looming eyes of his allies and enemies alike. One of his most infamous battles was against one of his most deadliest adversaries, the venomous <b>Poison Ivy</b>. The beautiful eco-terrorist was obsessed with plants, botany and environmentalism, utilizing toxins and pheromones for her criminal activities. One fateful night, the dark knight was lured into an abandoned cottage on the outskirts of Gotham city, where Poison Ivy prepared to strike her opponent in perhaps her most powerful plot yet, with the intentions of reducing her enemy to utter humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps one of his more closer calls, Batman fell victim to a trap, courtesy of his more unusual opponents, <b>Catwoman</b>. Sharing a confusing relationship with the caped crusader, Catwoman was an accomplished burglar with malicious intentions. A rare artifact caught the attention of the mischievous feline, an item that she could use to her advantage. Even if the dark knight arrived on the scene, she knew that, once he arrived, he would be no match for such a powerful artifact, capable of total domination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA former psychiatrist, Dr. Harleen Quinzel, now known as <b>Harley Quinn</b> became obsessively fixated on her first patient, her current boyfriend, the <b>Joker</b>. Under orders, Harley Quinn managed to steal a high-tech shrink ray. Using this device, Harley lured the caped crusader into her clutches, where she planned to place her boyfriend's arch nemesis into her dirty hands. Harley however, had plans of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Catwoman however, was forced to endure such a minuscule point of view, more significantly with her battle against the <b>Riddler</b>. With rumors circulating around the mysterious disappearance of the dark knight, the Riddler suspected Catwoman as the culprit to his demise. As a result, he teamed up with the <b>Mad Hatter</b> to lure the cat burglar into their maze, where she was forced to consume size-manipulating substances, similarly to that from <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, in order to access certain points in the maze. This was truly a puzzling position for Catwoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which story would you like to follow?</span></div></div>",

The truck contained a certain species of plants, new to the country, with strange qualities. I investigated the crime scene where I detected a familiar pheromone in the atmosphere surrounding the area. I followed the trace, and I managed to track Ivy to her latest hideout; a small, abandoned cottage, on the outskirts of the city, surrounded by lush woodlands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I arrived at the scene, everything was quiet. Too quiet. Ivy's scent was detectable, almost too easy to detect. Something was up. I knew that I was walking into a trap, I just had no idea what I was bringing myself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore making my move, I contacted the police, prepared to capture the criminal before her crimes grow out of my control. The police would arrive at the scene in about an hour. This meant that I had only one hour to subdue Ivy before they could take offensive action. I had no time to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered the cottage and, to my surprise, the interior was completely restored. It was a little dream cottage out in the countryside, rich in forestation. Then I detected the presence of my target, lurking in the kitchen. I entered the kitchen, prepared for anything, until there she was, hands behind her back, approaching me with an innocent smile on her deformed lips. Surrounded by shelves loaded with piles of dust and plant pots, I didn't like it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why Batman,\"</i> she politely remarked, <i>\"What a pleasant surprise!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was reason to suspect her intentions. I saw through her innocent facade and inquired about her latest plot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk, she revealed the reason for her actions. The plants she stole were from an endangered species, very few remained on the entire planet. They contained powerful qualities. The pheromones they produced were capable of size manipulation, capable of both increasing and reducing the size of any living creature, including humans. Skeptical, I was not convinced that such power could exist, but I knew that I had to keep my guard up, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could take any further action however, Ivy suddenly made her move. She swiped her hands forward, revealing some sort of powder in her palms, and blew the powder into my face. I realized that this was no ordinary powder, and immediately, during a brief moment of confusion, I forced Ivy to relinquish her hands. She stepped back, pressing her back against the wall, relishing her accomplishment. For a moment, I was stunned, my vision was momentarily impaired. Besides the arrogant laughter of my adversary, all I could hear was a loud ringing sound in my ears. I could even feel my muscles twitching at the stress that I was enduring. I felt faint and disorientated. All I could do was hold my fists up, prepared for a possible fight with Ivy, and shake the pain off. However, this was not what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I regained my senses, I realized that something remarkable had happened.</span></div></div>",

Temporarily blinded by the blow, I prepared for a possible attack from my deadly adversary. But to my concern, she did not strike. Instead she continued to laugh maniacally, proud of her disorientating offense. I soon regained my senses, and then I realized why she behaved so triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting to look into the eyes of my opponent, I opened my eyes, and I was horrified by what I saw. Instead, I found myself looking directly at her foot, which was remarkably huge, even larger than me. Confirming the worst, I looked up high, only to see a huge green giantess looking down at me with a wicked smile on her red lips. Looking around, I noticed that my surroundings had also increased in size, recognizing the wooden shelves upon the walls, once within reach, now seemed like they towered over me. At that moment, I realized that everything Poison Ivy had told me was the truth, she had successfully used some sort of substance, produced by the rare plants she stole earlier, and managed to shrink me. From my feeble point of view, I estimated that I had to be no bigger than one foot in size, the same size as my adversary's foot to be more precise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see Ivy's humongous legs rising. Feeling confident with her vantage point, she slowly approached me, her massive feet drawing ever closer. I stepped back, overwhelmed by the tremendous size. Noticing me doing this, Ivy saw the fear in my tiny figure and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, well, well,\"</i> she remarked as her massive figure cast a dark shadow over me, <i>\"Not so tough now, are we? What's wrong? Feeling a little small, are we Batman?\"</i> She suddenly started to bend over, raising her hand, as if she intended to scoop me up from the ground. Outraged, I tried to avoid her grip, but unfortunately I could not resist her awesome might, she was far too big to avoid, as she tightened her grip around me, I felt as if I was caught in a vice as she lifted me up to her face. I was awestruck by the fact that I wasn't even bigger than her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew my close to her lips, my own head almost swallowed by her immense lips. I was suddenly blinded by the glimmering shine of her teeth as she revealed a devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You see, Batman,\"</i> she added, continuing to answer my question from earlier, <i>\"These precious plants were being sent to the Botanical Garden in Gotham North. The vile, little man who bought them was a mister <b>Nolan Black</b>, but I know a secret about him. Unknown to the rest of this putrid city, Mr. Black conducts experiments in the gardens, hurting valuable plants and murdering my precious babies. So, I've been conducting my own little experiment right here, and I have to admit,\"</i> she chuckled, <i>\"You made out to be the perfect test subject! And now with my greatest enemy no longer a threat, I'm going to pay Mr. Black an unwelcome visit.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked by her devious plot, Poison Ivy failed to realize that I had planted a plastic explosive on her wrist. It was fortunate for me that, while I shrunk, so did my outfit and equipment, so with the hope of ruining Ivy's plans, I activated the explosive. The blast hardly left a scratch, but did enough damage for her release her grip and roll me into her other hand, where she held another pile of powder. I held my breath and threw as much as I could into the face of my giant opponent, who managed to inhale some of the powder through her mouth. I anticipated the reaction.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately however, she endured a slightly different alteration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to escape sight, I jumped from her open hands, gliding a seemingly safe distance from the giantess and landing safely back upon the windowsill. I turned around and, to my horror, I was unable to settle the score. In fact, Poison Ivy gained an even greater advantage, growing another two feet in height. If she wanted to, she could suffocate me between her toes, that was how big she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping to her knees in search for me, Ivy continued to gloat. <i>\"Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to mention. The effects of the powder are completely random. There's no telling how much you will shrink, or grow, but I think you've realized this by now. It was awfully generous of you to give the woman the advantage though.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could continue any further however, she noticed me, on the windowsill, climbed back to her feet and, before I could react, swiped another blast of powder at me. I tried my best not to inhale, but I couldn't resist, the aroma was far too delectable. Before I knew it however, to my dismay, unlike my adversary, I shrunk even further. From my estimation, I couldn't no bigger than a mere three inches! Horrified by this transformation, I felt another cold shiver as my vision was clouded by the looming figure of Poison Ivy, now even bigger than ever. Compared to me, she looked even bigger than Wayne Tower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips while doing so, Ivy attempted to smack me with her giant palm. Just in time, I managed to dodge the crushing blow, avoiding a humiliating death, squashed under the palm of an insane woman obsessed with plants. Before she could attempt further damage however, I had little other choice but to dive out of the window and glide as far as I could into the lush garden. I landed hard on the soil, the night sky suddenly disappeared, clouded by the towering foliage. Most of the plants in the garden were three times the size of me, some of them even looked bigger than the buildings in Gotham city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being lost in what seemed like an immense jungle of a garden, there was a moment of relief, knowing that the massive, seven foot tall Poison Ivy lost track of me. Before I could regain my composure however, I heard a familiar voice echo from a distance, thundering through the garden like lightning. I could tell, from the thunder in her voice, that she was annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why Batman,\"</i> she yelled in an ironic volume, as if she knew that I was close, <i>\"Aren't you gonna stay behind for dinner?\"</i></span></div></div>",

I knew that she realized that she would be better off letting me return to her. Realizing this, she had no intention of hunting me down in the garden. But I couldn't just hide for the rest of the night. Not at three inches tall. Not ever. I had to return and fight. The police were scheduled to arrive on the scene in less than an hour. Ivy had the only substance capable of returning me to my normal size. If the police apprehend her, they would confiscate the rare plants as evidence, leaving me here in this lush garden with no contact or direction. I would never be found. And what if Ivy escaped with the substance? She would be capable of turning Gotham city into her ant farm! Despite her tremendous advantage, I had to fight her, for the sake of Mr. Black, for the sake of the police, for the sake of Gotham city, and for the sake of my own well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard not to be distracted by the lush plants that loomed over me like huge trees, but I was completely awestruck by the world from my new point of view. Despite these distractions however, I trekked through the vast garden until, finally, I reached the cottage. Cautiously I crawled under the door, as silent as I had ever been before. It was a struggle, but I managed to climb onto the top shelf on the wall of the kitchen. There, I could see the giantess, Poison Ivy, sat on a wooden chair next to a table, fiddling with a dash of powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table, I noticed a potted plant, one of the plants that produced the powerful substance responsible for the whole ordeal. To my luck, I realized that, upon the shelf, I was standing next to another potted plant. Realizing that, whatever she was doing, Ivy would soon draw her attention to that very plant, I acted quickly. I climbed onto the pot and researched the plant. I discovered that the entire bud was full of the unique powder. I reached my hand in and grabbed as much as I could. With each handful, I filled a pair of empty containers from my utility belt. Turning away from the plant, I then realized that Ivy had left the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, I lost sight of Ivy, until she suddenly popped her head from beneath my view, my vision was impaired by the immense size of her glamorous face. <i>\"There you are,\"</i> she sighed, <i>\"I knew you couldn't resist me, little bat!\"</i> I could see, from her gleaming eyes, that she had dreadful intentions for me. She smirked, and raised her hand in an attempt to grab me once again, her hand now even larger than I remembered, but before she could, I released one of my containers and blasted it in her face.</span></div></div>",

Her fingers grew bigger and stronger, almost crushing me in the process. Struggling to breathe, I watched as Poison Ivy, still stunned by the blast of powder, shot up high. Her head crashed through the roof of the cottage, completely destroying her makeshift laboratory in the process. Ivy continued to grow and grow until she stood approximately thirty feet in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill stunned, Ivy failed to realize that she had released her tight grip, but standing there in the middle of her immense palm, looking up to the heavens at the skyscraper of the evil woman, I was disheartened. I had become a mere speck of dust compared to the god-like size of Poison Ivy! From what I saw, there was no possible way I could defeat her with such an astonishing size difference. While I was a mere three inches big, Ivy had become a giantess, capable of posing an enormous threat to the people of Gotham. Looking around, there wasn't even any possible way I could escape her massive grasp. Out of desperation, all I could do was rush to the edge of her hand and dive off before she could crush me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining her vision, Ivy was pleased by the result of her growth.

As I dove for cover I managed to crane my neck up, hoping she didn't spot me. Her legs seemed to stretch forever.

I could see her city block sized rear slowly descending towards me. Her tight outfit leaving little to the imagination. \"Wow.\" Snapping out of it, I had to think of something fast. It is only a matter of time until she finds me again. I needed a way of distracting her so I could return myself to normal, and cut her down in size.

Suddenly, her entire body started quaking and trembling. Oh boy, here it comes, I thought to myself. Without warning she began to expand at an alarming rate. Arching her back and resting her hands behind her she began growing bigger and bigger. I couldn't help but watch for a second as the already enormous Poison Ivy stretched larger and larger. She seemed to be almost in ecstasy. Then I realized something I had overlooked... I was now trapped between her giant, growing legs. I took off running towards her growing feet, hoping to make a escape. I heard her moan and noticed she was growing even faster now. Still running, I looked over my shoulder only to see her giant growing crotch closing in on me.<br>\r\nGetting stepped on or eaten is one thing, but now she's going to crush me with her growing crotch? I just can't catch a break tonight...<br>\r\nI was now between her thighs. I stopped and turned to see the massive wall of green closing in on me. Another good/bad idea came across me. I quickly launched another growth bomb towards her face. It went off right under her nose, causing her to grow even faster, and fall completely onto her back, arms and legs stretched out. \"<i>Oh my god YES!</i>\" She screamed.

And there I saw it, My path of escape. There was what looked like a small \"cave\" in front of me. There was just enough gap between her butt that i could fit. I quickly ran for it. I was now underneath her giant growing butt. Luckily for me I had made her big enough that I could fit between her butt cheeks and not be crushed. There was just enough light for me to see. I glanced up to see the \"ceiling\" of my cave slowly rising higher and higher. I could hear her moaning and the ground was shaking around me. \"I sure hope I didn't overdue it.\"<br>\r\nFinally after running for about 2 minutes I was able to make it out from under her butt and to the arch of her back. Suddenly, she slowly began to sit up. I turned and looked back at my \"cave\" and watched it disappear.<br>\r\n\"<i>You are such a fool!</i>.\" I heard the loudest voice ever. \"<i>Come on batty, give me one more! Make me even bigger! Growing feels sooo good!</i>\" She cooed in a sarcastic, yet seductive voice. \" <i>I will crush this entire city under my thumb! And it's all thanks to you Batmite!</i>\" Fearing the worst, I slowly turned and saw her impossibly huge back, still growing but nowhere near as fast. It  covered my entire view. She must have been close to 1000 feet tall. I watched, completely mesmerized by her sheer size as she slowly got to her feet. I got sick to my stomach knowing I had given her so much power. I was nothing but speck to her. She was impossibly huge. I stared up and up and up and up. I could Just make out the bottom of her curvy butt that I was Just under moments ago. She was a goddess. An incredibly evil and crazy one at that.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think I over did it.\" I thought to myself. But hey, at least she couldn't see me, right?<br>\r\n\"Now its time for the good part of my plan.\" I pulled out the 2 remaining bombs I had filled with growth powder earlier and opened them And inhaled as much powder as I could. Almost instantly I could feel a tingling and began stretching taller. It kind of does feel good... Wasting no time I bolted towards the remains of the cottage which somehow survived(somewhat) Ivy's monstrous growth spurt. As I dove over the remains of it I noticed I had finally returned to my normal size. \"Well it's about time I'm back to normal.\" I muttered to myself. I scanned the remains of the cottage for more plants. Lucky for me I spotted 2 of them that survived, both slightly different looking from one another in the corner. I quickly made my way towards them, stumbling over debris. Almost as if on cue I heard a thunderous BOOM. Then another BOOM. Then some evil laughter.</span></div></div>",

She slowly slid her legs farther apart, causing the ground around me to shake. My jaw dropped as all  I could do was stare straight up at her crotch and butt. She had finally stopped growing but she must be close to 1100 feet tall. \"Now what is she doing?\" \"I really need to stop ending up underneath her.\" I muttered under my breath as I watched her slowly spreading her legs farther apart.<br>\r\n\"<i>Batty, if your down there somewhere you really did a number on my back</i>.\" I watched on in awe and horror as her massive form slowly bent over, bringing her giant  hands to the ground. Once again mesmerized by this evil beauty, I took in the view.  Her impossibly long legs extended upwards for what seemed like forever only to be connected by the canopy of her green leotard. Her curvy butt slowly extending outwards as she bent over to stretch. My eyes slowly moved forward to her house sized womanhood witch was pushing her leotard to the limits. Her flat stomach, followed by her now building sized breasts which where barley contained from her bending over.<br>\r\nRealizing I was completely ogling this evil goddess I literally had to slap myself in the face to keep with the task at hand. I hastily grabbed both of the plants and started extracting powder from them in and placed it in 2 separate piles. I noticed her shadow above me move again and I glanced up to see her now leaning forward with her hands on her back, stretching again. Forcing myself not to enjoy the view of her butt too much I carefully took a tiny bit of powder on my finger tips and inhaled ever so slightly. I slowly shrank about six inches. I the did the same with the other powder and returned to normal. I filled the remainder of my bombs with each, making sure to label which was shrinking and which was growing powder. Just as I finished filling the last one I heard a thunderous BOOM and looked up to see....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I got to my feet and quikly looked back up to see her other foot raised high. I am definitely starting to regret my \"idea\" to make her bigger... SLAM. Again I was sent tumbling across the ground. SLAM. Another near miss.<br>\r\n\"<i>I can do this all night Batman.</i>\" She said laughing.<br>\r\nBOOM. Once again her giant foot landed right behind me. I'm starting to think she is toying with me. Suddenly without warning a massive green wall came crashing down in front of me. Unable to stop sprinting in time I smacked right into it landing hard on my back. I looked up, completely helpless on the ground and saw her massive form squatting down, her hand outstretched. A giant fingernail was placed just in front of me.<br>\r\n\"<i>You'll get on if you know whats good for you.</i>\"<br>\r\nFeeling a major shot to my pride I obliged and climbed on. Suddenly at blinding speed I was brought up to her face. \"<i>Now what should I do with you?</i>\" She said with an evil smirk on her face. All I could do was watch in fear as she was deciding my fate. In an instant I was plunged into her mountain sized cleavage.<br>\r\n\"<i>Should I crush you right now?</i>\" She said peering down at me, gently squezzing her breast together. \"<i>Or should I leave you here so you can see first hand as I destroy this pathetic city you have sworn to protect?

Again they exploded just under her nose, releasing huge amounts of the powder.<br>\r\nHoping for the best, but fearing the worst I watched her inhale as much as possible.<br>\r\n\"<i>What are you trying to do Batman, grow me to death?</i>\" She laughed. \"<i>I am going to get so big I will conquer this entire planet!</i>\"<br>\r\nRemoving her hands from her breast, I slid deeper between them.

It had little effect on Ivy's senses, but it did enough damage for her to inhale the tiny cloud of powder through her nose. I watched as Ivy slightly shrunk, her head slightly falling out of sight, and out of reach. Realizing what I had done, and realizing that she had returned to her original size, Ivy became irritated. For the first time since this whole fiasco started, there was a glimmer of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stupid little pest,\"</i> she squealed, slightly unnerved by the loss of her once tremendous height, <i>\"You're going to pay for that!\"</i>. In retaliation, she once again reached for me, her hand slightly smaller than earlier. For a moment, it seemed that resistance was futile, as she caught a hold of me, catching my cape in between her fingertips. She pulled me from the edge of the shelf and held me, by the cape, in front of her furious eyes. Despite my little offense, all it did was restore her normal size. This had little effect on the overwhelming size advantage she maintained, at least, not at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to catch my breath as I hung from my cape, I saw Ivy licking her crimson lips. I could tell, from the look on her massive face, what she intended. <i>\"It looks like I'm going to be treated with a midnight snack,\"</i> she remarked before raising me over her head. She tilted her head back, opened her mouth and released her tongue, intending to drop me onto her tongue and into her mouth, swallowing me whole. Before this could happen however, I managed to release the second container, blasting the powder directly up her nose once again. The first blast had little effect, but the second blast packed a real punch to the face of my deadly foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned by the blast, Ivy released her grip of my cape. I struggled in the air, but I managed to land safely on the table, where Ivy was previously conducting her experiment. I turned to face my opponent, who was screaming on the spot, struggling to breathe, as she faded to the floor, out of my sight. At last, Poison Ivy had a taste of her own medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining my composure, I turned to see the potted plant, next to a pile of powder, right on the opposite edge of the table. At that moment, I was relieved that this ordeal would soon be over, but unfortunately, I was swept off my feet. Returning to a vertical position, a noticed a familiar shadow loom over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around and looked up to see Poison Ivy, horrified to find that she now stood at approximately fifteen inches, five times larger than me. Even despite all of my best efforts, it seemed as though I would never defeat Ivy, at least not on this night. Luck just wasn't on my side. Despite everything I did, she still maintained a powerful size advantage over me. Never have I endured such an immense challenge. Standing tall in front of me, my agitated opponent looked down at me and smiled as I stepped back in shock and awe. Standing no taller than her knee, I let out a sigh of disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made the first move. I dove in between her massive legs and made a break for the powder on the opposite end of the table, but Ivy was far too quick and far too strong. Before I could gain momentum, she grabbed me by my cape and pulled me back towards her, where she lifted me above her head and slammed me onto the surface, landing hard on my back. She then placed one of her big feet onto my chest, slightly tickling with her toes. I was unable to push her off as she looked down with a sinister laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sorry,\"</i> she cackled with a malicious tone, <i>\"But I'm afraid that you're still the little bat around here!\"</i></span></div></div>",

Realizing my wounded state, Ivy pressed on and rushed towards the pile of powder, cursing me in the process. I slowly stumbled back to my feet, struggling to catch my breath, but before I could follow, she had already reached the pile of dust. In despair, I watched, from a distance, as Ivy indulged herself, dunking her hands and chest into the pile and flinging it into the air. I could see that she was trying to get rid of the substance before I could reach it, ensuring that I couldn't use it for myself. Regardless however, I limped towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready I noticed her beginning to change. For a moment, it seemed that the closer I ran towards her, the further away she faded. It wasn't until I reached her when I realized that her ruthless, aggressive scavenge for the powder, and her desperate attempt to remove the substance, came to no prevail. Ivy was distraught when she turned to face me, realizing that she had, once again, shrunk, this time however, to a much more fairer size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy climbed back to her feet, her face and chest stained with powder, now standing at a mere five inches tall. Although she still maintained a two inch size advantage over me, I suddenly grew confident with my chances of survival, relishing the opportunity of an even bout. Overcome with rage however, Ivy furiously lunged at me, knocking me off my feet. For a moment, I underestimated her, I failed to realize that she still maintained the size and strength advantage. It was a fierce battle where I almost fell victim to her lethal attacks. She put up a tremendous fight, possibly the fight of my life, where she completely overpowered me, and even threatened to throw me off the edge of the table, but finally, in the end, I managed to overcome her merciless onslaught, and render her unconscious. At last, Ivy was defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison Ivy was finally subdued, but the whole ordeal was not over yet. I only had twenty minutes left before the police would arrive on the scene. The last thing that I needed was to be discovered at this size, my secret identity would indefinitely be exposed. I had twenty minutes to find a way to return both Ivy and myself to our original sizes. With no time to spare, I approached the massive plant, scaled it, and reached for another handful of powder from the bud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plant however, reacted to my presence, and retaliated by squirting the powder into my face.</span></div></div>",

I looked up to see the plant, now impossibly out of reach, not even my grapple was long enough to reach the edge of the huge plant pot. Overwhelmed by my microscopic size, I desperately scanned the area for the powder, but at that moment, I turned around to see my unconscious adversary, and I was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense size difference was staggering. Once again, I found myself a mere fraction of the size of Poison Ivy, I was even smaller than her little toenail, but what was more horrific was the fact that she was only a mere five inches in size, meaning that I couldn't be any bigger than a mere fraction of an inch, or even a millimeter! It was hard to believe that, just moments ago, I managed to render this colossal giant unconscious. Despite the deep fear of my minuscule size however, I detected a large quantity of powder. The flaw however, was that it was stained on the tip of Ivy's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter inhaling the powder earlier, Ivy must have incidentally dunked her breasts into the powder and, as a result, caught stains on them. This was the last thing that I would ever do, I never thought that I'd find myself climbing onto one of Poison Ivy's breasts, and from my estimation, I thought that I might have to even climb her nipples if necessary! Regardless of my disapproval however, there was no other trace of the powder in range. Reluctant, I steadily approached the unconscious mountain of flesh, unnerved by her massive size, dreading what had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrived next to Ivy's massive corpse, cautious with her strong, unconscious breath and, with precise timing, I clung onto Ivy's smooth skin and, with all of my strength, I started to pull myself onto Ivy's body, the skin disturbingly easy to cling onto. It was difficult to maintain my grip however, the fallen foe breathed excessively hard as her chest continuously expanded, but eventually, I managed to reached the curve of her breast. I crawled up and pulled myself up to a vertical position, my feet slightly sinking into the flesh, precisely on the edge of her massive breast. As I investigated the area, overwhelmed by the feeling of an immense nipple, beneath Ivy's tiny costume, under my feet, and realized that the powder had only stained her other breast, not the one I was currently standing on. I sighed, struggling to balance upon Ivy's breath, slightly aggravated by the complication of this whole ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was reassured by a constant thought in the back on my mind. Surely, this whole fiasco would soon be over.</span></div></div>",

However, I was suddenly swept off my feet by a sudden shift from beneath. A rather large breath caused me to slip, bouncing off the soft breast and rolling in between a pair of fleshy mountains. To make matters worse, as I fell into her enormous cleavage, I was suddenly overwhelmed by a tight fabric. To my misfortune, I found myself trapped under Poison Ivy's skin tight outfit, wedged in between her two breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was hardly anything I could do as I felt myself grow, but unfortunately the effects of the powder were minimal. Although I was not as minuscule as my previous size, I was still outclassed by the giant redhead who I was perched upon. By the time I finished growing, I was still less than an inch tall, nestled in between her breasts, struggling against the skin tight fabric of her costume. I was now the size of an newborn baby compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up in fright to see the looming face of my adversary, looking down at me with a playful grin on her cherry lips. It seemed that my struggle had caught her attention, waking her from unconsciousness. The first time I was able to use the powder to make myself grow, and it attracts desperately unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, there you are, little bat!\"</i> The tone of her voice implied that she was, once again, in control of the whole situation, speaking to me as if I were a mere infant. She grabbed me by my shoulders, harshly pinching me in the process, and pulled me from her ridiculously tight costume. In her hands, she pressed my arms against my sides, rendering me unable to move, as she looked at me up and down, as if I were just some sort of doll. <i>\"Well, what are we going to do with you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now treating me like an infant, but considering my current size, at least compared to her, and after the fight I just gave to her, she must have been feeling pretty good about herself at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You've certainly made yourself difficult,\"</i> she added, looking at me with a stern glare, as if she was a figure of authority telling off a naughty child, <i>\"What can I do to make you understand? You cannot win, you cannot beat me, it's over. I've won! You need to stop resisting! What does it take to make you stop fighting me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she noticed the smudge of powder still stained on her breast. Clearly I was unable to inhale it all, and I couldn't help but wonder, if I did, would I still be in this predicament. However, that was not the current concern. I was worried that she had something much worse in mind.</span></div></div>",

With no power to use it in the desired manner, all I could do was point the sharp item and slightly poke the side of her curve. It did little damage, not even a scratch, but it pinched her enough to loosen her thrust with a small, irritated screech. She dug her massive finger into her cleavage, looking to comfort the bruise. I seized the opportunity and, in desperation, I scaled her finger, climbed onto the back of her large hand, and dived onto her bouncy breast. Before she could retaliate, I inhaled the powder stain on her nipple, but to my dismay, the situation went from bad to worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, as if the powder did nothing else, I shrunk. Horrified by what was happening, I dropped back in between the breasts, but this time, I did not get caught. As I continued to shrink, I plummeted into the cleavage, fading from the sight of my dreaded, giant adversary. Ivy's massive head was no out of sight, I was overwhelmed by the immense size of her breasts, the gap between the enormous curves significantly wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was now so small that even Ivy, standing at a mere five inches tall, was unable to detect me, I had become a mere speck on her otherwise perfect skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I felt an immense force from beneath my feet. Desperately I grabbed onto her smooth skin, clinging for dear life, as the island where I stood started to ascend to a vertical stance. An enormous finger then rubbed against the skin, I was so small that, even the tip of Ivy's finger was too big to squash me, it harshly scratched my back, but I did not leave go, I continued to cling onto her skin, like the insignificant spot that I had become. Even if she wanted to, I was so small that Ivy couldn't even squash me! That was how minuscule I had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to make out what was happening from beyond the enormous size of her breasts, blocking most of my vision from my humiliating point of view, but I suddenly felt an immense shift from one of my sides, Ivy was seemingly lifting her breast, presumably to inhale the powder stain, the same stain that I once risked my life for, and the same stain that might have doomed me to a humiliating demise. I could suddenly feel a tremendous expansion within my grasp. To my disgust, the powder had, once again, increased my adversary's already overwhelming size, she grew at an alarming rate until she reached what I presumed to be her original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, I truly felt like an insignificant speck on her otherwise perfect skin, clinging in my foe's cleavage that had now become as wide as a canyon! I was truly defeated and, in my darkest hour, I was truly in the mercy of my enemy. Even the slightest breeze would be powerful enough to sweep me into the unknown, where I would forever drift, never to reach the ground again. I had become a mere speck of dust, almost the same size as a speck of the same powder that I once fought for, the same powder that had led me to my potential death. Poison Ivy had indeed won, I knew that, since I was no longer a threat, she would continue with her sinister plot for vengeance, and then move on to the total destruction of Gotham city. Not even the police would do anything to stop her, especially with such a powerful substance now at her disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I could do now was cling onto her skin and pray for a miracle, something that I thought that I would never do in my entire life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Believing that I had disappeared beyond microscopic proportion, Poison Ivy was free to continue her plot for vengeance against Mr. Black, the owner of the northern Botanical Gardens, responsible for the death of hundreds of plants, and not even the police could do anything to stop her. Our battle might have exhausted her supply of the size-manipulating substance, but Ivy had stored enough to pose a threat to Gotham city, and she was fully capable of reproducing plenty more of the substance, unless someone was able to stop her. Unfortunately however, the only man that could have possibly stopped her was now desperately clinging in between her breasts, now the size of a mere speck of dust, hopelessly unable to pose a threat to any other living creature. I was defeated. Poison Ivy had won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I dangled for dear life, struggling to hang onto her smooth skin, from what I determined from her overwhelming movements, I knew that Ivy, now restored to her original size, was making her move. She exited the cottage and made her way towards the Gardens, laughing at the sight of the <b>Batmobile</b> parked outside, clearly proud of being responsible for the dark knight's last song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long journey, almost perilous at times, where I thought that I would be swept from my position into the unknown, but to my relief, Ivy had successfully reached the Gardens. At this point, my time limit had expired, an hour had passed since this whole ordeal had begun and, presumably, the police had already arrived at the abandoned cottage, where Ivy and I fought earlier. At this point however, this was the least of my concerns. There was no hope of Mr. Black's survival, there was no one capable of preventing Ivy from exacting her revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison Ivy entered the Gardens through the front door and, to my surprise, I caught a glance of a potted plant, the same plant that produced the size-manipulating powder responsible for my minuscule size. I presumed that Ivy had not noticed. So, with nothing left to lose, I pushed myself from Ivy's cleavage, with as much strength as possible, fell underneath Ivy's enormous breast, and extended my cape, in the hope of gliding to the plant. Of course, Ivy did not notice. I struggled to control myself in the open air, the overwhelming breeze continuously taking me off course, but upon Ivy's eager entrance into the Gardens, her swift movement created a strong gust that pushed me closer to my destination. It seemed that I would miss my target entirely, and that I would drift into oblivion, but in the last minute, I dived at the target, and rolled into the massive bud of the plant, an impossible stunt for any ordinary human to accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bud of the plant, my small size was pathetic. I was so small that I could literally stand on the light petal. Even the specks of powder from inside the plant were the size of rocks. Rather than inhaling, since I was so small, I tried to suck the substance and, to my relief, I felt myself grow. For the first time since this whole ordeal began, the size-manipulating powder made me grow, returning me to my previous size. This however, was not enough. Even at this slightly increased size, I still found myself standing on the petal, and hidden within the bud of the plant. I would hardly pose a threat to Poison Ivy at this insignificant size, I was still a mere fraction of an inch. At that moment however, I had a revelation, and made an astonishing discovery about the plant, something that Ivy must have missed. Every time I inhaled the plant through my nose, I shrunk, but what I learned was that, if I inhaled through my mouth, I would actually grow. Therefore, Ivy was wrong, the effects were not random, but merely depended on the respiratory system and the course it took through the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this knowledge, I scooped a handful of powder, relieved by the smaller size of the specks compared to a moment ago, and once again, I inhaled through the mouth and, to my relief, I once again started to grow. I grew so rapidly however, that I stumbled from the petal of the plant and fell into the pot of soil. I stood back up to find that I had returned to my previous three inch size, as if the shrinking effects that I endured earlier were, step by step, reversing. If I could climb back into the plant and inhale some more powder, there was a chance that I could return to my original size.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From a distance, I could hear screams of terror. I could only presume that it was Mr. Black, the homicidal owner of the Botanical Gardens, was in peril, in the mercy of Poison Ivy. If I wanted any hope of rescuing the poor man from a fate worse than death, I had to act quickly. I swiftly climbed back into the plant and inhaled some more powder, through the mouth of course, and I once again started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again falling from the plant, I stumbled from the pot and returned to my feet, realizing that I was now larger than the plant itself, now standing at one foot in size, the same size that I was reduced to, back when this whole ordeal began. The last thing that I wanted however, was to be discovered at this still insignificant size by my venomous adversary, who would still pose as an unimaginable threat against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I heard Mr. Black rushing towards the front door in a petrified state. Panicking, I quickly reached for the powder and hid behind the pot, hoping not to be spotted at such a pathetic size. Out of sight, I overheard Mr. Black crash against the doors, failing to realize that Ivy had locked them with a powerful vine. Black continued to bash against the door, desperate to escape, but before he could, he once again dropped to his knees in the ominous presence of Poison Ivy, who stood in front of him with a grin of delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's it, Nolan,\"</i> I overheard from her poisonous lips, <i>\"Beg for your life! Scream for mercy, just like my precious babies did before you killed them for your own, gruesome intentions. You are a small, weak, pathetic little worm of a man, and for all your crimes, that is what I am going to turn you into!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time to act was now. I looked into my hand, looking into the powder. During my rush however, it seemed that this was the remaining quantity of powder left, I had depleted the plant, and now the last pile of powder rested in my hand. Thankfully however, I realized that, since one foot was the first size that I was reduced to, once I inhaled this final pile, I would finally return to my own original size, and no longer would Ivy possess an incredible size advantage over me. Justice would finally be served. With this belief, I inhaled the powder, through my mouth, and I once again felt my body rapidly grow in size. The plant pot below me grew smaller as I finally ascended, my presence caught the attention of Ivy, who watched me grow. Unfortunately however, my prediction did not come to fruition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of returning to my original size, my growth stopped half way through. I saw the look of fright on Ivy's face turn into a wicked smile. As she left Mr. Black cower on the floor, she approached me, still in possession of a noticeable size advantage over me. As she approached me, she stood in front of me, my face literally inches away from her pelvis. Without a fear in the world, Ivy stood over me, with wide legs, resting her fists against her sides, as I pathetically looked up to her, struggling to ignore my undignified position in front of her waist. From my estimation, I was now no more than three feet in size, no taller than one of Ivy's remarkably long legs, eye level with her enormously wide pelvis. I looked up to her, her breasts blocking my view of her sparkling face, as if I were a small child looking up to his tall, adult mother. I felt pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ivy could do anything however, I headbutted her in the groin. Standing in such a silly manner, she did have it coming. Stunned, I dived in between her legs and attempted a spinning kick against her buttocks, knocking her onto the floor. Enraged, Ivy returned to her feet before I could capitalize on her vulnerable position. Since that moment, I felt the full fury of Poison Ivy. She kicked me as if I were a football, knocking me far across the garden. She punched me, her fist almost engulfing my face as I slammed my back against the ground. She wrapped her massive hand around my neck, her fingers touching behind it, choking me in the process. She lifted me high above her head, clinging to me by my neck and ankle, and slammed me hard onto the ground, almost breaking my bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I laid on the floor, she even dropped all of her weight on me, crushing my entire torso under her immense hips. I felt my chest squeezing between her buttocks as she remained in a seated position on top of me, realizing that my arms were trapped under her tremendous weight. All I could do was kick my legs wildly. From her seated position, Ivy looked down at me, with a twinkle in her eye, giggling at the sight of my head, the only part of my body not trapped under her enormous hips, excluding my legs. I did not have enough strength to push her off. Stuck in such a humiliating position, there was nothing I could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy had total control over me. Her size, strength, speed and endurance were just far too overwhelming, as I found, lying hopelessly trapped under her massive hips. Once again, size was a tremendous advantage for the dominant woman. It seemed that I had, once again, endured another humiliating defeat in the hands of the dreaded, giant beauty, Poison Ivy.</span></div></div>",

Catching Ivy off her guard, Black threw a handful of powder, that he had kept secret in his pocket, into her face, temporarily blinding her. Finally, I felt her tremendous weight loosen as she recoiled in disgust. I returned to my feet as Ivy struggled to wipe the powder from her eyes, unwillingly inhaling the substance through her nose. Then, to my delight, Ivy began to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her horror, Ivy regained her senses, realizing that she had indeed shrunk by a massive proportion. She had returned to her previous size of fifteen inches, now the size of my own leg. The tables had finally turned against my adversary. For the first time since this whole fiasco began, I had the size difference. Realizing her significant disadvantage, and dreading her late, inevitable defeat, Ivy tried to retreat into the garden. Needless to say, she did not get far. Before she could disappear, I managed to tie her up with some rope, rendering her trapped, similarly to how she had trapped me under her previously crushing weight. Looking at her then, it was impossible to compare the god-like giantess, the enormous being that I once desperately clung onto like the insignificant speck that I once was, to this trapped, quivering, pathetic woman wriggling on the floor, struggling to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attention then turned towards Mr. Black. Despite my triumph over Poison Ivy, looking at Black, I realized that I was still the size of a small child. After everything that happened during this whole ordeal, this was the result. I couldn't continue protecting the city of Gotham if most of my adversaries were twice the size of me. I was far too small for such a huge task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Listen Batman,\"</i> my track of thought was suddenly lost upon the sound of Mr. Black's empathic voice, <i>\"Thank you for helping me out tonight. I always thought that you were a nuisance, but you've proved me wrong. You are a good man. Please, as a token of appreciation, I'd like you to have this.\"</i> He extended his hand out to me, and in the palm of his hand, he revealed one more pile of powder, the same substance responsible for this whole fiasco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis generous offer was enough for me to crack a smile.</span></div></div>",

Not to let them go to waste, the exhausted plants were taken to the gardens, under the care of Mr. Black. The plants that weren't depleted however, were returned to their previous owners, out of the entire country, and to ensure that such a fiasco would not occur again, the capsules that contained the substance, created by the beautiful eco-terrorist as a part of her devious plan, were stored within the security wing of <b>Wayne Enterprises</b>, and hidden from the general public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Batman</b> managed to survive the night, but he would never think of his adversary in the same way ever again. His encounter with such an immense figure would continue to haunt him for years to come, a fear that his other adversaries would soon exploit. This recurring nightmare would also be the catalyst to the caped crusader's realization that he couldn't continue fighting crime alone, a thought that remained on his mind during his investigation of <b>Anthony Zucco</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for <b>Poison Ivy</b>, she was taken back into custody, and she was returned to <b>Arkham Asylum</b>. Her next escape however, seemed like an impossible task from her point of view. After her last fight with Batman, Ivy was left at a mere fifteen inches in size. Her diminished size proved to be an advantage for security, who imprisoned Ivy in a new special cell, sharing similar qualities to an extended hamster cage! Rotting in her own miserable failure, Ivy swore revenge against the dark knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations!

With Harley's help, Ivy managed to not only return to her original size, but also shrink the dark knight to a mere two inches! To make matters worse for the tiny caped crusader, the deadly duo have him trapped in perhaps the most humiliating position he's ever found himself in. Escape looks unlikely, but even if he does manage to escape, the dark knight will never look at Harley Quinn the same again!

I kicked myself back onto my feet and attempted to blow to the torso, but despite all of my strength, Ivy was not even hurt. In retaliation, she grabbed me and lifted me from my feet, pressing my body against her own. She squeezed with all her might, viciously tightening her grip. I moaned in agony before she relinquished one of her massive arms and grabbed me by the back of the head. She forced my face into her cleavage, my nose sunk in between her smooth breasts. I struggled to breathe in perhaps the most humiliation position I've ever found myself in, and yet all I could do was kick my feet in desperation. I almost fell unconscious from the brutal bear hug, struggling to cope with the constant cackle of my adversary, until, with a cheap blow, I drove my knee into her crotch with enough force to relinquish her hold. A punch to the torso did little damage, but a knee to the crotch momentarily stunned the colossal villain, who moaned in pain.

I knew that she would strike at Gotham museum, they shipped a new item and stored it here two nights ago. Before following her, I did some research on the item. From what I found, it was a rare artifact of Egyptian origin, a handheld statue, in the shape of some sort of Siamese cat, with rare jewels encrusted in the eye sockets. Apparently, if held in the hands of the caster, the jewels could cast beams of light, capable of manipulating the size of all living beings, including humans. As impossible as it sounded, I couldn't take any chances, especially if <b>Catwoman</b> was after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed her into the museum, it was dark, silent and vast, the burglar could be crawling about anywhere in the building. Creeping through the building in search of the mischievous thief, I had a strong suspicion that this would be no ordinary night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down a long hallway, I found her, naturally crawling through the burglar alarms, like the professional that she was. I watched from the shadows as she successfully reached her goal. She obtained the statue and, almost instinctively, leaped from the scene. Once again, I followed her out of the museum and onto the rooftops of the city. I followed her to a familiar spot, overlooking the entire residential district, bright under the moonlight, it was here where we both shared our first kiss, a night I would never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe prepared to wait for my arrival, as if our encounters became a routine, cradling her new trophy. She was the least bit surprised when I revealed myself. <i>\"There you are,\"</i> she remarked, comforting her prize by her chest, <i>\"I was hoping you would show up earlier tonight.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was not amused. <i>\"I'm afraid I can't let you steal that artifact.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman simply chuckled. <i>\"Sorry darling,\"</i> she replied, <i>\"But we're not going through all this again tonight. There's going to be a change of plans.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was unsure what she meant with this remark, but regardless, I realized that I had to take action. I lunged towards her, but she immediately dodged my attack and leaped up to another vantage point. <i>\"Don't you ever get tired of the same old routine?\"</i> she laughed as she once again jumped out of my reach, <i>\"How about, just for one night, I do all the chasing for a change?\"</i> I did not reply. I was more concerned with subduing this petty thief, but she clearly had other intentions on her mind. <i>\"Well if you don't want a change,\"</i> she added, pointing her statue at my direction, <i>\"Then I guess I'll have to make a change. Let's have ourselves a little chaos!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I was blinded by a gleaming light, shining from the jewels encrusted in the sockets of the statue.

I could feel everything before me fade from my reach, my entire body felt an overwhelming surge as I collapsed to my knees, to the delight of my smiling opponent. For a moment, I lost all of my senses as the shimmering sensation coursed through my body, but when I finally regained my vision, no longer sweating under the gleaming beam of the statue's crystal eyes, I was horrified by the outcome of what had just transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything had become distant. I ascended back to my feet and came to a terrible conclusion. The effects of the beam had shrunk me drastically. Petrified by what had happened, I turned back to my opponent, who stood triumphantly high above me with a sinister grin on her lips, even though I could barely tell, considering the tremendous distance from her face. She began to approach me, the closer she came the more insignificant and pathetic I felt in comparison to the colossal, superior adversary. My head was now no taller than her crotch! I was even shorter than one of her legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled to look into the glaring eyes of my opponent, my vision was blocked by the large breasts that hung high above my head. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, and unwilling to battle such an immense, deadly adversary like a giant-sized Catwoman, I had to make a move. I couldn't let such a devious individual have her way with me in such a pathetic stance. She was capable of physically overwhelming me with little effort. In a desperate attempt to escape her fearful wrath, I put all of my strength in a single kick to her thick shin. Unfortunately my attempt was in vain, as Catwoman felt nothing but a mere scratch on her shin, reminding me of how insignificant I had become, a tiny sensation that a woman as strong and endurable as herself would not even groan about. She merely giggled at my feeble attempt to fight back before swiftly lifting her leg and driving her boot straight into my chest, pressing me down on my back with enough force that she could break my ribs if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly dazed by the overwhelming strength of my colossal adversary, she released her tight foot from my chest, but before I could crawl away, she sunk her heels into my wrists, trapping me beneath her ankles, and dropped her massive buttocks onto my torso, thus rendering me unable to do anything else but squirm. I tried, with all of my might, to push her off, but she had all of her weight pressing down on me, trapping me in a humiliating position beneath the buttocks of a woman now well over half the size of me. From Catwoman's point of view, all she could see was my head, a sight that made her laugh hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I squirmed under her massive butt cheeks, she looked down at her pathetic victim. <i>\"Come on Batman,\"</i> she taunted, laughing at how vulnerable I was, <i>\"You can put up a better fight than this, can't you?\"</i> She continued to mock me as I remained trapped under her enormous butt. <i>\"This is more like it,\"</i> she cackled, <i>\"This is the most fun I've had in a long time.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of tight leather made me feel queasy. Feeling as pathetic and insignificant as ever, all I could do in retaliation was scream. <i>\"You fat cow,\"</i> I yelled furiously, feeling the tough strain of being crushed underneath the huge, chunky buttocks that my adversary now possessed, <i>\"You won't get away with this! Let me go now!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarcastically Catwoman took a moment to ponder on my demand, ultimately resulting with a straight denial. <i>\"Are you kidding? Why should I?\"</i> she laughed back at me, <i>\"You're in no position to threaten me. Besides, I enjoy watching you squirm! I love a bit of foreplay!\"</i> The sight of me pinned down under her own weight made her feel immense, the knowledge of the dark knight, the legendary Batman, now too small and weak to fight back, could not even budge under her massive weight, made her proud of what she had accomplished. In her mind, she had finally put an end to the reign of Batman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention then turned back to the statue in her hands. Admiring the artifact in her claws, the item responsible for putting her in such a dominant position sitting on her arch nemesis, she continued to mock her fallen opponent as she embarrassingly sat on my torso. <i>\"Now, what should we do with you? As much as I'd love to, we can't just sit here all night, can we? But I can't just let you go, even though it would be pretty hilarious to see you take on the other freaks in Gotham at this size, what would be the satisfaction in that? No, I have to think of something much more satisfying to do with you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelpless, I could only wait in horror for my captor's decision.</span></div></div>",

My size was far too restricting already, I couldn't imagine how useless and pathetic I would be if Catwoman decided to shrink me further, but from the shimmering look in her eyes, I knew that I would soon find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sadistic glare, Catwoman aimed the statue back down at me, giggling at my weak attempts to break free, and before I knew it, I was once again blinded by the gleaming light of the encrusted jewels. I could feel my entire body shrink even more, my torso now trapped in between both leather-clad buttocks. I could feel my arms slip from beneath her heels, only to slide and remain stuck under each butt cheek, humiliating me even further. My shoulders faded from the sight of Catwoman, a sight that tickled her so. Even my feet disappeared under her behind. All that was left of me was my head, my chin just about touching warm leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman was amused by what she had accomplished. My humiliation, at her expense, couldn't have been any more satisfying. <i>\"Now that's better,\"</i> she remarked, smiling down at my shrunken head, the only part of my body that wasn't engulfed by her enormous butt. Never had Catwoman felt more dominant and superior as she did at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So Batman,\"</i> she sarcastically added with a wicked smile on her lips, <i>\"Are you enjoying yourself under me?\"</i> I did not reply, I was far too embarrassed to answer, I remained silent and defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You know,\"</i> she continued to gloat, <i>\"It would be such a shame if you happen to suffocate down there, but lucky for you, your head isn't buried underneath me, isn't it?\"</i> With that said, she pointed the statue at me once again and shrunk me even further, I felt my head sink in between her immense butt cheeks, where I could barely breathe. <i>\"Oops, looks like I was wrong! Oh well!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was now totally engulfed under her massive butt. I struggled to breathe, my face was trapped by boiling leather, as if I were buried alive. The black walls of Catwoman's suit surrounded me, I was unable to move, I honestly thought that this was the end. There was no way out from this. I had to admit that I was to die in the most humiliating way ever conceived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I slowly passed out, I could hear the echoing voice of Catwoman high above, my ears were muffled under her tremendous weight but I managed to pick up what she said, each word caused a little jiggle, rubbing her leather suit into my face even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I hope you survive down there Batman,\"</i> she said, <i>\"It would be a sad way for you to die, what with being smothered by my butt and all.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I passed out.</span></div></div>",

Dazed and beaten, I stumbled to my feet, where I found myself in an entirely new location. It seemed that I was standing in the middle of some sort of bed, from my estimation, I realized that I must only be a mere handful of inches, approximately three inches in size. Upon the bed was a sheet, some pillows and, most noticeably, a familiar leather suit wrapped in a pile to my side. I felt insignificant, and the only person who could rescue me from an otherwise degrading peril was the same woman responsible for leaving me this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I thought of the devil, that very woman suddenly noticed me from the opposite side of the room. She did not wear her costume however, instead she wore what I presumed to be her casual evening clothes, a baby-tee and short shorts. I was astonished by her colossal, god-like size as she approached me with a sinister grin on her lips. Catwoman, residing in her true identity as <b>Selina Kyle</b>, bent down to face me, her massive face loomed over me, casting a dark shadow over my minuscule body. I was a prisoner in her flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, well, well,\"</i> she gloated, chuckling to herself, <i>\"Look who finally decided to wake up after all! I guess you enjoyed being squeezed in between my butt cheeks too much! Ha!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please Selina,\"</i> I pleaded, now more desperate for mercy than ever, <i>\"You have to stop this...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Or what!?\"</i> Catwoman snapped, the mere sound of her ferocious voice knocked me to my knee, <i>\"What will you do to me? What can you possible do now? Face it Batman, it's over. I beat you. You're nothing more than a weak little mouse, and I'm the kitty who's going to enjoy taking a bite out of you!\"</i> I was horrified by such a concept, but I knew that she was right. She had defeated. I was nothing more than a mouse, I was now Catwoman's little toy, and she could have her way with me, no matter what she came up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention then turned towards her <b>Catsuit</b>, resting in a pile on the bed to my side. <i>\"Now here's what we're going to do now, little bat,\"</i> she started, revealing her intentions for me, <i>\"We're going to play a game of hide and seek!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"First, I'm going to plant you inside my suit. Then, as I strip out of these clothes, you're going to find a spot in the suit to hide. Once I've stripped myself, I'm going to put my suit back on, with you in it, and I'm going to have myself a little trip to the bank. Wherever you hide in my suit, that's where you'll stay until I come back and take that suit off again. Oh, and don't try any funny business. If I catch you trying to escape, then we'll have to think of something else to do with you. Got it?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't given a chance to reply. Before I could give her an answer, I was swept from my feet. Catwoman had scooped me into her hand, the force almost damaged my spine. She then dropped me into her leather suit. As I struggled to breathe, Catwoman managed to zip the suit tight, ensuring that I couldn't get out. Catwoman then lifted the suit, with me in it, and started shaking it. I was rocked all over the place, I couldn't maintain my focus, the scent was too unbearable. I almost passed out again as Catwoman dropped the suit back onto the bed, presumably to resume stripping out of her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No peeking,\"</i> I heard from a distance, I could barely hear through the rubbery leather that engulfed me. The interior of the suit was disturbingly warm and sweaty. I could barely move, so escape was impossible. Bruised, battered and out of breath, all I could do was crawl, before I suddenly felt two huge fingers pinning me in place from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Gotcha!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Catwoman had stripped out of her clothes, the concept of Selina Kyle, standing there in the nude, was slightly arousing. Pinning me in place, I felt her lift and unzip the suit. Before I could react however, I felt one of her limbs slip into the suit. As she started to put on her suit, I felt a sudden avalanche of skin press me against the sweaty leather, once again restricting my movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of her humongous body entered the suit, it was hard to tell where I found myself, all I knew that I was implanted somewhere on her smooth body.</span></div></div>",

As the tight suit attached itself to her smooth flesh, I found myself in a very humiliating position. My suspicion was confirmed when I felt a mighty force from outside, where I was almost crushed by the unstoppable weight of my adversary. I could barely hear, but I could feel Catwoman pulling on her boots as I found my entire body being consumed by two huge mountains of chunky skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stink was unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Catwoman ascended back to a vertical stance, relinquishing my hold very slightly, she began to walk. Every movement squeezed me even more, I was suffocating in such a degrading position, wedged in between two mountains of soft flesh and forced in between them even further by the push of tight leather, and each step she took felt ever worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped for a moment, presumably to search for me in the mirror, and giggled at the sight of me, pressed in between her buttocks. <i>\"My, my,\"</i> she taunted as she rubbed her finger across my back, <i>\"Who's a lucky boy then?\"</i> I couldn't reply, I was overcome by the horrible stench, and even if I could, there would barely be a response. <i>\"I've gotta say, my little pet,\"</i> she continued, <i>\"You just can't resist my perk little bottom, can't you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stuck in place, perfectly caught in between two huge buttocks, face first, forced even further by a wall of hot, stuffy black leather. My arms and legs were trapped, there was no hope of escape, or even a little distraction, I was hopelessly imprisoned almost inside Catwoman's gigantic butt. I knew that it wouldn't take long for me to pass out from such a horrid stench, and with the knowledge that Catwoman was free to do whatever she pleased, knowing that her only competition was stored in between her own butt cheeks, my heart sank in despair. There was no hope for me. All I could do was bleed it out, and endure the worst that was inevitably to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Catwoman made her move. My face was squeezed deeper in between her soft buttocks as she trekked across the rooftops of Gotham city. The further she traveled however, the more she began to sweat. I could feel massive beads of warm sweat drip across my stuck body, staining my entire suit. Eventually Catwoman started to sweat profusely, and I was drenched. It was a hot night out in the city, but Catwoman continued nonetheless, satisfied by the feeling of her old nemesis pressed firmly in between her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an eternity, I was disappointed that I did not pass out from such a dreadful scent, but eventually Catwoman stopped. She bent down, presumably to take another glance at me stuck in her rear. <i>\"Having fun my little pet?\"</i> Knowing that she would not get a response from me, she asked another question. <i>\"Ready to rob the bank with me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't even let out a grunt. My muscles were numb from squirming, I was completely drained. I couldn't reply to Catwoman's remarks, but my face grew hotter with humiliation. It was bad enough to be wedged in such an embarrassing position, to be rendered completely useless, but the thought of Catwoman roaming the streets of Gotham freely, free to do whatever she pleased without the fear of any competition, consumed me with rage. As angry as I was however, it did not matter at such a hopeless point in time. I welcomed death at this point.</span></div></div>",

It seemed like a long sprint to the edge of the formerly enclosed rooftop, and the vast stone beneath my feet reached out to a distance like I was standing in the middle of a desert. For a moment, I thought that Catwoman had disappeared into the night, until I caught a glimpse of a pair of leather boots, enormous in size, standing directly in front of me. As I stood up to my feet, as tall I as could, I continued to tilt my head up, following the immense, god-like figure that stood before me, until, occupied by a huge, devious grin, I saw the face of Catwoman, looming high above, looking down at me as she licked her lips. In that terrifying moment, I realized that the power possessed by the item was too true and, as a victim of its tremendous power, I had shrunk. I now stood, from my estimation, at a mere three inches in size, a mere fraction of the overall, massive size of the cat burglar that stood triumphantly above me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling from ear to ear, Catwoman began to bend down with a twinkle in her eye. In a squatting position, she continued to stare at me in amazement, proud of what she had accomplished. <i>\"Well, well, well,\"</i> she giggled in delight, <i>\"Looks like it's my turn to do the chasing.\"</i> I was too petrified to reply, all I wanted to do was run away, out of the grasp as my sinister adversary. Unfortunately however, as I saw her massive hand hover above my head, I knew that she had other intentions on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I've waited a long time for this, Batman,\"</i> she continued as she approached me with her enormous leather glove. Under the looming shadow of her massive hand, all I could do was turn around and run for dear life, something that I thought that I'd never do in my entire life. Even at my diminished size however, my attempt to escape was futile. I was immediately swept from my feet, landing into the soft hand of Catwoman, who held me in a tight grip with her fingers. The immense force she held me between her fingers rendered me unable to move. I squirmed, like a fly caught in a web, as Catwoman lifted me high above the ground, holding me in front of her face. I was so small that, if she wanted to, she could have swallowed me whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dreaded the inevitable humiliation that I was about to endure in the hands of my malicious rival, who now had full control and dominance over me. As she squeezed me in between her sharp fingers, holding me in front of her glaring cat eyes, I could read from the smile on her lips that I was doomed to suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Time to have ourselves a little fun!\"</i></span></div></div>",

The clown prince of crime addressed his partner, <b>Harley Quinn</b>, in an oddly civil tone, as the former psychiatrist listened with undisclosed admiration for her former patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Harley,\"</i> the Joker answered, <i>\"Listen, the bat is on his way. We can't just let him sneak in without saying hello, can we?\"</i> He then started to cackle, his maniacal laugh was adored by his sidekick, who smiled with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Joker's intentions were now clear to me. The concept of a shrink ray had not passed the Joker's attention. I suspected him from the moment I heard the news, and now, there he was, cradling his latest prize, the stolen prototype of a new invention called the <b>Minimizer</b>, with devious intentions on his depraved mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Minimizer was a small handheld device, shaped in the fashion of a regular pistol, that blasted some kind of ray of light, capable of manipulating the size of any object, or person, the user desired. I knew that the Joker had to be separated from such a powerful weapon before he could cause any damage. He had to be stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, hidden from detection within one of the vents, as the Joker rallied his henchmen into position, preparing for the inevitable arrival of his arch nemesis, the dark knight detective. Little did he realize was that I had found a way into his hideout via the ventilation system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Joker, along with his henchmen, left the hideout and into the amusement park however, he handed the device to Harley Quinn, ordering her to stay inside to keep an eye open for me. Reluctant at first to be left alone, Harley armed herself with the device, prepared for my arrival. Now was the time to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dropped in, right before her eyes, a caped crusader cloaked within the darkness. From her point of view, all she could see were the illuminated eyes of my cowl. She pointed the weapon at me, clearly in a state of irrational fear. I was not willing to fight her, I was saving my strength for the clown. All I wanted from her was the device, but as predicted, she was too afraid to make a move. I tried to approach her carefully, trying to calm her down, but before I could touch her, I was overcome by a sudden beam of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley had fired the Minimizer at me. She hit me, and almost instantly, I felt my entire body change drastically. Everything before me grew further away from me as I started to fade further from Harley's sight. Harley was amazed by what she was witnessing, what she had done, and what she had accomplished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I came to, I realized the remarkable size advantage Harley Quinn now possessed over me.</span></div></div>",

One individual who was particularly suspicious of his mysterious disappearance was <b>Edward Nygma</b>, better known as the <b>Riddler</b>, who suspected that the elusive cat burglar, <b>Catwoman</b>, had something to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why he lured Catwoman into his carefully orchestrated trap. Luring her in with the promise of information regarding the dark knight's disappearance, the Riddler had successfully trapped Catwoman in what she presumed to be some sort of maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inspected her surroundings. She was stuck inside some sort of maze, but she noticed that the door, leading to the next area in the maze, was far too small to pass. She also noticed a small glass bottle in the corner, and a monitor upon the wall. Before she could investigate any further, the Riddler's face suddenly appeared on the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hello Catwoman,\"</i> he informed her with hidden intent, <i>\"I understand that you're just as concerned with the mysterious disappearance of Batman as me. But unlike you however, I happen to know the man, or woman, responsible for this. But if you want me to tell you who accomplished the unthinkable, you must first make it through my maze.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman continued to listen, curious about her task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You might have noticed, by now, a small bottle in the corner, containing a strange potion, and a small door that you couldn't possibly pass through. Well, it is perfectly simple. All you have to do is drink the liquid, and you'll be one step closer to the answers that you crave. But don't try anything funny, I'll be watching you, and if you even think about trying to escape, well, I'm afraid that you will not like the consequences. Have fun!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riddler faded from the monitor as Catwoman turned her attention to the bottle in the corner. She picked it up, contemplating whether to drink the strange potion or not. She knew better than to drink it, but at this point, it seemed that she had little other choice.</span></div></div>",

It felt like there was an enormous palm pressing down on her entire body. Opening her eyes, she saw as the walls of the maze grew bigger as she shrunk. Yes, she realized, she was shrinking. Panic welled up for a moment only for her to squash it. She had to get through this with as much dignity as she could, and when it was over she could personally scratch Edward Nygma's eyes out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrunk rapidly, shrinking into her own over-sized costume, pooling as it was all around her body. Stepping out, nude as could be, Selina stared at the monitor, where the Riddler's face had sprung into life. The criminal had a wide grin on his face as he took in the diminutive Selina, who felt a cold breeze run across her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Feeling a bit small, are we?\"</i> He was clearly proud of his accomplishment, <i>\"Well don't worry your tiny little brain, I do have some clothes for you. I think you'll find them quite wondrous!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke, a small box was lowered from the ceiling. The tiny nude Catwoman approached cautiously, opening it to find a blue dress with frills and lace all over. It looked like something a nine year old girl would wear! Mumbling, Selina thought that it would be best to continue and, with a face of disgust, she slipped into the outfit and glared at the Riddler's image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Continue on through the maze, solve my riddles, and maybe I'll tell you who's responsible for the disappearance of the dark knight detective! I'm sure you'll do as I say if you knew what's good for you!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina sighed but nodded. She crawled through the tiny door, heading down the passage ahead, tiny feet barely making a sound as she took in the now much bigger world before her.</span></div></div>",

She felt a constant itch in her new costume, a blue frilly dress presented to her after she first shrunk. She'd rather continue in the nude if she knew that the Riddler wasn't watching. She already agreed to take on his outrageous challenge, so she wasn't prepared to give him the satisfaction of watching her in her nude, no matter how small she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon reached her first obstacle. In a square room, she noticed the small entrance to some kind of ventilation system high above. The vent was big enough for a normal-sized person to squeeze in. Unfortunately however, it was far too high, it was completely out of her reach. If she was normal-sized she would have easily entered the vent, or if she at least had her whip with her she could have climbed up to the vent, but alas, she had neither size or equipment, other than the frilly dress that constantly scratched her otherwise smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, well, well,\"</i> Selina looked up to see the Riddler's face on another monitor, smirking at her defeated stance, <i>\"Can it be that the great Catwoman has been defeated by a vent in the wall? Is she so small that she can't even figure out how to reach the next part of my maze?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gloating was almost endless. <i>\"Or is she so stupid that she even failed to notice the three pieces of gum sitting in the corner?\"</i> With that said, Selina followed his finger, finding three small pieces of blue candy, possibly gum, sitting in the corner. <i>\"At last,\"</i> the Riddler added, <i>\"For a moment, I thought you lost your sight as well as that ludicrous costume of yours!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspecting the three pieces of gum, small enough for her to hold in one hand, Selina was once again distracted by the sound of Edward Nygma's voice. <i>\"It's perfectly understandable my dear little kitten. Only one of those sweets will enable you to reach your next destination. The other two however, well, let's just say that you won't be so lucky. All you have to do is choose one. But do choose wisely. Oh, and you'd better choose quickly, before the room fills with poisonous gas.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistressed, Selina struggled to make her decision.

Before she could open her eyes again however, she felt a tingling sensation that coursed through her entire body. Strangely, she felt bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and looked down, horrified by the sight of her frilly dress tearing at the seams. The pressure was too much for the dress to withstand and, almost immediately, it snapped right off, shattering into tiny pieces, exposing her already inflated chest. She felt her entire body inflating. She could feel her thighs pressing against one another as her arms sunk into her torso that grew into a large, round shape, blown out of proportion, as if her entire body was being inflated like a balloon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could react, her legs sank into her enormous posterior. She tried to waddle, but her body continued to swell. She grew far too heavy. She tried desperately to reach for the remaining pieces of gum on the floor, but all she could do was waddle her hands and feet. She fell off balance, tipping onto her stomach. The swelling cushioned the drop, but still it felt horrible. She lost all ability to move under her own free will. All she could do was lay on her fat stomach, in the nude, and kick her feet wildly in the air. As if she didn't feel vulnerable after shrinking already, now she couldn't even defend herself. She couldn't even scratch her nose if she wanted to! She was disabled. She was completely helpless. Perhaps worst of all, she was still tiny. At this point, literally anyone could have their way with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if things couldn't get any worse, I heard a familiar voice from above. <i>\"Oh dear,\"</i> the Riddler laughed, <i>\"It seems that you chose wrong!\"</i> All Selina could do was blush, her promise to expose her naked body in his presence had backfired immensely, rendering her in such an undignified state and position. <i>\"Looks like you've gone and turned yourself into a tiny little ball! Now how are you ever going to complete my maze?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't worry your soft little head,\"</i> he continued, much to Selina's chagrin, <i>\"Fortunately I've planned ahead for such an inevitable scenario.

The floor continued to shift until Selina's round form rolled to the edge of the room. The wall then lifted from her path, forcing her to roll further down until she reached some kind of huge contraption. From her point of view, she could barely see what laid ahead. All she could hear was the constant sound of mechanical gears, and all she could feel as the freezing cold steel below her spherical back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, once again, the Riddler made his presence felt. <i>\"Roll up! Roll up! Watch as the fate of the bloated Catwoman rests in the hands of this poor individual!\"</i> From the voice of the poor individual, it seemed that she was in peril. The Riddler was clearly addressing some kind of hostage, forced to do his bidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I know you can hear me down there my little fat cat. Of course I wasn't going to leave you down there like that all alone. So you've failed to overcome my first challenge. Don't worry, you still have eight lives left, right? Of course I'm right! You've most probably noticed my lovely hostage down there with you, crying for help. Here name is <b>Alison</b>, and today, she'll be playing a game of <b>Human Pinball</b>. And guess what? You're going to be the pinball! Whether you continue through my maze or not, it entirely depends on her performance. So I hope you're up for the challenge Catwoman, because I'm sure that Alison will. After all, if she fails to beat the high score, you'll both die. Now have fun! I know I will!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had gone from bad to worse. Selina's fate rested entirely in the hands of this poor hostage. Selina had no way to telling, but Alison was looking over her, from high above, strapped to an electric chair, with the pedal controls in her hands. Realizing what had to be done, Alison prepared to begin the game. She pulled down the spring. Selina gulped at the sound of the spring loading into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alison activated the game, Selina was launched by a mighty thrust, rolling her into the massive contraption that was a giant pinball machine. Every hit caused her tremendous pain, the constant rolling was enough to make her sick, an illness that, for some reason, was restricted thanks to the strange gum she consumed earlier. She had become a human pinball. All she could do was hope that Alison managed to reach the high score.</span></div></div>",

Something had happened to her that prevented her from throwing up or falling unconscious, it seemed like an endless nightmare, a glimpse of what hell might look like. Alison was completely oblivious to Selina's pathetic pleas to stop, but who could blame her, she wanted to escape the clutches of the crazed Riddler. One thing that Edward Nygma failed to take into account however, was that Alison was very fond of her games, and pinball was of no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of Selina's well-being, Alison continued the game, as if she were playing an ordinary game of pinball until, finally, she managed to beat the default high score, much to the surprise of the Riddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Congratulations Alison,\"</i> the echoing voice boomed across the area as Alison was released from the electric chair high above, <i>\"I didn't expect such a pretty face to be so fond of a traditional arcade game, let alone be any good at it!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alison rushed out of the electric chair, with a damaged nurse outfit and make-up running down her face from her previous sobbing, she quickly approached the edge of the massive contraption below, where Selina, the human ball of fat that she had become, laid faint with her feet sticking in the air. Opening one of her closed eyes, she caught a glimpse of the massive face that loomed above her. She was horrified as the giant woman stretched out her hand and reached for her. As she grabbed her in between her fingers, as if she was holding a mere ping pong ball, Selina slightly twitched at the pinching fingers that dug into her flesh. Alison lifted Selina in front of her face in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm so sorry about this,\"</i> she apologized, <i>\"But I had no choice! He threatened me!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was unimpressed. <i>\"Thanks,\"</i> it was hard to make out what she was saying, she was completely drained from all the rolling, <i>\"Can you put me down now? This is so humiliating.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wouldn't do that if I were you Alison,\"</i> the annoying voice of the Riddler suddenly boomed across the room, <i>\"You might need that little ball of yours for your next challenge. As for you, my little fat cat,\"</i> his attention then shifted to Selina, <i>\"I probably should have told you that you are not alone in my maze. You see, Alison also wants me to help her find your precious dark knight. She has a few personal problems that only he can solve, but as you already know, only I know who's responsible for his mysterious disappearance. The question however, is who wants it more? As it stands, it seems that Alison needs the information more than you do. Alison has been able to succeed in the challenges ahead of her, while you, my little fat cat, have not. Now it seems that you're unable to move without the assistance of your competition, and to be honest, I'm hardly surprised!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison then turned her attention to the locked door with some kind of computer lock. With Selina in hand, she activated the lock, and the annoying voice returned. <i>\"Congratulations for overcoming this challenge. In order to progress, you must first solve this simple riddle. <u>Riddle me this!</u> I am full of holes, and yet I am full of water. What am I?\"</i> Shrugging, as if she immediately knew the answer, Alison typed in the answer with her free hand. <i>\"A sponge,\"</i> the voice replied, <i>\"Of course you solved that one easy! You were supposed to!\"</i> Suddenly the door opened, revealing a vacant passageway. As Alison continued through, gripping Selina tightly in her hand, the Riddler continued speaking over the speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<u>Riddle me this!</u> When does a cat become a ball? When she fails to overcome her first challenge! But what happens when she faces her second challenge? Will she succeed, or will she yet again fail and suffer the consequences?

Inside another small enclosed room, before her stood some kind of miniature maze of slides behind a glass wall, with what appeared to be a joystick controller sticking out in front of her. Inspecting this new contraption, Alison twitched the joystick to the left and, as she confirmed, she watched as the maze itself tilted to its left side. It was still unclear to her however, what was it that she needed to guide through the maze, and what was it that she needed to reach at the end of the maze?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Edward Nygma once again returned to the speakers. <i>\"Gazing at your latest challenge I see,\"</i> he said, noticing the expression on Alison's face, with total disregard of Selina's unfortunate predicament, <i>\"It's simple, all you have to do is find your way through the maze and press the button to activate the next riddle! But I bet you're wondering, what exactly can you use to guide through the maze? Surely there must be something, or someone, you could use, right?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that question, Selina immediately knew the answer, and realized what she had to endure. From her point of view, she could barely pick out what the maze exactly looked like, but she knew that it would involve a lot more rolling and bumping across hard surfaces, as if she didn't endure such a humiliating, undignified scenario already. She then noticed Alison looking down at her, who also realized what had to be done. <i>\"I'm so sorry about this,\"</i> was all that could be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at the contraption before her and, at the top of the wall, she noticed a small gap in the wall, too small to fit her hand through, but big enough for her to squeeze the spherical Catwoman through. Predicting this hole to be the entrance to the maze, Alison proceeded to stuff Selina through the gap, her sides struggling to squeeze through, until Selina landed on her bottom and began rolling down a gentle hill until she banged into another hard surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the joystick controller, Alison then proceeded to tilt the maze left and right, backwards and forwards, much to the dismay of the unfortunate little ball of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, how predictable,\"</i> the Riddler suddenly blurted, unable to distract Alison from the task at hand, <i>\"I take it that you failed to notice the tennis balls that I've provided for you to progress through this particular challenge, but I like your resourcefulness nonetheless!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was outraged, but this meant little to her at this particular point in time, her ears were ringing and her mind was boggling, all she could do was try her best to endure the impending punishment of bumps and crashes. Alison however, blushed at her failure to notice the small tennis balls sitting in the corner of the room, but since Selina was already stuck in the middle of the maze, it was pointless attempting to take her out and start all over again. As she continued, the Riddler continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's pointless trying to help her out now Alison, you've already started the challenge, so you might as well finish it. After all, if the fat little cat fails to reach the end of this maze and press the button in less than two minutes, I'm afraid that you won't be able to proceed any further, unless of course you happen to me immune to poison gas, which I doubt! Now hurry up ladies, time's running out!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was horrified and she started to panic, her nerves started to unsettle her calm nature, but despite her sudden claustrophobia, she proceeded with the task at hand.</span></div></div>",

What is it?\"</i> Distracted by the mournful Selina in her hand, still recovering from the bumps and bruises, but eventually she managed to solve the riddle. <i>\"Correct, it is a coffin! Even a child could have solved that one, but good job nonetheless!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar to before, a section of the wall collapsed, revealing a vacant passageway, clearly leading to the next challenge. As Alison and Selina made their way towards the next challenge, the Riddler continued to brag over the speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I see that the two of you are becoming a a formidable team! Let's just hope that this alliance of yours will be able to survive the next challenge!\"</i></span></div></div>",

A small bottle, similar to what Selina drunk from earlier, sat on the table. Alison also noticed a monitor on the wall, obviously intended for the Riddler to make his presence felt once again, as if hearing his voice was annoying enough! Confused at the sight of the small bottle, Alison picked it up to investigate, but before she could contemplate the possibilities, the Riddler appeared on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"As you can see, there is a small bottle, filled with a mysterious liquid, but I will not reveal its contents to you, nor will I tell you what will happen to you once you consume it. Unfortunately however, there is only the one bottle, and yet there are two of you, so you must now make a choice. Which one of you is going to drink from the bottle first? Just remember, whatever your decision, it may effect the outcome of your next challenge. So I implore you, choose wisely, but also choose quickly, for you will once again be timed, and if either of you refuse to take a sip before the time runs out, the room will be flooded with poison gas. Now have fun!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a difficult decision. Neither Alison or Selina knew what would happen to them if either of them drunk from the bottle, but as the Riddler clearly stated, one of them must drink from the bottle, or else they would both be poisoned there and then. The question however, is who drunk from the bottle first?</span></div></div>",

She had already used the tiny ball of fat that the once incredible Catwoman had become as a pinball, and then as a ball in a maze. She couldn't stand treating her as a ball anymore and, despite Selina's refusal, she gorged her tiny ally with the liquid, pouring it between her lips, in the hope that she would change into a less degrading shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mixture poured into her throat, Selina's nerves were instantly set ablaze. Her eyes watered as she felt a familiar tingling sensation course across her entire round body. Noticing the agony that she was in, Alison gently placed Selina back onto the table and watched in horror as she rolled onto her curvy back, wiggling her hands and feet as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison could only watch as the changes engulfed Selina's body, anticipating her latest transformation, trying her best to ignore the constant glare of the Riddler on the monitor, who smiled with delight. Witnessing the changes first hand however, Alison was a little relieved that she did not consume the mixture herself. Alison was lucky to avoid any transformation so far, but how long could it last?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Selina opened her eyes, finally free from the pain, and analyzed herself, ignoring the reaction on Alison's pretty face.</span></div></div>",

She was delighted that she was once again able to move on her own accord, her arms and legs were finally freed from the tremendous fat that she once possessed. Although she was not used to standing on her own feet at first, she quickly managed to regain her composure. Despite feeling a cold breeze tickle her naked body, she was relieved to have her body back to her normal shape. Looking back up at the looming face of the massive Alison, despite that she was still a mere three inches tall, she was still happy to have her fit body back again, and judging from the gleaming smile on Alison's face, she was happy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well done, it seems that you made the right choice after all,\"</i> the Riddler's voice suddenly boomed from the speakers, <i>\"Once again you have proved yourselves to be a formidable team capable of accomplishing even the most astonishing of challenges. But don't get too comfortable Catwoman, I have much more planned for you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, one of the walls slid up, revealing yet another path leading to the next challenge. As Alison scooped the tiny but agile Selina back into her hand, Selina pleaded to plant her back on the ground, desiring to walk to the next challenge by herself. Shrugging her shoulders, Alison complied, and placed Selina onto the ground. Although at first she was petrified by the enormous size of Alison's foot in comparison to her, she eventually grew more and more confident. Half way across the path however, Selina admitted that she wanted Alison to carry her the rest of the way, much to her adoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I hope you're both prepared for your next challenge,\"</i> the Riddler once again bragged, <i>\"Because I'm sure that you both will have your hands full with this one.\"</i></span></div></div>",

Notice the length of their jaws. They weren't easy to come by either, and they haven't been fed for the last two days. I can only imagine how hungry they must be now. I can tell by the look on your face, you're thinking how on earth can you possibly cross this gap in one piece? Well, if you'd direct your attention to the tubes looming above you, then you might have your answer.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison looked up and noticed the pipe maze hanging from the low ceiling, just low enough for her hand to reach. Unfortunately however, it was far too unstable for her to use to cross the gap. However, upon further inspection, she realized that the tiny woman who stood in the palm of her hand, the nude Catwoman, was just small enough to squeeze through the pipe maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alison stretched her arm as high as she possibly could, Selina dropped onto her chest and crawled into the pipe maze. It was a tight squeeze, and the only way she could possibly move was if she crawled through it. All Alison could do was pray that Selina would survive long enough to crawl all the way to the end of the maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately however, the Riddler was the type of villain who preferred to complicate matters. As Selina crawled through the maze, a small chunk of the pipe itself fell from underneath her chest, dropping all the way down to the alligator pit. Catching a glimpse of the massive drop, Selina let out a gulp before pulling herself back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crawled even further, now even more cautious than before, she then felt a strange liquid flow through the maze, feeling it tickle her naked body. That was when the Riddler continued to explain the latest challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I see that you've progressed quite far already Catwoman,\"</i> he explained, <i>\"That's good. After all, you only have two more minutes to reach the end of the maze and solve my riddle before dear Alison falls into the alligator pit below you. That is, if you manage to reach the end of the maze without falling to your demise. Oh, and by the way, you may have already noticed the bluish liquid flowing through the pipes. I would advise you not to drink the liquid Catwoman, because I don't think those pipes are big enough to contain the ball of fat that you once was, and I'm sure that you don't want to turn into a ball of fat again, am I right? Of course I'm right! Hurry up now, time is running out.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared that Selina had bit off more than she could chew. Despite hearing the distant cheers of encouragement from Alison far behind, Selina found it difficult to concentrate crawling through the pipe maze with the strange liquid gushing across her entire body, as if she was swimming through it, not to mention the loose chunks of the maze falling into the alligator pit below. Time was quickly running out, and the task at hand seemed almost hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Selina was not willing to go down without a fight. She relied on poor Alison ever since they both met. If it wasn't for her, Selina would not have gone very far, but now it was her turn. It was Selina's turn to accomplish this grave challenge. It was Alison's turn to rely on the almost defeated and humiliated Catwoman, and Selina was not willing to allow Edward Nygma the satisfaction of victory and triumph.</span></div></div>",

This was the driving force that led her through the tight maze. After all that they have both been through, Selina was determined not to fail. She was determined to reach the end of the maze in time. She was determined to overcome the odds in perhaps the most difficult challenge so far. For Alison's safety, as well as the mysterious disappearance of the dark knight, the tiny Catwoman was determined to beat the Riddler's challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed herself to the limit. The maze seemed to grow tighter and tighter the further she crawled, with the strange liquid gushing across her entire naked body. It was difficult to resist the urge of consuming the liquid, but the last thing that she needed was to turn into a ball of fleshy fat again, especially not in such confined space, especially while dangling precariously over a large pit of starved alligators. Despite the incredible odds, Selina managed to pull through and, even with time to spare, she managed to reach the end of the pipe maze, harshly dropping onto the platform below as she gasped for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely exhausted and drenched, she stood back up and noticed Alison, far on the other side of the long pit, clapping and cheering. She then turned around the see another computer lock, no doubt containing yet another riddle to solve. She approached it, and the riddle was asked. <i>\"<u>Riddle me this!</u> If you look at me, then I'll look at you, but if you raise your right hand, then I'll raise my left hand. What am I?\"</i> Selina was stumped at first, she struggled to regain her focus as the time limit rapidly decreased. Running out of precious time, Selina sat back down to concentrate on the task at hand. Suddenly it hit her. Noticing a small puddle from the liquid beneath her feet, she looked at her reflection. Realizing the answer, she sprung back up and entered the answer. With literally seconds to spare, she managed to solve the riddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What!?\"</i> The Riddler was in shock. <i>\"You weren't supposed to complete this challenge! How did you do it? Did you cheat? You must have, there's no way you could have done it! Well, enjoy it while you can Catwoman, for this will be the last time that you'll ever taste victory again!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping to her knees in complete exhaustion, Selina could only chuckle at the Riddler's distress. As his voice faded out however, Selina noticed a bridge extend behind her, reaching to the opposite platform where Alison stood. Crossing the narrow bridge, almost losing her balance then and there, Alison finally reunited with her tiny partner and scooped her back into her hand. She was about to kiss her before Selina threw her hands up in defense, reminding Alison that she was drenched in the inflatable liquid. At that point, another pathway was revealed to the duo, who were now more confident than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that freedom was ensured, and they would both soon obtain the answers that they deserved.</span></div></div>",

There, at last, they saw the Riddler, in the flesh, standing triumphantly on top of some kind of high platform, decorated with monitor screens and glowing question marks. In the presence of the Riddler at last, Selina scowled furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, well, well,\"</i> the Riddler boasted with delight, this time without speaking through the loud speakers, <i>\"Look who managed to make it through my maze! I must admit, even I did not expect you to come this far, but before I give you the answers that you so desperately want, I'm afraid that one more challenge awaits you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, three goons suddenly rushed onto the scene. While two of them grabbed Alison by the shoulders, the third picked Selina in between his thumb and index finger, tightly squeezing her torso in between. Selina screamed in pain as a sick smile developed on the dimwitted goon's face. <i>\"He he,\"</i> he chuckled, <i>\"Not so tough now, aren't you Catwoman?\"</i> All Selina could do was kick her legs and wave her arms violently, but the overwhelming grip of the goon's filthy fingers were far too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Leave her alone, Spike!\"</i> The Riddler addressed the goon carrying the tiny Selina in his hand, <i>\"You'll get your chance to play with her after she completes this last challenge.\"</i> Although he was a little disappointed, the goon followed his orders and dropped Selina onto some kind of table, completely disgusted by the way she was just treated by such an idiotic brute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining her composure, Selina stood back to her feet, watching as the two others goons threw a panicking Alison into some kind of glass chamber in front of her. As the three goons left out of sight, Selina was left alone to examine the task at hand, while the Riddler explained the final challenge from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Confused, Catwoman?\"</i> The Riddler explained, <i>\"Well, firstly I must congratulate you for making it so far, despite failing to overcome my challenges all by your own. It was clear all along that you needed some help, and that is why I decided to team you up with dear Alison. Adorable, isn't she? And yet underneath that beautiful exterior lies an incredibly intelligent mind. Not as intelligent as me of course, but nonetheless, far more intelligent than yourself. Without her, you would still be a tiny little ball of fat. But now, I'm afraid that you have to face a rather difficult decision.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's attention turned towards two red buttons in front of her. One of them was connected to the chamber where Alison stood inside, while the other was connected to some kind of box next to her. Inside the box was some kind of vial of a strange bluish liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"In front of you are two buttons. One of them is connected to the chamber that Alison is currently trapped inside. The other one however is connected to that box next to you. Inside the box, you'll find a vial, containing the very mixture required to restore you back to your normal size. It is perfectly understandable, all you have to do is choose which one you'd prefer. If you choose the vial, then the chamber will fill with poison gas, and Alison will die, but if you choose to save your new friend, then that box will fall, shattering the vial and leaving you to remain three inches tall for the rest of your life. Must I remind you that you will have exactly sixty seconds to make your decision?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So what will it be, Catwoman? Save your friend and stay as a tiny little bug for the rest of your life, or return to normal and leave your friend to die?\"</i></span></div></div>",

If it wasn't for Alison, she would not have gone as far as she did, she would have still been a tiny ball of fat lying on her back in the middle of the Riddler's maze. But to save a complete stranger at the expense of her independence in her normal size sounded ridiculous, even for someone as noble as the caped crusader. Selina struggled to make a decision, but in the end, her conscience got the better of her and, following her heart, she pressed down on the button to release Alison from the gas chamber. Doing so however, caused the box next to her to drop from the table and onto the concrete floor. Selina could hear the vial inside shatter, and at that moment, her heart sank, and the finality of her decision settled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Alison could react however, the Riddler's goons rushed back in and grabbed her. Selina noticed this, but before she could act herself, she heard hands clapping. She turned around to see the Riddler himself, in the flesh, sarcastically clapping his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How noble of you, Catwoman,\"</i> he remarked, with a wicked smile on his face as he approached the tiny naked woman, <i>\"An unfortunate decision to make I must admit, and personally I would have let the girl die, but noble nonetheless.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Let her go, Edward,\"</i> Selina suddenly squeaked in a feeble attempt to intimidate him, <i>\"You promised you wouldn't harm her!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riddler simply laughed at her useless demand, <i>\"I promised nothing. I merely asked you to make a rather simple decision, but I did not promise you anything. But since you've managed to make it this far, I guess it would be only fair to give you the answers that you so desperately crave. You want to know what happened to your precious dark knight? That's funny, because so do I!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina and Alison were both confused by this announcement. Edward Nygma promised that he would reveal the dark knight detective's whereabouts if they made it to the end of his maze, but it appeared that he didn't even know himself. But judging from the change in his expression, it appeared that he knew who was responsible for his mysterious disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<u>Riddle me this</u> Catwoman! Who was the one to eliminate the dark knight? The one who last saw him! That was you, wasn't it? You're the one responsible for getting rid of the dark knight detective! Admit it!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman suddenly regained her memory, much to her dismay . As the Riddler loomed over her, furiously burning holes through her with his glaring eyes, she recollected the last time she encountered the caped crusader. On that fateful night, she stole an ancient artifact capable of manipulating the size of an individual, and she used it on the dark knight, turning him into her personal pet slave for several days, until she lost him, almost as if he completely vanished. Despite the Riddler standing high above me, I turned to Alison, still gagged by the loyal goons, staring at Selina in disgust. She was clearly devastated that the woman that she once trusted had been hiding such a dark secret from her all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a futile attempt of resistance, Selina tried to explain herself. <i>\"Yes, I was the last one to see him, but I swear, I don't know where he went!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't you dare mistake me for an imbecile! I am Edward Nygma! I am the Riddler, and you are nothing but a tiny, insignificant little insect! I can crush you to death in between my fingers! Now tell me!

This made the goons worried, before they were snapped back into shape by their boss, who ordered Spike, the goon who toyed with the tiny naked woman earlier, to check what was happening outside. Almost immediately however, the overweight henchman found himself screaming in terror as he disappeared into the unknown. Their was a look of concern on Edward Nygma's once confident face. Almost desperately, he ordered another henchman to find out what was happening, while the other continued to hold Alison by the arm, but once again, the henchman faced a similar fate. The Riddler was now terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the final henchman could react, he was suddenly knocked out. The Riddler went to check on him, only to find a <b>Batarang</b> sitting next to the goon's head. <i>\"No,\"</i> he pleaded, <i>\"It can't be!\"</i> A shiver went down his spine as he felt a cold, dark shadow cover his body. He nervously turned around until he came face to face with a familiar presence. <i>\"You!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Batman!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I, Batman, stood there, under a dark shadow, with a score to settle with the Riddler. I approached him, and he panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping to his knees, I pleaded for mercy. <i>\"Batman,\"</i> he cried, <i>\"How did you find me? Where were you hiding? You must tell me!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk, I replied. <i>\"No.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward Nygma was clearly distressed. Desperately he tried to grab Alison, in an attempt to use her as a human shield, but I decided not to give him the pleasure, and launch another Batarang at him, knocking him out. There, the Riddler laid unconsciously on the concrete floor, his bowler hat knocked several inches out of reach. The Riddler was defeated. Almost immediately, Alison dropped to her knees, with tears of relief soaking her makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attention then turned towards the naked Catwoman, standing on the table no taller than three inches, shyly covering her nude body with her arms. After spending most of the whole night in the nude, almost comfortably, within the presence of the dark knight, she blushed with embarrassment. Even I couldn't help but let out a giggle at such a pathetic sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nice to see you again, Selina,\"</i> I said, trying my best to contain my laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Selina blushed again. <i>\"Spare me the pleasantries, Batman,\"</i> she sarcastically replied, trying her best to maintain a dignified attitude, <i>\"But, umm, thanks for saving us. But after everything that I put you through, why did you save me? A better question would be how?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It wasn't easy,\"</i> I explained, <i>\"But while you were distracted I managed to break free from your grasp and dive out of your apartment window. I laid low for a while, leaving you with enough time to forget about your little prisoner and stop searching. I noticed that you hadn't returned for several days however, so I returned to your apartment, knowing that you'd most probably leave that artifact of yours along with your collection of goods, and used it to restore myself to my normal size so I could investigate. While there, I found an address on a sheet of paper. I followed the address to an old, devastated flat. Upon finding caltrops scattered across the floor and green question marks spray painted on the walls, I knew that something terrible had happened to you. After interrogating <b>Sherman Fine</b> for his most recent transactions, I managed to track you down to this abandoned warehouse in the condemned industrial estate, all rented by Edward Nygma.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was astonished. <i>\"But why go through all of that, just to save me? After all that I put you through!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Simple. You would have done the same for me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Of course, I should have known,\"</i> Selina sarcastically chuckled at my response, <i>\"So I guess you didn't enjoy daily trips stuck inside my suit, did you? So what now? Is it my time to spend some time in your suit?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not exactly,\"</i> I replied, although the suggestion was tempting, I wouldn't stoop to her level, <i>\"But I think you might be needing this.\"</i> With that said, I presented her with another vial, containing a mixture capable of restoring her to her normal size. <i>\"I would have arrived here sooner, but I ran into the <b>Mad Hatter</b> on the way down here. I swiped this formula from him during our fight. I presumed that he was sharing his size manipulating mixtures with the Riddler, and looking at you, I guess I presumed right.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI placed the vial on the table next to the tiny cat burglar, who was thrilled to receive it. As she uncorked the vial and guzzled the mixture down, I noticed Alison, cowering in the corner. I asked if she was alright, and she told me of her problem. In response, I told her that I would sort it out immediately. I then noticed Selina, now back to her normal size, approach me as I tried to avoid looking down at her nude body. Seductively she wrapped her arms around my neck, pressing her naked breasts against my chest, and gave me a kiss. This was her special way of saying thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I went to attend to Alison's issue, Selina whispered to me. <i>\"Please make her happy, Batman,\"</i> she said, talking about the poor nurse, <i>\"I would have lost all nine lives if it wasn't for her. Please make her proud.\"</i> With that said, I disappeared into the night, leaving Selina behind to comfort the distraught Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was finally over.</span></div></div>",

The dark knight defeated Thorne, and safely brought her mother back into the welcoming arms of the poor nurse, who thought very highly of her beloved relative. Her mother was her inspiration, and she was forever grateful for the caped crusader's help, not only for her mother's safety, but for saving herself from the clutches of Edward Nygma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after they were rescued by the dark knight, both Alison and Selina Kyle were taken to hospital, were they quickly recovered to full health. While lying in hospital beds next to each other, Alison and Selina grew closer and closer, becoming very close friends. Upon leaving hospital however, they both went their separate ways. While Alison continued to succeed in her career as a nurse, following in her mother's footsteps, Selina Kyle, after designing a new costume after the one that she lost, went on to continue her life as <b>Catwoman</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <b>Riddler</b> was very fortunate to survive the night with a bruised skull alone. After all that he put her through, Catwoman was tempted to return the favor and provide him with a taste of his own medicine, but she was soon talked out of it by the dark knight, who had already confiscated the artifact she previously used against him. Despite her promise to Batman however, Catwoman secretly hid her own vial, containing a shrinking formula stolen from the Riddler's collection. She planned to save it for a very special occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he only escaped with a bruise on his skull, the Riddler went insane over the fact that he could not figure out where the dark knight detective hid all along. He was desperate to know, but all he could do was scream his dissatisfaction out loud, causing the guards at <b>Arkham Asylum</b> to lock him in solitary confinement, where he pondered to himself, and plotted his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn case you haven't figured it out, this particular storyline was somewhat a sequel to another storyline in this interactive story: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/cid/1165557\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/cid...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations! You've completed this interactive story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a reward for finishing this particular story arc, here is a bonus image that I drew especially for you to enjoy: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://michelle-the-monster.deviantart.com/art/Cat-and-Mouse-252067686?q=gallery%3Amichelle-the-monster%2F31847902&amp;qo=1\" target=\"_blank\">http://michelle-the-monster.deviantart.c...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this secret image, Catwoman finally gets to turn the tables on the dark knight detective and, instead of being followed across the rooftops of the city, she gets to play the cat in this game of cat and mouse. After Batman is shrunk to a minuscule size, no longer posing any threat to anyone, Catwoman uses her tremendous size advantage to toy with the tiny little mouse that the caped crusader had become. I hope you enjoy this reward as much as I enjoyed creating it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for your support, and remember, this is an interactive story, so as long as you follow the rules provided, feel free to contribute as much as you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story is far from over...</span></div></div>",

I, the dark knight, faced the merciless wrath of a giant Ivy on more than one occasion, a long fight all about the sanctity of a rare plant that produced an incredible chemical capable of manipulating the size of a human being. On more than one occasion, I found myself fighting from the palm of my environmental nemesis, and at one point, I was even an entire fraction of a mere fraction of an inch, a mere spot on the otherwise perfectly smooth skin of Poison Ivy. I thought that I would face my inevitable doom on that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the end, the dark knight triumphed once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to survive the night. I promised myself that I would never take Ivy likely ever again, I realized the true potential of her imposing threats. Even to this day, I was haunted by the events that took place that night, a fear that I struggled to ignore. <b>Nolan Black</b>, the owner of the Botanical Gardens in Gotham North, the man responsible for bringing the rare plants into the city in the first place, closed down his scientific operations after learning the error of his ways, and resumed taking care of his gardens, and although most of the plants were depleted during the course of that fateful night, the remaining plants were shipped out of the country, while the capsules that contained the substance, created by Ivy before her encounter with me, were stored within the security wing of <b>Wayne Enterprises</b>, hidden from the general public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Poison Ivy however, she was taken back to custody, and returned to <b>Arkham Asylum</b>, but not the same size as she left. Escape seemed unlikely for her, an impossible task from her new point of view. Her diminished size proved to be an advantage for security. She was locked in a new special cell, sharing similar qualities to an extended hamster cage, left to rot in the misery of her own failure. From that day on, Ivy swore that she would exact her revenge on the dark knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months passed since this encounter, and within those two months, Ivy was unable to settle down with her new size. Ashamed that she had become a mere pet for security, all she could do was cry to herself and cringe at the thought of her defeat in the hands of her adversary. During one fateful night however, the hope of vengeance suddenly became more realistic.</span></div></div>",

Such a gorgeous sight made most forget that the town was ridden with gangs\u2014especially in the southern parts of the city. All with weapons pointed at one another in a constant power struggle with only one man and his allies that stood in between the good people of Gotham and chaos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistinct footsteps echoed softly as the clicking of heeled boots could be heard. A tall woman in a black leather suit that hugged every curve of her body was casually sashaying along the roof of Gotham City Museum. It wasn't her first time committing grand theft, nor was it her first time even robbing this same museum. Red goggles shaped like cat eyes shielded her eyes which were also covered in black eyeshadow. A girl had to look her best.  They served to accentuate her cherry red lips that were coiled into a cocky smirk. Her cowl had two cat ears on her head. The suit in combination with her whip on her hip made it obvious who this perpetrator was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one and only, the ever elusive <b>Catwoman</b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmhmhmmmm!\" She hummed enthusiastically as she extended the claws out of her glove's fingertips. She stopped at a glass pane that was tilted inward. Cat woman poked her index finger's claw through the glass and drew a circle, easily cutting a perfect hole. Next, she poked all her right hand's claws into the glass and pulled it out, setting it down next to her. She put her legs in first and slid her body in flexibly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline thief scanned the room before stopping and taking in the sight at the center of the room. A glass casing surrounded by red ropes was her target. DO NOT TOUCH was what the small sign read. Selina smiled mischievously at that sign. She never really did follow the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman slung her whip to grapple around a support beam that was in the roof. She then clipped the handle to her belt and gently swung downward. With her foot wrapped around the whip for extra support, she lowered herself to the case for a better look. Inside was a diamond almost the size of a bowling ball. What attracted her to it besides how large it was, was the fact that it was also shaped like a cat's head with ears and all. This artifact in particular was said to mysteriously vanish only to resurface in other parts of the world. Most assumed it was just due to theft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to mama!\" Catwoman whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat burgular took out a small device with a touch screen. <b>SKELETON KEY READY</b> is what the text read. A little souvenir from her last visit she paid to Wayne Enterprises. Bruce Wayne would never go for a girl like her anyway, too much of a goody-goody. A girl can dream though, can't she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman tapped the device with her thumb and pointed it at the display case. <b>DISABLING ALARM. UNLOCKING. UNLOCKED.</b> The skeleton key worked its magic and an audible metallic pop came from the top of the display case. Catwoman carefully plucked the cylindrical top off of the case and reached in with her other hand. \"Come on... got it!\" She snatched the diamond out and gently placed the cap back on the display case. She grabbed ahold of her whip to make herself upright so she could study the fruit of her labor. \"It's real alright...\" she slid it into her satchel and climbed up her whip to the support beam to undo it and swing herself back to the window she cut a hole through to enter in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy night!\" The cat grinned as she strutted across the roof, hips swaying and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, Catwoman!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Spoke too soon!\" Catwoman rolled her eyes. She recognized that voice and knew who he was without even turning around. \"Come on batsy, not tonight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justice never rests. Now return what you have stolen and I'll tell the commissioner to go easy on you.\" The Dark Knight stood on the corner of a more elevated part of the building. His black cape steadily breezed aside with the wind. He jumped down and approached her slowly as he spoke until he was but a few feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine. How about we just\u2014\" Catwoman swung her whip to wrap around the caped crusader's leg and she yanked to pull his leg out from under him. She kicked her heeled boot up the side of his head to disorient him as she then made a run for it, hopping and acrobatically sprinting from rooftop to rooftop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catwoman!\" Batsman shouted as he ran after her. He reached to his utility belt and slung a batarang at her. She dodged it, but it wasn't being aimed at her. The batarang sliced her satchel clean off her shoulder, causing it to fall onto one of the rooftops and the precious diamond to roll out. Was it glowing? \"My diamond!\" Catwoman stopped dead in her tracks to turn around and rush back for it. Batman was equidistant from it as they both ran to collect the artifact. Neither of them seemed to notice how the ancient rock was glowing a neon violet the closer the two got. They both put a hand on it at the same time and a brief flash of light took over both the Dark Knight and the Cat Burglar's vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's time for you to step into this conflict. What happened? Did they switch bodies then and there? Did nothing happen at first? Or did they just mysteriously wake up the next day but things aren't as they should be?</span></div></div>",

He walked over to the couch where he saw two cats sitting opposite of eachother, he sat down in between them and did some thinking, \"how did this happen?\", \"Is it reversible?\", \"what will I tell Alfred?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then decided to change into different clothes that weren't so *ahem* skin-tight, as he briskly walked over to the supposed bedroom.  He found another cat watching TV on the bed, which had over 50 scratches on it, he found a dresser and dug inside until he found a black nightgown that seemed to be kept quiye nice. He took it and a few minutes of discovering a little too much about catwoman he was in completely different clothing. He then took to the scratched bed and waited by the cat for the morning to cone as he thought, \"i wonder how selina is doing?\" Along w8th the occasional, \"how the **** do women get dressed?!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Acting all high and mighty, looking down at us from his tower, laughing as the rest of us struggle to survive in the slums of the city. He expects us all to admire his bravery, coping with the loss of his parents. I, for one, am sick of his pompous, false self satisfaction, and yet you all continue to kiss his golden ass. Well I have had it. That is why, tonight, I will take Bruce Wayne down a few pegs. He will soon be begging me to put him out of his misery! He'll be wishing that he was gunned down along with his parents! So say goodnight to your precious billionaire, for it may very well be his last!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a chilling message from <b>Oswald Cobblepot</b> would not be enough to damper the spirits of my peers. The Wayne Charity Fund Party continued as scheduled, only with additional security. It seemed that the <b>Penguin</b> had put the Gotham City Police Department on alert tonight. Their main priority was to ensure my safety, but if he decides to make a move tonight, I will be waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fundraiser was as predicted. Catching up with old friends while meeting the new, all in the name of charity. Same old, same old. It seemed that nothing would ever change. Even after all these years, I was reminded of the dreadful loss of my parents on that fateful night at <b>Crime Alley</b>. Little did I realize however was that this was the night when my entire life changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that night, I reunited with some old faces. I was particularly interested by the presence of <b>Dennis Flaherty</b>, someone who I had not encountered since my years in training. I did not expect to meet him here in Gotham city. Although he was rather reluctant in interacting with me, I kept my eye on him all night. I recalled an incident all those years ago, and I remembered the arts that he once delved himself in. I suspected that he was up to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the success of the night, the fundraiser was almost spoiled upon the arrival of a young girl named <b>Emma Marshall</b>. Her parents, <b>Edwin Marshall</b> and <b>Janice Marshall</b>, were good friends to me, their family had been friends with the Wayne's for decades. I wish that I could say the same for their children, especially their youngest daughter, the six-year old Emma. I insisted that no children should be brought, but despite Emma's siblings sleeping with their grandparents, Edwin told me that Emma wanted to go to the party. He assured me that she promised to be on her best behavior. He was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was a success. Despite the antics of Emma Marshall, the fundraiser went off without a hitch. Not even the chilling message from the Penguin from earlier in the day was enough to spoil the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I realize however was that things were about to get worse.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As everyone began to leave for home that night, I began preparations to take to the streets as the fearful dark knight. I knew that there was no time for rest, the Penguin had to be subdued, but for some odd reason, I couldn't remember anything else from that night. I had no recollection of donning the <b>Batsuit</b> that night. The following morning however, I awoke to find a shocking discovery that changed my life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awoke in a strange new room, I looked around, and all I could find were pink decorations, stuffed toys and fluffy furniture all around me. Even the bed I laid in had patterns of hearts and unicorns. In shock, I threw the blanket from me and looked down. I was horrified to find myself looking down at a pair of pink and white pajamas with an image of a kitten stitched onto the top. I rushed to my feet, slightly stumbling from the surprising height of the bed, and stared into the nearest mirror I could find. I was terrified to find the six-year old body of the little brat, Emma Marshall, glaring back at me in shock. Suddenly it became clear. Whatever happened that night, somehow, some way, I found myself trapped in the body of Emma Marshall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never been so terrified in my life, and that was saying something. The sight of my reflection made me, almost instinctively, let out a small shriek. Never had such a high-pitched feminine sound come out of my mouth. I covered my mouth, still in disbelief by what I was looking at. Before I could compose myself however, I heard a booming voice from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Emma? Emma!\"</i> It was the voice of Janice Marshall, an old friend of the Wayne family, clearly beckoning for her youngest daughter. Suddenly she stormed into the room, swinging the door wide open. There she stood, wearing yet another stunning dress as if she was prepared to go out for another night. I was astonished by the tremendous size difference, she almost looked like a giant compared to my new point of view. She approached me, a slight shiver rose up my spine. <i>\"Emma darling,\"</i> she continued, <i>\"Do you realize what time it is?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't answer, I remained silent. <i>\"You had a long night last night,\"</i> she went on, <i>\"And you had a long sleep. Almost all day! But now your father are going out again tonight. Your sister, <b>Rachel</b>, and your brother, <b>Phillip</b>, are both sleeping over their friends tonight, so you'll be staying here with <b>Hayley</b>. And I hope you and Hayley both treat your new babysitter with proper respect this time. Okay?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply nodded. The mere difference in size was far too intimidating, even for a caped crusader. All I could do was accept her offer, and in the meantime, figure out a way how to get myself out of this mess. I remembered the Marshall family from before. I wasn't willing to meet my new siblings too quickly, I remembered how cruel Hayley was to the rest of her siblings, slightly chunkier than them, the fifteen-year old would be a force to be reckoned with, but then again I was glad that the sixteen-year old Rachel and the ten-year old tearaway, Phillip, were absent, at least for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now come downstairs honey,\"</i> she added, knocking me from my trace of thought, <i>\"Your babysitter will be here any minute, and I want you to meet her.\"</i> With that said, she marched out of the room and back downstairs, noticeably awaiting me to follow her. So without any other choice, I simply followed, still astonished by the massive size of everything around me. I even had to stretch my soft, short legs to take each step down the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I made my way downstairs, the doorbell rang throughout the large house. I awaited on the stairs as Janice opened the door, revealing my babysitter, and possibly the referee between me and my new sibling, the malicious Hayley Marshall,  for the evening.</span></div></div>",

I was born to defy women like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, don't worry about her,\"</i> Janice interrupted, <i>\"That's our youngest daughter, Emma.

Please call me if you need any help, and make sure you tuck my girls into bed early. Is that all okay?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sure thing Mrs. M, you can count on me!\"</i> With that said, the parents left the house, abandoning me with the abusive Hayley and the seemingly crazy babysitter who I immediately recognized. <i>\"Okay kiddo,\"</i> she said to me, treating me like the child I had become, <i>\"What should we do first?\"</i></span></div></div>",

Believing Hayley and me to be doing our own things in our own bedrooms, she gossiped almost all evening on the phone, a conversation that she tried to keep secret. Upon overhearing her conversation, my suspicion was confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey red, how are things? ... So far so good, this babysitting gig was a great idea, I didn't expect it to be so easy! ... As long as it brings in the money I'm happy ... Don't mention him, I'm not talking to him until he says he's sorry! ... I do kinda miss him though ... You're right, I've gotta job to do! ... No, it's kinda nice having a break from all the police, the crimes, the Batman, all of it! ... Oh, some little snot, Emma I think her name is, and this porky teen called Hayley! ... But they're rich stiffs, so I'm in the money right now! ... Yeah, I'll speak to you soon! Bye!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she placed the phone down, throwing her bubblegum into a nearby bin, she turned around to find me sitting next to her on the couch. I tried to speak as intimidating as I possibly could with such a girly voice, it sounded intimidating in my mind, but it was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I know who you are, <b>Harley Quinn</b>!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey,\"</i> Harley chuckled at my feeble attempt to scare her, <i>\"Shouldn't you be in your room?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No,\"</i> I simply replied, <i>\"I need your help, Harley.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression on her face suddenly changed. <i>\"What's wrong, Emma?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm not Emma. I'm not supposed to be here. I'm not supposed to be in this body. I'm trusting you enough to tell you this, so can I trust you to help me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Harley Quinn was not accepting what I was telling her, looking at me as if I were playing some sort of game. <i>\"Alright then,\"</i> she said in an attempt to challenge me, <i>\"So if you're not Emma, then who are you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm Batman.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Batman!? Now I know you're just playing!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, you have to listen to me. I don't know how, but I just woke up to find myself trapped in this body. You've got to help me!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No way, you're just messing me around! Well then, if you're the Batman, then I'm the <b>Joker</b>!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm serious! This is no game! I'm Batman, and I have to stop the Penguin before it's too late!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that no matter what I said, she just wouldn't accept it. She thought that I was playing some sort of game, it was difficult to convince her from such a short, pathetic stature. I couldn't find a way to convince her who I was. And even if I could, what then? Would she be generous and sympathetic enough to help me? I didn't care, at this point, I was desperate for help, there was no way I could stand a chance on the streets of Gotham alone, at least not like this, at least not alone.</span></div></div>",

The vigilante that she once feared and looked up to was now looking up to her, stuck in a form completely vulnerable to even the weakest of elementary school children. If she wanted to, she could completely overpower me, and there was nothing that I could do about it. <i>\"Hang on a minute,\"</i> she suddenly stated, before she could continue to mock me even further, <i>\"So if your mind is stuck in the body of a little girl, then where's the little girl's mind? Is it stuck in your body?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I think so,\"</i> I replied, realizing the fear that the real Emma must have been enduring in the body of Bruce Wayne, <i>\"That's what I need to find out.

I couldn't let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was reluctant at first, considering the huge advantage that she now possessed over me, and considering the amount of pain that her relationship with the clown prince of crime had endured because of me, Harley Quinn eventually agreed to help me out and, after tucking Hayley into bed, Harley sneaked me out of the house and into her car, but not without presenting me with a baby car seat, just to add to my humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So bats,\"</i> Harley said as she drove out of the street through the city lights, <i>\"What's the plan?\"</i></span></div></div>",

It's the only way we can beat him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Harley simply nodded her head. <i>\"Fine, I'll go, just don't start crying on me!\"</i></span></div></div>",

Jenny. The thought of being called Jenny left a lump in my throat, but then again, at least she named herself Gertrude Harrison, a name that I would have had no choice but to refuse. And as much as it sickened me to say it, I had to pretend that she was my mother, a concept that she was all too happy with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually we arrived at the club, and upon her first glance of the flashing neon lights, Harley let out a significant gulp of anticipation.

She said that we'd been on a long car trip and that she needed to go too. \"Let me just say this, do NOT order a Big Gulp from the last rest stop for fifty miles.\" Harley said as she bounced around to make it more convincing. I reluctantly joined in, saying that I drank too much apple juice and said that I was going to have an accident.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After some time elapsed, I finally regained consciousness. As I came to, I realized that I was unable to move. I was tied, by a thick rope, to a wooden chair, with my ankles tied to the chair legs and my wrists tied behind the back. Dazed and confused, I looked around. I was not entirely sure where I was, but judging the heaping quantity of wooden crates, broken props and coats of dust and spider webs, I concluded that I was in some kind of basement, presumably underneath the Iceberg Lounge. I was still bruised from the bump I took, but from my memory, I remembered how I was denied entry into the club, and how my associate left me alone in the cold. I then recalled how I attempted to sneak into the club through the back, only to be caught by a group of thugs inside. From then on, I couldn't remember a thing, and now here I am, trapped in the basement of the crooked establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I heard a groan from behind. I was not alone. Although I was unable to turn my head to catch a glance of the figure that casted a shadow over me, but from the shrill pitch of her voice, no introduction was needed. It was Harley Quinn, who agreed to help me investigate the club and return to my original form. It seemed that she too was tied up, with her back against my own. It seemed that she too was found and captured by the goons of the crooked owner of the club. I couldn't help but feel obliged to take the blame for such a ridiculous plan, but at the same time, I was still uncomfortable with feeling as inferior and insignificant as I did at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we both struggled to break free, a familiar laughter echoed from a distance. Our eyes turned towards the lone door until it swung open, revealing the owner of the Iceberg Lounge. <b>Oswald Cobblepot</b>, better known as the <b>Penguin</b>, emerged from the dark staircase and approached his hostages. Pure hatred coursed through my veins, but alas, there was nothing I could do. In my normal body, I would have easily freed myself from such a common position and would already be pounding what was left of the Penguin's teeth until he pleaded for mercy, but alas, in this body, I was merely another addition to his nearly endless catalog of hostages. I felt completely useless, helpless and pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Penguin approached us, he looked down at my frowning face and smiled, showing off his scorching yellow teeth, and took another puff of his chunky cigar. <i>\"Well, well, well,\"</i> he squawked with a dismantled accent, <i>\"Looks like my boys have caught a pair of bitches sneaking around my club! And what to do you know, one of them happens to be the clown's little squeeze!\"</i> He then turned his attention to me, unaware of my true identity. <i>\"And who's this? Your daughter? Can't be, she's way too fat!\"</i> The thugs that stood behind their boss let out a sinister chuckle. <i>\"Is she adopted? Must be, a fat little piggy like her don't belong to a tart like you!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Harley suddenly snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Get lost you fishy freak,\"</i> she screamed with all her might as I held my head in disgust, <i>\"Hey sardine breath, why don't you pick on someone your own size!\"</i> I had to admit, I too would be embarrassed by such a statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another puff on his cigar, as well as an abnormal squawk, the Penguin continued to gloat. <i>\"This one's feisty, ain't she?\"</i> The thugs then started to urge their boss to throw the first hit, and he complied, slapping the infuriated Harley Quinn with the back of his deformed hand. <i>\"I'd watch your mouth if I was you. You're in my turf now bitch, and there ain't no clowns to save you around here. But you know what I have got? I've got a smiling fish lurking in a pool upstairs just waiting to take a bite out of you and your fat little friend. He could do with some pork and beef, and he might just get it if you ain't too careful. Got it?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gulp and a whimper, Harley silently nodded her head, and reluctantly, I did the same. I was in no position to rebel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good, I'm glad we've come to an understanding,\"</i> Cobblepot remarked as one of the thugs handed over his top hat to him. With his trademark hat on his head, he made his way back upstairs, but not without leaving one more remark. <i>\"Now if you don't mind, I've got a business to run, but don't worry, I'll be back to continue our conversation later. Come on boys, let's leave these slabs of meat alone. Ha!\"</i> And with a squawk, we were left alone to wallow in our defeat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harley Quinn and I were left alone, tied up and trapped in the basement of the Iceberg Lounge, being held captive by the Penguin. I remained silent for a while, unwilling to show signs of weakness to the clown girl, although at this point it was futile, stuck in the body of a chubby little girl, I felt completely weak. There was no way I could free myself, and from the constant twitching behind me, it seemed like Harley was having trouble breaking free herself. I was defeated, and I prepared myself for the inevitable in the hands of Oswald Cobblepot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was however until I could feel one of the ropes falling off, but it wasn't one of the ropes that were tied around me. I then felt some weight lift off from my back. I looked up to see the face of Harley Quinn, looking down at me with a disturbingly amused smile on her face. Obviously I felt uncomfortable, still tied up while Harley now roamed freely, but it was clear that she was truly enjoying the role as my superior. <i>\"Hey Jenny,\" </i>she snickered, to my chagrin, <i>\"You need me to help you out a little?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't thrilled about her gloating over me, and I initially refused her help, but watching me struggle to free myself even more just made her much more entertained. <i>\"Come on, ol' sardine breath will be back in any minute! We can't stay down here all night you know...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to refuse her help, I was embarrassed enough already because of her, I wasn't going to allow her the pleasure of helping me out of this situation. I've escaped from worse situations before, I knew I could handle it. At this point however, Harley was starting to get a little annoyed. <i>\"Come on Bats! Don't you want to get your old body back or not?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this just made me even more determined, but then I stopped as Harley shrugged her shoulders. <i>\"Well, I tried,\" </i>she remarked, turning away from me, <i>\"But clearly you have everything under control. You don't need my help, so I might as well just leave right now. Good luck getting your old body back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley stopped in her tracks. She turned back to face me, biting her lip in anticipation as I tilted my head down in defeat. <i>\"Alright,\"</i> I sighed, <i>\"Go ahead. Cut me free.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley looks reluctant. <i>\"I dunno B-man,\"</i> she said, <i>\"What's the magic word?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...I would have accepted muffin, but okay! Just stop squirming and we'll have you outta there in no time!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith ease, she managed to loosen the ropes around me. I felt the ropes slide off my body, and I was finally able to move again, although I was still a little dazed from the earlier encounter. I thanked her for her help, to which she responded by patting me on my head. After reminding her of our current situation, I then told her that we need to find a way out of the building. She pointed at a long wide window high above the wall. I knew that this was our only way out, but I was not entirely sure I could squeeze through, considering my current body frame. Nonetheless, Harley hurried me towards the window. I was far too short to reach it, so instead Harley tried to lift me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Holy cow Batsy,\"</i> she huffed, struggling to lift me off the ground, <i>\"You must weigh a ton!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite struggling to lift me up, much to my annoyance, she finally managed to help me up to the window. The window was already unlocked, clearly the Penguin was not aware of this. I shoved the window open and poked my head through it. I looked around and saw that it lead to an empty alley just outside the Iceberg Lounge, nothing was seen apart from a few trash cans and small piles of junk. I managed to squeeze my shoulders through the window, but then I encountered a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body was far too thick to squeeze through. I managed to squeeze my head through the window, as well as my arms and shoulders, but my sides and stomach were far too thick. I tried pushing myself free, but it was no use. As I should have anticipated, I was completely stuck. Half of me was outside the building, the other half was still stuck in the basement. I could only imagine the sight that Harley had of me, but I knew how big the smile on her face would be, especially seeing the frilly dress I was wearing riding up my body to reveal a pair of pink panties. There was nothing I could do at this point apart from uselessly pushing the wall and dangling my flabby legs. I could hear Harley laughing her head off from inside the building, and I could feel my face glowing bright red because of it. <i>\"Harley,\" </i>I yelled, completely frustrated now, <i>\"This isn't funny!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley finally calmed herself down, wiping a tear from her eye. <i>\"Not from where I'm standing,\"</i> she giggled, still trying to stop herself from becoming hysterical. <i>\"Don't worry B-man,\"</i> she finally said, now much calmer than a few moments ago, <i>\"I'll get you out. All I need is a stick of butter!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that joke, Harley tried to live up to her promise, but not in the way I would have liked. I felt a sudden impact in my backside. Harley had clearly charged and tried to use her shoulder to shove me through the window, but it was useless, all it did was wedge me even further into the window, making me even more stuck. She then tried to pull me back into the basement by grabbing my ankles and trying to pull me out of the window, but again, all it did was slightly shift my body into a much more awkward position. It was hopeless. Unless I suddenly lost a lot of weight, I was going to be stuck here all night, and there was no other way for Harley to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to make matters worse, Harley suddenly squeaks. <i>\"I hear voices. Fish boy must be on his way back! It's now or never B-man! Suck in that gut or else we're gonna be fish food!\"</i> With that said, she resumed shoving me by the backside, trying desperately to squeeze me through the window. It was still useless, but then suddenly, I budged a little further. As I sucked in my gut, I could feel myself poking a little further out the window. I just needed to get past the stomach and fitting my legs through would not have been a problem.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a very tight squeeze. Of all the situations I've found myself over the years, this was by far one of the worst. Wedged in a narrow window, with Harley Quinn trying to shove me through by the backside, just minutes before the return of one of the most fearful gang leaders in Gotham, who would surely feed us to his sharks if we were caught. I pushed with all my might, and so did Harley, and inch by small inch, I was finally budging until, at last, I felt a huge release of pressure from my gut. I finally clawed my way out of the window, and I finally I had my whole body out of the building. I was no longer stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may have been free however, but I could feel a searing pain across my stomach. It felt like I was caught in a vice, the pain was so great that I could barely make it back to my feet. I laid on the concrete floor in the alleyway, rubbing my torso with great displeasure. That was when I spotted Harley, who herself had just managed to squeeze through the window, to my annoyance, with much greater ease. She did not get stuck, she was slim enough to slide through without a problem. The window closed behind her as she tried to help me back up to my feet, struggling while doing so. This only caused me more pain, and out of character, I let out a huge moan of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on B-man, quit your whining,\"</i> Harley sneered as she finally pulled me back to a vertical base, oblivious to the pain that I was in, <i>\"We need to get moving!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of running in this body was disturbing, I was already suffering enough, and I was already out of breath, but nonetheless I had to dig down deep. We began to ran, which was terribly more exhausting than usual. I noticed Harley running slightly further than my pace, and I knew she was holding back just to help me keep up. We might have our differences, but she has truly proved to be very loyal throughout this whole ordeal so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we headed down the alleyway, I could overhear a familiar voice from behind us, bellowing from the other side of the closed window. <i>\"What are you waiting for?\"</i> The Penguin was clearly not too thrilled about our narrow escape. <i>\"Find them now!!\"</i> With that said, I tried to quicken up the pace, but with great failure as I suddenly tripped up and fell flat on my face. Harley stopped and tried to comfort me, noticing tears running down my face. This was uncharacteristic of me, the tears were merely not of my own conscience, they were forced out after taking such a bump. Nonetheless Harley made sure I was alright before we started heading back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were fortunate to reach Harley's car without getting caught. That was truly a narrow escape, but for me, it was a realization of just how weak and useless I had become. We both hopped into the car and Harley revved up the engine as fast as she could before pulling out and driving away from the Iceberg Lounge. Hopefully this was the last time that we saw the Penguin that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure that we were out of Cobblepot's range, Harley finally eased up and started cruising the car. She took a glance at me, sitting quietly in the baby car seat, looking bruised and beaten up. <i>\"You okay?\"</i> she asked, to which I replied <i>\"I'm fine.\"</i> But she knew I was lying, she knew that deep down I was in a lot of pain. She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, you're not fine,\"</i> she said with a more serious voice, the same voice she used before she turned to a life of crime, <i>\"Listen B-man, you're not exactly in any position to keep up the dark knight routine. If I wanted to I could have offed you back in that rich stiff's home as soon as you told me who you were. But I didn't because no one deserves this. My puddin' would never be the same if he ever saw you like this. I know you and I have our differences, but to see you like this is actually quite upsetting. I actually enjoy the time that we spend together, even if I do point guns at you or you beat the living crap out of me. But this...this just isn't the same. I want you back to normal just as much as you do, but right now, you're not the dark knight. Right now, you're just a fat kid who thinks she's a superhero. You've already put both of our lives at risk because you believed you were skinnier than you thought. I really want to help you, but you've gotta know your limitations now. You're hurt, so just try and take it easy while you can. Stop trying to be something that you aren't right now, and start acting like a little fat girl!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that speech, I felt miserable. She was right. I was just a hindrance at this point. If we wanted to get anywhere to solve this mystery, I needed to know my limitations and try my best not to put our lives at risk again. I was thankful for her help, and I was thankful she did not feed me to her puddin' already, even if they aren't on good terms at this point. But from that point on, I decided to try my best to withdraw any attempts at the things that I used to do as Batman with ease. I decided to take Harley's advice and start acting more like the girl that I had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were now closing in on our next destination. This was our next step to discovering the truth behind this whole ordeal.</span></div></div>",

So Selina and Mary did, watching as Zatanna finished her show, still in disbelief. The female magician turned herself into a pig, became a giant-sized version of herself, and finally summoned a whole Roman legion on-stage, before everything vanished before the audience's eyes in a flash of light, leaving only Zatanna with a wide grin on her lips. Everyone cheered, including Selina, until she realized just how exhausting a simple task like clapping her hands was now in the overweight body of Mary Brewer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the audience filed out, Zatanna walked up to Selina and Mary to give them each a hug, slightly straining to wrap her arms around Selina's current body. <i>\"Thank you so much for agreeing to do this.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No problem,\"</i> Mary replied as she continued to examine her athletic frame. Before the show, Mary was on the run from some thugs, when Zatanna saved her life. She told the magician that she would do anything she wanted in return. At first, Zatanna wouldn't accept the offer but then tonight's show was looming and both of her assistants had called in sick. So she asked Mary, and Mary agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I suppose you two would like to go back to normal, right?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women nodded, though Mary was a bit slower to do so. It was nice being so fit for a change, much to the chagrin of Selina Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna closed her eyes and cast the reversal spell. Selina waited for the ripping feeling to return, but after several minutes with no feeling, she opened her eyes only to find herself still in Mary's grotesque form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Zatanna, what's going on?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna tried again, speaking the words aloud. She spoke several arcane languages, but still nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well...it looks like you two will have to stay like this for awhile. I'll need some time to research how to get you two back to normal.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How much time?\"</i> Mary asked, unaware of the distressed look upon Selina's chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A few weeks. I was certain I knew the reversal spell. Sorry.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sorry!?\"</i> Selina was starting to see red. <i>\"You're sorry?! Look at me! How can I be in society looking like this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey!\"</i> Mary cut in, <i>\"That wasn't nice.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well news flash, honey! I'm not nice,\"</i> Selina irrationally shot back. The two glared at one another until Zatanna jumped between them to break the tension. <i>\"Ladies, don't fight. I'll fix this, I promise.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You had better,\"</i> Selina growled. And with that said, Zatanna nodded. She was about to head to her study until, suddenly, several thugs burst into her venue, machine guns in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Where's that lousy cat burglar!\"</i> A familiar voice squawked, causing Selina to turn pale. Then, from the entrance, emerged Oswald Cobblepot, better known to the public as the <b>Penguin</b>, one of the most powerful crime bosses in Gotham city at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Zatanna pointed her wand and the group of criminals, including the Penguin himself, fell asleep, giving her enough time to teleport herself and the other two ladies away. Finding themselves in Zatanna's home, Mary began to panic. <i>\"What was that about? Why was The Penguin there?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna looked at Selina, realizing that she had done something to cross the crooked mobster. <i>\"You better tell her. She's a part of this now!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina groaned but eventually nodded. <i>\"You see Mary...the thing is... I'm <b>Catwoman</b>.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina waited for a gasp but what she got instead was a loud thump as Mary fainted. Selina gave a great huff, putting her hands on her wide hips as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fantastic!\"</i></span></div></div>",

The bird just happened to have something I wanted, so I sweet talked him at the <b>Iceberg Lounge</b>, waited until he got himself drunk, and then I robbed him. I didn't think he'd take things this far.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How would you like it if someone stole something of yours?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina groaned at the highly moral tone coming from her mouth. <i>\"Whatever, we need to focus on training you to survive in case the bird comes by again.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You'll teach me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Of course.

Mary wasn't paying attention however, she was too busy tucking into a large plate of assorted food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was about to reprimand her until she realized that she was eating even faster.

The formerly timid young woman was now far more confident. She was able to handle herself in a fight. It wasn't perfect, no way near as fluent as the original, but Selina knew Mary wouldn't fall to some random thug now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the positive. The negative was the weight Mary had gained over time. She had overcompensated each training session by gorging herself silly during mealtimes, the end result being the flabby, jiggling, mass that she had turned Selina's butt and stomach into. She wasn't outright fat, but the sight of her body with so much excess weight terrified Selina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary had tried to eat less, apologized to Selina, pushed herself harder during training, but the weight just wouldn't go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Selina just sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Never mind,\"</i> Selina said, <i>\"I'll lose it when we switch back.\"</i> Selina then looked at Zatanna, noticing just how much the mage had grown as well. Her fishnet stockings were struggling to contain the mass that were her thighs and rear end, and her face jiggled a bit, revealing a second chin forming. Zatanna's belly was evident to the whole world as it caused her shirt to ride up and even rip in a few places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's your excuse?\"</i> Selina smirked, staring down at Zatanna's frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna simply shrugged. <i>\"Well, with both of your appetites, it tends to rub off on a girl.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You actually like this?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna nodded. <i>\"It's not bad.

Selina will only get upset.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna scoffed at her comment. <i>\"Trust me, with all the stuff that she's done over the years, she deserves a little weight gain! Besides, she's pretty skinny for a girl her age!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is the spell really that complicated, or are you doing this to get at Selina?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It really is that complicated. If there was a way to switch you back right now, I'd do it in an instant. But I don't know exactly why it's so hard to undo. I don't know if it's your soul not wanting to return to your body, the difference in size between the two of you, or simply the alignment of the planets. Hell, it could even be all of those combined!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I get it, I think. Remind me not to deal with magic again, though.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna chuckled and nodded, before summoning several extremely large plates packed with pastas, fried chicken, and french fries. Mary smiled as she grabbed a piece of chicken and jokingly pressed it against Zatanna's in a mock toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"To the fat life!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna grinned and started on her next course.</span></div></div>",

Zatanna's eyes widened as she recognized the amulets that protected them. <i>\"This is bad,\"</i> Zatanna cried, <i>\"My magic won't work on them!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina, after clocking one of the men before he could fire, shouted back. <i>\"I noticed!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the sound of gunfire, and Selina dropped to the ground, rolling as best she could until she was under a table. Sweat was freely flowing now, Selina panting from all the exertion she had gone through, failing to notice the rapid beat her heart was pounding. Zatanna was knocked out, the magician only managing to down two foes before she had been struck on the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina herself was soon held at gun-point, not resisting as she was hoisted to her feet and the sound of the Penguin's pleased squawks came to her ears. The crime lord was smoking a cigar as he walked in, noticing the two captives he had caught, swiftly letting loose a cry of displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I told you to find Catwoman, not this humongous whale and her chubby little friend!\"</i> Selina noticed the amulet around the Penguin's own neck and how it was far bigger than the rest of his goons' own amulets. At least there was one good side to all of this. At least they weren't dead yet. <i>\"Well don't stand there staring! Find Catwoman now!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Right here, bird-brain!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina fought the urge to roll her eyes at the lame remark as she watched Mary drop from above, clad in one of her black, skin-tight, costumes. Thankfully Zatanna had enlarged it for Mary's use, as she didn't want any hint of her newly gained pudge to spill out so others could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched, she was quite impressed at how Mary handled the whip and dealt with multiple armed foes at once. She was actually thinning out the opposition by a large amount.  But just before she could take down another henchman, the Penguin lashed out with his umbrella, gas flying from the tip, rendering the fit and agile Mary Brewer unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Selina got to watch however, as a swift blow knocked her out cold.</span></div></div>",

Helping Selina to her feet, slightly struggling due to her tremendous weight, Zatanna showed her a map of Gotham city, a block on the map glowing orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is the best I can do,\"</i> she explained, holding the map in front of Selina's wide eyes, <i>\"Penguin's amulets must be shielding him from narrowing the search.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Zatanna, that's in the <b>Warrens</b>!\"</i> Selina was clearly distraught. <i>\"We could spend days searching that whole block with the amount of buildings there!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well it's the best that I can do, Selina! Now do you want your old body back or not?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in an undisclosed location, the Penguin was idly playing with Catwoman's precious whip, waiting to gain a reaction from his prisoner, who was currently tied to a chair, back first to the wall in some old seventeenth century manacles the criminal mastermind <i>received</i> a few jobs earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing his prisoner slowly regaining consciousness, the Penguin, surrounded by two henchmen, addressed the woman who they believed to be the real Catwoman. <i>\"Aww, what's the matter kitty?\"</i> Cobblepot sarcastically asked, <i>\"Normally you'd be upset if someone took your things.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the Penguin realize was that who he believed to be Catwoman was, in fact, Mary Birch, a woman who swapped bodies with the feline some time ago. Deciding that her best bet for survival was if she did not speak, Mary did not respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm sure you wouldn't like it if I scarred that smooth skin of yours, would you?\"</i> The Penguin brought out his umbrella, pointing it towards his prisoner as a sharp blade poked from the tip, <i>\"Because that's what I'm going to do if you don't start groveling for forgiveness for stealing from me. No one steals from Oswald Cobblepot! No one!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Mary reacted with silence, and in response, the Penguin gave an avian whark of displeasure, lowering his umbrella in frustration. With his free hand, he delivered a sharp slap across her smooth face, producing a deep cut on her cheek. He was about to deliver another until a third henchman rushed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Boss,\"</i> he said, <i>\"Telephone.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Penguin however, was not interested. <i>\"Can't you see I'm busy?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sorry boss, but this guy says that you owe him a favor.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the Penguin gave a grunt of displeasure. <i>\"I'll deal with you later, kitty,\"</i> he said as he waddled out of sight, followed shortly by two of his goons. He then turned to face the third goon. <i>\"Watch that cat! If anything happens while I'm gone, I'll ring your neck!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the henchman nodded as he turned their attention to the shackled prisoner, pointing his gun directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey Catwoman,\"</i> he noted, examining the prisoner's figure, <i>\"I always thought you were slimmer. Been packing on the pounds have we?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary inwardly cheered. After the training that she went through, she was more than comfortable with dealing with the incompetent goon that stood before her. Suddenly her chances of surviving increased. Her only hope was that the Penguin was distracted long enough for her to attempt an escape.</span></div></div>",

He watched as she leaned forward a bit, revealing her exposed cleavage, emphasizing how much her breasts had expanded due to the weight that she had recently gained. The henchman reacted predictably, as intended, and moved closer. He was speechless, clearly mesmerized by the prisoner's overwhelming charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at the henchman's predictable reply, she winked at the flimsy thug. <i>\"Hey, handsome,\"</i> she continued in an incredibly seductive voice, <i>\"I could really use a belly rub...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he was nervous, unsure whether to trust the chubby cat burglar or not, but after glancing back at the door behind him, realizing that his boss was no doubt still tending to others matters, he caved in. Dropping his gun, he took the risk. Reaching out a hand, the man gently touched the gut, bulging from extra weight encouraged by the magician, pressing the flab a bit before he started to rub in smooth, circular motions. His hand was warm, the prisoner's body heat was causing him to sweat. As he became quite enthralled by this, he moved ever closer, to the point where he he even wrapped his free arm over the prisoner's neck and shoulders. Allowing a groan to escape her lips, the woman posing as Catwoman struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the henchman realize was that, as he rubbed the prisoner's chubby belly, she already used the sharp tips of her gloves to break the ropes and untie herself and, as the henchman wrapped his arm around her shoulders, she swung her claw, viciously scratching his face. As he struggled back to his feet however, she was already free from her shackles, and before he could react, she had already knocked him out. It seemed that Selina Kyle's tutelage was successful, Mary Birch was taught to almost perfectly imitate the real Catwoman's skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow free from imprisonment however, there was still the matter of escaping from the Penguin's hideout. But then again, what's the rush? The thrill of overcoming the henchman's watchful eye was far too exciting for her to pass up so soon. She was far too confident to put her newly acquired skills to the ultimate test.</span></div></div>",

Isn`t that right Zatanna?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I was considering maybe giving you punishment for all the crimes you have committed\u00a8Zatanna said.

She rubbed her eyes in disbelief as she felt a sudden chill across her body, but there was no doubt about it. There she was, feeling as bare as ever, gazing at what was her own body passed out on the floor! She looked down at herself, realizing that her skin was green and coated with leaves. She waved a lock of red hair from her face. To her horror, she was trapped in the body of Poison Ivy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not remember how such a thing could have happened. All she could remember was that she was chasing Ivy through what appeared to be some kind of mall in the middle of the night until she was blinded by a mysterious flash of light, and when she came to, she was stuck in this form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when someone else burst into the scene, someone else who was involved in Ivy's plot that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment of her realization of what had just happened, Harley Quinn came crashing in, in style, driving a luxury sports car through the mall with total disregard for her own safety. She left a complete wreckage behind her as she pulled up right before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long time no see Red,\" said Harley with a jumpy voice as she swung the door open, offering her a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, as much as she hated it, Cassandra knew that she had no other choice. As much as it bothered her to leave her own body behind, and as much as she hated the idea of socializing with the clown girl, she knew that she could not jeopardize the situation already. There would be no way she'd be able to survive in society in the body of the eco-terrorist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this was not the only reason why she decided to join Harley Quinn that night, as she would soon find out...</span></div></div>",

It almost felt like Ivy's personality was slowly trying to take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me I'm fine,\" she suddenly replied in a soft seductive voice, very similarly to the eco-terrorist, \"Shall we just call it a night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding?

They pulled into an abandoned fairground on the edge of the city, where Batgirl, trapped in Poison Ivy's body, began having sudden flashbacks, not of her own past, but of Ivy's. She suddenly remembered that she had arranged a deal with the clown prince of crime himself, the <b>Joker</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back now Red, just gotta catch up with my puddin'.\" Harley skipped off further into the fairground as Batgirl sat alone in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone, she started to think of the dark knight. Her only hope of figuring out a way to sort this dilemma out was to contact him, but in the body of such a formidable adversary, would he be able to recognize her? Upon her second thought however, she suddenly felt blistering anger and rage at the mere thought of the caped crusader. She snapped out of it, realizing that it was Ivy once again trying to take over her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\" she asked herself, \"I'm a criminal hiding out with Harley Quinn, and I'm starting to think and act more and more like Poison Ivy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it came to her. She was in the body of Poison Ivy. This meant that she also had her powers! To test this out, she reached out her hand out of the car, focusing on the dirt below, and suddenly a vine shot from the ground, delicately dancing around her arm. She stepped out of the car and gave it another go, and suddenly a much larger vine burst out and swooped her off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she thought to herself, \"This is cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she realize was that the more she used these abilities, the more mental changes she would develop, and the more she would become like Ivy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she could explore her powers any further...</span></div></div>",

Throughout it all, she felt that perhaps she should have created more reinforcements from her plant underlings. She gave it her all, and she felt tired enough to surrender before getting knocked out. Unfortunately, she feels different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up from the fight, Poison Ivy looks around the room, strangely eager to have another go against Batgirl. That girl will pay for ruining her plans, she thought. Immediately, she gets to her feet, determined to prepare for any tricks that her foe plans to dish out. Poison Ivy scans the area, only to realize that Batgirl isn't in sight. Angered an on the offence, she yells out \"alright, come out bat-brat before my sweet greens get the better of you.\" Strangely, she stops after saying it after realizing the strange voice. Irritated, she cries out \"Are you copying me!? You bat creeps are getting annoying!\" Pamela realizes something. The voice is coming from her! Confused, she looks down at herself and notices the black costume present on her body. She looks at her hands and instead of it being her usual tan skin, it is instead covered in black. Pam moves them around, still unsure, only to see that they move well enough to her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared by her looks she squeals \"Oh dear, I'm bat-boob! Why am I in the body of batboob!\" She jump back in shock, only to realize that she moves back a great distance from her spot. Batgirl's peak physique is truly amazing. Pam can't handle this. Batgirl is her enemy, not herself. She feels parts of her body and feels the ultility belt, cape, and costume. Everything seems new, yet vaguely familiar. All of this is weird to take in. Trying to think of a solution, she says \"Gotta call Harley before things get worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam runs off to go find someone. She realizes that she is much faster in this body than in her previous one. Looking at the wall near her, Pam quickly jumps to it and runs on the side of the building. With a shocked expression, all she can say is \"How in the world.\" Thinking of everything, Pam decides to try to cool her mind and quickly makes her way out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading outside to the rooftop, she takes a look at Gotham and all that it has. The city lights illuminate some areas, while there are other places hidden in the shadows. Taking it all in, Pam wonders if she can find Harley and get her to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she does so, something happens. Someone swoops down behind Poison Ivy, catching her off guard.

I'm Spoiler again. The upbeat heroine ready to take on anything!\" She then strikes a power pose, showing how serious she is. Her enthusiastic personality confuses Batgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam doesn't want anything to do with her. She clenches her fists and takes a few steps back. \"Get away from me! I don't need to deal with another problem today!\" Just great, another 'hero' ready to ruin my day, Pam thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiler doesn't understand. Why is her friend acting so weird? \"What's wrong? We can talk about this.\" Stephanie walks closer to Batgirl, hoping to comfort her and get answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh, such the hero being all goody-goody while making all the other villains look bad</i>, Pam thought. She just can't stand these types of people. <i>It's just irritating!</i> \"You know, having another member of the bat family was just what I wanted. After all, it was just the thought I was having the moment I was making my plans. I was all like 'Gee, I sure hope another Batgirl appears. Maybe it will help ruin my plans better'\" she says sarcastically. \"Don't you have something better to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried, Stephanie says to her \"Batgirl, don't you remember me? You're the one who helped me get back on my feet to be a part of the bat family. You were the one who inspired me to be better than the person I was before.\" She points and looks away from Pam in Cassie's body. Deeply hurt, she turns around, trying to hide her sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis strange act gets to Pam. She never intended for this person to get shaken up about it. It's just she doesn't know what's going on. Now it's her fault for unintentionally making some sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam doesn't trust or like the bat family, yet she realizes that this one holds no anger or intent to attack within her. For some reason, she can just tell by her movements. Despite Pam knowing that the bat family is her enemy, she feels strange in that she can place her trust in the other Batgirl before her. Perhaps if she plays along, she might get answers. Who knows, the two might become good friends. Deciding to give it a try, Pam walks over to Cassie. \"I'm sorry, friend.

Hearing what Batgirl just told her, Stephanie says \"I guess so. Do you think we can be like Batman? You know, become top-notch crime fighters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy never really thought this far. Her, of all people, would have to fight off the people she worked with. There were times when she did so due to being double-crossed or felt that they were expendable, but not fight them in an active role. Just what did she get herself into by being in Batgirl's body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over, she questions ust how will she pull it off. This ruse of being this Batgirl feels weird to her. She doesn't have the powers of controlling plants and people alike. All she has is the power of acting like some sort of ninja. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, now she has a new friend, yet she's some sort of hero. Trying to make a decision, Pam spurts out \"Sure we can! We don't need bats anyway! Together, we can do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie turns to Cassandra. Right now, she feels happy to hear the words coming from her friend. \"You think so!?\" Wanting to show how great it is to hear those words, Stephanie hugs Batgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the hug, Ivy can't help but question why she made an outburst like that. It was like that time when she reactively chose to scale a wall and use some skills that she barely used before. Was her personality mixing with Cassandra's nature? All of this is weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Stephanie, she questions just how much passion she has within and what she can do now. This might be the right thing to do, for now, before she gets her body back. Feeling confident with herself for some strange reason, Ivy says \"Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie looks over to Cassandra \"Really!? Alright then!\" Since Pam doesn't know what else to say, she goes with it. At best, she could try to keep up with whatever Spoiler will make her do. Maybe something good will happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison Ivy tries to think of an excuse as to why she isn't the same Batgirl Stephanie knows. \"Um, but first, you're going to have to teach me how to use this. My mind got a bit messed up in my fight.\" In her mind, she hopes that Spoiler will buy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright\" Stephanie says. \"Remember that you have the batarangs and all the tools in your belt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam stares at her, questioning Spoiler's words. \"Oh yeah, great information there. That's sure going to help me oh so much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie pulls out her grapple gun. \"You see this, point at a building and shoot it. Then you'll be flying through Gotham with ease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam can't believe what she's hearing. She, Poison Ivy, has to go through Gotham by flying around like a crazy person. \"You seriously think I'm going to go do all that craziness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiler chimes in to convince Batgirl. \"Don't worry, you have me by your side.\" Turning away from Batgirl, she says \"Now off we go, Batgirl!

She is serious in her efforts in gaining control of the operations that happen in Gotham. Her skills are great in combat and in communication. As leader of the Golden Dragons, Lynx makes sure that her henchmen are able to carry out the tasks she gives them. Any insubordination will be dealt with swiftly and given no remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey work to manufacture themselves some weapons in a potential fight against Red Hood. He has been known to cause some trouble for the villains in Gotham. Not only that, but Black Mask and other crimelords want to gain control over certain parts of Gotham. They might see Lynx as a nuisance and take what she has from her. Lynx just wants to ensure that she is not one of them. With her weapons, Lynx plans on be ready for the confrontation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone is busy working, the bat-family work their way inside. Stephanie guides Batgirl through the warehouse, seeing as how she hasn't been herself lately. They stay hidden from view, trying to find a good spot for any potential take-downs or intel-gathering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeping on the people, they are shocked at what's going on. For some reason, it appears as though they are mixing weapons with technology. Poison Ivy scans the area and tries to see what else is going on. She soon stops after seeing a buff android not doing anything. It appears to be shut off. But from Poison Ivy's memory, she remembers it vaguely. It was a robot that was sent to attack the Justice League and almost succeeded. It could copy any League member's power and use it as its own. They called it AMAZO and it proved to be a threat. Just what could one of those robots be doing in Gotham, she wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt best, Batgirl might know something about this whole operation. Nervously, she asks \"Hey Batgirl, just what exactly is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a finger on her lip, Stephanie replies \"Batgirl, we need to keep our voices down. Who knows what they might do when they find us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry\" Poison Ivy says calmly. To think she would be on the other end of this whole situation. It feels weird and strange. First being in a Batgirl's body and now trying to pretend to be the hero until she finds where her real body is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to fan out and see what they are up to. Batman's gotta know what they are planning\" Spoiler tells Batgirl. Although Batgirl has acted a little weird, she trusts her enough to carry out her task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, the two continue their investigation. Hopefully they might put a stop to this operation before it gets worse and weird.</span></div></div>",

As a villain who has put men under her sway and people to obey her, she knows how to get around. Even though she is trapped in the body of Cassandra Cain. If she had her powers, Poison Ivy would just come in, smack someone, control people, and set off on a possibly good day. Either way, she is still curious as to what might happen with these goods present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way around, she manages to hear a conversation going on. Some of the workers are discussing how they plan to integrate Ivo's work into being used by anyone wielding their work. It's very vague, and Poison Ivy is unsure of it all. She wants to get closer and see what they are up to. So far, she hears how they are making a suit that will be used by others to combine the AMAZO robot with some other person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing this seems interesting, like stealing some gold from people, but without the mind control and plant powers. It was often fun with Harley around. Together they would cause mischief and mayhem, ready to see what the world has to offer. It was a good life they lived, but Poison Ivy is not in her body anyway. The question is, whether or not Cassandra is still dormant within her body or, somehow in hers. If that's the case, she might be trying to get her friend and idiotically herself arrested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, watching in the shadows, someone appears to be standing there. \"Looks like I caught a little spy\" says the person hidden from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley doesn't know what's going on. Should Batgirl be in her body, she might get herself arrested along with Harley. After all Batman and the other heroes wouldn't resort to being evil, would they? What if Batgirl is in her body and doing a better job of being a villain? What if she's out there seducing people and getting her way just because she's a heroine trapped in a villain's body? She could even be more of a best friend to Harley, and that's something that might stop Batgirl from giving her back her body should she like that role. Thoughts race through Poison Ivy's mind as she tries to find answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison Ivy realizes something. She has got to get her body back instead of playing hero with Spoiler. After all, the girl can do this on her own without her help. Set on ditching the heroine, Poison Ivy prepares to leave. Crawling away, she makes sure no one can hear a sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moves away from the criminals, she soon bumps into someone. She gets startled, wondering who she bumped into. \"I can't believe you're here of all people. Geez, try to put some effort\" says the voice. It's feminine, and familiar to Poison Ivy. Looking at the person she bumped into, she sees Spoiler standing before her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While most people wouldn\u2019t expect it, considering their respective reputations, Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent were good friends. For all they didn\u2019t have in common, it was out-numbered by what they shared: a love for justice, a belief in doing their part to help others, and the struggle to separate a fantasy life and their real life. Though which was which for the last point was different between the two. Still, it was because of all that that, after nearly two months on no contact, Bruce was getting worried for his boy-scout friend. Luckily, this just so happened to coincide with a trip to Metropolis for Wayne Enterprises, and as a stockholder in the Daily Planet, Bruce thought checking in with Clark at work shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one problem: no one had seen Clark either. It wasn\u2019t as bad as a few months, but from what Bruce could gather from some of his coworkers, Clark had started acting odd about two weeks ago, and then a few days after that, started calling in sick. Lois had done the same shortly afterwards. Bruce Metropolis secret headquarters wasn\u2019t as advanced as the Batcave, but he was still able to look online, and in the process he couldn\u2019t find hide nor hair of the Kryptonian Kansan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left really just one option: detective work at the apartment. Once night fell, Bruce became Batman, and entered the apartment using a special key he\u2019d been given, one that bypassed the normal defenses Clark had set up. But he hadn\u2019t stepped two feet into the apartment before being tackled by someone. The lights were all off, and Batman was so blindsided by the attack it took him a moment to realize who it was. \u201cWhere\u2019s Clark? Start talking, or I swear to God I\u2019ll...\u201d Lois Lane\u2019s voice trailed off as she realized who she\u2019d just tackled. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you. Good, maybe you can help me find a lead, Bruce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Clark had told Lois about his caped second life, it hadn\u2019t been long before she\u2019d learned who Bruce Wayne really was as well. At first, Batman hadn\u2019t appreciated this, but it hadn\u2019t taken long for him to realize that Clark\u2019s wife was trustworthy, as much so as Alfred. Fixing her with a look that wasn\u2019t quite as hard and harsh as his usual fare, Batman replied, \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d Rolling her eyes at him, Lois pointed to a nearby wall, where she\u2019d clearly been brainstorming connections. It didn\u2019t take a lot of looking to gather that Clark\u2019s odd behavior seemed to have begun after staying late at the Daily Planet Office. A closer look at Lois showed she was dressed in black, clearly aiming for stealth. Without a word, the two set off to find out what had happened to Clark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir investigation of the office began after the last janitor left the building, and together they carefully tore the office apart for clues. They were coming up empty, until they reached Clark\u2019s desk. In the bottom drawer, which only Lois had a key for, they found something that looked familiar: a green rock. But why would Clark have Kryptonite in his desk? Lois picked it up, then offered it to Batman. \u201cAny clue what...\u201d she started to say, as he took the rock in his gloved hand. But in that moment, everything changed, as their perspectives changed completely. Suddenly, each was standing where the other once was, and they quickly realized they were in each-other\u2019s bodies.</span></div></div>",

With trained reflexes that she herself never trained, Lois Lane in Batman\u2019s body quickly reached out to catch it again, before staring down at her batsuit-clad body. \u201cMy God...\u201d she whispered, her voice coming out far lower and more gravely than she\u2019d ever experienced before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was still holding it, Batman reached out with the feminine hand of Lois Lane\u2019s body to touch the rock again, but nothing happened. Fixing the beautiful face he now possessed in a grim scowl, Batman growled, \u201cIt looks like repeating the circumstance doesn\u2019t fix the problem.\u201d The tone of voice sounded completely wrong in the feminine, husky voice of the body he was in, but if Batman cared about that, he didn\u2019t show it. With a gloved hand, he pointed to one pocked in particular of the utility belt on Lois\u2019s waist. \u201cThere are plastic bags in there. Contain the sample so I can analyze it at my lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois found Batman was telling the truth, and soon was holding onto the green rock in a sealed plastic bag. Raising an eyebrow and adding more humor than was often found in the Dark Knight\u2019s voice, Lois asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you mean my lab? I know your crazy level of security, Batman, and that means that there\u2019s no way you can get into it in my body. Plus, I run out of sick days tomorrow, so unless you want to start using your billionaire bucks to pay for Clark and my apartment, you\u2019ll need to go to work in my body.\u201d When Batman gave her a sharp glare, Lois laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I\u2019m an investigative journalist. With your body, money, and connections, I\u2019m sure I can crack this case in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Batman didn\u2019t want to admit it, she was right. Thanks to the biometric scanners, there was no way for Lois Lane\u2019s body to get into his lab, and even if he\u2019d never admit it, he didn\u2019t want to be responsible for making Lois lose her job. That didn\u2019t mean Batman had to like it. Gritting the teeth in a mouth far smaller than he was used to having, Batman told her, \u201cThe only password you\u2019ll need is \u2018League of Assassins\u2019. Your retinal scan and a DNA test should take care of the rest.\u201d Then, he gave her the actual address, and Lois told him what story she was currently assigned to, a case of corruption in the prosecutor\u2019s office in Metropolis, possibly tying them to Intergang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed in their separate ways. Lois spent the night actually getting into the secret lab. It took some time getting a hold of traveling around the city by way of grappling hooks and running over rooftops, but after a while it started to come to her naturally. Meanwhile, Bruce returned to the Kent apartment and decided to try and get some sleep, since it was likely this body couldn\u2019t take the sleep deprivation he was used to. Sure enough, the second Bruce\u2019s head hit the pillow, he was out like a light.</span></div></div>",

Almost like he was on autopilot, Bruce got out of Lois and Clark\u2019s bed, went into the bathroom, and got ready for work. Bruce normally had some make-up skills, necessary for disguises and public appearances, but the way he got Lois\u2019s face ready in the mirror was completely professional, like he\u2019d done it a thousand times. Once that was done, he quickly picked out an outfit for the day and went over to her laptop, where his fingers quickly and precisely input the correct code to unlock the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Bruce stopped, looked at Lois\u2019s hands, and scowled. It seemed there was more to this body swap than just the bodies. More than that, the body was influencing Bruce\u2019s mind, though so far only in subtle ways. He feared if it would go further. Still, there was nothing he could really do about it, right then and there. So, he pulled up the computer files on what Lois had dug up on her current assignment so far. Apparently, Mack Rell at the Metropolis Prosecutor\u2019s Office was likely working in conjunction with Intergang. So far, Lois had collected some spurious testimony, but nothing that would hold up in an article or in court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, he knew the perfect thing to try next: infiltrating the man\u2019s office. Bruce left the apartment, locking the door behind him, and headed out to drive there, only to realize Lois didn\u2019t have a car. With no other choice, he hailed a cab, doing his best to ignore the leers the driver gave him the whole way there. Once at the building of law and order, Bruce quickly came up with a game plan on the fly, rather than his usual method of planning everything out ahead of time. Walking up to the receptionist, a handsome young man who looked to be just out of college, Bruce fluttered his eyelashes and made sure the man got just a hint of his cleavage. \u201cHello, I\u2019m here to pick up an important package from Mr. Rell. Is he in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bruce knew from Lois\u2019s notes, the man was at a meeting right now, but the flustered receptionist let Bruce in anyway. Once inside, he strutted through the office, looking like he belonged there, until he found the correct office. It was locked, but that was nothing to stop either Lois Lane or Bruce Wayne. Pulling out a miniature lockpick set the reporter kept on her person, Bruce used it expertly to open the lock with no fuss and no witnesses. Once in the office, he started searching, looking for anything he could use in an article.</span></div></div>",

With Batman visiting Metropolis, he had been forced to take on The Joker earlier that night. He had fortunately managed to capture the fiend, but Harley Quinn had gotten away. He had also managed to secure the abandoned warehouse and the strange chemicals inside. What Tim couldn't piece together was the plan. He couldn't figure out how The Joker planned to distribute these chemicals or even what they did. That's what he was studying now. Unfortunately, he couldn't figure it out. Hours of work, and all he and Alfred could determine so far was that they were non-toxic. With that discovery, Alfred pressured Tim to get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Drake,\" He explained, \"Your exposure to these chemicals was quite minimal, and now that we know they aren't dangerous, it would be best to get some sleep and have a fresh start in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chemicals may not be toxic, that doesn't mean they don't pose some sort of danger. With The Joker, you know there's got to be a twist.\" Tim retorted, \"But I suppose you're right. I could use some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Tim retired to a room in Wayne Manor. But it didn't feel like he slept long. He awoke to the sound a police siren. 'An odd noise at Wayne Manor,' he thought, but then he looked around and realized he certainly wasn't in Wayne Manor. It was a small apartment, quite small and trashy. He wondered how he got here. He started stumbling around in the dark, feeling something quite off to his steps but unable to place what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't find a light switch until he entered the bathroom. As he flicked it on, he was shocked at what stared back at him from the mirror: A stunning blond woman in a white t-shirt and short sweats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Miss,\" He said. Then he realized the reflection mouthed the same words he spoke. It dawned on him: He had swapped bodies with this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining the reflection just a little closer, he noticed the tips of either end of his blond hair dyed black and red. There was some pasty white makeup on the edge of his neck that hadn't fully been washed off for the night. His heart began to sink. The face was hard to recognize without the costume and makeup, but he certainly knew who he was now -- Tim Drake had somehow swapped bodies with Harley Quinn!</span></div></div>",

Tim had been the boy wonder for long enough for Batman to trust him to hold the fort while he was away. Robin knew all the ins and outs of the mansion's security systems and guard details. It was very rare that the Dark Knight left Gotham in the hands of his apprentice, so Robin could only imagine how disappointed Bruce would be if he came back to see this mess. He had to fix it! (From now on, I'm going to refer to Robin with female pronouns for the duration of the body switch.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stealthily hid in the shadows as she moved from cover to cover. All the while evading the sight of several security personnel. Well, she moved as stealthy as one could move while wearing high heeled boots. While she was infiltrating the manor, it felt strange how she had studied all the security flaws of this home with the intent of knowing how to keep criminal scum  like Harley Quinn out. Yet here she was, breaking in. Tim climbed up the vines on the side of the household. She had some trouble at first both due to the unnecessarily effeminate footwear and her body's new center of gravity. \"Ow!\" Robin swore in Harley's high pitched voice as a few thorns pierced her t-shirt and ripped the fabric clear across the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the rooftop with a huff, she realized that learning to maneuver this new body to do her usual acrobatic fighting style would be a pain. She sighed and blushed slightly when she examined the tear in her shirt exposed a prominent amount of cleavage. Thankfully, she wore a lacy black bra underneath. In a women's body or not, Robin was a man on the inside and she had to appreciate the size of the breasts Harley had. Batman trained Robin to be heavily resistant to seduction after encountering Catwoman and Poison Ivy. Yet, this was her body now, at least until she can fix it. A slight temptation beckoned her to explore her new form. A dainty hand snaked its way up her toeso and she just felt it for a moment, blushing as she inhaled deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snap out of it!\" That sounded weird coming from Harley's voice. She shook her head and regained focus. \"Alfred!\" She whispered, remembering the urgency of her situation. She never lost focus like that in her actual body! Robin quickly unfastened the hidden lock on the skylight and she dropped down into the dark dining room. The light was still on from the kitchen and she overheard Alfred putting some food away. Robin was uncertain if she should just approach him in this form or if there was a better way of doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she could make that decision, the light to the dining room was on and she was face to face with a very confused Alfred. The elderly man had frozen in shock for a moment and immediately turned around, walking at a brisk pace. He was going to go set off the alarm that would notify Batman that Wayne Manor was compromised. \"Wait, Alfred! Wait!\" She chased after him, almost tripping on her heels. \"Who are you and how do you know my name?!\" He backed away, raising his arms defensively. \"Alfred! It's me! Tim! Tim Drake!\" Alfred coiled a brow at that remark but returned to his serious frown. \"That's preposterous! Clearly you are ill, young lady. You need professional help!\" Alfred didn't believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alfred, I can prove it!\" Robin got an idea. She headed over to the large grandfather clock. Alfred chased after her. \"Hey! You get back here!\" Robin ignored him as she turned the clock's hands to a precise time. The clock moved to the side on its own and revealed a secret stairway that led down to the batcave. \"10:47PM, the exact time of night Bruce's parents were murdered.\" Tim stated confidently. \"H-how could you possibly know\u2014Master Tim?\" Alfred finally believed him after a brief pause. \"H-how... why...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alfred, listen to me. I went to bed like you told me to and I woke up in Harley Quinn's body! We need to capture Harley in my body before I\u2014she\u2014he\u2014whatever, does some serious damage!\" Robin told Alfred frantically. He nodded. \"Then there is no time to waste...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, the dynamic duo headed to Tim's room. What did they find?</span></div></div>",

With the dark knight tackling the criminal masterminds of the city, and with the boy wonder busy with his studies, she was alone during her patrol, at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't seem to mind, even when a slow day like this made the hours drag on far longer than if she were actually tracking or trailing some criminal activity. She paused atop of a building in the central section of the city, around her position were a few well-known businesses. She didn't need experience to know that it was more often than not a hotbed of crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the locales, a slight smile appeared on her lips as she came to spot on a familiar figure, the elusive burglar, <b>Catwoman</b>. The dark spandex-wearing woman quietly and expertly was in the middle of breaking into one of the city's most well-known jewelry stores. It figured that the lady always had a cat's eye for anything remotely shiny or valuable. Waiting for her to break in, Batgirl figured it was time she did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisabling the security system was a little too easy for the cat burglar. Her prize was a jeweled cat figure, imported from Egypt, worth reportedly half a million dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArrive, steal, leave. Her task was so easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn instinct, she dodged a <b>Batarang</b> aiming straight for the small of her back. <i>\"Figures he'd be here,\"</i> the burglar thought to herself, but as she turned her face felt a much different fist connect around her right cheek. <i>\"Well,\"</i> she remarked,  <i>\"Not who I figured it'd be!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah just like I figured you'd be after the kitty cat in the case!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Clever girl.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out her whip, the cat and the bat exchanged strikes with one another. Their battle continued for several minutes. Selina Kyle was not at all surprised with how well Batgirl was able to keep up with her. She was, after all, a partner to the one and only dark knight. However the bat was unaware of the cat's true intentions. While her eyes were certainly on the prized feline, she had been carrying a little something she was very interested in testing, especially after something similar had occurred to her months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a hasty retreat after another quick dodge, Catwoman made for her personal entrance, hoping that her opponent would follow, and follow she did. Outside, Batgirl wondered where Selina had escaped to. Just then, Batgirl gasped as she felt her legs suddenly give out on her, causing the defenseless girl to crash face first onto the rooftop's hard surface, knocking her out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, with a troubling headache, Batgirl finally regained consciousness, completely unaware of where she was or what had happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah, nice to see you've come around.\"</i> She recognized the voice of Catwoman and, sure enough, the sultry criminal strolled up towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Where am I?\"</i> Barbara asked, her mind still foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"At my place,\"</i> Selina explained, inching ever closer to her prisoner, <i>\" You see, I wanted you to test out something for me and, to be quite honest, it worked just as expected!

Her face had several chins and her cheeks could house an army of chipmunks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman purred in satisfaction at the sight of Batgirl, who was only now just realizing what she had become, much to her horror.

Just because she had been made stunningly obese didn't mean she had forgotten the skills taught to her by the dark knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Jeez for a cat bugler you'd think she'd have better security...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instantly recognized that certain high-pitched tone of voice.

It is you, isn't it?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer time with the clown prince of crime had ensured that she wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. <i>\"Well, this is a huge,\"</i> her sudden laughter earned her a sharp glare, <i>\"Pardon the obvious pun, but surprise! I came looking for a little something that kitty stole before Mister J could get his precious hands on it, but instead of finding her, I find a big bloated bat! Ha!

To Batgirl, the truth was more embarrasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sounds like someone's hungry.\" Catwoman said, patting Batgirl's titanic tummy. \"Don't worry, I've got the thing to help with that.\" She then walked over to a nearby door and opened it. It was a closet, and inside was a platter full of sweets. Catwoman picked it up and walked over to Batgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had Sweet Tooth whip this up.\" She said. \"Don't worry, I made sure he didn't put any poison or traps in them.\" She set the tray on Batgirl's massive chest and picked up a scone. Batgirl shut her mouth tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you don't eat, that hunger's going to drive you mad.\" Catwoman said. \"Believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl stared at her for a minute, then relented and opened her mouth. Catwoman smiled and placed the scone in Batgirl's mouth. As much as the immobilized heroine didn't want to admit, the scone was delicious. Catwoman started to feed her more treats as she began talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're probably wondering where my little fattening surprise came from. Well, I swiped it from Wayne Industries. Supposed to help with ending world hunger or something.\" Catwoman said. \"But I convinced Crane to do a little alteration to it. He tried to make it so people hit with it became terrified of being skinny, but one threat to claw his face off changed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl was a bit confused while she chewed a donut. \"What's the point of this? And what did you mean by revenge?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't anyone tell you it's rude to talk with your mouth full?\" Catwoman teased as she fed Batgirl a strawberry shortcake. By this point she had climbed up on Batgirl and was lying on her massive chest. \"But to answer your question, Pammy and Harley had something similar. Well, Pammy did anyway. Made me enormous too, though not as big as you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl swallowed and looked at Catwoman bewildered. \"What reason would they have for doing that?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell if I know. Maybe they wanted a test subject. Maybe they wanted me out of the way. Maybe it's what Pammy's into.\" Catwoman replied. \"Point is, they made me 800 pounds. Pammy even said it changed my celluar structure so that my body thought I was always that fat, said I could exercise for a hundred years but never lose any weight. But I was cured eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you didn't do that to me, did you?\" Batgirl asked, now a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. I'm not heartless.\" Catwoman answered, sticking an eclair in Batgirls mouth. \"In fact, I'll even give you a chance to be cured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, really?\" Batgirl asked, chewing and swallowing the eclair. Then she realized something. \"What's the catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I'm not totally sure Crane did a good job with my new little toy, so I want to make sure nothing goes wrong. So, here's the deal. You stay with me for, oh, let's say two weeks. I make sure this works properly, and you get free food.\" Catwoman explained, climbing off Batgirl now that the tray was empty. \"I'd say free bed too, but you seem to be your own bed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I say no?\" Batgirl asked defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman shrugged. \"Then I leave. And you get to spend the rest of your life like this.\" She said, slapping Batgirl's massive belly for emphasis, sending shockwaves across her whole body. It took several seconds for Batgirl to stop shaking. \"So, what's your answer, Batgirl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring at Catwoman, Batgirl... </span></div></div>",

I don't mean as in you'll engulf this entire place in the next minute or so, but you are still, albeit slowly might I add, growing fatter,\"</i> The cat explained, and while it was somewhat comforting to know she wasn't moments away from turning into some horrendous blob monster, Barbara still didn't like the idea that her body was still not done growing, never mind that shedding off a literal ton of weight was already going to be a huge hassle unless Selina had a cure lying somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Cure me now!\"</i> She yelled at Selina for a moment, ignoring her sudden request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sorry but I don't have anything like that.

You, on the other hand, can make yourself at home.

Ivy was a few feet away, green belly sticking out a bit. <i>\"Getting a bit big for your britches, aren't you Ivy?\"</i> Selina purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm just putting on water weight,\"</i> Ivy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sure, sure, whatever you say.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had both taken what they wanted from the heir shortly afterward, Selina making off with some jewels while Ivy escaped with a rare kind of daisy. The memory of Selina's taunt still fresh in her mind, Poison Ivy decided to take a more subtle approach. Dialing Selina's number, she got a hold of the thief. <i>\"I'd like to plan another heist with you. Would you mind coming over to my place?\"</i> Selina agreed and, after getting directions, hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next evening, Selina showed up at Ivy's current lair, a model home community on the outskirts of Gotham. Ivy greeted her with a smile, which Selina carefully returned, though her grin soon turned catty as she poked Ivy's much larger middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Still living in the fat lane, huh Ivy?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I've just gotten in touch with the woman inside me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Looks like you've got more than one in there,\"</i> Selina joked, before sitting down on the couch, ready to go over their plans.

Ivy watched as Catwoman gorged herself silly, managing to devour the entire cart by herself, the end result being a stuffed cat burglar rubbing her large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy watched her plan unfold in front of her very eyes, smiling with delight.</span></div></div>",

Her softer face grew pale with shock as she took in the full view of her body.  Her stomach was the first thing she noticed.  It was still bloated and round from her binge the night before that was only vaguely coming back to her, but there was a layer of softness around that told her in no uncertain terms that when the swelling went down her trim, athletic midsection would no longer be there.  She had work her semi-professional attire there, which was fortunate as her usual cat suit she brought along would not have survived.  Her form fitting blouse rode up over her new belly, pressing into her swollen breasts.  Her bra was tight to the breaking point, but she was only dimly aware of how much it was hurting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole body had been fattened, and yet she wasn't fat yet.  Just chubby.  Curvy, maybe.  Her hourglass figure emphasized by some extra pounds.  She winced as he eyes took in her now widened hips, her unbuttoned slacks which were near the tearing point on every seam.  Her arms, no longer trim and muscular, but soft, doughy, stuffed into her shirt as her thighs where in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly growled, causing a slight and disconcerting jiggle throughout her whole body.  By just looking down she could feel the budding double chin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh . . . oh god,\" she whispered.  She tried calming her breathing, tried not to make any sudden movements to risk waking Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My god, she did this to me.  She's making me like her.  But worse, if she has her way</i>.  Why or how didn't matter to Selina right now.  Many concerns went through her head.  How useful would her acrobatic skills be with all this fat weighing her down?  How long would it take to get her figure back into fighting shape?  But, mostly, as her anger grew, how she would get out and get back at Ivy for this.  She could bare control herself from shaking with rage at what Ivy had done to her--and with fear of what else she would do to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>First things first, I've got to get out of here,</i> she thought, and, very slowly, began lifting Ivy's fat arm from around her . . .</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever so slowly, moving inch by inch, Selina very carefully lifted Ivy's arm from around her, letting it drop quietly to her side.  She was certain every slight movement, every rustling of the sheets, vines, and leaves around them, would wake her.  Normally Selina would have every confidence in her ability to move silently.  But she was near panicked now, and more importantly, she could feel how different her body moved now.  It was heavier, doughy.  Her legs were stuffed into pants far too tight, the seams all but coming undone, her belly jiggling and breasts jiggling uncomfortably with every motion.  It was enough to make her want to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Made it!</i>  Selina swung her legs to the side of the bed and attempted to hop up in her typical, cat-like fashion.  She hopped up all right, but then nearly fell back down.  She grabbed a table after stumbling forward a few steps.  <i>Oh, come on, I'm not so fat yet that I'm having this much trouble walking,</i> she scolded herself.  Just to see if she could, she tried to button her slacks.  They came close but no such luck.  Her tummy was too full, to soft, to admit it.  She grimaced at the sight of her once proud abs reduced to a pudgy belly sticking out almost as far as her breasts.  She tugged her shirt down to at least cover it up some.  She would have to exam the damage to her figure later, however.  She bent down to pick up her back--which, she realized, contained her cat suit which wouldn't come close to zipping up on her now--and heard a tear from her rear.  She blushed, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jesus, Ivy, couldn't even let me keep my ass?</i> she thought.  She made her way towards a vine-covered staircase that would eventually lead to the streets.  She took one last angry look at Ivy, fast asleep, smiling, so plump.  Selina could go over there and strangle her right now after realizing that Ivy would have made her even fatter than she already had.  No, that could wait.  She turned, and then--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whiiiiiiiiiiiir . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina stopped in her tracks and bent over, one hand gripping her stomach.  It had started buzzing, gurgling a little, almost like a motor turning on inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uurrrrp,\" she stifled the burp as much as she could, scared her body would betray her yet again.  Her stomach churned uncomfortably, the whirring sound growing lower.  She could feel another belch welling up inside her, a massive one, one that wouldn't fail to wake her tormenter.  She gripped her belly with both hands, holding her breath as the buzzing, churning sound faded away, dissipating in a series of unnerving, quickening sensations deep inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina waited for a full minute before moving again.  She wanted to rationalize it as bad gas, but she knew better.  Ivy's poisons where in her now.  She could think of only one cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the sewers and finally into the subway system proved harder than when she had arrived.  Her thighs were starting to rub together.  Her hips swayed like an exaggerated strut.  She had to keep tugging her shirt down to vainly hide the fact that her slacks were unbuttoned.  And to top it off, she had to make sure her bag was situated over her now giant ass to hide the tear there.  Fortunately it was very early morning.  The subways weren't running yet, and Selina had yet to run across another soul.  It made traveling fast easier.  Also, she was feeling much more self-conscious than she ever had her entire life, and did not want anyone at all to see her in this state.  She caught glimpses of herself in windows as she made her way to the street level.  Still recognizable, yes.  She was curvy now, maybe voluptuous if she was being charitable, and her face still pretty despite the puffiness.  If her breasts and hips had only grown she could have lived with that, but that her ass and belly were clearly going to hold the bulk of her fat if she grew any bigger was a nightmare come true to the always athletic thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were people on the street.  She avoided eye contact.  It was all she could do to keep some sense of pride right then.  She hailed a cab easily.  She was convinced the cabby was perusing her figure critically as she got in, but it was probably just her own insecurities as newly chubby as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed with some relief.  At least she had went to Ivy's in her full Catwoman carb.  She'd be naked and helpless.  At least now she was able to escape and figure out what--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whiiiiiiiiiiiir . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh,\" Selina cooed and doubled over as the vibrations deep within her began again.  A few tiny burps followed, rumblings, gurgling, a whole slew of disgusting movements and sounds coming from her once beautifully fit tummy.  She wrapped her arms around it, wincing at the heavy churning sensation and the softness.  She remembered what she thought before, that it felt like a tiny factory inside her gut was turning on.  Within a minute, it was gone, and she was left with a full, bloated belly and feeling a little hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, miss?\" the cabby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp,\" Selina covered her mouth, \"I'm fine.  Indigestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening to her?  She knew exactly who would be the right person to call, the one who she could count on and fix whatever Ivy had done to her.  But, as much as she hated to admit it, she was dreading the thought of Batman seeing her like this, so plump and wobbly, with a stomach that turned into a noisy motor every few minutes.  She had few other options.  Batman wasn't the only one who could help.  She discreetly went to her cell phone, turning it to its untraceable mode.  She couldn't contact too many people in the superhero community like this, but there were a few, and she was desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just send the damn S.O.S., Selina,</i> she thought, <i>The longer you wait, the more likely you'll wind up a fat cow for the rest of your life.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly jolted up and down as the driver hit a pothole, to punctuate the point.</span></div></div>",

Hope you're hungry!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I sure am,\"</i> Selina replied, licking her chunky lips, her tone sounding a bit dazed, as her mind was far too focused on the food to come and eating it than what exactly had been happening to her body. Twenty minutes later, Ivy was at the table, having a hearty breakfast of her own, but mostly just watching Selina plow through the meals she had made just for her. Syrup coated Selina's mouth, bits of bacon were in her hair, and there was a ring of hot chocolate around her lips as she gorged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, Ivy watched the changes taking place, noting just how fast the visible increase was. It must have been to Selina's constant exposure to Ivy's new ability, because now Selina's big pot belly was a gut, one that was forming into rolls as Selina continued to eat. A ripping sound was heard, and Ivy smirked at the sight of Selina's thighs completely squashed together, and the sight of both of Selina's butt cheeks overtaking the bottom of her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud creaking sound until Selina suddenly found herself on the floor. Despite her undignified position on the floor, she managed to grab her plate just before she collapsed, and continued to eat away, as a second and then third chin flubbed into life under her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Selina stopped eating, a drowsy look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm...gonna...take a nap...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy merely nodded, bending over a bit and touching Selina's truly enormous gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy squealed and squeezed as much as she could of Selina's plump body, prompting a few groans of discomfort, but nothing else, from the drowsy thief.

But when she tried, it felt like a huge weight was keeping her down. After a few more attempts, Selina finally got herself into a sitting position. Slowly, she swung her legs off the bed, and shakily stood. Now, she finally had a chance to look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was quite surprised at just how big she had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina's breasts were now twice the size of her head, a canyon of cleavage in front of her. Her arms were thick and flabby, and would never fit in any sleeves. Her thighs were so thick they were permanently touching. Her hips were almost as wide as a doorframe, and her butt rivaled basketballs in size. Even her face was fatter, with permanently inflated cheeks and three chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none of that compared to her boudler of a gut. It was huge, almost the size of a beach-ball, and made up of rolls. The slightest movement made Selina's belly jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime in the past week, Selina had finally burst her original costume, and Ivy had been \"oh so kind\" to lend her a leotard. Thankfully, it was made of a stretchy material, but had a plunging neckline, and the backside was practically a thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap\" Selina said to herself. Even her voice had gotten huskier. \"When did I... get so big?\" Just then, Ivy walked into the room. She had put on few more pounds, but was nowhere near Selina's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Selina~\" Ivy said. \"Breakfast is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Selina's gut let out a huge growl. Ivy stiffled a giggle at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sounds like someone's a bit hungry.\" Ivy said, somewhat teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina just looked at Ivy for a second before slowly (very slowly) waddling out of the room. Ivy hung back, watching Selina's bloated backside jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was in a good mood. A week of using her pheromones had permanently altered Selina's appetite. Now the formerly thin thief was always hungry, and even if she became full, it'd only be a few mintues before she was hungry again.

At first, everything she had done was just to test out her new power, to use Selina as a test subject, then go out and wreck havok on the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut overtime, Ivy found herself becoming more and more focused on making Selina fatter. The sight of Selina gorging herself, watching her grow flabbier by the day, actually became euphoric to Ivy. Eventually she realized something: Selina's fat had become her addiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days were mostly spent purchasing or stealing more food for Selina to eat, and then just watching her devour everything. When Selina wasn't eating (which was incredibly rare now), Ivy simply watched as Selina went about what little business she could in Ivy's little home, enjoying every little bounce and jiggle from Selina's bloated body, anticipating just how many pounds Selina would gain next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nights were filled with dreams of growth, watching as Selina's body expanded in every direction, almost as if putting on a show just for Ivy. And lately, unlike most dreams, Ivy could remember each and every detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this new love came with a price. Everything Ivy had previously enjoyed suddenly felt empty and pointless to her. She no longer had any desire to reclaim Earth for Mother Nature, any experiments with plants she had going became dull, even Harley just became white noise to her. Ivy's life, practically her existance now, was dedicated to making Selina as fat as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was fully aware of all this, and didn't care anymore. To her, Selina's immensity was her everything. Ivy didn't even dare touch a single part of Selina, believing that doing so would somehow ruin everything. To her, Selina was practically a goddess now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reentering the kitchen, Ivy sighed happily. It was time for her new favorite activity: watch Selina eat.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\nIt was an hour later, and Selina had finally finished the breakfast Ivy made for her. Bagels, cereal, donuts, toast, and more found its way into Selina's bottomless stomach. Ivy, meanwhile, idly munched on some french bread while enjoying the sight of Selina pigging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina swallowed the last of the pancakes, and leaned back in the reinforced chair Ivy had somehow managed to get. She groaned as she rubbed the gargantuan orb that was her gut, almost making Ivy squeel in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I've let... myself go.\" Selina said, tired from her binging. \"I wonder how... big I am now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy suddenly shot up from her seat. \"I'llgetthescale!\" She said quickly, before racing off to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina slowy lifted herself out of her chair, the poor piece of furnature creaking as it no longer had to support so much weight. Once she was fully standing, it took a couple of seconds for her body to stop jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy quickly returned with an industrial strength electronic scale, and set it on the floor in front of Selina. Carefully, the immense cat burgler stepped on the scale, and Ivy kneeled to watch the numbers, almost drooling in anticipation. Finally, the numbers stopped at...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catwoman's leather suit creaked as the bloated burglar tried to get comfortable on Ivy's couch. Selina's overly tight leather suit usually drew attention to every aspect of her slim, nimble frame, but right now it was only drawing attention to her overstuffed belly. The zipper of Selina's suit was always undone, in order to draw attention to her ample cleavage, but her overeating had pushed it down even further, to the point where her boobs were nearly spilling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How was that?\"</i> Ivy asked, surveying Catwoman with barely concealed delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina gave a groan as she placed her gloved hands on her belly. <i>\"Sooooo good,\"</i> she purred, <i>\"I never knew you were such a good cook, though I suppose it does explain all the weight you've been piling on lately.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile spread across Ivy's lips, and she moved closer to her unknowing victim, sliding onto the couch beside her. <i>\"You're looking a little overfed yourself...\"</i> she poked a finger into Catwoman's firm stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina batted Ivy's arm away, looking a little embarrassed. <i>\"You're  a bad influence,\"</i> she muttered, <i>\"Now, what about this heist you mentioned?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy, of course, realized that there was no heist, but she wasn't prepared to let Catwoman go so soon. Her powers needed more time to take their full effect on the unsuspecting thief. <i>\"Tell you what kitty cat, why don't we just wait until the morning to discuss it, you look a little tired...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman suddenly realized how far her zipper had come down, and struggled to zip herself back up, but her bulging stomach made it hard. As she fiddled with the zipper, she turned to Ivy, <i>\"Hmm... Oh, stay the night? Well...I don't know if I should...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy gently ran her hand down Catwoman's belly once again, and this time, Selina made no attempt to bat her hand away. <i>\"Oh come now Selina, you're tired, you're fed, and I'm offering you a free bed, what could you possibly have to lose?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman eyed Ivy suspiciously, then glanced at her protruding belly and sighed. <i>\"Alright, I'll stay, but I don't want to wake up in a bed of plants!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy chuckled. <i>\"As if I'd do a thing like that,\"</i> she rose from the couch and walked to her bedroom, her plump rear swaying as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman was left on the couch, where she was apparently sleeping tonight. Once Ivy had gone, she unzipped the front of her skin tight suit and let out a moan of pleasure as her heavily bloated stomach was set free. <i>\"Oooooooooh...\"</i> she groaned, <i>\"What a relief!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't eaten this much food in years. Her sizable breasts, coupled with her globe of a belly, gave her the look of a pregnant woman, and Selina was ashamed of how much she had devoured. Her hands traced over her naked belly. She wanted nothing more than to strip off her suit completely, but wandering around Ivy's apartment in the nude didn't seem like the best idea in the world. Besides, she had her suspicions that Ivy was up to something, the plant woman had never been this nice to her before. Perhaps she was planning something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut thoughts of Ivy's plots soon left Selina's mind as she found herself drifting off to sleep, still unzipped, still totally stuffed.</span></div></div>",

Ivy slowly walked towards the sleeping figure on the bed, carefully avoiding any noise so as not to wake her guest. As she peered over Catwoman's body, she saw that the sleeping burglar had already begun to succumb to the effects of her new powers. Catwoman's stomach had grown considerably since her earlier feeding, which could only mean that Selina had started to feel the increasing hunger that would accompany her new condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy smiled at her handiwork, but even more delightful was the fact that Catwoman had been forced to unzip her skin tight leather suit, fully exposing her overstuffed, basketball sized belly and big, perky breasts. Ivy couldn't see Selina zipping herself back up any time soon, not with a stomach that bloated so far out of proportion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh Selina, who's getting a little too big for their britches now, eh?\"</i> Ivy smiled, remembering Catwoman's words earlier in the week, <i>\"This is going to be so much fun.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy took one last look at her half naked victim before returning to her room. She was looking forward to the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun rose in Gotham city, Selina Kyle stirred from her sleep, gave a tired yawn, rubbed her eyes and attempted to sit up, but the task was much harder than normal this morning. Selina, confused as to her inability to get out of bed, rubbed her eyes again and stared down at her body. What she saw caused her to let out a shriek of alarm. Her stomach had shrunk down since last night, but was still looking very bloated, while her breasts were hanging out of her costume. After stuffing her face the previous night, she had forgotten about being almost completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new burst of energy, Selina sat up and jumped out of bed. She couldn't believe how big her belly looked, it should have returned to it's normal shape by now! She grabbed the zipper of her costume and desperately tugged at it, only to find that it wouldn't budge past her belly button. Selina inhaled deeply, holding her breath while she sucked in her belly as far as possible. This allowed her to finally get the zipper up past her belly. Just to be sure, she pulled it all the way up past her boobs, not daring to leave any cleavage on display in case she had another wardrobe malfunction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina breathed out and her stomach bloated back to it's old size, causing her suit to become incredibly tight. This also had the unfortunate side effect of drawing attention to her still bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh dear,\"</i> Selina said, gently touching her bulging middle, <i>\"I look pregnant!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman could not fathom why she had made such a pig of herself the previous night, nor why her stomach had not returned to at least a semi-normal size. Perhaps her body was not used to consuming so much food, or perhaps there was another, more sinister explanation. Ivy was fattening up quite a bit these days, perhaps Selina's new appetite was somehow related to Ivy's recent weight gain? It was too much of a coincidence to ignore.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selina rushed to the breakfast table and pulled up a chair. All thoughts of Ivy being responsible for her current condition had disappeared from her mind when the delicious scent of breakfast filled the air. She quickly sat down and began to tear into the feast that Ivy had prepared. Ivy watched from a distance, a smile spreading across her deadly lips as Selina began to gorge herself once again. Deciding not to let her guest have all the fun, Ivy also pulled up a chair and tucked into the breakfast feast she had prepared. Catwoman was loading up her plate with bacon and sausage, while stuffing a pancake into her open mouth. She looked up at Ivy, who was piling her plate high with all manner of treats. <i>\"So...what was I saying before?\"</i> Selina mumbled in  between mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh,\"</i> Ivy smiled, chewing on a strip of bacon, <i>\"You were asking me about that heist I had planned.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I was?\"</i> Catwoman looked confused, but instead of questioning Ivy, she simply crammed another waffle into her mouth. <i>\"Can't it wait until we've had breakfast? I don't know why, but I feel absolutely starving again!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Of course it can,\"</i> Ivy smiled, delighting in the perfect execution of her scheme. Catwoman's appetite didn't slow down for a second as she and Ivy continued to stuff their faces. She grabbed at everything in sight, sometimes racing Ivy to the leftovers. Ivy let the greedy cat burglar have whatever she wanted, smiling all the while. Selina's belly was once again starting to bloat, causing her suit to become so tight she feared it might split. Just as she was about to start on the plate full of omelets, she gave a groan and lent back in her chair. Her leather suit creaked audibly, causing her to moan in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's wrong?\"</i> Ivy asked, <i>\"Don't tell me you're full already, there's still so much left to eat.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's not that,\"</i> Selina groaned.<i> \"It's my suit. It's not exactly suited to four course meals!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, unzip it a little, take a load off,\"</i> Ivy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina looked uncomfortable at this suggestion. She was worried that if she lowered her zip, she might not be able to raise it again, and the last thing she wanted was for her boobs to pop out while she was swinging between the rooftops after breakfast. Regardless however, she didn't have much of a choice. She desperately wanted to eat more of Ivy's tasty treats, but she knew that she was in store for a serious wardrobe malfunction if she didn't loosen her suit up a little. Selina reluctantly pulled down her zipper to just below her breasts, exposing her ample cleavage to a pleased looking Ivy. <i>\"Urghh,\"</i> Selina sighed, before returning to the feast, <i>\"Much better!\"</i> Ivy, meanwhile, was struggling to keep up with her companion's growing appetite. Selina was like a force of nature, unstoppable in her demolishing of every item of food on the table. Ivy was pretty stuffed herself, but she could see Selina's belly growing to an even larger size! Her bloated stomach stood in stark contrast to the rest of her body, which remained slim and toned, at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, about an hour later, everything on the table was gone, leaving Ivy and Catwoman looking extremely full and groaning in delight as they held onto their heavily bloated bellies. Ivy slowed down to allow Selina to finish off what was left, and her guest had done better than she could ever have expected. Selina's suit was now so tight that it looked ready to tear apart, her basketball sized belly pushing forwards, causing the zipper to ride down a little more, almost exposing the entirety of Selina's perky breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can't believe I ate all that,\"</i> Selina was groaning, trying to get comfortable in her chair, <i>\"I've never eaten so much in my life...urghhh...ooooh...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Something wrong?\"</i> Ivy asked, her own belly now so full that it was wedged against the underside of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm so hot...this suit wasn't meant for big meals. It hurts having to wear it!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Then take it off,\"</i> Ivy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And walk around here in the nude with you?\"</i> Catwoman covered her mouth as she let out a loud belch, <i>\"I don't think so...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Alright, but don't say I didn't warn you,\"</i> Ivy cooed. Selina rolled her eyes at Ivy and began to raise herself out of her chair, her suit began to creak even louder, pushed to its limits by the simple act of standing up. Selina was just on the verge of standing up straight, but when she arched her back, the inevitable happened. The zipper on her suit, unable to stand the pressure placed on it by her overstuffed gut, unzipped itself, causing the top half of Selina's leather body suit to burst open. All at once, Selina's breasts and belly jutted out in front of her, bursting free from their confinements, her huge globular belly and big, full boobs were on display, and even Ivy was shocked by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No!\"</i> Selina squealed and tried to zip herself back up, but it was a futile effort. Her belly was so bloated that the zipper couldn't even move. She covered her exposed breasts with her hands and, to make matters worse, let out another loud belch, much to her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow,\"</i> Ivy mumbled, <i>\"You really did get your fill didn't you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to well up in Selina's eyes as she stared down at her enormous gut. <i>\"Oh Ivy, what have I done to myself!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy also made an attempt to stand up, her big belly almost trapping her in her seat. Eventually, she managed to pull free and walked over to Selina, placing a hand on the bloated woman's shoulder. <i>\"There there Selina, why don't I find you something to wear? That big old belly of yours will have shrunk by dinner time, and you'll be back to your old self.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I hope so...\"</i> Catwoman said, trying to calm herself.</span></div></div>",

Only a few days ago, she had been making wisecracks about the plant lady\u2019s recent weight gains, and now it seemed that she, herself, was going down the same food filled path...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Selina remembered something\u2026before dinner; she had been planning to confront Ivy, having suspected her of being responsible for her increase in appetite! How could she have forgotten this? As soon as she had started stuffing her face, all thoughts of Ivy\u2019s potential plotting had been erased from her mind! This was definitely looking suspicious\u2026but was she just looking for someone to blame for her own overindulgence\u2026or was Ivy truly responsible for her growing waistline?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could explore this any further, the chubby red head walked back into the room, carrying a small green leotard and wearing a big smile on her pale, green cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYou\u2026can\u2019t be serious,\u201d</i> Catwoman gawked at the size of the outfit and folded her arms more firmly across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy laughed and held the corset-like leotard up for Selina\u2019s inspection. <i>\u201cDon\u2019t worry; it\u2019s made of a natural fabric which stretches with your body.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy pulled at the fabric to illustrate her point. Selina observed her carefully, it definitely seemed to be a very flexible material, much more than her tight leather suit. But it left little to the imagination. While Selina\u2019s costumes were hardly modest, they at least covered her legs and arms. Ivy\u2019s old outfit was little more than a stretchy corset! Unfortunately, Catwoman\u2019s alternative was to either walk around with her hands permanently clasped over her boobs or spend the day as a nudist. Neither option appealed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI think it\u2019ll look great on you,\u201d</i> Ivy added enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other choice, Selina nodded. <i>\u201cOkay, just set it down here,\u201d</i> she gestured to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy placed the green leotard down on the seat and looked across at her guest eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cErm\u2026a little privacy?\u201d</i> Selina said, trying to keep the impatience out of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh\u2026of course,\u201d</i> Ivy smiled. <i>\u201cI\u2019ll be in my room if you need me.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman breathed a sigh of relief as she was finally left alone. She let her hands drop from her bulging breasts and tugged her suit down over her shoulders. The zipper had already unfastened itself as a result of her bloated stomach, so the suit was relatively easy to remove. Selina now stood naked in Ivy\u2019s sitting room, staring down at the monstrously large belly she had developed during breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked enormous, like a woman in her ninth month of pregnancy. Her stomach was the size of a basket ball, and just as round. Gingerly, she traced her fingers over the expanse of her overstuffed belly and was surprised by just how firm it felt. She pulled her hand away and shook her head in disgust. <i>\u201cHow could I let this happen?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her cat ears fixed to her head, Selina grabbed the green leotard and pulled it on over her thighs. Ivy had been right, it really was flexible! The soft material of the leotard allowed it to stretch over Selina\u2019s globe of a belly and up past her sizable breasts. With no zipper, the outfit was easy to get on, and seemed to fit her body quite nicely, the fabric hugged every inch of her curvy form, while leaving her long slender legs on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHmm\u2026nice fit.,\u201d</i> Selina observed, rubbing a hand over her expanded belly in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the most modest outfit in the world, and it drew more attention to Selina\u2019s bloated state than she would have liked, but she was grateful to have something to wear until her stomach shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on queue, Ivy sauntered out of her room and walked back in. <i>\u201cPurrrrfect,\u201d</i> she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina frowned, not sure whether Ivy was mocking her or not.<i> \u201cYeah\u2026thanks for the loan, Pam.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI\u2019ll get this cleaned for you,\u201d</i> Ivy said, picking Catwoman\u2019s discarded outfit up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh, that\u2019s not necessary\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNonsense,\u201d</i> Ivy said, placing a hand on Selina\u2019s burgeoning belly. <i>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble. You just relax.\u201d </i>And with that, Ivy turned away, taking Catwoman\u2019s costume with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina did not like the way she was being treated. Ivy was being helpful, but she couldn't help but feel she was being patronized\u2026did the bulging red head have something else on her mind?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't shake the idea that Ivy was somehow responsible for her ridiculous overeating, and with some time to herself, she decided that a search of the apartment might be in order. She walked forward uneasily, unaccustomed to the weight of her bulging stomach. Gripping her globular belly, Selina crossed the room, heading for a plant-covered desk that seemed to be Ivy's workstation. She noticed vines were crawling along the walls in this corner of the room, and for a moment, she worried that Ivy might somehow be watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now then, let's see what you've been working on lately...\"</i> Selina allowed herself a smile as she pulled open one of the desk drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina produced a handful of papers from the drawer and spread them out across the desk; filtering through them, she saw plans for various heists, attacks on corporations, new kinds of plant food, nothing out of the ordinary. Perhaps she was just going to have to accept that she had made a complete pig of herself? With a tired sigh, Selina slumped into the chair near the desk and placed her hands atop her bloated belly, gently massaging the firm dome that now rested comfortably in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the desk once again, Selina suddenly noticed something sticking out of another drawer. She leaned in and tugged the drawer open, only to find that it was locked. A smile spread across her face. <i>\"Oh Ivy, you didn't think a simple lock could keep me out, did you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her kit in Ivy's hands, Selina was forced to improvise. She spotted one of Ivy's hair pins on the desk, grabbed it and, within a matter of seconds, bent it into the shape of a lockpick. Selina was a master thief, and opening the drawer was no problem at all, and sure enough, in less than a minute, she managed to pick the lock. Selina quickly pulled the unlocked drawer open and examined it's contents; a series of photographs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wonder why she kept these...\"</i> Selina murmured, flicking through the pictures curiously. The photos seemed like ordinary surveillance images, probably taken while Ivy was planning some sort of infiltration scheme, they featured security guards going about their daily routines. But, as Selina continued to flick through the images, they started to become more troubling. Now, she found herself looking at pictures of the security guards eating, growing larger, ripping through their uniforms. By the time she reached the last picture, the guards were lying on the floor, surrounded by empty boxes and fast food wrappers, their uniforms too tight for their swollen bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my God...\"</i> Selina placed the pictures down in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer suspicions were correct. Somehow, Ivy had developed the power to increase another person's appetite. The reason for her overindulgence while staying here was all too clear now, Ivy had been manipulating her, causing her to eat huge quantities. The question however was to what end? And how would she stop it? She had no intention of letting Ivy fatten her up any further. But she had to move carefully. If Ivy knew she was on to her, she might unleash the full fury of her new powers on Selina's body. But then again, if she didn't confront Ivy now, she'd risked being influenced by those powers once more...</span></div></div>",

Catwoman glared furiously at her host, who simply smiled in amusement. Her eyes drifted toward the photographs, which Catwoman was tapping against her thighs angrily. It didn't take Ivy long to deduce what had happened, but the amused grin never left her pale, green face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh dear, it looks like the cat's out of the bag...\"</i> Ivy said coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina advanced towards her, her green eyes sparkling furiously. <i>\"You were behind <b>this</b> all along,\"</i> she said, gesturing to her bloated stomach, <i>\"You've developed some freaky new powers, am I right?

Well, who's getting a little too big for her britches now, Selina?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman's eyes widened in surprise. <i>\"All this over a fat joke? It's hardly my fault you let yourself go!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not just a fat joke, you were also a perfect test subject for my new pheromones,\"</i> Ivy continued, <i>\"Not only do they increase appetite, they also speed up the weight gaining process. And who better to be my guinea pig than perfect, sexy, Selina Kyle?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman was horrified. Ivy had really lost it this time. It was time to bring her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This ends now!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's eyes narrowed as she prepared for a fight. <i>\"You're in my house now, kitty!\"</i> Selina was prepared to strike, she took a step towards Ivy, but the chubby redhead raised her arms above her head in a dramatic gesture. Selina barely had time to comprehend the meaning of this action before she felt something wrapping around her legs. She looked down in surprise, and saw that Ivy's vines were snaking around her chunky ankles, trapping her in place. She struggled to pull herself free, but another two vines descended from the roof and engulfed her arms. Selina tried desperately to free herself from Ivy's plants, but they were too strong. She was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hmm, I should have tried this a long time ago,\"</i> Ivy chuckled, running her hand over Catwoman's bulging stomach as she savored her triumph, <i>\"I didn't expect you to go down so easily, but I suppose you are still a little lethargic from your overindulgence at breakfast.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look Pam, let's be reasonable here,\"</i> Selina pleaded, hoping that she could still reason with her captor, <i>\"Would a heartfelt apology do any good at this point?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my no,\"</i> Ivy replied, circling her victim, her flabby belly jiggling with each step, <i>\"I'm having too much fun to let you go now. I think it's time we started phase two.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman froze in fear, she was almost afraid to ask what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Phase...two?\"</i></span></div></div>",

With a wave of her hand, Ivy directed the thick vines towards the kitchen, using them as extensions of her own body. Selina gazed on as the vines began to seize food from the cupboards and fridge and drag them back towards Ivy, who smiled eagerly in Catwoman's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What are you doing?!\"</i> Selina asked, her voice shaking ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Haven't you guessed?\"</i> Ivy chuckled and waved her arms, directing the vines towards a startled Selina. Revealing what was about to happen, Catwoman clamped her mouth shut, but within seconds, Ivy was on her feet. Selina closed her eyes and tried desperately to keep her mouth closed, but Ivy pinched her nose. Selina couldn't hold out much longer. Unable to breathe, she was forced to exhale, and when she did, she saw only the briefest flicker of Ivy's smirking face before a dozen food-carrying vines began to cram food into her mouth. She had no choice, it was eat or choke, and Selina preferred to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good kitty,\"</i> Ivy said, placing her hands on Selina's burgeoning belly. <i>\"Eat up now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina had no choice, the second she finished one bite, another was crammed into her mouth. The vines were relentless, seizing every morsel of food in the apartment and dragging it towards her face. She wanted to resist, wanted to strike back and knock Ivy onto her fat ass, but it was no use. She was trapped in place, getting more and more bloated and lethargic. Worse still, the food she was being forced to devour was just about the most unhealthy junk she had ever seen; rich chocolate cake, fatty cheeseburgers and fries, milkshakes, cream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ivy...urghhh...stop...\"</i> Selina begged in between mouthfuls, but Ivy did not even respond. Instead, the vines began to work even faster, causing Selina to work even harder to chew and swallow her treats. She could feel her stomach growing even larger, bloating out steadily with every mouthful, stretching the material on the skimpy green leotard Ivy had loaned her. She knew that her leather costume would probably have given up the struggle to contain her belly by this point, so was grateful that she at least had something more comfortable to wear during her colossal force-feeding, leaving her single shred of what was left of her dignity. Suddenly, the flow of food came to an abrupt halt. Selina gasped for air, hoping the ordeal was finally over, but she quickly saw the vines were all working together to carry a large, metal jug towards her. Ivy was smiling, licking her lips as she watched her babies bring the jug closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wh...<b>URP</b>...what is...<b>URP</b>...that?\"</i> Catwoman asked, trying hard not to belch out every word. She felt like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Something to wash your meal down,\"</i> Ivy replied, <i>\"Haven't you worked up a thirst?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina knew what was coming. The vines hoisted the jug into the air at Ivy's command and forced it to her lips. She looked down into the jug and sniffed. It was milk, about three gallons of the stuff! This was going to be rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was circling Selina once again, and she pulled the nimble, yet big bellied cat burglar's mouth open as the vines poured the milk down her throat. Selina had given up trying to struggle, so she concentrated on not choking on the gallons of white liquid flowing into her bulging belly. With each mouthful, she felt her stomach swell to even larger proportions, testing the limits of her now skin-tight leotard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good kitty, drink all your milk,\"</i> Ivy cooed, stroking her prisoner's globular belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the ordeal was over, Selina had been eating for a good half an hour, and had consumed more than most people do in one week. Ivy's powerful pheromones had helped the process along, helping Catwoman go well past the limit of what one person could consume in a single sitting, but despite this, Selina Kyle still felt like she was about to explode. Her massively bloated stomach made her look nine months pregnant and her face was a mess, her smooth, perfect skin smeared with food and dripping milk. She could hardly move under the weight of her overstuffed belly and only the strength of Ivy's vines kept her standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Full?\"</i> Ivy asked, poking a finger into Selina's firm, bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Selina could do was moan in response, letting out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I thought so,\"</i> Ivy chuckled, <i>\"You'd better sleep this off.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Poison Ivy turned and walked from the room as Catwoman fell into a deep slumber, her body still suspended from the ceiling, her full stomach dragging her towards the floor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a few hours before Selina regained consciousness. With a tired groan, she opened up her eyes and saw that Ivy's plants had engulfed the entire apartment, making it look like a small garden. The windows were completely obscured by moss and the floor was covered in a layer of thick grass that had not been there earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vines which had kept her bound now seemed to have released their grip and Catwoman was now lying on the floor. The last thing she remembered was feeling incredibly bloated, belching and falling asleep. Ivy's stuffing session had been so intense that she had been unable to stay awake afterwards. She looked down at her body to assess the damage, and was greeted by the sight of a large, spherical belly. She was almost afraid to touch it, she looked like she was nine months pregnant...with twins! As her hands found her stomach, she felt her fingers sink into a soft layer of flab. She wasn't bloated anymore, her taught, food stuffed stomach had been replaced by a fully grown pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How the hell did this happen so fast?!\"</i> She asked herself as her poked at her doughy middle.<i> \"That bitch is going to pay for this.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly reminded of Ivy, Catwoman sat up, allowing her new pot belly to rest comfortably in her lap. Her thighs looked a little wider than they used to be, but all the weight she had gained seemed to have settled in her stomach. The green leotard that Ivy had loaned her was even tighter than before, and left very little to the imagination. Her sizable breasts were almost overflowing the top of the costume, and Selina couldn't help but notice that they seemed a little larger than before. She struggled to her feet and looked around the room, tip toeing towards the door, which was covered in thick, heavy looking vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mmmmmm...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moaning noise stopped Catwoman in her tracks. She spun around and saw her captor was sleeping on the moss covered couch. Ivy gave another moan of pleasure as she rolled over, exposing her own gut, which looked about twice the size of Catwoman's. Ivy was surrounded with the same fattening foods she had forced Catwoman to consume, and from the looks of it, she had been pigging out since Selina passed out. The plant lady's once slender physique had filled out tremendously, and Selina could see that her clothes were starting to tear apart under the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Got to get out of here before I end up like her...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeping silently to the door, Catwoman attempted to turn the handle, but one of the vines sprang to life and blocked her hand. Obviously, she would need to find another route. Praying that Ivy would not rise from her slumber, Catwoman turned and made her to the mossy window she had originally entered through. She tore at the moss so that the handle was exposed, then carefully slid the window up. It made a loud clang as it opened all the way, and for a moment, Selina was sure that Ivy would awaken, but when she turned around, the chubby rogue was still fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling in satisfaction, Catwoman clambered out of the open window, relishing the fresh night air. Fortunately, it was quite late, so she could at least make her escape under the cover of darkness. She would have preferred to be wearing something that concealed her added poundage, but going back for her leather costume was too risky, and she doubted it would fit over her newfound gut anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout her whip or any of her kit, Catwoman decided it wasn't a good idea to take the rooftops home. Instead, she descended the fire escape and jumped to the floor, her newly acquired flab jiggling precariously as her feet hit the ground. Seeing her stomach shake like that made her feel disgusted. She had to find a way to reverse this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman took the alleys home, keeping to the shadows...</span></div></div>",

She recognized the umbrella marking on their jackets as the the sign of the <b>Penguin</b>, meaning these men were loyal to him. She had been hoping to avoid a conflict like this, but Gotham was a dangerous place at night, and truth be told, she was surprised she hadn't run into one of these gangs sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, well...what do we have here?\"</i> The lead thug smirked, advancing towards where Selina stood hidden in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm not looking for any trouble here boys,\"</i> she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group just laughed at her. <i>\"Ain't that nice?\"</i> One of them shouted over. At any other time, Catwoman was sure she could have taken out these punks easily, but in her current condition, she wasn't so sure. She was already feeling tired and sluggish, and had not yet recovered from eating enough food to fill ten people. But these guys weren't going to take no for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait...is that Catwoman?\"</i> One of the thugs asked. Selina realized she was still wearing her cat ears and goggles atop her head. Combined with her green leotard, she was sure to confuse her attackers. Slowly, she advanced out of the shadows towards the leader of the group, and the buzzing lamppost overhead illuminated her body for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thugs looked gobsmacked. <i>\"That ain't Catwoman!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's really let herself go.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah, she's more like Fatwoman!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thugs burst into deep, rumbling laughter as they pointed and laughed at Selina's pudgy pot belly. She felt a dark rage creep over her, her mouth curling into a snarl as they continued to mock her. Who were they to laugh at her?! She clenched her fists tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Come on guys,\"</i> the leader said, gesturing to Catwoman's spherical stomach. <i>\"This girl's clearly pregnant or something. Is that right good lookin?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I. am. NOT. PREGNANT!\"</i> Catwoman roared, lunging forward in a rage as she slammed her fist into the man's face. She didn't have her claws on, but that punch knocked him out cold. She felt her belly jiggle again as she struck a combat pose, but she wasn't put off. <i>\"Who else wants some?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Some chick with a pot belly is gonna take us out?\"</i> One of the goons laughed. <i>\"Yeah right. Get 'er boys!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more of the thugs ran towards Selina. She quickly leaped towards one of the men, but before she could strike, her belly sent sent him flying back. She allowed herself a small smile, it looked as if her new gut was her secret weapon! The other thug was approaching her from behind, but she sensed his movements and spun around, kneeing him in the groin with as much force as she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Looks like I haven't slowed down as much as I thought,\"</i> she chuckled,<i> \"Either that, or you guys were really cheap hires for Pengy.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's it you bloated bitch, you're goin' down!\"</i> The final thug charged at Catwoman in rage but in one swift motion, she raised her leg and kicked him back with such force that he was sent flying into the wall, where he slumped down, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not bad,\"</i> Catwoman purred, patting her belly in satisfaction as she surveyed the scene.<i> \"And it seems I have a change of outfit after all.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelt beside the nearest thug and removed his tugged at his clothing, removing his jacket, vest, pants and shoes. She left the poor guy his underwear, though she was tempted to take them just to spite him. She set the clothes aside and set to work removing Ivy's old costume. She had to peel herself out of the spandex material, which clung to her expanded belly like glue. She could feel her excess flab jiggling as she wriggled free, and she detested the sensation. Finally, she was able to free herself from the ridiculously tight costume, at which point she tossed it aside and let out a long sigh of relief, standing completely naked in the alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That feels so much better...\"</i> Catwoman purred as she relished the feeling of the cold night air on her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have happily walked home in the nude, but she doubted that would be practical given her current appearance. She examined her exposed body more carefully now, and saw that her changes were not just confined to her belly (which looked even bigger without the spandex suit containing it). Her stomach was a true pot belly, but was much firmer and rounder than she had expected. Her thighs were thicker, her legs had lost some of their muscle tone and her arms had thickened. If she had to guess, Selina would say she had gained about thirty pounds in the last twenty four hours. She ran her hands along her bulging stomach and up under her breasts, which she lifted.<i> \"Looks like you guys got heavier too,\"</i> she said, giving her boobs a playful squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no more time, she scooped up the baggy pants she had stolen and put them on. They were a little tight, but infinitely more comfortably than her previous attire. She pulled the vest top on over her head, and it felt like she was wearing spandex again; the top barely covering the expanse of her protruding belly. Luckily, the loose fitting jacket concealed her weight gain very nicely. The clothes were ill fitting and dirty, but at least her stomach was less noticeable. She removed her cat ears and goggles and stuffed them in the jacket pocket. She didn't want to be recognized again tonight.</span></div></div>",

She had obviously been stuffing herself while Selina was unconscious. <i>\"Morning kitty, nice cat nap?\"</i> Ivy teasingly said, stroking Selina's chubby cheeks as she did, causing her to slightly blush. Still low on strength and energy, she noticed that she was still wrapped up in the vines, still as helpless as she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to protest, but was quickly silenced by the feeding vines stuffing her face once again. She moaned in defeat as she resigned herself to another stuffing session, with Ivy gloating and laughing from the sidelines while she rubbed her own belly and casually munched on snacks. The sight of the stuffed kitty amused her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a good hour or two before eventually Selina was at breaking point, her belly hanging towards the floor, her face covered in food and mess as the vines began to creak in protest at the weight they were holding up. Ivy, not one to stand and listen to her babies plight, immediately reinforced the restraints on Catwoman with the addition of several new vines from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina had once again drifted off into a gluttony induced slumber. Ivy waddled in front of her to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face had welcomed a second chin and had begun the appearance of a third, her neck thickened and her shoulders now a lot more puffy. Her arms were the size of her once powerful thighs, chunky and round. Her perky breasts hadn't been neglected by the fat distribution, but it was her belly where the most weight was going, it cascaded forth in a wave of decadence and gluttony, beginning to develop multiple rolls now that the rigid dome of her stuffing was beginning to be digested. Her ass and thighs had gained too, a proper blubber, but pronouncing itself from behind her and her thighs touching together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy had never felt so turned on by a such a vulgar sight before.</span></div></div>",

Catwoman shuddered at the sight, the one thing she had always feared was losing her trim figure and being unable to continue her fun filled lifestyle. She made an attempt to suck in her stomach as Ivy walked towards her, but she knew that it was a useless effort. <i>\"Selina,\"</i> Ivy asked, <i>\"How did you sleep?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina ignored the question, she wanted to get straight to the point. Turning to the side for emphasis, she displayed her big belly to Ivy and pointed at it. <i>\"I made a complete pig of myself last night, as you well know. But I couldn't seem to control my appetite, and I woke up around midnight and helped myself to another feast.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh dear,\"</i> Ivy said, surveying Selina's girth with a smile, <i>\"You seem to have overdone it a little, haven't you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And lately, so have you,\"</i> Selina snapped, prodding a gloved finger into Ivy's own flabby gut, <i>\"Don't you find it odd that the second I visit your apartment I start making a complete pig of myself?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's face betrayed nothing, she looked completely innocent. <i>\"Perhaps I'm just a bad influence...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That much is obvious,\"</i> Selina said, patting her firm belly, <i>\"But what if our new appetites are related? What if there is something more going on here? I can think of plenty of people who would want us out of the way, and getting us flabby and out of shape is a good start!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy's hands caressed her bulging gut. <i>\"I suppose you're right, I have been gaining weight recently, and I'm not sure why. I was always in perfect shape before. My new form isn't exactly as seductive as my old one!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You've got that right,\"</i> said Selina, <i>\"Look, it might be nothing, but for the moment I'm going to spend some time away from you. It could be my proximity to you that triggered this hunger.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I understand,\"</i> Ivy sighed, <i>\"I suppose our heist can wait until another time. Let me know how you're feeling soon, in case you're right about someone manipulating us.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina nodded and walked over to the window, although the constricting material of her suit, combined with her bulging stomach, turned it into more a waddle. She moved out onto the balcony of the apartment, drew her whip, and swung to the next rooftop. This task had never been so difficult! As she swung through the air, Catwoman could feel her suit tightening around her entire body, causing her considerable discomfort. When she landed on the next rooftop, she had to take a moment to catch her breath. This journey was going to be harder than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ivy slumped down onto her couch, disappointed that the sexy cat burglar she had planned to fatten up was no longer within her grasp. Nonetheless, Ivy's powers would continue to effect Catwoman over the next few days, and she was confident that Selina would come back looking for some answers soon enough, but in the meantime, Ivy herself was rather hungry. She had become so focused on fattening up Catwoman that she had barely eaten anything herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her soft butt from the couch, Ivy went to the kitchen and began to prepare a feast. Her stomach rumbled noisily, and in response, she placed a hand on her fat gut. <i>\"There there, I'll feed you soon enough...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy had to admit, upon gaining weight, she had been mortified, but as time went on, she actually started to enjoy her new form. Her breasts had grown considerably, while she enjoyed the feeling of a big, round belly. Her outfit meant that little of her new body was left to the imagination. With her pot belly always on display, jiggling back and forth with every step. She had to wonder what would happen if she tried her new powers on herself...</span></div></div>",

As she breathed in her own power, she became a little light headed and stumbled forward, grabbing onto the kitchen table to steady herself. She stayed there for a moment until the dizzy feeling wore off, then waddled back to the couch. She was feeling no extreme hunger, and was barely feeling hungry at all, which could only mean that her powers had failed to effect her. <i>\"Oh well,\"</i> Ivy sighed in disappointment, <i>\"I expected as much.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ivy felt a strange sensation coming from her gut. She placed a hand on her flabby belly and looked down at it curiously. This wasn't a rumble of hunger, it was something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy wasn't sure what was happening, but it suddenly became very clear. Her belly was growing larger before her very eyes. The green skinned red head gasped in amazement as her pot belly began to bloat out to a larger size, as though it was filling up with air. Ivy felt her belly, as if to make sure what she was seeing was real. It was confirmed to her when she found her fingers sinking into soft flesh. She was growing fatter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Ivy's butt began to swell with flab, stretching her green underwear to their limits as her widening ass spread across the couch. The plant woman's already ample cleavage began to swell, her breasts inflating, like rising dough, and overflowing her bra. Ivy moaned as her belly continued to expand, she had reached a point where she looked like she was nine month's pregnant with twins, then triplets! Her clothing began to tear apart, her panties bursting into shreds as her huge, plump rear grew. Her red shirt ripped apart completely, allowing her breasts to free themselves from their fabric prison and rest comfortably on the plant woman's gargantuan gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy moaned and groaned her way through her rapid weight gain until she had finally stopped growing, and simply sat there on the couch, completely naked, her fat, green body taking up nearly all of the couch. Ivy looked down upon her new form and smiled in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am a Goddess,\"</i> she moaned, her hands gently massaging her huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy must have gained at least one hundred pounds during her expansion, putting her weight somewhere between two hundred and three hundred. Her face remained largely unchanged, though she was definitely starting to get a double chin. Her stomach was her biggest, most impressive feature, and Ivy couldn't take her eyes off it. She felt more beautiful than ever before, and couldn't wait to show her new body to the world. Her powers had definitely mutated since the last time she had used her pheromones, now she could make people gain weight without even having them eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be oh so sweet...</span></div></div>",

She was going to use all of her energy to cause Harley to fatten up right here and now. She concentrated hard, closing her eyes as Harley stared on in confusion, wondering what the hell was going on. Ivy's pheromones began to fill the air, creating a cloud of spores which hovered around Ivy's enormous body for a few moments before enveloping Harley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What is this stuff?\" Harley asked, swiping at the air with her hands in a desperate attempt to get rid of the spores. \"Red! Are you listening to me? Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy opened her eyes and saw the red mist that had surrounded Harley. There was no escaping it's effects now. Her powers were definitely growing, she had produced more of the weight altering spores that she had ever thought possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley was still swiping at the air, spluttering and coughing as the mist covered her body. Though she could not see it yet, her slender, athletic physique had already begun to change. When the mist finally cleared, leaving a very confused looking Harley, her tight red and black outfit was looking even tighter than usual. \"What was that icky stuff?!\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll find out soon enough Harl...\" Ivy chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy looked on in amusement as Harley began to fidget uncomfortably. She seemed to notice that her clothes were becoming much tighter than usual, and started tugging at her leather pants. \"Startin' to feel a little weird here...\" She mumbled as the spores went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Ivy asked, barely managing to keep the amusement out of her voice. \"What ever is the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My costume feels...ugh...really tight...\" Harley grunted as her top began to stretch, making it difficult for her to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Harley looked down at her body and was shocked to see her usually flat, toned stomach bulging out. A fine layer of flab had developed where her abs once were, and that flab was quickly swelling, turning her stomach into a round, doughy belly. Harley squealed at the sight, the sudden use of her lungs causing her corset-like top to lose a few buttons. She squealed again, and this time her pants popped open, allowing her growing belly to bulge free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear...\" Ivy smiled, enjoying the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red! What have you done to me! I'm chubbing out!\" Harley shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's new belly had rounded out quite nicely, forming a perfectly circular pot belly which drooped over her open pants. Harley grabbed her new love handles in shock and shook her flabby stomach in amazement. Ivy decided to slow the transformation for the moment, pleased with the progress her friend had made so far. She cleared the air of her pheromones and watched Harley's growth slow to a halt. A good thirty pounds had been added to Harl's slender frame, most of it settling in her chubby new belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Ivy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley grabbed a roll of flab from her belly and shook it in Ivy's direction. \"What do I think? You made me fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only a few extra pounds,\" Ivy said dismissively. \"I thought you looked cuter this way. It suits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley seemed surprised by this. She poked at her doughy belly. \"You think so? It is nice and jiggly...\" She giggled as she poked her flab again.</span></div></div>",

Ivy was glad that she chose to unleash her crime spree in a grocery store as she watched Huntress bloat herself up with soda and chips, eating with abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was still the matter of Oracle, Ivy noticed the sound of the woman's shouts over the other two's comm-link. The desperation in the woman's voice made Ivy grin. She knew Oracle wouldn't be able to get through to her team. She would be a sitting duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning a massive vine, Ivy tugged the Huntress close, the woman's toned abs now nothing more than a memory. Whining at the loss of food, the Huntress started to resist, but Ivy gave her a deep kiss on the lips, clouding her mind with her charm pheromones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You want to tell me where Oracle is?\"</i> Ivy whispered, taking out the comm-link and crushing it between her fingers before doing so. No need for Oracle to find out she was coming. Under a trance, the bloated Huntress nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's at the <b>Clock Tower</b> on 58th Street.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy smiled at the Huntress and blasted both her and Canary with her new pheromones for over twenty minutes straight before leaving, spying flab starting to tear through both heroine's costumes. The sight brought a smirk to her lips. It would be amusing to see how fat they both became by the time her abilities wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the clock tower was simplicity itself, but how was she going to get close enough to give Oracle a whiff of her new abilities? Ivy needed to plan her route.</span></div></div>",

Nonetheless she was still able to move, one flabby motion at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo drive herself onward, Ivy imagined just what a fat Oracle would look like. She had never actually seen the woman known as Oracle, only coming into contact with her through a computer screen after being defeated by the other Birds of Prey. She would often give Ivy a lecture about how crime didn't pay. It was nearly as annoying as being defeated by such a menacing team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she heard a female voice and rapid typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No Robin, I can't reach them. Just go look, alright?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy then spotted a grate that offered her a view of the Oracle.

Now her friends were captured or worse, dead, and there was nothing she could do! She would have continued this berating of herself had she not heard her stomach suddenly roaring. <i>\"It has been a while since breakfast,\"</i> she thought to herself as she wheeled herself towards the mini-fridge not too far from her computer, pulling out a box of donuts and three soda cans. Looking at the food, she grabbed a sub out as well, feeling hungrier than usual. The first bite set off a tempest within the Oracle, only able to be calmed by more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate and ate, not caring at all as sauce, soda, and crumbs littered her white shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, all she cared about was eating more and more food!</span></div></div>",

That was until the <b>Riddler</b> struck. With the assistance of the crooked professor <b>Hugo Strange</b>, he was able to create and inject a serum to each member of the group, Catwoman, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn. This serum was capable of expanding the women to ridiculously large proportions over a certain amount of time, passing the point of immobility after twelve hours. As an added twist however, the Riddler decided to create a single vial containing the only known antidote to the weight gain serum, intending to watch the three women complete a series of amusing tasks, competing against one another, with the antidote as the prize. With a series of obstacles prepared across the city, most of which determining the fate, and weight, of the Sirens, this was surely the Riddler's greatest idea yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the dark knight had problems of his own. The <b>League of Assassins</b> had returned to Gotham city, this time however, without their notorious leader. In his place, his daughter, <b>Talia al Ghul</b> led her loyal elite guard on a quest for redemption. However, their main priority was not Batman, but instead, Venom, the same chemical used to enhance the super criminal, Bane. One by one, each member of her elite guard were injected with the chemical, rapidly increasing in size and strength, capable of matching Bane himself in combat. A perfect combination of strength and speed, Talia's elite guard were now a force to be reckoned with, and with an immensely enhanced Talia leading the group of ninjas, it appeared that not even the dark knight was capable of stopping the powerful threat. Would he finally give in and join the League of Assassins once and for all, or would he be yet another victim to the continuously growing list of victims to the elite guard? Perhaps this was a fight that the caped crusader would not be able to overcome alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which story would you like to follow?</span></div></div>",

To be watched over by the mysterious figure of authority made the Riddler feel uncertain, but nonetheless, as true as he continuously claimed, he was far too proud of himself to allow emotions, such as fear and inferiority, bother him in the slightest. It was hard to tell whether this was indeed the truth, or a cover of some kind of ignorance, he was the Riddler after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Indeed professor,\"</i> he replied, tilting his bowler hat to the monitor screen that displayed the still face of professor <b>Hugo Strange</b>, the former warden of Arkham Asylum, who seemed to have contacts that exceeded the government of Gotham city. <i>\"I have hired a few competent allies to inject our three puppets with the serum, and soon our little game shall begin.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Excellent.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo elaborate, the evil professor had created a serum capable of manipulating the weight and mass of an individual, causing the individual to slowly and endlessly increase and expand in fat and size, even surpassing the point of immobility. However, there was a flaw in the production. The serum only seemed to effect females, not males. The serum would be useless to the target of the professor's obsessions, but instead, he provided it to a contact that would have use for such a spectacular formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are your little obstacles prepared?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes,\"</i> the Riddler replied with a disgruntled look on his face, <i>\"Although I would hardly call them little. They were designed to provide our competitors with tasks that may effect the outcome of this entire game.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Do not think yourself above me, mister Nygma, I still have the information you require.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes professor, I apologize.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not often that the Riddler would apologize to someone other than himself, but this was a valuable arrangement. It seemed the Hugo Strange had plans for his three subjects, in reward for preparing these tasks, he had promised the nefarious villain to reveal the identity of his adversary, the dark knight, a proposal that the Riddler could not refuse. That was the reason for his apology, and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Remember mister Nygma,\"</i> the professor continued, <i>\"I wish these women to amuse me. If you fail me, I will make sure that you will never leave the asylum in one piece again. Understand?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes sir.\"</i> And with that, the Riddler resumed his work. All over the city, he had set up rather tasking challenges for his chosen competitors to take part in, each capable of effecting the balance of the game, including weight-specific serums and valuable clues. As an added twist however, the victor of the competition would be determined by whoever could reach and consume the one and only known antidote first, a finish that the Riddler seemed excited about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was truly an example of his genius, a true masterpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the three chosen participants of the bizarre competition would not be so willing to agree.</span></div></div>",

This would have been the perfect night for the infamous cat burglar <b>Catwoman</b> to venture into the streets and collect as many precious jewels and artifacts as possible, but alas, this was not the case. <b>Selina Kyle</b> did not expect to find herself running for her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was six o'clock in the evening, way too early for Selina to be leaping across the rooftops in her leather tight costume, but she had no other choice. A group of armed thugs were after her, and after knocking out a few of them at her apartment, Selina decided to slip into her costume early and start running from these trained assailants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter jumping over countless rooftops, with the mercenaries shortly behind her, she finally realized that enough was enough. High on top a tall block of flats, Catwoman stopped running, and prepared for the inevitable assault. Before her emerged at least ten military trained goons in warped armored outfits, one in particular was wielding a special weapon, capable of firing darts containing some kind of serum. Catwoman did not intend to find out what this serum was capable of, so this was her first target. She swiped the weapon from his hands before viciously scratching his face. The weapon was knocked out of reach for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all her might and strength, she struggled to fend off the overwhelming crooks, they were just too well trained to overcome alone. This did not stop her however. She was able to take out at least seven of them before she was finally knocked to the floor and shot in the arm with one of the darts. Upon the sting of the dart, Selina felt faint, distracted enough to allow the remaining goons to retreat. She felt an awesome gushing sensation course throughout her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she pulled the dart from her arm, the gushing sensation had stopped, but immediately she realized the effects. Climbing back to her feet, she noticed the zip of her costume was slightly tighter than usual. She was then horrified to find a large chunk of fat emerge from her stomach. She squeezed it, realizing that it was all fat. The serum that was injected to her must have done this. She was horrified to discover a small pot belly already appear under her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking at first, she then noticed a small flat monitor screen in one of the unconscious goons' pocket. She picked it up to find a familiar face upon the screen. <i>\"Well, well, looks like the kitty finally wants to play!\"</i> Upon the flat screen was none other than Edward Nygma, the Riddler, with a cheeky grin on his face. <i>\"Congratulations, Selina Kyle, you've been selected to participate in what I like to call the first ever Weight Game. For your initiation, you were injected with an incredible serum capable of manipulating the weight and mass of an individual, or in this case, you. Do not be frightened, all it really does is make you grow and grow, fatter and fatter, bigger and bigger, until you become nothing more than a bulging, gluttonous, jiggling blob of human fat and flesh, that is, of course, unless you finish the game.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgusted by such a concept, Catwoman looked down and noticed that her small pot belly had already grown slightly larger. It seemed that the Riddler wasn't kidding. It seemed that she had no other choice but to continue listening. She was now at the mercy of the Riddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The objective of the game is simple. All you have to do is follow my instructions, and in time, you will reach your goal, and at your goal, you will find the one and only antidote known on the entire planet. Along the way however, I will provide you with clues to your next destination, where you will have to complete a series of amusing tasks and challenges, all with rewards that will effect the outcome of the game. Surely do not think for one second that you will be alone in this game. Between you and two other lucky participants, it will be a race to the finish, with the winner claiming the one and only prize, so make sure that you finish <br>\r\nfirst, or else you may stay like this for the rest of your lives.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was turning out to be a terrible night for Catwoman. There was nothing that disgusted her more than the concept of becoming an obese slob. She was determined to finish first in the race to salvation, but before she could set off, there was still one significant detail left by the Riddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, and one more thing. You were injected with a rapidly progressive serum, so make sure that, within six to twelve hours, you will be rendered completely immobile. So have fun, I know I will!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ready for your first clue? <u>I shall 'C' you at the Docks at '7'</u>.\"</i></span></div></div>",

That part of the riddle had been easy enough to figure out, at least. As she used her whip to swing up onto a Gargoyle on a nearby building, her costume tightened across her chest, and she gave an annoyed growl as she clambered atop the statue. For the first time in her life, her costume felt uncomfortable. Her tight leather outfit usually fit her slender, toned form perfectly, accentuating her amazing figure and womanly curves - but tonight, thanks to the Riddler's trickery, she was starting to outgrow it. Looking down at her stomach, she was reminded of the slight bulge her stomach now possessed. The added pressure caused by how her bloated belly had caused her zipper to ride down slightly, exposing much more of her cleavage than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Jesus...I'm almost spilling out of this thing,\"</i> Catwoman muttered, pulling the zip up a little further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued on her journey, moving gracefully across the Gotham skyline until she began to smell the salty, fish scented air of the Docks; one of Gotham's sleaziest locations. She jumped over a chain-mail fence and landed silently on the other side, causing her zipper to descend even further than before. She quickly pulled up it again, ignoring the bloated feeling in the pit of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now, what did he say... I shall 'C' you at the Docks at '7',\"</i> she repeated the riddle and scanned the area for clues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Batman was here, he would no doubt have solved the riddle already, but this wasn't exactly Selina's area of expertise. Suddenly, the monitor began to bleep. She hurriedly pulled it out and saw an 'INCOMING MESSAGE' alter flashing. She depressed a green button and the Riddler's sneering visage filled the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So, you've solved the first part of my riddle, but then, any brainless monkey would have made it this far!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Shut it Riddler,\"</i> Catwoman growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So, you haven't solved the riddle yet then?\"</i> He asked, chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman looked around again, repeating the riddle over and over in her head...but what was the answer!?</span></div></div>",

No matter where she looked, she could not come close to solving the riddle. And to make matters worse, as she stood there, she suddenly felt a heavy thrust in her bulging stomach. Her zipper was now already on the verge of breaking under the tremendous bulge. Disgusted by the alarming weight shifted to her stomach, causing her back to ache slightly, she took one last glance around the area, until she turned around and, upon a relieving sight, she let out a loud groan, releasing her frustration with her own stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she had looked behind her all along, she would have noticed a building with the text \"C7\" high above the garage door. She was looking for Warehouse C7 all along. Kicked herself behind the leg, she quickly made a move on, desperate to reach the warehouse before anyone else. Instead of crawling under the garage door however, she decided to climb up and through a hidden window, just in case she was walking into a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs predicted, as soon as she entered the building, she quickly hid behind a large crate upon hearing a group of thugs, obviously hired to do the Riddler's dirty work, bickering amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Did you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Catwoman's here right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, considering what the boss did to her, it's not like we're gonna miss her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh ooh I got one!

Normally, she would have no problem, but with the growing problem under her costume, she knew that it was going to be rather difficult. Suddenly, she felt a vibrating sensation. She pulled out monitor from earlier, and once again, the Riddler's sinister smile appeared on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well done! So you've finally solved the riddle! And how about that? You were the first of my contestants to do so! But I would hurry if I were you. They could arrive at any minute. Oh, and just to make sure you don't have any thoughts of working together...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed a button, and suddenly the bloated sensation became much more rapid. Her gut had expanded to the brink of destroying the zipper completely, and the skin-tight outfit was about to tear between her thighs and buttocks. Distraught, Selina looked down in horror at what was happening to her, trying her best not to openly curse in case of attracting unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...now you have only two minutes to locate and retrieve the temporary antidote before you become completely immobile. Then, and only then, will I provide you with your next challenge.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You'll pay for this,\"</i> Selina quietly scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"One minute and fifty seconds. Time's running out my little ball of fun!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina tried to put the monitor away, but realizing that there was no longer any room, she had no choice but to leave it behind the crate, preferring to remember where it was after the task was complete. But it was not going to be easy. She could feel her outfit tear at the seams upon every step she made. She had to make a move now, but after glancing at where the thugs were bickering earlier, she realized that they have all separated. Each one was carrying a gun, and each one was on the lookout. She then noticed something in the middle of the warehouse. On top of the largest crate of the building sat a small vial of liquid, with a wooden sight hung above that read \"The Prize\". That must have been the antidote to stop the rapid inflation, at least for now, but it was in the middle of a wide open area. If she reached it now, one of the thugs would clearly spot her and then finish her off. But if she reached it, what then? Would it restore her to her previous size before the Riddler triggered the rapid growth, or would she be stuck with the huge disadvantage of being a ridiculously huge size on only the first challenge? And if so, how could she have any hope of outrunning the competition and completing the rest of the challenges to completely save herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was running out. Catwoman needed to reach the antidote, without being seen, and she needed it now before she got way too big.</span></div></div>",

As hastily and quietly as she could, she crept towards him and used her flabby arms to strangle him to sleep. She gently placed him onto the floor before escaping from the open. One down, four to go, but she had already wasted fifteen precious seconds, and her zipper was practically useless now. She had to make a move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spotted the next thug, not far from the first, making his way to his unconscious partner in crime's location. It wouldn't be long until he spotted his fallen comrade and alerted the others that they were not alone. She had to make sure that did not happen. She tried to creep up to him, but the more she moved, the more she realized that her body was starting to chafe, struggling to be contained within the ridiculously tight leather outfit. Hearing the loud squeaking of her suit, the thug turned around. Selina managed to hide behind cover just in time, but now the thug was suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey guys,\"</i> the thug yelled out, <i>\"On me! I think I got her cornered!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then she realized that she was boxed in, hiding behind a large crate that stood right against the wall, with one thug around the corner on her left and, according to her goggles, the other three goons making their way to her location on the right. The thug was right. She was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Come on you idiots,\"</i> he continued, <i>\"The big fat cat's right here! What's taking you so long!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're on our way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the rush? Didn't you hear the boss in your headset? She's gonna turn into a blob of fat in over a minute. Then she'll be target practice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? Man, she must look pretty smoking hot right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was not lost however. As she quivered at the thought of the thug's fetish, she then spotted a ventilation grill on one of the crates, one that appeared to lead towards the crate in the middle of the room where the antidote sat, just the right size for a regular-sized human to squeeze through. Unfortunately however, at this point, Catwoman was not the size of a regular-sized human. She had just reached the one minute mark, and already she was three times her normal weight, well over the three hundred and fifty pound mark, and she continued to grow even bigger by the second. But what other choice did she have? At this size, she was barely able to stand, let alone take on four armed thugs, and her hips was so wide now that she couldn't even reach her belt to grab her whip. She could barely even breath under the tremendous tightness of her outfit, which continued to tear apart, just mere strings away from total destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thugs were about to make their move. She had to make hers. She wobbled to the wall and ripped off the grill, revealing a narrow squeeze, but a squeeze that could lead her to putting a stop to her alarming expansion. Then again, it could also lead elsewhere, maybe even out of the building altogether, and what then? She already wasted a whole minute taking out only one thug and ending up cornered, how could she possibly reach the antidote in time, especially through such a tight squeeze?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point however, it was a chance that she had to make.</span></div></div>",

Her costume relentless squeaked and screech upon each movement of her enormous body fat, but nonetheless she managed to squeeze her shoulders through next. That was when she heard the thugs behind her screaming and yelling, but to her confusion, not to advance towards her. She to struggled to wiggle herself into the vent, she then heard gunfire, assault rifles blaring in between separate pauses of violent screaming. It sounded like the goons had their hands full with other problems, but at this point, this was the least of her concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could proceed deeper into the vent, she realized that her hips were wedged outside the gap. She could not drag herself any further, and to make matters worse, as she tried to pull herself back out, she realized that she could not. While her entire stomach and torso were trapped inside the vent, her legs and her gigantic posterior were stuck outside. She was stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was completely helpless. Now reaching the five hundred pound mark, her shoulders were completely stuck, preventing her from moving anything above the waist, and with her body still growing, she did not even have the strength to kick her free legs due to the tremendous weight of her ass, which continued to engulf what was left of her shrinking costume. Whatever time she had left to reach the antidote was no longer necessary. She could have had thirty seconds left or even thirty days left, she was not budging from this humiliating position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepressed by falling into such a dire fate, she suddenly realized that the noises in the background had stopped. No more screaming, no more gunfire. She had no idea what had happened since she couldn't look back, but she knew that something had happened to the thugs.

But while the police had much bigger problems to deal with, there was no time for a full scale search, and so, once again, <b>Poison Ivy</b> and <b>Harley Quinn</b> were free to roam the streets of Gotham once more, at least as long as they maintain a low profile, an urge that poor Harley struggled to resist. Sharing a hideout at a defunct botanical garden, the troublesome duo steadily grew impatient with each other, both with conflicting desires for their latest scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Listen red,\"</i> a shrill shriek echoed in the vast botanical landscape, <i>\"The bat hasn't been spotted in Gotham for weeks! I'm telling you, we've gotta make the most of what time we have left to ourselves!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, a slightly deeper, more sensual voice followed the echo. <i>\"Forget it Harl, we're not going anywhere until we're certain that <b>Batman</b> is out of town. Or at least until we figure out a way to stop him in his tracks.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were clearly at a disagreement. While the mischievous clown girl, Harley Quinn, wanted nothing more than to make a scene, reflecting the showmanship of her beloved spouse, the beautiful Eco-terrorist, Poison Ivy, was far more hesitant to attract such attention, she was a brilliant thinker who preferred to stick to the plot. This was, of course, not the first time these two women were down each other's throats, but after what poor Harley had to endure during their previous reign of terror before returning to captivity, she was not too keen to sit around waiting for the time to strike. In her mind, the time to act was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, no I'm not just gonna sit on my butt until you come up with another one of your stupid plans!\"</i> Harley was determined to return to the streets. <i>\"That flying rodent deserves what's coming to him!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, pardon me for breaking you out of Arkham in the first place,\"</i> Ivy suddenly sat up, infuriated by Harley's misbehavior, <i>\"But if you don't want to be a part of this, then you might as well just leave!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fine! I will!\"</i> And with that, Harley stormed out of the garden, throwing a tantrum as she did so. As she made her way out of the garden and into the streets however, she was unaware that she was being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Poison Ivy then struggled to settle down, still furious with her partner's bitter behavior, those same eyes focused on her from a distance. These men appeared to be military soldiers, or at least trained goons in suits of armor, two in particular were wielding special weapons, capable of firing darts containing the same serum referred to by the Riddler earlier, but of course, not even Ivy was aware of their presence. It was all going according to plan. Two squads, one following Ivy and one stalking Harley, both squads with at least one of these serum-filled rifles, with the mission to inject one serum into each of the two women. They did not question, they only served, and with the Riddler whispering into their headsets, they were determined to make sure that they satisfy their superiors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the moment to strike. This was the moment when the <b>Weight Game</b> began.</span></div></div>",

At six o'clock that evening, Ivy attempted to blow off some steam by watering her precious plant. The delectable aroma of the foliage that surrounded her had a way of charming the notorious criminal into a calmer state. There was nothing that she enjoyed more than the company of her so-called beloved pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finally settle with her plants however, she could sense a disturbance through the soil. She then felt a slight tingle on her bare skin. She looked down to see a bright red dot bruising her otherwise perfect skin. She immediately recognized the red dot sight from afar, and in response, unleashed her fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour armed thugs were swept off their feet, their ankles wrapped together by a number of large, strong vines that sprouted from the earth. From the bushes emerged Poison Ivy, who looked at the intruders with pity. <i>\"My my,\"</i> she remarked, <i>\"Looks like a group of trespassers just asking for trouble.\"</i> Before she could do anything with her new prisoners however, one of them still held their weapon, and managed to fire it at Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retaliation, her vines slammed the four mercenaries harshly to the ground, knocking them all out cold, something that Ivy did not want to happen. She was clearly distracted by a stinging pinch in her bicep. She pulled out a tiny dart that stuck to her arm, but not before feeling a gushing sensation course throughout her entire body. The sensation didn't seem to bother her that much however, so without any further distractions, she proceeded to inspect the four hired goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one of the injured goons was still conscious. Ivy decided to interrogate him first. She demanded an explanation before noticing a green painted question mark upon his attire. <i>\"Ugh,\"</i> she sighed in annoyance, she instantly recognized the trademark symbol, <i>\"What as he up to now?\"</i> That was when she found a small flat monitor screen in the goon's pocket. She picked it up, only to find a familiar face staring at her on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, well, aren't you a rebellious little vixen?\"</i> Upon the flat screen was none other than Edward Nygma, the Riddler, with a cheeky grin on his face. <i>\"Congratulations, miss Pamela Isley, you've been selected to participate in what I like to call the first ever Weight Game. For your initiation, you were injected with an incredible serum capable of manipulating the weight and mass of an individual, or in this case, you. Do not be frightened, all it really does is make you grow and grow, fatter and fatter, bigger and bigger, until you become a bulging, gluttonous, jiggling blob of human fat and flesh, that is, of course, unless you finish the game.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgusted by such a concept, Ivy didn't believe him at first, but with that said, she couldn't help but notice a slight bulge develop on her stomach. She did feel strangely bloated, much to her chagrin. It seemed that the Riddler was telling the truth, and if this was the case, she had to find a cure before the serum could take full effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The objective of the game is simple,\"</i> the Riddler continued, <i>\"All you have to do is follow my instructions, and in time, you will reach your goal, and at your goal, you will find the one and only antidote known on the entire planet. Needless to say, there is no other cure, so there's no point in wasting your time in finding another one. That means you, miss Isley. Along the way however, I will provide you with clues to your next destination, where you will have to complete a series of amusing tasks and challenges, all with rewards that will effect the outcome of the game. Surely do not think for one second that you will be alone in this game.

Whether she liked it or not, she had to take part in the race, but before she could make preparations, there was still one significant detail left by the Riddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, and one more thing. You were injected with a rapidly progressive serum, so make sure that, within six to twelve hours, you will be rendered completely immobile.

Unfortunately, the docks were about 3 blocks away from her hideout, so she commanded a vine to take her there as fast as it could. Luckily, she made it there before the other \"contestants\" did. Reaching the gate, she noticed that, in the time it took to get here, she had gained again. The bulge became a full pot belly, and her breasts had grown a few cup sizes. Annoyed, she entered the docks and headed for warehouse C7.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could enter, however, the monitor sputtered to life, and the Riddler's face filled the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Congratulations, my green, chlorophyll vixen. You've worked out the first part of my game. And I am impressed, because you're the first one here. Now the next part can begin. Inside the warehouse is a temporary antidote and your next clue.

The door is locked with an electronic pad, and will only open after you solve a few riddles. You have as many chances as you need. Get at least 5 right, and the door opens.

Oh, and the other contestants will be along at any point, so you'd best hurry.</i>\" Riddler laughed and the screen went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy wanted to just use a vine and smash the door down, but Riddler was watching, and he might speed up the gain if she did. Sighing, she decided to play. Before she got to the door, she heard a ripping sound. Looking down, she saw that the front of her costume had torn, and green belly flesh was spilling out of the rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Damn it, better hurry before I destroy my costume.</i>\" She said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to the door and looked at the pad. It had a screen with a riddle on it, and a keyboard below it. The riddle read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am always on my way, but I never arrive. Many wait for me, but they never see me. What am I?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the growing bloated sensation, Ivy though for a moment, and then came up with an answer. The answer was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In an attempt to blow off some steam, she decided to head to a nearby shopping mall. It was six o'clock in the evening, so the mall was still open, but this did not bother her. She figured that stealing a nice set of clothes could do her good and calm her down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, she picked out a number of fashionable clothes to match her slim trim figure, unaware of the bright red dot that touched her bare skin. As she made her way to the changing booth, a silent shot was fired, with accuracy that could even match Floyd Lawton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ouch!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley felt a stinging pinch on her bicep. She looked down to see a tiny dart stuck in her arm, but before she could pull it out, she suddenly felt a gushing sensation course throughout her entire body. As she pulled the dart out, the sensation didn't seem to bother her much. She simply returned to trying on her chosen clothes, unaware that she was immediately effected by the weight gain serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried on her first outfit, and to her surprise, some areas did not seem to fit her, particularly around and waist. <i>\"Huh, that's funny,\"</i> she thought to herself, <i>\"I'm sure this was my size. Oh well...\"</i> She merely resumed and tried on a dress, but again, it seemed to tight on her. <i>\"What's going on here?\"</i> Convinced that she had picked out the wrong sizes, unhappy with the inaccurate labeling of her clothes, she decided to return into her regular street clothes, but unfortunately, not even her own clothes seemed to fit her right. Confused, she looked down at her body to investigate, and was horrified at the sight of her stomach. Just moments ago, her stomach was flat, but now her stomach had become padded and cushy like a soft pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley started to panic until she remembered the dart on the floor. She picked it up to investigate, and inscribed on the dart was a mere painted question mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when something slid from beneath the changing booth door, in between her feet. She peeked out of the booth to find who was behind it, but there was no one to be seen. She looked down to find what appeared to be a small flat monitor screen, but as she picked it up, suddenly a familiar face appeared on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah, finally, I thought that you'd never figure it out!\"</i> Upon the flat screen was none other than Edward Nygma, the Riddler, with a cheeky grin on his face. <i>\"Congratulations, Dr. Harleen Quinzel, you've been selected to participate in what I like to call the first ever Weight Game.

It seemed that the Riddler was not joking. He had, in fact, injected her with a formula, and now she was doomed to grow into a humongous tub of lard. Needless to say, this caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The objective of the game is simple.

I had to take action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I prepared to turn on the machine, <b>Alfred Pennyworth</b>, my trusted assistant, entered and inquired about my device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's a metamorphosis chamber Alfred,\"</i> I explained, clearly proud of my latest achievement, <i>\"Using similar qualities to the substance produced by our old friend <b>Clayface</b>, this machine is capable of shifting the formation of a human's biological cells, changing their appearance and, therefore, assume the disguise of an entirely different person, male or female, fat or thin, man or child! It can even change someone's voice to match its new form! It is the ultimate shape-changing device!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I see,\"</i> Alfred was clearly unamused. <i>\"Are you sure about this, master Bruce? It seems highly unstable.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't worry Alfred,\"</i> I assured him of the safety precautions if anything went wrong with the chamber. I was totally confident in my latest creation, a machine capable of mimicking the same abilities as <b>Basil Karlo</b>, but little did I realize that such immense power could not be manipulated by a mere machine. I was oblivious to the unstable nature of the device, a mistake that I could not let down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered the chamber and switched it on. I proposed to Alfred that, if I used this machine to disguise myself as another human being, more accurately a high school student, I could investigate the area, undetected, on a regular daily basis, to ensure its safety, and to prevent any possible terrorist attacks. Alfred was reluctant in me doing so. I should have listened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the chamber I felt my entire body change. I wanted to take a form similar to when I was in my later teenage years, regress myself back to the age of a senior high school student, but alas, during the operation, something went horribly wrong. The machine malfunctioned, and my body was altered drastically, more than I anticipated. A loud, deep scream of pain coursed into a high-pitched, piercing shriek. Indeed my voice was changing, but I knew that this was not the only part of my body that was changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver my sound of my shrill, feminine cry for help, I could hear Alfred trying his best to shut down the machine. Eventually he did, but the damage had already been done. The chamber was up in smoke, and the fuse had died out, but this was the least of my worries. Dazed and aching, I crawled out of the chamber, noticing the widened eyes on Alfred's look of astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, I climbed up, only to stumble upon the sight of my new body, tucked inside my old clothes. Horrified by the result of my foolish mistake, I returned to my feet and rushed towards the reflective mirror on the side of the broken chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked wasn't even the word to describe how I felt as I stared at the unusual reflection that looked back at me.</span></div></div>",

I was horrified by the form that my now repulsive body had taken. Very quickly I was starting to run out of breath. Even getting up to my feet became a challenging chore that I couldn't withstand without breaking beads of sweat. In one final attempt, I finally managed to stand up and stay up on my feet. I looked down to inspect my new body, and I was horrified by the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experiment went more horribly wrong than I thought. When I activated the metamorphosis chamber, I intended to change into the form of a younger teenage version of my normal self, taking certain physical attributes from <b>Dick Grayson</b> to avoid being detected as Bruce Wayne. But when the machine malfunctioned, the transformation went out of control, and I was looking down at the horrific result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt my first glance, I noticed two three huge lumps of fat bulging from my torso. The first two lumps I discovered to be considerably flat breasts, while the much larger mountain further below turned out to be my fat stomach, all stretching my old clothes. Petrified, I rushed towards the reflective mirror on the side of the broken chamber. Shocked wasn't even the word to describe how I felt as I stared at the unusual reflection of a hyper-obese fourteen year old girl with long, light brown hair, green eyes and freckles. I saw my bulging stomach squeezed inside my top, so I unbuttoned it, unleashing a sudden rush of fat out in plain sight. I noticed that my chubby face was red, coated with sweat. Even standing up was proving to be difficult in such an unhealthy form. All in all, I was horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I say,\"</i> I suddenly heard Alfred's voice from behind, clearly astonished by what had transpired, <i>\"Is that really you, master Bruce?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was too afraid to answer, all I could do was continue to stare at my reflection, as if I were in a trance, until I suddenly felt Alfred's hand tap my flabby shoulder. I turned to face him, as much as I hated to admit it, with a tear in my eye. I could feel the tear tickling the curve of my chubby cheek as Alfred opened his arms, welcoming me into his arms. With nothing further to say, still in denial about what had just happened to me, I fell into his arms, almost dropping him to the ground, and embraced him, burying my face into his bicep and began crying. This was clearly the hormones effecting my personality. Despite the malfunction, the metamorphosis chamber made an almost perfect alteration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually I managed to regain my composure, since there was very little of my dignity left to maintain. With Alfred's aid and comfort, I inspected the damage. Unfortunately however, Alfred estimated that the machine would not be functional for another three months. Although the transformation was not as I intended, I was still in a suitable form to carry out my plan, as intended, for at least the first quarter of the school year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with this in mind, after appointing <b>Nightwing</b> in charge of the Batcave, Alfred made the arrangements. Unfortunately however, with little time to spare, and little time to get used to my new short, chunky body, I was scheduled to attend my first day as a freshman in Gotham high school the following morning.</span></div></div>",

I couldn't sleep, I was restless in the body of a fat short teenage girl, I just couldn't get comfortable. What was more horrible was that I was unable to survey the dark streets of Gotham city as Batman but instead, as Nightwing filled in for the missing dark knight, I had to stay in bed until the morning, where I will face life as a high school freshman once again, only this time however, as a chubby teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning broke earlier than usual. I was not used to waking up so early in the morning, especially not in such an unhealthy form. Nonetheless, with Alfred's unnecessary help, I got up and got ready for my first day back in school. It felt awkward when Alfred walked in with the school uniform. It was bad enough that I had to attend school in such a horrendous form, but to wear such a tight vest and a loose skirt was truly undignified, even for a playboy billionaire! I felt absolutely ridiculous in the uniform, and I looked equally as shocking. Even Alfred was embarrassed for me! Despite everything however, I had to press on. This was my life from now on and, for the next three months at least, I had no other choice but to get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred dropped me off in the school grounds from the limo. With my backpack around my shoulder, I watched as Alfred drove out of sight, leaving me alone to face the horror of returning as a high school freshman, or at least I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of tall girls, possibly from the eleventh grade, approached me, looming over me with scornful looks upon their faces. In an attempt to intimidate me, one of the girls, apparently named <b>Crystal Horrocks</b>, stood before me, with a sick smile on her lips, and harshly pushed me, slightly knocking me off balance. I tried my best to stand firm, but it was futile. These were evidently the bullies of the school, picking on their seemingly weaker peers, but unfortunately for me, I was currently stuck in the body of a weak overweight girl, completely defenseless against such intimidating girls. Before things could get out of hand however, we were separated when a blonde senior student rushed in between us, chasing the junior students away, at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl turned around and looked down to me. I was relieved to be greeted by the face of <b>Stephanie Brown</b>, a friend of <b>Tim Drake</b> from back when he himself attended high school. I recognized her as the vigilante <b>Spoiler</b>, but in school, she was simply recognized as the bright, popular school girl. With a smile on her face, she made a cheeky remark. <i>\"Hello Bruce, did you lose some weight?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Very funny Stephanie,\"</i> I replied, unimpressed by her attempt at humor, <i>\"But thanks, I didn't think those girls would leave me alone.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah, Crystal's crew can be a bit spiteful at times, but as long as you stay with me, then you'll be alright.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thanks. It's very kind of you to allow me to pose as your little sister for a while.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's right! I guess you are my little sister from now on, right?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Only for three months, but after this, we'll go back to our separate ways again. Okay?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay Bruce...oops, I'm sorry. I mean <b>Britney Brown</b>!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Stephanie led me through the front door, touring me through the school grounds and constantly reminding me of my new name. I had to get used to being called Britney, a name that made me slightly cringe every time I heard it. Unfortunately however, I realized that I also had to get used to being compared to Stephanie by her peers, who treated me like the young girl that I had become. I could have done without the fat remarks, but I should have known how hard life in school would be like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it was time for first period. Stephanie and I had to go our separate ways, at least for a short period of time, as I faced my first class alone, where I would be introduced to the students who I would be studying with for the next three months or so.</span></div></div>",

A few he had known before their fall into insanity; but he knew that none of them were born mad criminals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all victims of tragedy and misfortune that had broke their mental state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that he could have been one of those inmates following the deaths of his parents all those years ago if it hadn\u2019t been for the likes of Alfred and Dr. Tompkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he did what he could to help. He often made donations to the hospital from his personal funds and did his best to make sure that the brightest mind were given jobs in its walls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce\u2019s dream is that one day those he had battled over years would be healed and be able to live the lives they deserved not the ones they were given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce saw the security guards surrounding the massive hole in the library\u2019s wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time you got here!\u201d Aaron Cash head of the Asylum\u2019s security yelled to the cape crusader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many got through?\u201d Batman asked as he looked through the massive hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHard to tell they didn\u2019t sign the guess book.\u201d One of the guard joked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman didn\u2019t laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least a dozen.

She straddled the line between thief and vigilante, robbing from the rich, giving to herself, and sometimes helping out the city when a madman went to far.  But all the good she did for the city never gave her any benefits.  She was trapped in her small apartment, with frequent visits from her parole officer, and it was all thanks to Batman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never really understood his obsession with stopping her.  She didn't kill anyone, and only hurt others in self defense, there where dozens of people doing worse things in the city every night.  Of course, she never really understood her own obsession with him.  He would never team up for a heist with her, and she would never be invited to go patrolling with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip in excitement. Beside her bed, she had just acquired the latest piece of technology from LexCorp science labs, a secret machine that would have been banned from existence if anyone knew it existed.  It was the ultimate weapon, a gun that wouldn't kill her opponent, but transform them to her will.   A machine that had a psychic connection to its user, and could reform the victims DNA, and fabric.  The thought of what she could do with it excited her to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it she could alter the Batman to become her sidekick, and be the love that she deserved.   But she knew its effects on the mind were limited, it would take some time from Gotham's Dark Knight to come around.  She didn't care.  The gun was ready to be tested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on her famous costume, grabbed the gun, put the telepathic chip under her hair, and went out into the city's rooftops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew the streets well.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Batman stumbled backwards, he immediately felt bizarre sensations coursing through his body. He gripped his chest in pain as his bones cracked and shifted and... changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman wasn't doing much better. While she had expected Batman to experience a strange alteration, the jolt of energy zooming in her veins was an unexpected development. She pushed herself away from the Caped Crusader. This wasn't right. If it malfunctioned and something happened to her and Batman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman reached out to stop her but the shifting sensations were too much. He fell to his knees, only able to watch as Catwoman pushed through roof door and fumbled down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief had to lean on the railway, struggling down each step. With every second came a new, unusual feeling. Fat moved around, shifting from the chest to fill out an increasing height. Soft skin and a thin waist altered to muscle and strength. The costume began to tear in places, unprepared for its new occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the strangest feeling of all... was a bizarre new guilt in the pit of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the roof, Batman was struggling with his own changes. His towering height was shrinking, reallocating to fill the same chest area Catwoman lost. Years of bruising and scars vanished and smoothed out. Hands course from training and fighting were now dainty and soft. His muscle hadn't quite vanished, but it was more hidden than usual. His hips and waist, already benefiting from the Wayne genes, found it easy to shift into an hour-glass figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman took several, long, deep breaths. He was almost swimming in the outfit by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth masked figures paused again, gasping in shock as one more change hit their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the changes were complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Batwoman recovered enough to chase down her attacker, Catman had vanished into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh lighter than she would like, Batwoman radioed Alfred. \"I'm coming home, Alfred. Don't ask- I'll explain later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some doing to explain the situation to Alfred. Several childhood stories and code words had to be exchanged before the loyal butler finally let this new woman into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here she was, standing in front of a mirror, looking herself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral thoughts leaped from Batwoman's analytical mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. I'm going to kill Selina.<br>\r\n2. Muscle mass changed, but not vanished. Still have power to win most fights.<br>\r\n3. Temporary suit is going to be necessary. Adjust for shifts in balance. Add some weight to what I've lost.<br>\r\n4. More than one suit, actually. There are some pros to this. One suit to emphasize fear, need to keep striking fear. But... there could be something to using this body to a different advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatwoman did not consider why this thought leaped so quickly to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Bruce Wayne... he's on vacation. A cousin- no, too much attention. An assistant? Possible. Perhaps, there should be more identities for more suits. A wealthy socialite could get into the same places as Bruce and an assistant could get into places he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked with her hair a little. It was a bit short. She was sure it was longer than it was but it could be improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Style it into something more attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while she was at it-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Bruce?\" She turned quickly at the sound of her loyal butler. He was carrying a small pile of women's clothing. \"Leftover from some of your many romances, I imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Alfred.\" Voice. That was going to take some getting used to. Lighter. She'd have to experiment with different tones and inflections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was looking at her strangely. \"You seem to be taking this... better than expected, Master Bruce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its just a little change.\" She ignored his raised eyebrow. \"And its <i>temporary</i>. As soon as we find Selina, I steal back what she stole from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sooner the better, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a non-committal hum, looking through the outfits. \"I'll need some new identities in the mean time. Something that people won't look too closely at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll begin preparation for the fake IDs, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Alfred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatwoman was quick to focus on the work ahead of her. She didn't have time to consider any other changes she might be unaware of.</span></div></div>",

Her behavior. Little experimentation here and there. She had to blend in so people didn't ask questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was so much easier to blend in as this woman than it was as Bruce Wayne. No one had ever seen this woman before. And nine times out of ten, she'd be forgotten by whoever she encountered before long. Depending on the outfit, strangers weren't often looking at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt some stranger pride in that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer main focus, however, was tracking down Catwoman. Wherever that ferocious feline went, she had hidden deep underground. Not a single trace of the thief remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Batwoman turned to predicting the thief's next move. She glanced through local art shows and museums around town. Any event or function that might grab the burglar's interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she thought about it, it seemed risky to leave those precious artifacts where they were. Catwoman was too crafty. She could steal them any time. And Batwoman had no way to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she hit on an idea. A deviously, wickedly, clever idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if she stole the artifacts first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only made sense. Replacing art with identical forgeries. Inside the forgery would be a tracking device. With that precaution, Catwoman would be caught in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plans formed quickly. The prize Harrington Ruby was on display at a local gala. That would be Batwoman's best chance to make the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't explain this to Alfred. He wouldn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, how to go about it... she needed a convincing disguise...</span></div></div>",

And there was nothing more common at such a gathering as a ditzy bimbo of a socialite. With that decided, it came time to plan the heist. <i>No, the plan!</i> Bruce reminded herself. <i>I'm only stealing this to get to Catwoman!</i> That excuse settled Bruce's conscience, but on some deeper level she knew that it was just an excuse, a rationalization she was using when really, the theft itself sounded more exciting than beating up any number of supervillains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of fighting crime, the transformed Dark Knight was instead working on committing one. Perfecting the disguise wasn't too hard, even with the new body. Bruce had the curves for the disguise without needing to artificially enhance them, and the make-up came easy to her as well. She found the perfect blonde wig and dress, and once that was all done, it came time to figure out how to hide the gadgets she'd use to take the ruby. It turned out there was an easy carrying place all along: her new cleavage. Sure enough, she was easily able to fit in the fake ruby, lazer scalpel, and a remote interface for causing a blackout. Now, it just came time to pull off the job.</span></div></div>",

Giggling off and on, laughing at any halfway funny joke she heard, showing off her wonderful curves to anyone willing to take a peak, it was intoxicatingly fun. But the mission was always in Bruce\u2019s mind, so she made sure to wind her way through the party and over to where the ruby was held. There was no sign of her foe, but just the act of remembering what Bruce had seen of it before leaving got her even more excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Selina in a man\u2019s body would be quite the opponent...and quite the lover as well. The thought immediately sounded both wonderful and strange to Bruce, and she shook her pretty head. <i>I can\u2019t far too fall into character,</i> she reminded herself. Of course, not ten minutes later, she found the opportunity: everyone had moved to another room, and the guards had gone with them. Alone now with the diamond, Bruce carefully took out the fake ruby and laser scalpel from her cleavage, cut a hole in the glass, and carefully pulled out the real gem (which she\u2019d researched to find had no internal protection, like laser tripwires), put in the fake one, and his the scalpel and the real ruby in her cleavage once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was time to get back to acting. Letting large tears start running down her face, Bruce ran into the next room and purposefully bumped into a tall, manly guard. \u201cGuards, I saw someone suspicious, and they, they, they took something!\u201d Bruce extended a well-manicured finger to where she\u2019d just come from, and the guard quickly went into the room, calling for back-up. Before another guard could come up to her Bruce pressed on her earring, which was actually the blackout button. The lights went out, but Bruce had memorized the layout and easily found her way out of the party and into the night, smiling gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been...so amazing!! Her heart was pumping so fast, and it had been so easy! All those skills she\u2019d accumulated to fight crime, they could so easily be used to cause it. With the ruby (literally) quite close to her heart, she knew Selina would be after her soon. After all, Catwoman always made a point to steal anything she wanted if it had been nabbed by a less experience criminal, it was part of her vanity. Bruce could understand why, there was a lot for Selina, and now Bruce, to be vain about.</span></div></div>",

Broad shoulders, well developed musculature, and a chin so defined it could cut glass. Just looking at this man, and feeling his hand on her, made Bruce shiver in anticipatory pleasure. \u201cWell, well, well. Look who finally decided to show his face. I thought you weren\u2019t going to put in an appearance.\u201d Still, what he\u2019d said did rile Bruce up a little, so she added, \u201cWhy do you care if I\u2019ve taken a little trinket?

We didn\u2019t just change in our bodies. I\u2019ve been finding myself thinking of crime as beneath me, and you went from Batman to Batthief in no time at all. We\u2019ve taken on each other\u2019s moral stances, as well as other things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce considered that. It was certainly true she\u2019d taken to theft like a cat to canary hunting. It was fun. Exciting. So much more exhilarating than punching thugs. But before this, she\u2019d hated criminals, and now she was one. Now that she was aware these changes were the cause, what was Bruce going to do about it?

Beneath them, an old, previously abandoned warehouse saw new life in it, as large wooden crates were unloaded from a still running truck.<br>\r\n<i>\"Do you think this is the spot?\"</i> Robin asked gleefully.<br>\r\nThe tall dark figure beside him looked through a pair of miniature binoculars, focusing on the guards necks. A green vine was coming out from their shirt collars, and creeping into their ears.<br>\r\n<i>\"It's the right place,\"</i> the figure said, with a respectful amount of intensity in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger dark figure was better known to the world as <b>Batman</b>, the caped crusader of Gotham, his city. With his civilian identity as billionaire playboy <b>Bruce Wayne</b>, he siphoned money from his own company to fund his night-time activities. Ever since Bruce's parents were shot in front of him by a mugger when he was only eight years old, he dedicated his life to freeing the city from other crimes. For a reason that will forever be unknown to the general public, he decided to fight crime while dressed as a bat. Beside him was <b>Robin</b>, the boy wonder. He was dressed in a black, red and yellow suit, but did not have nearly the amount of gadgets or armor that his mentor did. Robin also had a civilian identity as <b>Dick Grayson</b>, the ward of Bruce Wayne. He was more acrobatic than the tall man beside him, an attribute he received by training to be a circus acrobat with his parents before their untimely deaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an unspoken signal, both heroes swooped down from the shadows and got into a quick scuffle with the guards. As the guards fell, they didn't make a sound. <i>\"Strange,\"</i> said Batman, as he examined the unconscious guard on the floor. He plucked the vine from the ear and the guard's eyes suddenly opened wide. Batman covered the man's mouth to stop him from yelling. <i>\"Quiet,\"</i> he whispered as he took the hand off of the guard's mouth.<br>\r\n<i>\"Where am I? What's going on?\"</i> the guard whimpered.<br>\r\n<i>\"It appeared you were under the influence of Gotham's famed femme fatale...\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"...Poison Ivy?\"</i> the guard finished, in both in fear and surprise.<br>\r\n<i>\"Go home, and take your friend with you,\"</i> Batman said as he pointed to the other guard, and with the guards gone, Robin, who was acting as a look-out on top of the truck, did a mid-air somersault and landed on one of the crates. With less distractions, Batman began to become more aware of his surroundings, and let Robin look through the cargo being transported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What do you see?\"</i> Bruce asked after Robin rummaged through the evidence.<br>\r\n<i>\"Packages of seeds, extra strength mineral growing water,\"</i> Robin replied as he held up a container, <i>\"And this.\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Careful Robin,\"</i> said the caped crusader as the biological hazard symbol caught his eye.<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm always careful,\"</i> Robin smirked as he tossed it into the air and caught the canister behind his back.<br>\r\n<i>\"There's probably more clues inside. Find a safe place to hide that, and we'll check out what's inside the warehouse.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin tucked the container into a pocket in his cape, and merged into the shadows as he was taught to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndetected, the two crime fighters made it inside, and hid between the piles of crates until something caught their attention. <i>\"There are giant vines growing between these crates,\"</i> Robin stated. Batman merely gave him a stern look, disappointed that his partner broke silence to point out the obvious. Unfortunately, most of Bruce's expressions looked the same, and no one besides himself could ever tell what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Soon, soon the city of sisters will be at one with nature!\"</i> A familiar voice echoed from deeper within the shadows.<br>\r\n<i>\"Indeed Pamela, indeed,\"</i> said the person at the other end of the conversation. Robin looked through the cracks in the crates. The woman known as <b>Poison Ivy</b> was speaking into a portable computer. More brainwashed guards where unpacking the crates around her. The containers of chemicals were being carefully put on the table housing her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pamela Lillian Isley</b> was an ex-biochemist turned eco-terroritst after a chemical explosion at a lab made her skin a shade of green. She developed an extra-human ability to talk to and control plants, and was known throughout the criminal community to be an expert in the art of seduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now, while she's distracted Robin,\"</i> said Batman quietly before they both leaped into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Pamela Isley, your reign of wretched root growing carnage is about to be plucked!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Batman? What took you so long?\"</i> asked Ivy in a rather suggestive voice. Batman flung himself out of the way, as two vines flew at him. Meanwhile, Robin managed to take down one of the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's happening?\"</i> the guard screamed in surprise as Robin took a vine out of his ear.<br>\r\nThis distracted Ivy, and Robin thought he'd get her attention by jump kicking the other guard in the back.<br>\r\n<i>\"Robin, careful,\"</i> shouted Batman as the guard dropped one of the containers with a bio-hazard sign on it.<br>\r\n<i>\"Relax, I got it,\"</i> said Robin and he dove down and caught the container before it broke on the ground.<br>\r\n<i>\"Is that so?\"</i> smirked Ivy, as a vine whipped the containers off of the table, causing them to break in front of Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA purple gas seemed to come from the broken capsules. <i>\"Robin,\"</i> Batman yelled, <i>\"Hold your breath!\"</i> In response, Robin covered himself with his cape as he tried to roll away. <i>\"No more games Isley!\"</i> Batman grabbed the eco-terrorist by her soft wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's been a while since you held me this way, big boy,\"</i> Ivy replied playfully.</span></div></div>",

I took precautions, and I didn't get exposed to the chemical,\"</i> Dick replied, agitated by his mentor's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sometimes I wonder if you're too young to be doing these things we me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sometimes I wonder if I wouldn't be more successful patrolling on my own.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked at each other, each trying to keep their emotions in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's been a long night, we'll talk more in the morning.\"</i> Dick didn't want to argue. He was tired, and even though he wouldn't admit it to anyone, the close exposure he had to the chemicals creeped him out.  There were rumors that Poison Ivy was experimenting on turning people into plants. He became freaked out at the thought of what could have happened if he had been exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off his uniform, he walked up a staircase and stepped into a passageway leading to Wayne Manor.</span></div></div>",

His eyes felt heavier than usual, and even though the sun was coming right through the window onto his face, all he wanted to do was roll over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a knock on the bedroom door. <i>\"Master Dick, I encourage you to get down to the kitchen soon, your breakfast may get cold.\"</i> It was <b>Alfred Pennyworth</b>, the loyal butler who had raised Bruce Wayne since before he was an orphan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach felt empty, and began to rumble. He threw off his covers and got up. He then stopped instantly as he realized something was very wrong. He looked down at his shirtless torso to see two barely developed breasts jiggle with his movement. With fear, he poked the side of one to see if it was a dream. His finger popped back as he realized how sensitive the new area was. His fingers were slimmer too, and his arms were more slender. All the muscles he had been building seemed to have disappeared. His legs even seemed different. They got wider as they moved towards his hips. He had thick child-bearing hips now! His boxers even looked flatter than usual, and in horror, Dick realized that he couldn't feel the stretch in them that he could most mornings. He slowly lifted the boxers to find that his male anatomy had been completely replaced with parts for the fairer sex. In his bare feet, he hopped to the mirror, trying to adjust to his new proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the girl in the reflection, the first thing he noticed was that his lips were plumper than they used to be. His nose was smaller, his jawline looked less squared, his eyelashes were longer, and his eyebrows even looked skinnier. His hair was still the same length, but it seemed shinier than it usually did. He touched it and noticed it had a softer feel that his hair did before the change. As he touched his face, he noticed that his skin felt softer too. Being trained as a detective, all the information came into his head, as he pieced together what had just happened. Somehow in the night, he had become a girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud higher pitched scream emerged from his throat, as he heard the doorknob to his room frantically turn.<br>\r\nAlfred barged in. <i>\"Is everything alright...miss?\"</i> In surprise, Alfred quickly did a visual examination of the room, and realized that Dick was nowhere to be seen. Alfred looked at the girl, standing in only men's boxers in front of the mirror. She looked like she could have been master Grayson's twin sister. <i>\"Master Dick?\"</i> he asked quietly, shyly trying to avert his eyes from the girl's bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh Alfred,\"</i> Dick sighed as he became overly emotional about the situation and ran into the butler's hands to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's going on?\"</i> Bruce asked as he jogged up the stairs. He was already in his track suit and had done two laps around the estate, but he stopped jogging as he saw a nearly naked girl in his helper's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred looked up at the man he had raised almost single-handedly and said <i>\"We have a situation sir.\"</i></span></div></div>",

Using state of the art computers, and getting some of his most trusted allies to diagnose scans of the blood sample, Bruce had come to one conclusion; that his partner was now female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the results said the same thing; that Dick was in amazing shape for a kid his age, but somehow turned into a young woman overnight. Looking over his shoulder, Bruce watched Dick try and do aerobics on a set of exercise bars he set up in the corner of the cave. Dick had just missed one of the bars because he was still trying to balance the weight in his chest and depend on his upper body strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred walked over and placed a cup of hot chocolate beside Bruce. <i>\"Penny for your thoughts, sir?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It doesn't make sense. I've read the police reports about the toxins found at the crime scene, nothing there matched anything that could have just switched a person's gender. He must have been exposed elsewhere.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sir, might I suggest calling your ex for assistance?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Zatanna? I've already sent her a message. With any luck, she'll be able to get to the city by the end of this week. In the meantime, I want Dick to be kept a close eye on. As far as I can tell, his brain scans still suggests that he has male brain patterns. There is no telling how he will deal to situations in society, or fighting crime.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes sir, I'll keep my eye on him...er, her.\"</i> With that said, Alfred then walked down to the young lady, who had only yesterday been a male. She was trying her balance on the requirement. As Alfred walked up, she was on her twentieth second of doing a one-armed handstand while doing the splits. <i>\"Very impressive Master Dick,\"</i> Alfred said and she pushed herself off the beam and made a perfect landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Tell me you have some good news, Alfred.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good news, as far as all the tests could tell, is that you're perfectly healthy. In fact, despite the metamorphosis, you seem to be incredibly fit for a woman your age.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So it's not going to reverse on it's own?\"</i> she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We'll need to do more tests tomorrow,\"</i> Alfred replied with little emotion in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But you said I'm fine. And just because I don't have a penis doesn't make me any less dangerous in the field!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If you say so, sir.\"</i> Before he walked away, the butler noticed that Dick has been rubbing her shirt throughout her exercises. <i>\"Perhaps this will help,\"</i> he said, handing something over to Dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What is it?\"</i> Dick asked holding the object in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's called a sports bra, sir,\"</i> said Alfred in his trademark deadpan manner.</span></div></div>",

Even though it felt a bit tight, she managed to improve her motion, and did better on the exercise equipment. <i>\"That wasn't so hard,\"</i> Dick said, wiping the sweat from her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Indeed, sir, but you can still expect to skip patrolling the city tonight.\"</i> Dick looked at Alfred, not sure if she found it odd to still be called 'sir' or not. Still, Alfred's mannerisms hadn't seemed to change at all, and there was something about that which she found very comforting. Ever since she woke up, Bruce seemed more distant. <i>\"If you'd like to come upstairs, I'm sure I could whip up something to your liking,\"</i> Alfred offered. Dick then looked at her figure. She knew that females stored fat differently in their systems than men did, but she figured splurging on a treat after exercise wouldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made it to the kitchen, a large dish of chocolate ice cream sat in the middle of the table. <i>\"You shouldn't have,\"</i> she said as she took a large bite. The sudden rush of cold gave her an instant headache and she stopped for a minute. She probably would have stopped eating there, but after a bite, this craving for chocolate emerged, and she started taking much smaller spoon sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt full much sooner too. It was probably because her body was smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you not going to finish your ice cream sir?  There is still half a bowl left.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No thanks Alfred, I'll save it for later,\"</i> she said. She wanted to burp, but looking at Alfred, she felt too self conscious to do it in front of him. <i>\"I think I'm going to retire to my room now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But it's only four in the afternoon,\"</i> Alfred protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, I'm tired and need my beauty sleep,\"</i> she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Very good mam,\"</i> Alfred replied, trying to get in on the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the afternoon, Dick looked at her reflection in the mirror. Making weird faces, doing feminine poses, and a bunch of other things people would hold against her forever if they ever found out she did them. <i>\"It's only temporary,\"</i> Dick whispered to herself, trying to reassure herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs night appeared, she looked out the window. She knew Bruce was out there right now, fighting crime, and trying to catch Poison Ivy, so he could cure her. She had no clue why she was so sleepy. Usually this time at night was when she was most awake. Maybe the body was taking up more energy because of the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a feminine sigh, she laid back on her bed and closed her eyes.</span></div></div>",

She looked down and realized that she fell asleep with her sports bra still on. After a very painful effort to remove it, she moved to the bathroom and filled the tub with hot water, where she let the pain soak away for an hour. She didn't want to leave, she felt comfortable, natural, and safe here, like she was in a womb. Then she remembered that she now possessed a womb. This thought stirred her from her relaxed state, and she got out of the tub. Wrapping a towel around herself, she walked back to her dresser, where she realized that all of her clothes no longer fit her. Throwing on a oversize t-shirt and some briefs, she walked down to the kitchen, where Alfred was making oatmeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good morning, master Dick. Breakfast will be provided shortly.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thanks Alfred,\"</i> she said, trying hard not to make eye contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's the matter sir?

None of my clothes fit me, and I don't feel like myself.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred stayed quiet until the oatmeal was finished. <i>\"Well master Dick, I suppose we could travel to the city and pick up an outfit or two which you would find more comfortable to wear.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you sure that's wise?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You being grouchy and sore on top of being a woman does no one here any good.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, the two entered the secret passage, accessed behind a clock, to enter the Batcave. <i>\"Master Bruce always keeps a few extra disguises in here,\"</i> Alfred said, as he pulled out a giant chest that was hidden under the stairs. The chest opened, and a mirror was on the inside of the lid, along with dozens of wigs, coats, and clothes of all shapes and sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey, there are black spandex pants in here,\"</i> Dick said.<br>\r\n<i>\"As well as a tank top, and a long-haired wig matching your color.\"</i><br>\r\nDick tried on the wig, and it really did look like she had been growing out her hair for months. <i>\"Alfred, look away.\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Yes mam,\"</i> Alfred said as he turned his back to her and covered his own eyes. After a minute, she said, <i>\"Okay, you can look now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred turned towards Dick and saw a girl with long jet black hair, wearing spandex, and a tank top two sizes too large for her, showing more than a liberal amount of cleavage.<br>\r\n<i>\"Sir, your boxers are on the ground,\"</i> Alfred said.<br>\r\n<i>\"They made the spandex look all crunchy,\"</i> she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred knew that new clothes needed to be found soon, the combination of pieces were most unflattering, and if she moved around two much, soon a camel toe would start to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Very good master Dick, shall we head towards the mall?\"</i></span></div></div>",

One of them fired a gun into the air. <i>\"Alright, freeze ladies! Stay still and quiet and no one gets hurt!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred looked over towards Dick to say something, but no one was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is that the girl?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Is it her?\"<br>\r\n\"Close, but no.\"</i> The goons were inspecting at the individual ladies in attendance. Suddenly, they wandered to a girl, no more than five years old.<br>\r\n<i>\"Leave my daughter alone,\"</i> a rich lady screamed.<br>\r\n<i>\"This is the one,\"</i> the guy said, grabbing the little girl's arm and yanking her from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, a girl wearing heavy eye shadow right across her face jumped in and hit the man in the face with a wooden foot stool. The stool broke, and the goon fell to the floor unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"One down, four more to go,\"</i> Dick thought as she jumped between the rows of clothes and into the shoe section. Grabbing two high-heeled shoes, she placed one in each hand, and lashed out at the masked man coming his way. The heels hit the guy's knee caps, and as he fell to the ground, a knee emerged from under the skirt and hit the man in the face. He was out like a light. <i>\"Three more left,\"</i> she thought. She grabbed a perfume bottle which had fallen out of one of the ladies' bags. <i>\"Warning: Do Not Expose to Skin,\"</i> she read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I want her found, no way we're telling the boss that we were defeated by a teenage girl in a frilly dress,\"</i> said the leader as he grabbed the five year old and held a gun to the witnesses as he backed out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick used the stealth skills she had been taught, until she got close enough to smash the bottle at the side of another man's face. <i>\"My eyes,\"</i> he shouted as a rash broke out on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You may look and act like garbage, but at least you smell pretty,\"</i> Dick said as she planted her fist into the guy's face. <i>\"Ow! My bones are more sensitive than before,\"</i> Dick thought as she rubbed her knuckle, trying to soothe the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Gotcha!\"</i> A larger goon grabbed Dick from behind. Dick tried to squirm, but her limbs were shorter, and she couldn't focus her weight towards the ground to slip the thug off balance. <i>\"Ya bitch, I likes it when you squirm,\"</i> he chuckled in a deep voice as his thick meaty hand began to slide into Dick's skirt. This action nearly froze the poor girl, and she thought about what else the guy was going to do to her. Before the horrible thoughts could become a reality however, the goon loosened his grip, as a wooden chair broke against the back of his head. As the goon hit the floor, Dick turned around to see that Alfred had sneaked up on them. She looked at the Butler, almost as to ask permission of what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't look at me miss, there is still one more ruffian that needs stopping.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Right, thank you stranger,\"</i> Dick said as she raced towards the other end of the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Who was that girl?\"</i> some of the shoppers asked each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she exited the store, she found the leader of the team knocked out, as a well dressed woman put the gun in her purse, and picked up the crying five year old.<br>\r\n<i>\"There, there, it's alright, we're going to get you back to your mommy,\"</i> she said, as she walked towards the store. She walked past Dick, giving her a look and a wink. <i>\"While he was focused on you, I got the drop on him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick kept his mouth shut, he knew this woman. She was <b>Selina Kyle</b>, the playful socialite who would occasionally dress in a dominatrix outfit and steal cat-related items. <i>\"Girl's got to have a hobby,\"</i> she continued, <i>\"Oh, and nice moves, but just between us girls, don't go so heavy on the makeup next time, it distracts too much from your other features.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have no idea if that's a compliment or an insult,\"</i> Dick thought to herself as she looked back at the store, seeing Alfred picking up the bags and giving the exit signal to her. She quickly ran into the washroom, dabbed as much of the eye shadow as she could off her face, and squeezed though the window, where she landed in the bushes and made her way towards the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you alright Master Dick?\"</i> Alfred asked as she got in the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, very. That was the most fun I had all day,\"</i> Dick said with a girlish smile. They drove out of the mall, as ten cop cars sped past them to the store they were just at. <i>\"I had no clue women's accessories would be so useful in a fight,\"</i> Dick continued as she took off her wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nor did I,\"</i> the Butler responded as they drove back to Wayne Manor.</span></div></div>",

It was pink, and she never intended for anyone to see her in it, ever, but it was comfortable, and made her feel less exposed at night. Alfred was very hesitant to buy it, and the look on the cashier's face, when he fumbled to explain Dick was his daughter was priceless. She looked at the mirror in her room. She looked sexy. She knew it, and she hated it. She didn't want to be a physically attractive woman, she wanted to be an irresistible man. The stupid chemical that did this didn't seem to effect anyone else, so she thought at least. At least she still thought like a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to earlier that night, when Alfred took her blood, and did a physical examination of her. She was embarrassed, but with any luck the changes had stopped, or were about to reverse themselves. Guys don't just turn into girls, except in bad fan-fiction stories on the Internet. There was probably a way out of this. If nothing else, Bruce's ex, Zatanna, would drop by in the next few days, and could probably use her magic to cure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna was a stage magician, but also knew about real magic, which she sneaked into her act. By saying any sentence backwards, she could make her command a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laying in bed for an hour, Dick couldn't sleep, she thought about how much crime the dark knight was letting go in order to find the cure for her. <i>\"Well, I'm just as dangerous on my own,\"</i> Dick thought to herself, <i>\"I can do this.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with an emotional need to prove herself, she took off her night gown and through on some dark spandex clothes Alfred bought at the mall. She was disappointed that she didn't even look intimidating. She looked more huggable than anything else. Despite this, she put on her wig, threw on her utility belt and tied her cape around her neck. She then found some leather gloves that used to fit her before her last growth spurt. She sneered at the mirror. She looked like she was rebelling against something at least. She sighed and took out a kit full of make-up. It was in Bruce's trunk in the Batcave. She tried some on, and her reflection looked almost unrecognizable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Watch out crime, there's a new girl in town,\"</i> she said as she did martial arts against the air in front of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking past Alfred in the kitchen, she made it to the clock and walked down into the cave, where a miniature motorcycle was waiting for her. With the press of a button, the vehicle started up, and she blasted off through the hidden entrance and onto the road heading into Gotham city. She was on her way to the original chemical accident, which supposedly caused her transformation, when passing an alley, she saw three guys picking on a woman. Without hesitation, the bike stopped and she jumped off of it, ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men averaged over six feet in fight and had clearly been working out recently. Robin was momentarily distracted looking at their massive arm muscles, but quickly snapped herself out of it. <i>\"I am a man,\"</i> she kept mentally repeating to herself. By the time she got close enough to strike, the crooks had already gotten the purse from the woman, and one of them was looking through it, while the others were holding the woman against the wall at knife point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay, here goes nothing,\"</i> Robin thought, ready to leap into action.</span></div></div>",

As the man fell down forward unconsciously, she pushed off of him, and did a back-flip onto the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Who the hell is that?\"</i> one thug asked in shock, <i>\"Looks like another crazy cape!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Silly boys, come and get me,\"</i> Robin taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's mine,\"</i> said the shorter thug as he charged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Silly man, I'm too fast for you,\"</i> Robin said as she jumped off of the wall, <i>\"Besides, you look like you'd prefer someone whose attitude is more concrete,\"</i> she finished as she directed him face first into the alley's brick wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You'll pay for that,\"</i> the other thug said, as he let the woman go and pointed the knife at Robin. Robin let out a smirk, she'd been trained to disarm people in these situations. This would be child's play for her. The two charged at each other as the other woman started running, yelling for the police. Within seconds, the knife was on the ground, and Robin had the man pinned down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And all this for a purse that doesn't even match your personality,\"</i> she sneered as she tied the man's hands and feet together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from the shadows came a slow clap, as a seductive frame swayed into the light. <i>\"Bravo. Perfect form, pretty good puns,\"</i> said the cat burglar known as <b>Catwoman</b>, <i>\"But lose the suit, you can't get anywhere in this city unless you have a theme.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's my first time out on patrol,\"</i> Dick said, defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Really? Because from what I've seen, it looks like you've been doing this for years,\"</i> Selina purred playfully, <i>\"In fact, I'd think you'd even get the bat's little boy a fight to remember.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Robin? From Batman and Robin? Don't tell me you believe in those freaks,\"</i> Dick said, playing ignorant to protect his identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't play the blonde, we both know that he's no urban myth. It's why you're out here right? You're hoping to get his attention.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Am I?\"</i> she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Darling, believe me, he never stops for the good ones. You want the bat's attention, you need to be the bad girl,\"</i> Selina smiled with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please tell me that's not the only reason you do your heists,\"</i> Robin remarked, worried about the stereotype Selina would support if she was only doing this to get a man's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey, it's profitable, too,\"</i> she replied as she revealed a large diamond from her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Where did you get that?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please girl, a lady must have her secrets.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin felt sad. This was the first female she'd talked to in a while, even before the transformation, and she looked as though she was going to blow her off. Catwoman seemed to sense the sadness beneath the make-up and wig, and decided that it might be used for an opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Tell you what, see that purse on the ground? Bring it to me in two hours under the second pier at the harbor, and I'll let you in on a little secret.\"</i> And with that offer, she swayed back into the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is probably Selina's way of inviting me to a girl's night out,\"</i> Robin thought to herself. Was Catwoman setting her up, or was she seeing if Robin would make a good partner? Maybe she just wanted to have some fun, as both cats and girls were known to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin went over to pick up the purse. It belonged to a <b>Mrs. O'Connell</b>. Robin knew her. She was a widower when her husband died in the line of duty. Robin felt a sudden sense of guilt overcome her. She didn't want to steal this purse, but she might also never get a chance to gain Catwoman's trust again. Bruce would probably be back in two hours, and hell would be raised if he found out about Dick's unscheduled activities that night.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't bring herself to take the property from officer O'Connell's widow. With a deep sigh, she felt she let herself down, this was a chance that she knew she'd never get again. But then again, Catwoman of all people would be the first to point out that curiosity could kill the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin threw the purse around her shoulder, and started up be bike. The engine roared, and Robin felt more than a slight sensation between her legs as the vibrations started. She revved the motor three times before she realized that she'd been in the same spot for five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I didn't do this when I left the cave earlier,\"</i> Robin thought to herself as she used the mental discipline techniques she received from her mentor to ride through the city, stopping only at Mrs. O'Connell's place briefly to drop the purse off and pay her respects to the fallen officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets seemed unusually quiet outside the bike as Robin passed through them. A calm before the storm perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way into the area below Wayne Manor, where she quickly put the motorcycle back into it's place and went back upstairs. Bruce was too good a detective to not realize that the motorcycle had been taken out. As Robin sneaked up to her room she thought about a few cover stories to tell Bruce. Still, her mind was only half focused on that. She wiped her make-up off in front of the mirror, embarrassed about her reaction on starting up the motorcycle. It felt so strange to get a new physical experience after training so many years to master her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, she removed the wig and looked at a tomboyish girl in the reflection. This wasn't the body that she had trained with. This was a new weapon, with different feelings, weaknesses, abilities, and social expectations. She wasn't prepared to do her night-time activities with it, but she wondered if it would be worth her time to do all the training again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll be cured by the end of the week,\"</i> she assured herself, and a sadness came over her, an emotional pit that she had not revisited since the night she had lost her parents.</span></div></div>",

She was going to get through this, and not hold herself back. Putting on her recently bought gym shorts and t-shirt, she went back down into the Batcave to train. An old punching bag hung beside the exercise bars. This would do fine to get her anger out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift punch of her left fist, the bag moved. It wasn't as powerful as she thought it would be, and her knuckle already hurt. She jabbed at the bag with her right hand, her breasts jiggling as she did. She had to get used to her new balance and motions if she was going to fight in battle. The punching and kicking continued for a good fifteen minutes before she was worn out, the adrenaline pushing her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't tell me your tired now,\"</i> said a deep masculine voice.<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm not,\"</i> Dick panted.<br>\r\n<i>\"You take a break like this during battle and you'll be useless in the field,\"</i> Batman revealed himself from the shadows. Dick turned around and sucker punched the bag. The bag gave a respectable swing.<br>\r\n<i>\"It's the art of deception. I only look like I'm tired,\"</i> Dick joked.<br>\r\n<i>\"You practice that more now that you're female?\"</i> Batman replied as he walked around the equipment.<br>\r\n<i>\"Aren't you supposed to be finding a cure for me?\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Depends if you want be be cured yet,\"</i> Batman said with a straight face. Dick could only assume he was joking.<br>\r\n<i>\"Like yesterday,\"</i> she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick knew it was usually around this time when Bruce would order her to do a training exercise, or do a surprise attack on her to see how she reacted. But nothing happened. <i>\"Why won't you get near me?\"</i> Dick's mind seemed to scream. She didn't know why, but ever since the transformation, she just wanted Bruce to comfort her and tell her everything was going to be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce looked at the motorcycle resting in the cave. <i>\"Have a fun ride tonight?\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"I just rode it around the estate to let out some steam,\"</i> Robin lied.<br>\r\n<i>\"Dick, I can tell when you're lying.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment, then realized that she had nothing to lose by telling him what happened. <i>\"I went for a short patrol.\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Did you see anything?\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Typical Gotham night. Stopped a purse snatching. Oh, and Selina Kyle says hi!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman just stayed quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Catch Poison Ivy yet?\"</i> she asked, breaking the awkward silence.<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm working on some leads,\"</i> Batman grumbled vaguely, <i>\"You've worked out enough for one night. We should both rest.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked down at her sweaty shirt. Her heart was beating faster than usual. The way Batman gave orders both annoyed her, and wished he'd give her more. <i>\"I guess I do need to take a shower and get some beauty sleep,\"</i> Dick shrugged without thinking.</span></div></div>",

Her eyes felt like refusing to open, and every inch of her felt like she had just suffered through a simultaneous growth spurt. The fabric in her blankets even felt like millions of little fingers touching her. Still, the bed was warm, and feelings of safety in the womb kept her still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after the sun passed over her face that she felt like moving around to follow it. As she finally got up from the bed, the mirror held an unwelcome surprise within its reflection. The girl there was much curvier than Dick had shown herself to be. Her lips plumper, her breasts larger, and her ass rounder. Even her eyelashes seemed noticeably longer. Her hair too must have been an inch longer than it was yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tomboyish image she had tried to adapt to while fighting crime was gone. Here was a voluptuous woman standing stunned by her own charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Alfred!\"</i> she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Alfred and Bruce rushed into her room to see the naked woman who had once been Robin standing there. <i>\"Oh my,\"</i> gasped the butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding her some clothes, the three had a very quiet breakfast before bringing her down into the Batcave. <i>\"Dick, we have something to show you,\"</i> said Bruce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You see, I had planned to wash your crime-fighting outfit, when I saw this in the cape,\"</i> Alfred continued as he placed the Robin outfit on the examination table. With his gloves on, Alfred pulled out a piece of a broken container. <i>\"I trust this looks familiar to you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's the chemical I took from the crates,\"</i> Dick responded.<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, during the scuffle, that chemical was released from its container and was absorbed through your costume,\"</i> Bruce explained. At that point, Dick's face turned red. She had forgotten that she had stuck the chemical container in her hidden pocket. She had at least some of the blame for being in her current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We tried some tests master Dick. Take a look in the microscope and tell us what you see,\"</i> Alfred continued as he put a blood sample under a <b>Wayne Tech</b> industrial strength microscope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I don't know what I'm seeing,\"</i> Dick said with her eye in the microscope.<br>\r\n<i>\"The chemical is altering the structure of the DNA,\"</i> Bruce said with a hint of both sadness and determination in his voice.<br>\r\n<i>\"The Y-Chromosomes are being altered,\"</i> Alfred finished so that Bruce's voice wouldn't choke.<br>\r\n<i>\"Why would that concern me?\"</i> asked Dick.<br>\r\n<i>\"Y-Chromosomes are the part of your genes that make you a man,\"</i> Bruce explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick seemed much calmer than the others expected her to be.<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh. But it ends there, right?\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"I wish it were that simple young master Dick. But the cells themselves are transforming to produce more defined corners.\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"In English, please?\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"The body's cells are becoming more like plant cells,\"</i> Bruce answered, with a bit of anger growing in his voice.<br>\r\n<i>\"So I'm going to turn into a plant?\"</i> Dick asked.<br>\r\n<i>\"We don't know that for sure,\"</i> Aflred replied as he tried to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, there is one other person with a similar cell structure,\"</i> Bruce added in disdain. The other two didn't even need to get an answer, they both knew who he was talking about. Pamela Isley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So her plan was to change the city into a group of people like her?\"</i> Dick asked.<br>\r\n<i>\"As far as I can tell,\"</i> Bruce said.<br>\r\n<i>\"But why?\"</i> she asked, hoping for a more detailed response.<br>\r\n<i>\"It's not the why that concerns me. It's the how and the fact that she has the materials to get this far,\"</i> Bruce said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Forgive me sir, I have not had the pleasure of being as familiar with the lady in question as you were, but didn't Miss Isley prefer the company of men? Surely it wouldn't be in her interest to rid Gotham of them,\"</i> Alfred stated.</span></div></div>",

Dick let out a girlish giggle.<br>\r\n<i>\"If you behave, maybe after lunch, we'll get you some new clothes,\"</i> Bruce commented.<br>\r\n<i>\"But I don't want to behave,\"</i> Dick almost said before stopping herself. The words refused to leave her moist lips, something about them didn't feel right.<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll see you in a bit,\"</i> Bruce said as he shut her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce returned to his subterranean hideaway where Alfred was already dusting the computer monitor. <i>\"Dare I ask?\"</i> Alfred remarked.<br>\r\n<i>\"I had to test a theory.\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Theory sir?\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Since the moment Dick woke up, she seemed off, even for someone in her condition.

Well, I haven't seen you since last week.\" Diana said smugly.<br>\r\n\"If we're not careful, Clark and the others might think that we're in some sort of relationship.\"<br>\r\n\"If only.\" Alfred signed behind them.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Bruce mentioned in a gruff voice.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Alfred, it's good to see you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three started walking towards the house.<br>\r\n\"I got your message and came as soon as I could.\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, while I'm not unfamiliar with Greek myths, I figured your first hand experience with them would be invaluable with this situation.\"<br>\r\nBruce looked up to Diana in this subject because she had a direct relationship to the classical myths. While he and his other team members would call Diana Prince by her civilian name, the rest of the world knew her as Wonder Woman.  She was Ambassador from her island to the world of men.  Her culture breathed the reality of titans, gods, sorceresses and underworlds that most the rest of the world had written off as fiction.  In fact just last week she stopped a rampaging cyclops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I speak with Robin please?\" she asked.  She knew his real name, but using code names so often in the field, in order to protect their everyday identities, made this a habit.<br>\r\n\"Of course. She's right upstairs.\" Bruce answered.  He trusted Diana with his life, she only asked for permission as a formality, showing her respect towards him.<br>\r\nThe three of them walked up the stairs as Alfred knocked on Dick's door.<br>\r\n\"Master Dick, there is a visitor here to see you.\"<br>\r\nAfter ten seconds of silence, Alfred opened the door.</span></div></div>",

It looked like her mouth was forming some sort of natural lipstick.  Even her nails were a darker shade than her skin.  Even with basic training in biology, Dick has little clue why that was.  Her skin was a milky-green, she stayed entranced at her reflection for about a minute before she realized that she had been stroking her hair that whole time.  Her hair was longer too, almost too her elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole skin felt like silk.  There had to be some magic mixed in with this chemical.

The only response he got from the Dark Knight was a grim scowl, and their fisticuffs began in earnest, on a catwalk surrounded by vats of chemicals that had never been properly cleaned by the company, after its shutdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Caped Crusader was faster, stronger, and more skilled than his opponent. The only advantage the Joker had was his unpredictability, but this particular night he was going down far easier than normal. In record time, he was being held aloft by his collar, blood beginning to leak from one corner of his mouth. But Batman was not happy with this development. This had been easy. Too easy. Suddenly, his brilliant mind teased out what was going on, and he growled, \u201c<b>Where is it?</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was the Joker\u2019s turn to frown. \u201cDo you really not remember? It\u2019s the anniversary of the night you knocked the Red Hood into that vat, over there,\u201d he said, pointing to one in particular. \u201cI thought it would be nice to get your attention, bring you here, and maybe die together in an enormous explosion. What can I say, I\u2019m a romantic.\u201d Before Batman could ask another question, the bomb planted on the underside of the catwalk went off, followed by several others placed throughout the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force and proximity were too much even for the Batman, who was knocked unconscious with his opponent, and his body flung into one of the vats, left to stew for hours before waking up. When he did, he knew right away something wasn\u2019t right. His body armor wasn\u2019t fitting correctly, hanging off his body like it was several sizes too large instead of being specifically built to perfectly fit his torso. In the moonlight, Bruce was barely able to see his reflection in the chemical liquids he\u2019d been bathing in, and what he saw made him freeze in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his bat-costume, there was a teenage girl, with long blonde hair and the kind of beautiful face that made sure she would be popular wherever she went. With time, she\u2019d likely become utterly beautiful. It was impossible to tell anything else about her body visually, but from the sensations Bruce was feeling inside his costume, he knew she had a thin figure, and was quite busty. With a scowl that didn\u2019t look right on his pretty face, Bruce climbed out of the remains of the vat and got into the Batmobile. There was no sign of the Joker, and he needed to get home, to find out what to do about this.</span></div></div>",

It was ridiculous, and there was no way he would be able to let any of his enemies know about this...the same could be said of most of his allies as well. Part of the power of the Batman was his strength, his seeming invulnerability, the mystery. If people knew he\u2019d been transformed into some teenage girl, no matter how powerful he still was, there was no way Bruce could ever recover his vigilante identity\u2019s mystique and menace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, he had to admit, a little more difficult to drive the Batmobile, considering it was designed with him in mind, and his limbs were all different lengths now. Still, he didn\u2019t crash it, and soon was pulling the car in through a hidden entrance into the Batcave, where Alfred awaited him. As to be expected, Alfred did no so much as blink as Bruce exited the vehicle, his body entirely different but his body language distinctly \u2018him\u2019. \u201cWell,\u201d Alred said, and Bruce stalked across the cave to his computer. \u201cIt seems your evening was more eventful than either of us would have guessed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring that comment, Bruce took a sample of the remnants of the chemicals that did this to him from the costume and analyzed it. It became clear immediately this was something quite odd: various chemicals never meant to be mixed together, left to stew for years on end. Finding a way to reverse this would take time. Weeks, at the very least. \u201cI\u2019m going to need a cover story,\u201d he said, to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll have to create paperwork for this new body...an illegitimate daughter of Bruce Wayne perhaps? I\u2019ll need to use a robot to play my \u2018father\u2019 when necessary...or perhaps a hologram. As for my crimefighting, I\u2019m sure I can make one of Barbara\u2019s suits fit me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clearing of the throat from behind Bruce made him turn around to look at Alfred. \u201cMaster Bruce, if I may make a suggestion?\u201d Always willing, if not exactly happy, to hear what his butler had to say, Bruce lightly inclined his head. \u201cIf you keep to crimefighting in this new body, it may help some people put together your \u2018daughter\u2019 being the new blonde crimefighter.\u201d That was a good point, Bruce had to admit. But what was the alternative? \u201cContact Dick. Have him be Batman for you, until this is solved.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But he couldn\u2019t do it. Shaking his head, Bruce explained his reasoning. \u201cDick isn\u2019t ready for that yet, it wouldn\u2019t work. Most criminals in Gotham have no clue the original Batgirl is in a wheelchair now, so I can wear an auburn wig, add some contacts, and as far as anyone would know, I\u2019d be her.\u201d Alfred didn\u2019t have a comeback for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he did have more advice. \u201cIf that is what you wish, Master Bruce, then nothing I say will stop you. However, I can see that you\u2019re not ready for any crime fighting for the rest of the night. You need sleep, especially now that your body is once again in its teenage years.\u201d As much as Bruce wanted to object, he knew he couldn\u2019t. Whether it carried over from body to body or not, if he didn\u2019t count being knocked conscious by the explosion, Bruce hadn\u2019t gotten any sleep in 32 hours. Even he had his limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the Batcave for the manor, Bruce looked through what female clothes were available, mostly things for various plans or excuses, and found things that would fit him well enough. They were lacy nightwear, and they were a little tight across his chest, but he could buy more clothes the next day. While undressing from the Batsuit to wear the clothes, Bruce did his best not to think anything of this changed body. Yes, it was female, but he was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in his personal favorite bedroom, Bruce did have to marvel at how soft the bedsheets felt, this skin was clearly more sensitive than his own body\u2019s. Still, it took some time for him to fall asleep. He was planning the next steps: a press conference with a hologram of his \u2018father\u2019 introducing his daughter to Gotham City, forging the paperwork necessary to go to a local high school, buying the necessary new clothes, and to keep up appearances, likely some sort of party here at the manor. Something to give the city more proof of this Wayne daughter. What Bruce didn\u2019t know, as he finally fell asleep, was that he should have taken a shower. The chemical was still on his skin, and in his hair. Still active, it took all night, but it wormed its way into his brain, and began its work there as well, slowly altering Bruce\u2019s personality over the next few days.</span></div></div>",

But for some reason, the fact he smelled terribly bothered him quite a bit, so he quickly ran to the nearest bathroom, disrobed, and took his shower. There were moments, as he washed his new body, where he couldn\u2019t help but admire parts of it. It was clear he was quite the attractive girl now. While this bathing did get the chemicals out of his hair, it was far too late for that to do anything to help his situation.<br>\r\nFrom there, he picked out what to wear, which he found wasn\u2019t as flattering for his curvy body as he would have liked, then set up working on things for the day. It wasn\u2019t hard to get a press conference set up on the area outside the manor, set of noon, nor to prepare the holographic image of his normal body, and create a recorded speech in that voice with everything he\u2019d need to say. Sometimes, Bruce did find himself looking at how he\u2019s once looked, and admiring the widely set shoulders and confidently masculine looks, before shaking his head and getting back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conference went off easily, and now the whole world knew Bruce as Bryce Wayne, legitimized daughter from a youthful fling. Setting up his paperwork to start class at Gotham Academy was child\u2019s play, and that done, he headed out to pick out civilian clothes at a local mall. At first, he had trouble deciding what style fit the new body best: Flirty? Casual? High-class? In the end, Bruce remembered he had his own credit card with him, and just got anything that he thought might work, and had Alfred carry it all home. The only thing left was the party, also announced at the press conference. Looking at what he had available, Bruce saw he could attend in a suit made for women, that would make clear that the Wayne heir still was a person of power and respect, or in a beautiful dress that emphasized his figure, putting more importance on the body\u2019s gender.

Their methods differed, and in some ways so did their ethos, but both wanted similar things, and respected what the other brought to the table. Still, they generally stuck to their own rogues galleries, with a few exceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing city lines was one such exception, and with Lex Luthor hiding out somewhere in Gotham City, while holding Lois Lane hostage, Batman was called in to assist in finding and subduing the brilliant billionaire bastard. Superman\u2019s usual technique of searching via X-Ray Vision was already something Lex had learned to easily avoid, made even more difficult in a city where more than half the building was still full of lead paint. Luckily, Batman\u2019s methods yielded more fruit: through tracing monetary transfers from shell business to shell business, he was able to pinpoint traces of Luthor\u2019s interference, and it all led to a hidden lead-lined chamber in the sewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Batman had a sense of humor, he would have made a joke of Superman, the symbol of everything good and righteous, squeeky clean boy scout, walking around the Gotham City sewer system. Of course, he didn\u2019t, so he didn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t take long for them to find the room in question, and the inside of it was bare...aside from a human-sized metal coffin, set against one wall, with air holes in the sides just large enough to keep whoever was inside it alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Superman sped across the room and started to rip the locked tomb open, but Batman knew a trap when he saw one. Sure enough, as the metal started to rip away, Batman could see the telltale glow of Kryptonite inside, though the exact hue seemed different from normal. Before Superman could be affected, just as he\u2019d finished ripping away the lead-lined lid, Batman ran forward and pushed Superman across the room, only able to do so thanks to the element of surprise. But now the lid was open, and it was clear there was no person inside the casket, only a chunk of mineral, that was bright pink. It\u2019s radiation hit Bruce in a way Kryptonite never had before, and he sunk to the ground as his body began to change. It was turning him from a human being into a Kryptonian, and from a man into a woman. But what kind of woman?</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d been tempted to use the door to smash the strange variety of Kryptonite inside, but what was going on to Batman was more important, and it was possible that whatever was going on with him would require the mineral in the coffin to be solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that neither had to fear further radiation from the pink mineral, Superman turned his attention back on his crime-fighting cohort, only to see the costume did not fit him anymore, and the cowl had been removed. Where had once been a man in the peak of human condition was a woman in much the same state. Tall, muscular, and utterly gorgeous, her silky black hair fell like a cascading curtain down to the end of her neck, and her sharp, almost predatory facial features make her look like a warrior. With the costume\u2019s bagginess, Superman was also able to tell this woman was completely stacked, but decided against using his X-Ray vision to see more details, out of respect for his friend\u2019s privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman was clearly still out of it, so with an apologetic smile Superman told him, \u201cI know you hate being carried, but you\u2019ll have to look grim and bear it.\u201d Batman grunted in annoyance, but made no other protest as Superman lifted his body in a fireman carry and flew the two of them through the sewers, into the Gotham night air, and towards Wayne Manor. The entire time, Superman did his best, as a married man, to ignore how his friend\u2019s suddenly feminine form felt in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the Wayne estate, Superman met with Alfred, who was always happy to see one of his favorite friends of Master Bruce. But when the butler\u2019s eyes fell on the transformed Bruce Wayne, a heavy sigh came from the British man. He wasn\u2019t necessarily surprised, too much had happened since the child he\u2019d been put in charge of began his mission to fight crime for anything to truly faze him, but he was worried. \u201cTake care of him,\u201d Superman asked of Alfred, while setting Bruce on one of the incredibly expensive couches in the manor, in spite of the bits of sewer grime still staining the Batman costume. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to grab what did this to him, so I can find a way to reverse it.\u201d With that, the Man of Steel sped off.</span></div></div>",

When Harley's head was level with his own-- 6'4\" --and her physique closely resembled an amateur middleweight bodybuilder's, her growth stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, surprising side effects of prison abuse,\" Harley commented, looking over her new body.  Then she realized something.  \"Hey, didn't you tell me to shut up a minute ago?\"  Standing in the doorway of her cell, the guard had no time to react as Harley's fist slammed into his face and he went flying backwards, hitting the wall painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley walked over to the unconscious guard and eyed the stun gun lying by his side.  \"I'll take this,\" she said brightly, about to shock herself again.

Is that you?\" one of them asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" she replied, turning towards the guards.  \"Like the new and improved me?\"  Before they could even draw their guns, Harley ran towards them with surprising speed and beat them senseless.  \"Now, where was I?\"  She said afterward, walking past the badly beaten men, before stunning herself in the leg.  Her body responded immediately, her physique soon becoming as large as a Strongman competitor's, while her head brushed the doorway.  Suddenly, an alarm went off and around 20 more guards surrounded her, all with their guns pointed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the younger, nervous ones accidently pulled the trigger and the bullet his Harley in the shoulder.

They were both in the Batcave, putting their suits on, when an alarm went off.  Walking over to the Batcomputer, they saw it was coming from Blackgate prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's trying to escape,\" Cassandra Cain said, pulling on her cowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we teach them the error of their ways?\" Stephanie Brown asked, putting her belt into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each hopped on a motorcycle and drove off towards the prison, weaving in and out of the late evening traffic as they went.  Approaching Blackgate, they saw a huge Hulking figure tossing cars around in the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bane again,\" Batgirl said, stepping off of her bike with a sigh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE ME BACK MY PUDDIN'!!\" Harley screamed in her usual shrill voice, ripping a car in half with her bare hands, before tossing the useless chassis aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley?!\" both girls said in shock, running towards the mayhem.  When they arrived, the now 7 foot tall villain was slamming her fist into the pavement, throwing up chunks of asphalt in the process and causing the ground to shake.  She was clearly distraught at being separated from the Joker for so long.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's the Bat's brats,\" she said, her enormous muscles tensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley, you're...Huge!\" Spoiler said, fear in her voice as she stated the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup and it's all thanks to Mistah J's Titan formula,\" Harley replied happily, turning her hand to look at her nails, causing the huge biceps on her arm to flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joker did this to you?\" Batgirl asked with alarm.  \"We have to help you then, Miss Quinn.  You're a danger to everyone else around you until you're cured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just a danger to anyone who stands between me and my puddin,\" Harley replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you won't come quietly,\" Cassandra said, grabbing a smoke pellet from her belt and throwing it into the behemoth's face.  It exploded and both heroes advanced on her, their blows bouncing off of Harley's rock hard body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared and both women realized their attacks were useless, they backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley chuckled.  \"You know, that kind of tickled.  Is it my turn now?\"  Stunning herself in the leg again, she felt the tingle return and her body grew even larger, stopping only when she was 7'6\" and her muscles swelled to an even greater size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharging at the two heroes, they were able to just barely avoid her massive body in time.  Harley picked up a nearby car and tried to crush Spoiler with it, but she leapt out of the way.  Batgirl jumped onto Harley's back, wrapping her arms around the giant's neck as best she could, but she felt one enormous hand pluck her off easily, holding on to her cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her out at arm's length, Cassandra writhed around, trying to get free, while Harley cocked back her fist.  Releasing her cape, the colossal woman thankfully only hit air, but she recovered almost immediately and tried to stomp Batgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiler leapt toward her target, but the Titan infused Harley was ready for her.  She easily caught the purple-clad hero in midair and slammed her onto the roof of a nearby police van, creating a huge dent and shattering a window.  She was about to deliver the killing blow, when a rope thrown by Batgirl wrapped itself around her wrist.  With a simple tug, Batgirl went flying through the air and ran painfully into the side of the van.  Her head throbbing, Cassandra felt a pair of powerful hands pick her up and place her next to Spoiler.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you Bat-Jerks would just leave us alone,\" Harley said angrily, looking down at her beaten foes.  Tossing the two women into the van, she heard a thud as they hit the door on the other side with a groan before collapsing into the seat.  Harley then proceeded to pick up the van with one hand and launch it into the sky.  She watched as it sailed past the prison, past the trees, until it was\u2026gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's that problem taken care of,\" Harley said.  \"Now, if only I could find Mistah J.\"</span></div></div>",

Good thing Batgirl and Spoiler were both wearing the best body armor Wayne Enterprises could make, otherwise they'd be dead by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heroines painfully got out of the vehicle before it sank, nursing multiple cracked ribs and bruised bodies as they swam to shore.  Collapsing into the dirt, they lied there, trying to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's...not do that...again,\" Spoiler said, sitting up, grabbing her side and realizing there were huge gashes on her arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to be smarter,\" Batgirl groaned.  \"Harley's not that bright, but she's too powerful.

She felt so strong.  So unstoppable.  She was leaping several blocks at once as she made her way through the city, her powerful stomps creating craters and setting off car alarms as she went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit was 9 feet tall and was capable of going toe to toe with Bane, as it had several times in the past.  Batman had augmented it further over the years, giving it more power and defensive capabilities, making it practically unbeatable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl followed Harley's path of destruction until she spotted her far below on the ground.  Unbeknownst to the Hulking supervillain, The Joker had been moved, on Batman's orders, to a safe location somewhere in the city, to make sure The Clown Prince and his girlfriend remained separated.  Apparently Harley had taken this news badly, because she was currently destroying a flower shop in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding with a powerful thud that shook the ground, Batgirl called out to her nemesis, \"Give up now or I'll be forced to hurt you.\"  She hoped Harley resisted.  Batgirl couldn't wait to break in this new suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's the brats again,\" she said brightly, an actual smile on her face.  The villain still stood 7'6\" as she turned around.  \"Where's your little friend?  Watching us from the rooftops?\"  She looked up hopefully, trying to find a caped silhouetted figure somewhere.  \"And...\"  Her face lit up, as if noticing the armored suit for the first time.  She skipped playfully over to Batgirl, the ground quaking with every step.  She gasped in amazement, as if being presented with a brand new car.  \"You brought me a new toy to play with!  How sweet of you!\"  She peered in through the thick bulletproof window on the front, spotting the smaller woman inside.  \"Why don't you want to come out and play, Short Stuff?  Was I a bit too rough on you last time?  I promise to be good.\"  She gave Batgirl the Sad Puppy Dog look, trying to seem as innocent as possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?  Is anyone home in there?\"  Harley tapped on the glass several times, sending a deafening, thunderous rumble throughout the tiny cockpit of the suit.  Batgirl staggered backward, her ears throbbing, as she heard Harley say, \"Ooopsie!  Was that a bit too loud for your tiny eardrums?  I'm sorry.  Guess I just don't know my own strength these days, huh?\"  She giggled innocently at her mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had recovered, Batgirl said, \"This ends one of two ways, Quinn.  Either you come quietly, or we have a rematch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAAAT???\"  Harley's voice became even higher.  She couldn't believe her ears.  \"You want to fight me again??  After I wiped the floor with you last time?  AND you without any backup?\"  Her voice returned to normal.  \"Well, it's your funeral, Shrimp.  And here I thought we were getting along so well.\"  She approached the Armored Suit, hopping around like a prizefighter, playfully jabbing it or giving it light body blows.  She still thought this was a game.  Either she was in a really good mood for some reason, or she was feeling overconfident from her last fight.  Either way, even though she was only \"playing\" with Batgirl, not using even a tenth of her strength, it was enough force to drive the Suit backwards several feet at a time, pounding the cockpit with more ear shattering booms.  Maybe this wasn't such a good idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun yet, Squirt?\"  Harley asked, smiling.  \"You know, this is getting kinda sad,\" she said, continuing to pound away, a dull thud ringing throughout the neighborhood.  \"Here you are, with a good foot or so on me and you're just standing there, taking it!\"  More pounding.  \"It IS kinda fun, though.  I see why all you super jerks do it so much.\"  She giggled as the \"fight\" continued, sending Batgirl farther and farther back, until she suddenly stopped, her body coated in sweat.  \"Hang on, though.  Doesn't that give you an unfair advantage?  Don't you have, like, Bat Grenades and Bat Missles and Bat whatever-the-hell-else under that thing?  Shouldn't I be the same size as you?  You know, so it's a fair fight?\"  Cassandra didn't like where this was heading.  \"I know!  I'll grow myself bigger, then we can continue.  It'll only take a jif!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought the stun gun from before out again and tried to shock herself with it, but Batgirl slapped it away.  \"Now, that wasn't very nice, you know?\"  Harley said.  \"You don't treat your sparring partners like that.  I should teach you a few tips on how to OOF!\"  Batgirl began punching Harley repeatedly, using all the strength the suit had to send the giant villain backward, and there seemed to be JUST enough power to do it.  She finished with a roundhouse kick to Harley's head that sent her flying through the air, crushing an SUV when she landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm through playing games, Quinn,\" Batgirl told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I see,\" the titaness replied, picking herself off the ground.  It didn't look like her punches did much damage, though Cassandra was pleased to see that the other woman was bleeding from the mouth.  \"Next time, give a girl fair warning before you start to pummel her, will ya?\"  Quinn dusted herself off.  \"Just for that, I'm going to kick your ass.\"  She ran towards her target, preparing to rip it limb from limb.  Batgirl did the same.  Both were willing to fight to the death, judging from the look in their eyes, when Harley suddenly stopped a few feet from the suit, her face turning into a playful grin again.  She held out her leg and watched as the Armored Suit tripped over it and went flying through an apartment building on the other side of the street, demolishing it instantly and burying Batgirl in the rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first, I need little pick-me-up.\"  Harley said happily, skipping off towards a fuse box nearby.  \"Hmm...Now, let's see...I grew before from just a stun gun.  But I wonder if any old electricity will do?\"  From behind her, she heard Batgirl emerge from the rubble and turned around.  \"There you are, Shortie!\"  She ripped the wires out of the box, sparks flying everywhere as she held them up in her hands.  \"Hey, do you think this a good idea?!\"</span></div></div>",

And her ears were STILL ringing from the \"fight\" she had with Harley few minutes ago.  To make matters worse, Harley wasn't even trying to hurt her, she was just playing around.

She ran towards Quinn, the suit responding sluggishly at first as she saw the villain plunge the wires into her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah, THAT hit the spot!\"  Harley said, a content look on her face, as the Armored Batsuit made its way over to her.  Already, she was 8 feet tall.  \"Wow you're REALLY tiny now,\" Harley exclaimed, peering her huge into the cockpit, spotting Batgirl, smiling.  \"Are you ready to go again?  Do you think this pitiful suit can take it?  'Cause I took you out with a leg trip earlier.\"  She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Quinn reached out, hugging the Batsuit lovingly, almost as if she were trying to apologize.  Immediately more alarms blared from inside the cockpit, as metal groaned from somewhere behind Batgirl.  As Harley reached 8 and a half feet tall, steam began to pour from the back of the suit and the villain backed off, bits of metal clanging to the ground.  \"Oops, sorry about that, Squirt.  But at least we're almost the same height now.  Ready to continue our little fight?\"  She giggled as she drew back her fist, slamming it into the bulletproof glass with a bit too much force than she had intended.  Immediately, the glass was nearly shattered and Batgirl found herself flying backwards like a bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plowed through half a dozen structures this time, each impact destroying more and more of the suit.  She finally came to rest half a block away from Quinn, the alarms blaring again, her vision a bit blurry as more trickles of blood could be felt.  Lying on her back, the suit barely functional as it rested atop a pile of bricks, Batgirl could see the outline of Harley's huge fist where it had impacted, the metal bent as if it had been made of play dough.  This suit was meant to take on Bane and his Venom, Batgirl thought as she could hear Harley's heavy footfalls coming nearer, the ground shaking.  But Titan was in a league of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's huge head fills Cassandra's field of vision, as the massive woman squats down to inspect the damage, her face inches from the cockpit.  \"Wow.  That was only a love tap I gave you,\" Harley remarked, as sparks flew from the suit.  \"Good thing I didn't hit you as hard as I possibly could, huh?  You'd probably be a thick, gooey paste in this hunka junk.\"  She grabbed one of the suit's arms to put it back on its feet, when her grip accidentally crushed it, almost severing it completely from the rest of the machine.  \"Whoops.\"  Batgirl felt herself being lifted off the ground and when she was upright again, she was looking UP into Quinn's playful face.  She had to be close to 9 and a half feet tall now, her muscles absolutely gigantic, though her body was still proportionate.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley tried to brush some of the debris off of the suit, but just managed to do more damage.  \"Wow, tonights just not your night, is it?  Bet Batman will be pissed when he sees what you did to one of his little doodads.\"  Batgirl groaned in pain, as Harley smiled down at her.  \"You know, you should get out of that thing.  I think it's been through enough for one night.  Here.\"  Her giant hand approaching the bulletproof glass, she easily separated it from the rest of the suit with just a couple of fingers, as if she were opening a can of soda.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go,\" Quinn said sweetly, talking as if she were talking to a frightened animal of some kind.  \"Come on out and enjoy some fresh air.\"  Batgirl hesitated.  \"Oh, come on.  I'm not going to hurt you...Well, not intentionally, anyway.\"  She giggled once more as she surveyed the mangled suit.  \"All this was accidental.\"  Still Cassandra didn't budge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't make me come in after you.\"  Harley smiled playfully.</span></div></div>",

Because of this failure, Harley Quinn had become increasingly desperate to restore the clown prince of crime to his former <i>jolly</i> self. Harley was hardly a woman of patience however, figuring the cure would come in the form of the same Titan formula that left her beloved with such fragile health. Harley however required a test subject, but she may had just found one when she recalled the woman her boyfriend left wheelchair bound some time ago, the <b>Oracle</b>. If Barbara Gordon could be restored to full functioning health, then perhaps so could Harley's mad love, or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the dark knight and the boy wonder away with other duties, <b>Batgirl</b> was left to watch over Gotham on her own. Risky yet something she was willing to do, given who she was. However things soon began to take a drastic turn when a shipment of venom fell under siege by the <b>Penguin</b>'s goons, and matters were made worse when Bane returned, wishing to reclaim his stolen property. Along the way, if she had any chance of stopping the muscle monster and criminal mastermind on her own, Batgirl decided that she had to take things to an extreme that even the fabled dark knight would go against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which story would you like to follow?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gotham was always a cesspool of criminal activity, yet one brave individual was determined to not let it overwhelm her. <b>Batgirl</b> sailed through the cool brisk winter air before perching herself atop a rooftop in the city docks. At the moment she was alone, given that both the dark knight and boy wonder were away with duties that took them both far and away from the city they called home, thus leaving Barbara on her own with <b>Alfred Pennyworth</b> as her sole radio contact. Of course, there was <b>Nightwing</b> but who knew what he was doing these days, if he was even in town to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, in the past few days she had been following up on a set of particular heists that she figured, through her own skills of deduction, were all seemingly connected with one another. It was just a matter of figuring out who was the mastermind behind it. After all, Gotham city certainly wasn't shorthanded when it came to the criminally corrupted, even without having sided herself with the dark knight. Her own father could have told her that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the investigation at hand, the highly dangerous and addictive chemical, <b>Venom</b>, was for whatever reason being shipped into the city by an outside source one that she deduced was the muscle monster himself, <b>Bane</b>. Because of how long his body had been exposed to the hyper steroid-like substance the masked man was practically addicted to it, most likely in need of it even when he wasn't breaking people's faces into dust. The numerous venom arrivals were no doubt a red flag that Bane was on his way back to Gotham, but someone out there was surprisingly beating him to the punch and, unfortunately for her, there was a lot of suspects that could easily come to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking into the warehouse through a nearby air duct, Batgirl crawled her way through the metal passageway, following the sounds of a few male voices. The men were no doubt the ones sent to pick up the venom supply. She paused as she watched silently through a vent's small opening. Doing so, she could make out the trio of men, one of which was busy ripping the cover of a tightly sealed crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sweet! Boss was right! Looks like the stuff got here right on time.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Shut up man, he'll bust our heads if we don't get this here crap back to him ASAP. So let's just load up and be done with it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm just glad that freak Bane ain't around. Hell, I'm surprise that the bat ain't here either!\"</i> The trio were suddenly surprised however, when one of them was taken down effortlessly after Batgirl slammed, feet first, into his lower back. <i>\"Dammit! You just had to mention him didn't you,\"</i> yelled one of the thugs, who soon found himself wincing in pain after an expertly tossed <b>Batarang</b> struck his rifle, forcing it away from his hand. Before he could recover, a sharp fist ended up connecting with his jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait! You ain't the bat,\"</i> the man grunted after he was forcefully pinned to the wall by a <b>Batclaw</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's Batgirl. Introductions aside you're going to tell me everything about your boss and what he has planned for the stolen venom.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thug refused to comment, stating that she wasn't the dark knight so there was less to fear. The lack of respect struck a nerve with Batgirl, who asked again with a sharper tone as she closed in on him. Once again he refused to talk, so she decided to take a different route. Wrapping up a foot of thick cable wire, she released him from her Batclaw, only to send him sailing into the air after using her line grappler. The tail end of the cable struck with the ceiling, leaving the panicked thug to dangle upside down by a singular foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now maybe you'll be a little more cooperative. Talk and maybe I'll bring you back down softly.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dammit, he'll kill me,\"</i> the goon yelled in fear after the cable shook from Batgirl's simple thug, <i>\"Alright, alright! It was the <b>Penguin</b>! He's the one having us nab all the venom! But I don't know what for, he ain't telling us. You gotta believe me!\"</i> To be quite honest she wasn't too surprised with the reveal. <i>\"Now get me down,\"</i> the man pleaded before, suddenly, a titanic arm came bursting through the rooftop and grabbed a hold of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I must thank you for using your final moment to deliver me some valuable information.\"</i> Smashing in like the monster that he was, Bane made a resounding impact as his humongous form touched the ground. He was rather surprised to see Batgirl before him, instead of the city's usual silent protector, and casually tossed the line cable back at her. The device snapped back into place as she readied herself for any sudden moments from Bane. Squeezing at the throat of the poor thug, it was clear that he was ready to kill the man at a moment's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Let him go, Bane,\"</i> Batgirl bravely shouted, despite the obvious size difference between them. He ignored her plea, instead applying more pressure, stating that the unfortunate man would be an example of what he had in store for the Penguin. <i>\"I said let him go, Bane!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Unfortunately for you and him, you are not the Batman, and even then I see no reason to bow to your requests,\"</i> Bane stated with a cold stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Help...me...\"</i> The helpless thug was beginning to fade fast as the life was being drained completely out of him. Barbara knew that she had to make a move now or the man's life was lost. With quick succession, the muscular giant howled as a trio of shock-powered Batarangs connected and imploded on his massive chest. It was just enough to loosen his grip and, using the Batclaw, she reeled in the goon who amazingly thanked her for the rescue. She didn't waste a moment urging him to revive the other two and get out as soon as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsulted, Bane rushed straight at her. It was only due to her sharpened reflexes that she was able to evade in time. Instinctively she attempted a counterstrike, but unfortunately, she nearly snapped a knuckle after making contact with his tremendous back. She backed off, for a moment, out of the corner of her eye she spotted the Penguin's goon squad making a break for it. Bane noticed as well, but his attention returned to the brave bat after another shocking Batarang struck him. Of course this was only serving to anger the empowered giant even more than he already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"For your foolishness, I will break you Batgirl! You will serve as my message to the Penguin, and the Batman!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that statement, Barbara knew that she was now completely in over her head. The dark knight himself had problems dealing with Bane during their numerous encounters. How was she going to survive against this venom-filled beast of a man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe venom! Would she actually, not even <i>he</i> wouldn't go that far! But Bane had murder in his cold eyes, and as drastic as it may seem, she had to do something, otherwise she really was going to die there and then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBane rushed at her once more with a fierce growl, but just as before, Barbara was able to dodge his wild stampede. As she did so however, she tossed a smoke pellet directly at his eyes. The marble-like object burst as it made contact, temporarily blinding the big man, although doing nothing to cool his rage. With the venom packed crate still intact, Barbara quickly loaded up an injector-like device containing the serum as she heard Bane curse her in Spanish. His blindness wouldn't last much longer. Her gloved hand shook nerves born from what she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Here it goes,\"</i> she muttered to herself, her breath held, as she injected the venom into her body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the foreign chemical surged through her bloodstream at an alarming rate, Barbara clutched at her midsection, her entire body beginning to feel as if it had been lit completely on fire. She screamed and yelled in agony as portions of her body began to pulse and vibrate.The venom was taking hold, and her transformation was about to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pain-filled yells masked the sound of her suit's fabric tearing away at the seams as her muscles began to stretch out and grow. Her arms and tremendous biceps made short work of her sleeves. Calves ripped through the tights individually, each nearly the size of her natural waist, her midsection however was now starting to rival the dimensions of a rather large flat-screen, her bulbous thighs now nearly matching the redwood-sized pillars of Bane himself tore through her lower attire. Only by chance was she left with a small portion stretched to the limit, but still covering her up somewhat. Meanwhile her back widened, like a bat spreading it's wings, her lats forming a perfect V-shape growing wider by the second. As for her pectorals and breasts, they both expanded outwards, adding inches upon inches of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer suit's top continuously grew tighter, the bat symbol stretching as she grew, but like her tights while it had been ruined through her expansion, a good portion still held together, shielding her from any loss of dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later her painful growth had come to a close, taking in several quick breathes to regain her lost air, the color on her face nearly matching that of her fiery hair. She looked herself over. It was a rough estimation, but in her mind she was just a bit below Bane in size. The man, while on venom, stood roughly over nine feet tall and weighed around three hundred and fifty pounds. At her size however, she guessed she was just under nine feet and Bane must be a good quarter or two pounds heavier then she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that was only with one quick injection. She could only imagine what she would be like if she used the same tech Bane used on himself. No, she shook away such thoughts. That was the venom's addictiveness altering her mindset! She had to stay focused on stopping Bane, especially now that she had the muscle to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You are either incredibly bold or foolishly reckless, perhaps both! To pull off such a move that even Batman has never done to himself. Do you not know of the consequences of your actions?\"</i> Bane asked, allowing Barbara to consider if his anger had settled during her amazing transformation, or if he was merely leading her into a false sense of security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I know darn well of the risks, but sometimes you just have to take them if it means keeping threats like you from the streets.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You wish to challenge me for my venom?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wish to challenge you to stop you,\"</i> the muscular bat stated as she stared right at the powerful masked man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Very well. Let us see how well you do with a size that is no doubt foreign to you and your fighting techniques!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't about to admit it, but Bane was right. This new body of hers was going to take some to get used to, but she had already come this far, and she was going to give it her all to stop him once and for all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just as she had figured. Bane mentioned this stronger yet bulkier body of hers was proving to be a bit of hassle to put out any constant offense or defensive maneuvers. Her reflexes and reaction time were sharpened to her older slimmer self, and while she could strike with the power of a battering ram, she was finding herself missing far and wide with several attacks, strikes that would have hit the mark in the past. She let out a grunt after Bane connected on her solidified rib cage, reminding her that the masked man was still bigger and stronger then her. She quickly responded with a right to his jaw, causing him to stagger, but not tumble. Still it was an opening and she took it, pounding away at the wide target that was his chest, Bane grunting and growling as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually blocked a strike and countered with one of his own with enough power to send the muscular bat reeling to one side. She attempted to regather herself, but in doing so, was unable to prevent Bane from charging straight at her, at full speed, and with far too much momentum, she could do nothing but possibly brace herself for impact as the two of them went straight through one of the side walls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with how massive she had become, Barbara still yelled out in pain, having taken the blunt of the attack, Bane then took her by the arm and spun her around before tossing her away. She came crashing down a good few feet away, and a part of her was thankful she was currently so large. If not, she would have been killed after those last few attacks. She lifted herself up, only to be met with another one of Bane's piston-like punches and, yet again, she staggered, causing him to charge at her a second time. This time however, she was on to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Only got one shot at this,\"</i> she thought to herself, just before she dodged Bane's bullish rush and proceeded to give him a bit of his own medicine by shoulder tackling him through another portion of the same wall he had plowed through with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reentered Bane found himself on the floor, the muscled heroine quickly mounting him, lying in punch after punch, but Bane would not relent yet again countering her offense, this time with a precise headbutt. It was enough to get her off and away from him. Moving quickly, Bane grabbed and pressed the muscled bat over his head and again he tossed her, this time almost in the shape of a dart. While she didn't go through Barbara still screamed as she crashed, side first, into another wall. She assumed it was only due to the amount of muscle she had packed on that prevented her shoulder from ripping completely out of its socket. She gasped, clutching her right arm and side, her legs were still good but there was no question that she was hurting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"As expected, despite your growth, you and I are far from equals. I will now collect what is mine and take my leave for I have a foolish bird I must find!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't bother responding, Bane's words were the truth after all, instead she spotted her fallen utility belt, it had snapped off after her waist had grown far too large. Silently she pulled out her trusty Batclaw. Bane far too busy grabbing a hold of his venom shipment to bother with her. As he lifted the crate over his wide shoulder she fired the weapon and, by luck, was able to to snatch a single container, reeling it back without Bane even realizing it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had beaten her, but she made sure that he didn't escape with all of his property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Barbara found herself staggering through the darker back alleys of the city, the venom was beginning to wear off and she was really starting to feel the pain and punishment Bane had put her through earlier. Her shoulder wasn't separated, but the impact from that last attack, combined with a hell of a sore back, was beginning to take it's toll. She collapsed into a sitting position, cursing to herself after nearly crashing into a nearby trash can. She was exhausted physically and mentally and she knew it. Still she reached for her radio transmitter, built into her cowl, to call Alfred for a pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually reached him. He mentioned how terrible she sounded and urged her to stay where she was, which wasn't a problem, Barbara wasn't sure if she could get to her feet even if she wanted to. Afterward she reclined onto a building's wall, her head resting on the hard surface. She needed this moment of rest and didn't even fight against the sudden slumber beginning to take hold of her.</span></div></div>",

After a few more pestering moments she at last awoke, unsure of where she was or how she had gotten there. It did feel comfortable though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good morning, Miss Barbara.\"</i> Even with a bit of sleep still in her eyes, she was vaguely able to make the cheerful expression of <b>Alfred Pennyworth</b>. The elder well suited man was busy opening the shutters of a nearby window. She quickly realized this was the light that had awoken her from her deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Am I at the manor? What time is it?\"</i> She asked as she wiped the sleep from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes ma'am you are and it's a bit past ten in the morning. You've been asleep since I found you late last night crumbled beside a building in the city's south section.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest she didn't even remember Alfred finding her, much less the trip back here. Last night's events must have taken more out of her than she thought. She tried to stand, but the moment she did so, a sensation of pain suddenly shot through her, forcing back onto the pillow and mattress. Alfred voiced his concern, warning her not to move around so suddenly, her body still recovering from her battle wounds from the night before. Frustrated with her weakened state, she sighed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can't just stay here waiting to heal Alfred, there's still so much to do!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butler asked what she meant and just what what had occurred last night. She explained how the Penguin was the one responsible for the stolen venom, although she wasn't sure what exactly he was using it for, and how Bane had appeared seeking to reclaim what was his and punish the one responsible for the thievery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I take it he is the one that caused you such injury, Miss Barbara?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nice guess,\"</i> she said amusingly, however Alfred was not in a joking mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How on earth did you escape from him, given your injured state and how damaged your suit was?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, he is the reason for me hurting at the moment, but...\"</i> Alfred caught her pause, asking if something was a matter, and in response, she asked for her utility belt. Upon receiving it she popped out the container, that was actually about as big as her hand, she had taken from Bane. With something of a smile she showed it off to the older man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My word! Is that?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It is. Venom, I took it from Bane...and the reason my suit was stretched and shred so much was because...I used this on myself.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't the least bit surprised when Alfred stared at her as if she had grown a second head, a near paleness coming over him. He instantly scowled her, asking what was she thinking exposing herself to such a drug, that Bruce and her father would never forgive her if they knew what she had done. She argued that she had no choice in the matter, Bane was ready to kill her for her interference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Master Bruce, much less your own father, would have found an alternative to stopping that mad man!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I didn't have a lot of options Alfred, and I'm not my father nor am I Bruce Wayne. I had to do things the way I saw fit.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself still rather frustrated at the continuing comparison to the dark knight. From the Penguin's goons to Bane, now even Alfred of all people! She was beginning to understand why <b>Nightwing</b> ultimately went solo. She pushed those thoughts aside however, Alfred was simply worried about her and a wonderful person and friend that she couldn't allow herself to be angry with the older man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I understand your concerns for my well-being Alfred, but I simply can't lay in bed while maniacs like Penguin and Bane are out there. Bane wants vengeance and he'll tear through all of Gotham to get to the Penguin. I was left in charge of it's safety. I won't let innocent people die because I refused to act!\"</i> As willing as he was to argue, Alfred could only find himself agreeing with her safety for the public. After all, he heard something similar many times from the very man he proudly worked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Alright but please don't strain yourself, Miss Barbara,\"</i> he asked of her as he helped her out of bed and to her feet. Assuring him she was alright she slapped on some spare slippers and made for the door. <i>\"Where are you going?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I need to take care of a few things down in the cave,\"</i> she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you sure, do you need me for anything?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm fine. Really. Just do me a favor. Watch for and inform me of any news feed that involves the Penguin, Bane, or both.\"</i> She flashed him a quick grin as he agreed to her request. This was her case and she alone was going to bring it to a close.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a long night, not just for the recovering Batgirl, but for the man responsible for her injuries. Bane had already trashed a few locations, in search of the criminal mastermind, the Penguin, but amazingly enough, found little success. He wasn't pleased with the fact that the vertically challenged mobster was somehow eluding him. Just where had that accursed bird gotten to was the question burning away in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment however, he was simply roaming the streets, looking for any sort of clue or overheard conversation that could bring him closer to his goal, he did so in his natural venom-free size, cloaking himself with a coat and hat so as to not bring any unwanted attention to himself. On the opposite end and just about ready to turn the corner was a citizen of Gotham who, by comparison, had a rather boring evening. <b>Selina Kyle</b> walked along at a simple pace as she did whenever she took one of her beloved cats out for a morning stroll, leash in one hand and a newspaper in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current day's headlines didn't seem to interest her, although she did glance over about an incident at the docks, perhaps this was the dark knight's doing, she hadn't seen or heard from him these past few days, although there was talk of a bat still sailing around Gotham city. Regardless she shifted to another headline, reading how someone had made a mess of a few safe houses that thugs of all natures used to evade the police department. Her night may have been dull, but it seemed like it was an average everyday night for the rest of the city. The thought amused her a bit that when she turned the corner she accidentally brushed up against a fellow passerby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe apologized to the man as her cat meowed and hid beside her. With a simple tip of his hat, the unknown stranger said the same before continuing on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"There there,\"</i> she muttered, petting her dear cat's head. She wondered what it was about that man that startled her pet cat, although there was indeed something about him that felt familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the <b>Batcave</b>, Alfred walked in with a teapot and a simple lunch on a dinner tray, the butler figured that Barbara Gordon should have something to eat since she had completely skipped out on breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Miss Barbara, are you still here?\"</i> He asked after failing to see her anywhere nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes I'm still here, Alfred, just getting in some training is all,\"</i> she responded from somewhere inside the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraining in her condition? Alfred could only sigh as he recalled Bruce Wayne doing the same far too many times for his own good. It seemed to him that some things just ran in the bat family. In any case, he pressed on, having followed the sound of her voice until, at last, he came upon her location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Something wrong, Alfred?\"</i> She asked with teasing sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Miss Barbara! What have you...\"</i> the poor man paused to keep himself from spilling her lunch and tea all over the cave floor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"Easy Alfred, can't have you passing out on my account!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy for her to say. The man had seen many things from his years of assisting the dark knight and beyond, but the stunning sight of Barbara Gordon, not just standing several feet taller than him but ripe with muscles that most men couldn't even hope to ever achieve in a lifetime, was something even he couldn't have prepared for. Barbara assisted him over to one side so that dear old Alfred could take a moment to gather himself, his reaction was pretty much what she was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Miss Barbara! Please tell me you didn't re-inject the venom into your blood?\"</i> Alfred asked, even if the answer was staring at him right in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I did,\"</i> she said in response with a rather apologetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter asked why, the butler didn't want to believe she was that purposely foolish, she explained that it was to help her heal faster. Prior to that however, she had been busy doing a good deal of research, using the data the <b>Batcomputer</b> already had on venom, and analyzing a sample of her blood she had taken before injecting herself again. Later, after making some progress, she gave herself the second shot and, when her growth concluded, she took another sample of her blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred interrupted at this point, asking if she felt light headed in any way due to the two blood sample she had taken so close from one another. She waved off his concern, stating that if she hadn't been affected by now it was a safe bet, she was going to be alright from here on out, instead continued to feed on the meal brought to her same with taking in a few drinks from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but laugh whenever she had a bit of difficultly doing such simple tasks, guess she wasn't completely used to her powerful size just yet. All that aside however, she continued with her explanation. Analyzing, comparing, and generally researching everything she knew and had about the blood samples and venom she was at last able to reach her goal. A suppressor of sorts, a chemical formula that when mixed in with the venom would still retain all the muscle pumping properties of the original but lessen the aggressive, violent, and addictive mental changes. Barbara stated that this was needed if she wanted to train and master her new size, only with a clean and focused mind would she be able to do such a thing. Her eventual second confrontation with Bane was also something to think about, only with her skills, sharpened to her new muscles, would she stand a chance against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So you're absolutely sure this will keep you of sound mind, Miss Barbara?\"</i> Alfred asked, while reassured somewhat, was still rightfully concerned for the young woman's safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes I am. I created this Alfred, because at some point I may need the venom's added power. This suppressor of mine is what's going to keep me...me, instead of becoming a monster like Bane.\"</i> Barbara knew full well that she couldn't afford to lose her mind to the venom's darker side. Later though, she spied Alfred taking notice of her attire. <i>\"You like? For the life of me I'll never understand why he has so many different bat suits,\"</i> she stated with a laugh, just before she showed off how well this new suit fit her much larger then average size. <i>\"Apparently it's well fitted, well equipped, and very stretchy,\"</i> she added with a slight bicep pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So I see, and just to go back to what you said before, master Bruce seemingly prepares for any sort of situation he may or may not find himself in.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara finished off her meal at this point and excused herself for a moment as she walked off to another part of the cave. He asked her if there was problem, and she responded with a no, that she was only going for one last thing she needed. A minute or two later she returned, metallic braces, with a singular tub attached to each, strapped to her huge forearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I knew Bruce had to have these somewhere. They're not exactly like Bane's current tech, in fact, these only reach to my biceps, but they should work well enough anyway.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred asked what she meant by that, she explained that the tubing system would give her a quicker, less painful transformation. She even modified it so that it could extract the venom straight out of her. Now all that was left was to get herself ready, she'd be hitting the streets again soon enough.</span></div></div>",

In fact, he was even more surprised when the paper came crashing back into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Do I look worried to you, boy? Of course I don't! As all of you know, I expected the man's arrival, and soon enough, he was going to come looking for me, but I already have something in the works for him.\"</i> Two of his armored men exchanged looks with one another before questioning their employer on how he was going to stop Bane from ripping their spines out. <i>\"You leave that to me. For now, simply stay on the look out for that dumb monster, or possibly even that flying rodent, Batman!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But boss, it was Batgirl the other day,\"</i> stated one of the men that had been saved by the redhead heroine the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So it was.\"</i> The unlucky goon gasped after the Penguin pressed the tip of his umbrella to the man's throat. <i>\"I don't care if it's a bat or a bird! Any of you spot someone dressed up in that specific attire, you open fire! Do you fools understand me!?\"</i> Out of fear they all nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good! Oh, and one more thing. Murphy dear boy, if you ever have your sorry arse saved by a bat again, do not return here and hope that I never find you! Understood?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe umbrella tip dug slightly deeper into the thug's throat. <i>\"Yeah boss, no problem! Won't happen again!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Excellent! I shall continue to prepare for our potential visitors.\"</i> With that said, the Penguin seemingly waddled away, leaving the goon squad alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wonder what he's planning?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dunno, probably some weird-ass crap with that venom we've stolen. Gonna need it if Bane comes rushing through like a damn bull!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men all agreed, hoping that their boss had something powerful in mind to stop the muscular monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, inside her apartment, Selina Kyle was busy readying herself for her usual evening activity, her thoughts going back to the man she had accidentally bumped into earlier in the day. Something about him was poking away at her curiosity, and it wasn't in a flirtatious nature like with the dark knight. No, it was a completely different vibe, one that had also startled her poor tabby. While she always kept her eyes out for any potential prize perhaps her little rooftop stroll would also provide with some answers to the mystery man's identity. Gathering her trusty whip, she was nearly ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Batcave, Barbara Gordon went through the last preparations she needed. Her body now back to normal, she had done as much training as she could, hoping that it would be enough. Fully equipped and with her motorcycle rived up, she slid on her cowl, Alfred wishing her the best of luck while promising her to stay in constant radio contact. She nodded in agreement before taking a seat on the motorbike. She waved goodbye as the engine roared and, a moment later, she was off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catwoman smiled nearly from ear to ear as she gracefully exited from her latest heist. A wondrous diamond styled necklace, she estimated it's value to be at least several thousands in worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That was far too easy!\"</i> Her smile faded however, when she picked up on a commotion nearby. <i>\"What's this now?\"</i> she wondered, before making her way down to the street below. She silently crawled on the cold pavement following the sounds of what she figured was another drunken brawl in one of the bars just across the street. Suddenly came the yell of one poor fool who had just been tossed right out of a window. He came crashing down, but before he could even pick himself up, the man grunted after Catwoman wrapped her thigh around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So friend, what's your story?\"</i> Her cheerful smile almost made him forget who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If I wanted this sort of action I'd go down to the strip club, but what the hell, guess it don't mean crap if I tell you that this masked freak is tearing apart everyone inside.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hmm, how interesting! Pleasant dreams.\"</i> Before he could properly react, the man was knocked unconscious after a quick strike. For a moment she wondered if it was worth looking into, she could leave now, never look back and not care what happened to the unconscious idiot or anyone else inside, but as the saying went, her curiosity was beginning to get the better of her. Selina, with slight amusement, hoped that last part about <i>killing the cat</i> wouldn't come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking on over to the freshly made opening, she parted pieces shards of broken glass from her path. Peeking into the building, she spotted a rather towering figure of a man fighting off a handful of thugs, or maybe it was better to say the opposite, considering the much smaller in size group were doing everything in their power to stop the giant from sending them all to the emergency room, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Someone kill the...\"</i> the thug yelled as he was tossed aside, like a rag doll, crashing into a nearby table. Another attempted to use a chair as a weapon, except the darn thing exploded into pieces the moment it made contact with the behemoth's back, who turned over and gave out a solid right to the poor sap as a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat silently watched as one last goon pulled out a rifle, determined to to put down the human juggernaut, but just as he pulled the trigger, the gun was effortlessly swatted away. However, despite that the weapon had still fired off a round, instinctively Selina lowered her head to avoid the shot. She later cringed as a slight sensation of pain ran through her right hand. Fearing she had indeed been shot, she looked over her entire arm and all seemed to be working order. Her eyes however nearly bulged right out of their sockets as she came to realize that, while no part of her had struck by the bullet, her prized jewelry was. It was demolished, damaged, no different than the broken remains of the window. Basically, it was completely worthless to her now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was furious and, like a woman scorn, wished to pay back the clueless thug who had effectively ruined her night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Bane grasped at his captive's neck, demanding he tell him about the Penguin or else he'd pop the worthless man's head like a grape. Suddenly the man was freed when the cat's whip made sharp contact with Bane's wrist. With a second strike Selina, perched where the broken window used to be, she brought him over toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You, my friend, just cost me a hard night's work!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked him out not a moment later. Needless to say, Bane was furious at the unexpected interference, cursing and yelling at her as he easily tossed aside anything in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Easy stallion,\"</i> Catwoman explained as Bane made his way towards her, <i>\"I'm not exactly fluent in your Spanish tongue, but if this kitty's pissed you off, well, blame it on that fool over there!\"</i> She then leaped onto the street, dusting herself off ready to make her leave, until Bane came crashing through the front door, ripping it completely off it's hinges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I was this close from receiving the answers I seek and you...you wretched Bruja have cost me my chance at finding El Pinguino! For that, I'm going to snap your body in half nine times over!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well shoot, guess that whole curiosity killing the cat thing might have some truth to it after all,\"</i> Selina thought to herself as she applied her bravest of faces, even if in reality she knew what that hulking beast of a man was capable of. Her hand steady on her whip, she knew she couldn't take him in a straight up fight. Instead she only had to distract and evade him long enough for her to come up with some sort of escape plan. It was the only chance she'd have of getting away with her life intact.</span></div></div>",

Selina had just enough time to leap out of the way as Bane ran past her, slamming into a parked car a short distance away.  Taking advantage of his momentary confusion, Selina used her whip, wrapping it around the behemoth's leg, in an effort to trip him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was like trying to rip a tree out of the ground.  Pulling the whip as hard as she could, Bane realized what she was trying to do and yanked the whip toward him, sending Catwoman flying through the air, before slamming into his rock hard midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, Selina rolled over, just in time to see a massive hand pull her off the ground.  His thick fingers wrapped around her neck, Catwoman struggled for breath, clawing at his hand for release, before she was launched backward, the breath forced from her lungs as she slammed into an SUV, glass showering the sidewalk as the vehicle rolled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armor she wore protected her somewhat, but she could already feel bruises forming on her back, along with a couple of cracked ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing with pain and swaying as she got to her feet, a fire hydrant whizzed by her face, embedding itself in the building behind her.  A small crowd started to form, though they were at least 30 feet away from the action, a few taking pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBane charged again, this time brandishing a car like a battering ram.  Leaping out of the way as the car missed her by inches, Catwoman jumped on Bane's back, trying with all her might to rip out a Venom tube thicker than both of her arms combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBane reached behind him with one of his enormous hands and pulled Catwoman away, before viciously throwing her on the asphalt.  A huge fist aimed at her face, Selina barely dodged it, before Bane stood erect again, sighing in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I grow bored of this fight, Catwoman,\" he told her.  Activating the Venom once more, Selina watched helplessly as his muscles pulsed with more and more power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hell,\" she thought to herself, crawling away on the ground.  She didn't know how badly she was hurt and she didn't  care; all that mattered to her was getting away from this monster before he killed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could go more than a couple of feet, a much larger hand pulled her off the ground again.  Holding both of her arms in one of his meaty fists, Bane suspended Catwoman in front of him, her body limp and wracked with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry it had to be this way, Catwoman,\" he said, cocking his other arm back, ready to deliver the killing blow...</span></div></div>",

On some occasions however, these changes have resulted in them reverting back their younger years, much to the advantage of their adversaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the dark knight unavailable, it was up to <b>Batgirl</b> to prevent yet another burglary committed by the elusive <b>Catwoman</b>. Hoping to confront the cat burglar inside the national bank however, much to her shock, she instead found a young baby, less than a year old, crying in the cat burglar's outfit on the bank floor. Upon further inspection, Batgirl realized that this little baby was actually Catwoman. Somehow, some way, someone must have transformed the poor feline into a baby in the middle of the burglary. While taking care of baby Selina, Batgirl must find out who was responsible and figure out how to change her back before the mysterious stranger can strike again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn another occasion however, it was Batgirl who was a victim of age regression. In a gritty night club in the middle of a late night, two notorious criminal bosses, <b>Two-Face</b> and <b>Black Mask</b>, were supposed to arrange some sort of deal with each other. Suspecting the worst, Batgirl, fresh from a bruising encounter with <b>Poison Ivy</b>, infiltrated the night club in pursuit of the deadly mobsters until, suddenly, the effects of Ivy's new pheromone began to take effect and, as a result, she found herself slowly regressing back to her youth. She must now find a way to escape the night club and confront Ivy before she becomes to young to even stand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which story would you like to follow?</span></div></div>",

Joker perfectionated the toxin to the point to take almost a day even for batman to analyze it to make a cure without resting not a single hour. When Batman finally discover it, it was too late for Gordon to endure it. Barbara was destroyed by the news that she exiled herself from everyone in her room.<br>\r\nIt took a year to Bruce and all the bat-family to convince Barbara to get out of her room but when she did Bruce almost notice that her behavior was worse she stopped to socialize with almost everyone not even Dick or Alfred could do anything to improve her behavior, when he confront her he discover that she send a message on the batcomputer where it says that left the city with no intentions to coming back. While the rest didn't understand the motive thinking it was more because of her father's disease, Bruce knew this was desmoralizing to her to the point she really will never come back .<br>\r\nReturning with the Joker his plans were more destructive and erratic than ever. It got even worse when in a battle at the Joker's hideout Harley Quinn her most loyal \"subordinate\" ,as the Joker puts it, interfere in the battle with the intention to help him to defeat the batman, but Joker after many times of her interrupting and getting in the way when no one asked, he finally snapped and get rid of Harley in a sadistic way, he punch her shoot at her and finally kill her threw her through a window dying for the fall. From that moment to the present day he started to kill more and more people no matter what Batman did he always come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis make anger Poison Ivy when she heard the news about her friend dead, she started a rampage in the city spreading plants of all different kind only to destroy the Joker. Even if she was stopped by Batman and jailed in the Arkham Asylum, Scarecrow one of his enemy see this as an a opportunity to test his new fear gas on her and see the results. At first it didn't affect her because of her plant biology but this inspired him to create a better formula which have a better effect in every kind of biology form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take to much before Scarecrow knew that a formula succeed when Ivy finally summits to the fear gas and finally killed herself. Scarecrow used this new formula to finally take control in Gotham city, at first it was going well for him but it came out of control when he discovered that this new version of his gas affected him even if had inmunity to this it seemed that the gas gained the ability to recombine molecules when is inside someone to alter the chemical composition not only to induce fear but destroy the brain too.<br>\r\nAgain when batman discover this it was too late, the city was declared \"No man's land\", and Scarecrow died because he wasn't aware of this until it was late and with him the real composition of the formula since it changed its composition it was unknown how to make an antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even half week later, Joker, Two-face and Penguin started a gangster war resulting in many people dying including cops, at the end of this the Mayor of Gotham declared a martial law to put on line the criminals but it made worse the things.<br>\r\nMeanwhile everything happen in the city Batman was in his batcave waiting for Lucius Fox one of his last remaining friends and allies to end his probably last invention. It was something unimaginable who not even the believers of science. <br>\r\nA time machine who can take the mind of the subject to the past, it was thanks to the materials and unknown technology given by...certain friends as a last attempt to stop certain disasters if they can do anything else to save the world.<br>\r\n\"Alright the last details were checked and analyzed, are you sure that you have everything checked before you go?\" Lucius said getting Bruce out of his thoughts.<br>\r\nSince many of his other allies like Nightwing, Huntress,Catwoman, Batwoman,even Alfred died in this last years by one of these events he became the last ally he had, he didn't like to much the idea of messing with time but, he knows is the only chance he had to stop the madness that was going on in his present, so before he answer he reorganized his plan once again before do this kind of time traveling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.-Stop the horrible future who depares to Gotham: his principal reason to travel back again, even with the risk of making it worse. <br>\r\n2.- Find a way to stop some of the supercriminals: even if some villains like the Joker can be cured nor changed since his motivation and origin are a mystery not even batman knows, there are others like Mr Freeze,Harley Quinn, Two-Face or Poison Ivy that can be saved from a life of crime only if they get the correct help, but he will see that later.<br>\r\n3.- The last one was more simple improve all of his gadgets and batcomputer with the knowledge he gained over years as vigilante: This will take time but if he improved his tech to approach he will have a better chances to make a situation at his favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reminding himself this he give Lucius the signal to begin the process.<br>\r\n\"Remember Bruce don't mess with the time line more than it is now\".<br>\r\nWith that said the machine started working.<br>\r\nAt first Bruce started to suffer a headache, then suddenly he didn't feel anything else when he recover his senses he found himself once again in front of the batcomputer searching around he discovered that many of his technology wasn't there nor many of his gadgets.<br>\r\nWhat finally confirm his suspicion about traveling back in time was a familiar voice that he recognize very well.<br>\r\n\" Master Bruce are you alright? You been here for almost an hour in front of your computer\" it was Alfred with brithish accent who approach him in his typical butler suit.<br>\r\nBruce couldn't help but smile knowing his friend and father figure is alive, Bruce had to fight the urge of hug him since it will be suspicious his sudden show of affection.<br>\r\n\"It's alright Alfred I will be resting for now it's been along night.\" Bruce said while parting himself from the big monitor.<br>\r\n\"Alright sir, I am glad that your taking my advice to spent less time here since the incident of the last week when you almost spent 5 days without sleep.\" Alfred said while they were heading to the surface of the Wayne Manor.<br>\r\nBruce find a kind of piece having a speech with Alfred again even if for him it was a few hours for Bruce was almost years without a single conversation even if it was about his behavior as vigilante.<br>\r\nIt didn't take to much for him to say goodnight to him and head to the bed.<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the batcave...<br>\r\nA new info in the codex was starting to been update.<br>\r\nGotham City (Batman 1st year)<br>\r\nStatus:<br>\r\n\u00b7Bruce Wayne aka Batman (ok)<br>\r\n\u00b7Allies/Confidants:<br>\r\n\u00b7Alfred Pennyworth (Alive)<br>\r\n\u00b7Lucius Fox (Alive)<br>\r\n\u00b7Dick Grayson aka 1st Robin, Nightwing (Alive and with the flying Graysons for now, civil status:normal citizen)<br>\r\n\u00b7Barbara Gordon aka Batgirl, Oracle (Alive, mental state: Normal, civil status: normal citizen,without knowledge of Batman or interest...yet)<br>\r\n\u00b7Jason Todd aka 2nd Robin, Red Hood (unknown location, alive, maybe living in the streets of Gotham City,civil status: orphan)<br>\r\n\u00b7Katherine Rebecca \"Kate\" Kane aka Batwoman ( Alive, civil status: heiress<br>\r\nof the (formerly) wealthiest families in Gotham, she is not Batwoman yet, sexuality:still descovering it)<br>\r\n\u00b7Helena Rosa Bertinell aka Huntress (Alive, Location unknown, probably preparing herself for a vendetta against the crime organization, still not becoming Huntress, mental state: Unstable,angry)<br>\r\n\u00b7Vicky Vale and Summer Gleeson Reporters of Gotham City (Alive, living in Gotham, they are begining their career as reporters)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVillains current status<br>\r\n\u00b7Mr Freeze:Alive, not a supervillian yet he's still Victor Fries<br>\r\n\u00b7Joker: Alive, unknown status but is probably too late.<br>\r\n\u00b7Penguin:Alive, operating the criminal underworld<br>\r\n\u00b7Black Mask:Alive, apparently his compamy is on the verge of bankrupt, he's still Roman Sionis<br>\r\n\u00b7Harley Quinn: Alive, apparently she is starting to move Gotham, she is not Harley Quinn sheis still Harleen Quinzel<br>\r\n\u00b7Poison Ivy: Alive, she's still the botanic Pamela Isley, apparently she is searching for a job here in Gotham.<br>\r\n\u00b7Catwoman:Alive, she still a cat burglar, Selina Kyle seem to have a few encounters with the Batman but never confront him directly yet.<br>\r\n\u00b7Clayface:Alive, He's still Basil Karlo, he's working as a movie star.<br>\r\n\u00b7Riddler: Alive,unknown criminal, Edward Nigma left a few cases with riddlers without solve in many crime scenes.<br>\r\n\u00b7Killer Croc: Alive, living in the shadows, all info about him is rumors of a giant cocodrile living in the sewers.<br>\r\n\u00b7Bane:Alive, in jail,waiting to test the venom toxin<br>\r\n\u00b7Scarecrow: Alive, working in the asylum, trying to perfectionate his fear gas.<br>\r\n\u00b7Two-face:Alive, working as attorney in Gotham, He is still Harvey Dent even if has his second pesonality, he has still in control over his other personality.<br>\r\n\u00b7Baby-Doll:Alive, unkwon location,Mary Louise Dahl is suffering a crisis after getting rejected because her condition and bejaviour, probably planning on kidnap her old coworkers of her old show.<br>\r\nRoxy Rocket: Alive, moving to Gotham, fired of her work thanks to her addiction to danger.</span></div></div>",

She always took pride in her work and felt as if she could make a difference in the prisoner's lives. However, one day, she was assigned to be the therapist of Jack Napier, aka, the Joker. During their sessions, Harleen felt as if the Joker was trying to seduce her, but she ignored his advances. When she went over every detail of his criminal past, it horrified her. It was then that Harleen knew what she had to do; become a crime-fighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Joker's raving madness that drove her to this, so she needed something that would strike fear into the heart of that clown. She then found a flyer for the now defunct Haley's Circus' clown act. She had become particularly inspired by the harlequin she saw in the poster and knew the exact costume she needed. She got a red and black leotard with black diamonds on the red, a black and red jester hat, red and black shoes. and put on clown make-up. Harleen Quinzel was dead, and now there was only Harley Quinn, the sole crime-fighter of Gotham. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout her entire crime-fighting career, Harley made several enemies, but she never forgot about her hatred for the Joker. However, things began to get out of hand as the enemies just kept coming and Harley was losing her mind. She needed a sidekick, and she got one. During a Joker attack on the Gotham City Police Station, Harley saved the life of the Commissioner's daughter Barbara. Out of gratitude, Barbara begged to be Harley's new sidekick, and Harley accepted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Gotham had the protection of the Quinn Twins, Harley Quinn and her plucky young sidekick, Barbie Quinn. Barbie was dressed in an identical costume as Harley, but her height was the only difference as she was slightly shorter than her.

I knew that she would strike at Gotham museum, they shipped a new item and stored it here two nights ago. Before following her, I did some research on the item. From what I found, it was a rare artifact of Egyptian origin, an ancient ring with an emerald jewel carved in the shape of some kind of Siamese cat. Apparently, the ring bearer would possess unimaginable power, capable of manipulating another living being, including humans, into any shape or form the bearer desired. As impossible as it sounded, I couldn't take any chances. It was no wonder why <b>Catwoman</b> would be interested in such a powerful item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed her into the museum, it was dark, silent and vast, the burglar could be crawling about anywhere in the building. The security was even tightened since the last time, but this didn't seem to phase her, and this was no problem for me. Creeping through the building in search of the mischievous thief, I had a strong suspicion that this would be no ordinary night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down a long hallway, I found her, naturally crawling through the improved burglar alarms, like the professional that she was. I watched from the shadows as she successfully reached her goal. She obtained the ancient ring and, almost instinctively, leaped from the scene. Once again, I followed her out of the museum and onto the rooftops of the city. I followed her to a familiar spot, overlooking the entire residential district, bright under the moonlight. It was here where we both shared our first kiss, a night I would never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe prepared herself for my arrival, as if our encounters had become routine. She was the least bit surprised when I finally revealed myself. <i>\"There you are,\"</i> she remarked with false innocence, <i>\"I was hoping you would show up earlier tonight.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was not amused. <i>\"Where is the ring Selina?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You can see right through me, can't you?\"</i> Catwoman laughed sarcastically as she reached into her suit and pulled out the ring from her cleavage, holding it in between her sharp fingers. <i>\"That's good, because I can see straight through you, Batman.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm afraid I can't let you steal that ring.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman simply chuckled. <i>\"Sorry darling,\"</i> she replied, <i>\"But we're not going through all this again. Not tonight. There's going to be a change of plans.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately realized what she intended to do. I had to take action. I lunged towards her, but she immediately dodged my attack and leaped up to another vantage point, as if she anticipated my response. <i>\"Don't you ever get tired of the same old routine Batman?\"</i> She asked as she once again jumped out of my reach, <i>\"How about a little change for once?\"</i> I did not reply. I was more concerned with subduing the petty thief before she put the ring on her finger and figured out how to activate its tremendous power. I lunged one more time, but once again, it was futile, as she once again jumped out of my reach. Now with the ring in her finger, she pointed it towards me. It seemed that she had already researched how to use the ring herself. <i>\"Let's shake things up a little bit!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was little I could do. She pointed the ring directly toward me with malicious intentions. A blinding light beamed from the diamond ring, shining over me. Under the beam of light, I realized that something remarkable was happening to me, much to the enjoyment and much to the desire of Catwoman.</span></div></div>",

I could feel everything before me fade from my reach, my entire body felt an overwhelming surge as I collapsed to my knees, to the delight of my smiling opponent. For a moment, I lost all of my senses as the shimmering sensation coursed through my body, but when I finally regained my vision, no longer sweating under the gleaming beam of the incredible ring, I was horrified by the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around me had grown out of proportion. It seemed like a long sprint to the edge of the formerly enclosed rooftop, and the vast stone beneath my feet reached out to a distance like I was standing in the middle of a desert. For a moment, I thought that Catwoman had disappeared into the night, until I caught a glimpse of a pair of leather boots, enormous in size, standing directly in front of me. As I stood up to my feet, as tall I as could, I continued to tilt my head up, following the immense, god-like figure that stood before me, until, occupied by a huge, devious grin, I saw the face of Catwoman, looming high above, looking down at me as she licked her lips. In that terrifying moment, I realized that the power possessed by the ring was too true and, as a victim of its tremendous power, I had shrunk. I now stood, from my estimation, at a mere three inches in size, a mere fraction of the overall, massive size of the cat burglar who stood triumphantly above me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling from ear to ear, Catwoman began to bend down with a twinkle in her eye. In a squatting position, she continued to stare at me in amazement, proud of what she had accomplished. <i>\"Well, well, well,\"</i> she giggled in delight, <i>\"Looks like it's my turn to do the chasing.\"</i> I was too petrified to reply, all I wanted to do was run away, out of the grasp as my sinister adversary. Unfortunately however, as I saw her massive hand hover above my head, I knew that she had other intentions on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I've waited a long time for this, Batman,\"</i> she continued as she approached me with her enormous leather glove. Under the looming shadow of her massive hand, all I could do was turn around and run for dear life, something that I thought that I'd never do in my entire life. Even at my diminished size however, my attempt to escape was futile. I was immediately swept from my feet, landing into the soft hand of Catwoman, who held me in a tight grip with her fingers. The immense force she held me between her fingers rendered me unable to move. I squirmed, like a fly caught in a web, as Catwoman lifted me high above the ground, holding me in front of her face as if I was nothing. I was so small that, if she wanted to, she could have swallowed me whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dreaded the inevitable humiliation that I was about to endure in the hands of my malicious rival, who now had full control and dominance over me. As she squeezed me in between her sharp fingers, holding me in front of her glaring cat eyes, I could read from the smile on her lips that I was doomed to suffer under her very power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Believe me my little bat, I have so much more in store for you!\"</i></span></div></div>",

I had no hope of reaching into my utility belt to at least help me escape from such a degrading position. At long last, I was caught, trapped in the claws of the dreaded Catwoman. She licked her lips in anticipation, holding her new toy in front of her, she could do anything she could possibly imagine to me, and there was nothing that I could do about it. I have finally been defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she was delighted with her total dominance over me, but almost suddenly, I noticed a shimmering look in her eye as she remembered her true intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I must admit,\"</i> Catwoman stated, changing the tone in her voice, <i>\"As much as I would enjoy having a little intimate moment together right now, there's something that I would like you to do for me before we get down to business.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dreaded what she had in mind. Whatever it was, I knew that I wasn't going to like it. I had no intention of helping the woman in any of her petty crimes, and I certainly had no intention of sharing an intimate moment with her like this, but at this point, there was very little I could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If you may recall, <b>Poison Ivy</b> has stolen some of my goods, and I want them back. I need you to provide a little distraction as I sneak in and retrieve them.

Catwoman would rather throw me, in this state, into the clutches of the evil Poison Ivy, just so she could have her already stolen goods back? I refused, but almost immediately, I faced the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt Catwoman loosen her grip as I slid in between her fingers. I was about to land hard onto the concrete floor until, suddenly, Catwoman caught me by the leg. With my ankle trapped between her thumb and her finger, the pressure she applied almost broke my ankle. She then began to shake me, I could feel the bones in my leg snap out of place. Dangling from a broken leg, I gave in and agreed to help her. With that said, Catwoman lifted me back into her hands and sarcastically apologized for breaking my leg, an apology that I refused to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could catch my breath however, Catwoman threw me, head first, in between her breasts. Being squeezed in between two huge mountains of soft flesh, pressed in place by a leather suit, was enough to make me suffocate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Enjoying the view down there my little bat?\"</i> Catwoman was completely careless. She showed complete disregard for my safety. She had shrunk me to a mere three inches, broke my leg and stuffed me, face first, into her tight cleavage. I was humiliated, but there was little I could do. Stuck in between her breasts, I could feel beads of sweat drench my costume as Catwoman made her way to her desired destination, where Poison Ivy awaited my arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually we arrived at the scene. Catwoman finally pulled me from her cleavage, noticing how drenched I was from her sweat. Again, she falsely apologized, clearly trying to hold back her satisfaction of having complete control over me, before looking down at an abandoned boutique where Poison Ivy called her latest hideout. The little shop was overflowing with foliage, and the scent was strong. Realizing what she had to do, Catwoman then looked back down at me, lying in the palm of her hand, comforting my broken leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you ready my sweet little bat?\"</i></span></div></div>",

Once again, I felt stunned under the bright gaze of the diamond ring as my entire body rapidly changed. This time however, I did not shrink, but instead, I was horrified to find out that I was transformed into a female! I felt my newly acquired breasts squeezed under my tight suit as the rest of my body slightly shrunk inside. My cowl was filled with flowing hair as my waist expanded. The changes were hardly noticeable under the costume, but I certainly felt the drastic change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed by my transformation, Catwoman pointed the ring at me again, and suddenly, my costume completely vanished, revealing the naked, sexy blonde-haired woman that I had become! Almost instinctively, I wrapped my thin, soft arms across my erect nipples, struggling to my wrap my arm around the enormous size of my breasts, and covered my smooth groin with my free hand.

My arms and legs sank into my already enormous torso, leaving only a pair of hands and feet. I felt my head sink into my neck. Losing my entire legs, as the pain in my broken leg faded, all I could do was waddle my feet uselessly. Shaped into an almost perfectly round ball of skin, all I could do was waddle my hands and legs as I laid on my fat back, perfectly placed in the palm of her immense hand.

Over the following few days, she found her entire world changing. She was eating a lot more and her skin was turning pink. The only one who could help her was the one and only Batman. But could the caped crusader help Selina Kyle from slowly but surely turning into a pig? Or would the hungry criminals of Gotham help themselves to some pork chops?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Renee Montoya</b> and her girlfriend, <b>Batwoman</b>, managed to track the <b>Mad Hatter</b> and confront him in his latest hideout, an abandoned warehouse. While fighting his thugs, they were both blasted by the crazed villain. Knocked out by the blast, the duo awoke several hours later, not only finding that their foes had disappeared, but discovering some odd changes happening to their bodies. While Batwoman was slowly transforming into a walrus, Montoya was starting to look more and more like a dodo! Will they be able to find the man responsible and change back before it's too late?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which story would you like to follow?</span></div></div>",

It was an old idol from an ancient civilization. The idol was in the shape of a large sow. Supposedly it was a representation of a goddess of plenty, but to <b>Catwoman</b>, the only thing that mattered was that it was valuable, or at least it would look quite good on her shelf, alongside her many other purloined objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving home forty minutes later, Selina divested herself from her tight costume and prepared for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slept, she failed to notice the eyes of the idol glowing green. A gleaming light struck her slumbering form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, awaking with a yawn, Selina went towards the kitchen, rubbing her stomach a bit. For some odd reason, she was starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she had intended to be merely a slice of toast and one egg turned into nine slices of buttered toast, the entirety of her eggs, and several large pitchers of milk. Laying back in her dining room chair, Selina cradled the taut orb her stuffed stomach now was, marveling at her capacity. She had never eaten that much food at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a shower, it eventually donned on her. Not her sudden craving for food, but her work. She decided that, with all the stolen goods she already possessed, she was just pushing herself too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Maybe I could take a vacation in a few weeks,\"</i> she thought to herself, ignoring the slight bump that developed across her soft belly.</span></div></div>",

As she entered the frozen dessert aisle, Selina spied the large selection of ice cream on sale. The treats caused her mouth to water until, suddenly, another noise emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"SNORT!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking a bit, Selina looked around. There was only a mother and her baby at the end of the current aisle she was in and it looked like they didn't hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Phew,\"</i> she sighed, <i>\"That was SNORT close.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening at the sound that escaped her nose, Selina hurried through the aisle, but not before grabbing several extra large pints of ice cream. She hoped that the checkout line wouldn't be busy, but unfortunately it was packed, and the thought of all the food she had in her cart caused her stomach to rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So SNORT hungry!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Selina?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina jumped a bit at her name and turned around, hoping the voice she heard wasn't who she thought it was. But unfortunately fate was against her that day, for as she turned around, she spied <b>Bruce Wayne</b>, her on-again off-again boyfriend. He had a shopping cart of his own, with various healthy foods and some wines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"B-Bruce...what are you doing here?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce looked a bit shy as well as he replied. <i>\"Well, I gave Alfred the day off and realized that I was running out of some protein supplements and wine so, here I am.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I see...SNORT!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce blinked a bit as Selina covered her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Selina...did you just snort?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Selina was next and, after swiftly telling Bruce she'd call him, she paid for her items and left, leaving Bruce to only rub his chin in thought.

Squealing, she jumped up and reached behind her for the source of the pain, finding some kind of rope with her hands. But, as she turned her head and looked down, she realized that what she thought was a rope was instead a curly, pink pig's tail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn involuntary snort was the only sound she made for several minutes before sitting down, carefully positioning herself so she didn't sit on her new appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's okay Selina, it's okay. You just have a tail, that's all. A pig's tail...Oh SNORT!\"</i> What followed was a series of sobs, moans, and snorts as Selina gave vent to the turmoil that were her emotions before, after ten minutes of venting, she remembered she had a friend who just might be able to help her. But as Selina went to grab her phone and dial said friend, her stomach rumbled and her feet carried her to the kitchen table and the bags of groceries she hadn't put away yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rational part of Selina's brain switched off as she dug into the food, eating without a care for manners, decency, or convention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ooh...\"</i> Selina moaned, eyes opening. She felt sluggish, bloated, and content at the moment, a hand patting her stomach, only to meet with her middle far sooner than she remembered ever having done so before. This brought more awareness shooting through her and she looked down, only to find a large mass where her toned abs once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Selina realized that she wasn't just stuffed. No, whatever was happening to her had caused her whole body to become fat, not chubby, but full on fat. Selina pinched, poked, slapped, and fondled every new inch of herself. Looking in the mirror, she snorted wildly. Yes, she was definitely a fat woman now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning from her reflection, Selina rushed towards the scale in her bathroom and, after a moment's hesitation, hopped on. The digital counter climbed and went berserk before displaying an error message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRound cheeks turning pale, Selina remembered that the scale had a limit of three hundred pounds. For it to fritz out like this meant that she was way over the limit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother snort, a few sobs, and then she remembered her friend. <i>\"Yes,\"</i> she realized, <i>\"<b>Poison Ivy</b> could help.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialing her number, she managed to get the plant-obsessed villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ivy? It's Selina. I need your help!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela Isley had seen a lot in her years as a criminal, but the sight of Selina Kyle, overweight with a tail and snorting like a pig was a bit much, even for her experience.</span></div></div>",

Of course, after four straight minutes of laughter, Selina finally put a stop to it by giving her best ugly squeal, the sound cutting off the sound and grabbing Ivy's attention. If Selina was surprised at how perfectly pig-like she sounded, she did not show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"\"Ivy,\"</i> she cried, before letting out another loud snort, <i>\"Will you help me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy nodded, moving aside to let the far fatter woman in, sneaking a peek at the rotund rear Selina now had. If Ivy wasn't aware that the butt she was staring at was Selina's, she would most certainly have enjoyed that massive amount of ham for her Thanksgiving day meal with Harley Quinn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seating Selina on her sturdiest metal chair, Ivy began her analysis, poking a syringe into Selina's arm and eliciting a squeal. Once her blood was taken, Ivy analyzed it and finally announced her discovery. <i>\"Genetically, there's nothing wrong with you. You appear perfectly human at the DNA level.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina oinked mightily at her conclusion, hands squeezing her pig-pink gut. <i>\"So this is nothing!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, if there's no scientific problem with you, obviously your problem is magical in nature. What did you do? Piss off <b>Zatanna</b>? Steal Wonder Woman's bra?\"</i> Selina simply frowned, until she suddenly recollected an earlier issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, I did take this idol earlier this week, but it was from some old civilization, and one not known for magic.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm guessing that it has something to do with your current appearance.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina was about to contest the point, largely because she didn't like where Ivy's point was leading, namely returning what she stole, something Selina never did, when her gut suddenly rumbled. The thief caught the amused gleam in Ivy's eyes as she leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is the piggy hungry?\"</i> Selina flipped her off and snorted angrily, but conceded and nodded her head. <i>\"Well you'll be happy to hear that Harley stocked up on sweets!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina wasn't happy, but her stomach rumbled again, and she knew that she would have no choice but to quiet it down.</span></div></div>",

Approaching the idol, Ivy knelt down to get a closer look at the statue that had caused the mysterious slow transformation of Catwoman, being careful not to touch it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hmmm,\"</i> Ivy examined the idol closely, <i>\"Well, from what I can tell, it doesn't look too out of the ordinary, although these eyes seem remarkably striking.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"They're what make it so valuable.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point when Ivy realized what was so striking about the eyes. They where a rare, one of a kind, type of gemstone, cut from a special crystallized plant sap that caused altering effects on those who happened to be exposed to the glow of them in the moonlight. They would actual plant itself, causing almost instant change if it's spores were inhaled. The changes were usually harmless, like skin pigmentation alteration or itchiness, but could be dictated through genetic tampering to suit the tamperer's needs, whatever they may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy knew she could reverse the changes for her friend if she felt like it, but she also knew that she could use the gems to create her own special piggy plant that could put Gotham city in the palm of her hand, change the population into a piggy utopia of fat and gluttony, addicted to her plant's honey.</span></div></div>",

Driven insane, she carved a dummy from the bark of the tree and named it Joker-Face. Harley allowed the Joker-Face personality do the dirty work, including robbery and murder. She was totally dominated by Joker-Face, who barked orders at her and degraded her with verbal (and even physical) abuse, not all that different from when the Joker was alive. Harley tried to reform by working puppets in a children's show, but could never escape from her first love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bane Crocodile</b> (Bane and Killer Croc) - Sharp mind and strong body. Despite what some may think, it was not the drugs that made him like a crocodile, rather it helped him stay more \"human\". The untested drug was developed to counteract the virus he had, which was slowly transforming him. At the same time, his strength was dramatically increased as a side effect, not so bad of a side effect except that now he must rely on the drug or else suffer extreme weakness and further transformation into his cold-blooded form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Two-Clay</b> (Two-face and Clay face) - Harvey Karlo played an unstoppable knightly lawyer on an old television show, but as an actor he was tied up in crooked business that helped his stardom. When relations with the mob were getting bad, he got into an \"accident\" which disfigured half his body, ruining his acting career. Not only did his body undergo a horrific change, his mind also became split. Half of him believed he was the heroic lawyer he played on TV while the other half stayed as a revenge seeking victim. When the lawyer would take control, the clay half would transform and complete the other side of his face to perfection, but when the victim would take control, the clay would expand and cover over the good side, showing a complete monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Freeze Penguin</b> (Mr.Freeze and Penguin) - Victor Cobblepot was always off-putting because of his strange appearance and harsh demeanor. He spend most of his life down in lab basements doing research on cryo-weaponry, with a fascination of birds as his side hobby (despite being called a penguin during childhood). At the company he worked he met the second woman to not care about his appearance, the first being his late mother. After the two of them wed, she became ill, and Victor used the company's resources (without permission) to put her in cryo-stasis while he worked on a cure. In a scuffle between the company head and himself, Victor was accidentally shot with one of the cryo-weapons, and was left in a pool of chemicals, forcing him to rely on sub-zero temperatures to survive. In the fight between the two, Nora's capsule was broken, killing her. Fashioning his collection of umbrellas, his icon of love and protection, into freeze gun tipped weapons, he sought out to kill the company head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe batcomputer alert suddenly went off, and one of the villains appeared on the screen.</span></div></div>",

It was in this abandoned warehouse district that the crooks of Gotham would take refuge from the cops and capes, and prepare and plot their next moves. Batman was only one man after-all, and even his extended team of crime fighters couldn't look at the entire city at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in one of these warehouses that the Clown Price of Crime, the Joker, sat as he tinkered with his latest concoctions.  (The) Joker had laid low these last few weeks, as Batman took his time fighting in stranger and stranger adventures.  So much chaos happening in the Caped Crusaders life that Joker felt no need to add to the chaos.   Batman would always come out okay, with his handsome scowl looking at Joker's crooked grin.  Joker smiled at this image, if anyone was to alter the Batman for the better, it would be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wat'cha doin Mista Jay?\" came a voice behind him.<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing Harley, I was just thinking.\"<br>\r\n\"Thinkin of what puddin?\"<br>\r\n\"Of what a nuisance you've been lately!\" Joker yelled as he turned around and tossed an empty flask at Harley, as his voice turned to anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley Quinn was once known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, the Joker's psychiatrist when he was being held at Arkham.  She was a bright but lonely woman who took pity on the Joker.  Over time, she began to see the genius in the madman, and helped him escape, before helping him with his crimes.   If you asked her, she'd tell you that she was the Joker's love.  If you asked the Joker, he'd tell you another story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Mista Jay, what's wrong?\" Harley said, making sure to keep her distance.<br>\r\n\"It's this confounded formula.  I tried, and I try, but it doesn't make sense.  People are beginning to build a tolerance to my laughing gas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painted smile on Harley's face began to widen.  \"I got just the thing for ya.\" she said as he pulled a small container out of her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this now?\" asked the Joker, intrigued.<br>\r\n\"It's a sample of Ms. Ivy's latest drink.\"<br>\r\n\"And what, does it do?\"<br>\r\n\"It's a biological compound that's designed to rewrite the DNA from the most basic level, and rework it to form something more pleasing.\"<br>\r\n\"English Harley.\" Joker replied with more than just a hint of disdain in his voice.<br>\r\n\"It changes apples to oranges.\"<br>\r\n\"So in other words, I alter this with my laughing gas, and it drives the audience fruity.\" the Joker said with a laugh.<br>\r\n\"Good one Mista Jay.\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up Harley.\" the Joker said as he grabbed the flask.  \"It's going to take some time, but I'll have to reverse-engineer this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Joker turned his back to Harley and began working at his table.

I got the last laugh!\" the Joker shouted triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley?\" Joker asked as she laid in a fetal position on the floor.  \"Are you alive?\"<br>\r\nHer answer came in the form of a grunt.<br>\r\n\"Harley, this isn't funny!  I worked hard on that formula.  I'm not going to have your biology mess it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley started shaking, then contorted her body.  \"Harley?\" Joker asked again, more curious than worried.<br>\r\nBefore his eyes, the woman changed.  He breasts seemed to inflate two full sizes.  Her ass matched them.   Her smile grew smaller until her lips started to pout.  Her pupils shrank, leaving an empty look inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, she rose from the floor.  Her hips swayed as she moved.<br>\r\n\"Hey Mista.\" she said, her voice more sultry than Joker had ever heard before.<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Joker replied in a puzzled manner.<br>\r\n\"You's sosmart Mista.\" she said as she stumbled towards him.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've established that 1000 times over.\"<br>\r\n\"I's wants to givza a kiss.\" she said as she leaned in towards him.<br>\r\n\"You and a million other girls in this god forsaken city, Harley.\"<br>\r\n\"Dontcha want me? Mista?\" she said as she leaned against him.<br>\r\n\"Harley, get off me.\" the Joker said sternly.<br>\r\n\"Just one little kiss.\" she said leaning in.<br>\r\n\"I'm not in the mood.\" the Joker said as he smacked her across the face, sending her to the floor.  \"My formula was meant to make them laugh, not pout.  It's a failure.  You're a failure Harley.\"<br>\r\nShe started towards him.<br>\r\n\"Just one widdle kiss.\" she pouted.<br>\r\n\"Harley, if you love me, you'll leave me alone with my thoughts.  Go out, have fun.  Capture Batman and we'll talk.\"<br>\r\nWith that he tossed her out of the abandoned warehouse office, and slammed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's back to the drawing board.\" Joker said to himself as he went to reverse engineer the formula again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another quiet night on the Gotham coastline for Tim Drake.  He was Batman's third Robin, and arguable the smartest.  Instead of acrobatics, or outright fighting skills, Tim chose to focus on his detective abilities.  He managed to track down the Joker's hiding place to the abandoned warehouse district, through process of elimination over everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joker doesn't usually stay quiet this long.  If he's in Gotham, he's here, and planning something.\" Tim thought to himself.<br>\r\n\"Robin to Alfred.\" he said into his Bat-tooth earpiece.<br>\r\n\"Alfred here.\" said the butler on the other end.<br>\r\n\"I am in the abandoned warehouse district. Over.\"<br>\r\n\"Understood, Robin.\" Alfred said as he disconnected the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No homeless seen yet.  That's unusual for tonight.\" Tim noted to himself.  Usually, the warehouse district had a few stray beggars wandering around at night, trying to find a suitable shelter to hide from the morning sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour of searching, Tim's keen hearing managed to focus in on a group of people walking to the East.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin to Alfred.  Detected movement, following up. Over.\"<br>\r\n\"Confirmed.\" Alfred said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently moving through the shadows, Robin managed to come across the group of bums.  Many of them were unshaven, missing teeth, and unhygienic.<br>\r\n\"Is it true?  You'd better not of woken me for some trick.\"<br>\r\n\"Ay, it's true mate, some oh broad is kissing men like us fo free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin followed.  Men being lead like this were usually victims of some psychopath's newest melodramatic crime plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin turned a corner, to see a group of young curvy women giggling to themselves as they kissed the bums that were there.  Most the women were dressed in rags and old clothes that were torn and didn't fit, just like the men were.  But in the center, was a familiar looking woman, Harley Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Tim thought that the woman resembled her.  She was curvier, poutier, and clearly had a larger breast size than Harley.  But she was dressed the same way, wore the same makeup, and had the same nose and eyes are Harley Quinn.  But what would her plan be?  Did she get her hands on Poison Ivy's mind-control lipstick and was building an army of men to help her out in some crime?  But if that was the case, what were all the homeless women doing there? Robin decided to continue carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching for a few minutes, of Harley kissing the men, Tim Drake stepped out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley.\" he yelled.<br>\r\n\"Itz, you.\" she said with some glee.<br>\r\n\"What are you planning, Harley, why bring all these men here?\" he yelled.  Making sure he had enough room to escape if the men tried to turn on him.<br>\r\n\"I swear, I wasn't planning anything.\" she said with a giggle.  \"All these big strong men, came to see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's playing me.\" Tim though.  He knew Harley didn't act this ditzy.  She must have been luring him into a trap.<br>\r\n\"Harley, come with me.  I can take you back to Arkham, we can get you help.\" he yelled.<br>\r\n\"Ok. But only if I's can see Batman.\" she said swaying towards him.<br>\r\n\"Batman will see you once we get you to safety.\" he said, holding out his hand.<br>\r\nHarley giggled.  Tim noticed there was defiantly something not right about her.  Some of the girls behind Harley started to follow her movement towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you Harley.  None of these girls needs to come with us.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll come with you. I'z don't tell my sisters what to do.\"<br>\r\n\"Sisters?\" Tim though.  Harley was a single child, and didn't call any other woman sister.  Was this an imposter?<br>\r\nThe other girls started to wander off, some still heading towards Robin, others away through the cracks between buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alfred, this is Robin. I think we have a situation here.\"<br>\r\n\"Alfred here.  What seems to be the matter Master Robin?\" he replied in a deadpan voice.<br>\r\n\"I've come across Harvey in sector D27, she seems to be drugged.  There are many other homeless women here.  Although I don't believe any of them to be known criminals.\"<br>\r\n\"Very well, I will inform Batman.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I think Batman will want to see this gathering.  Robin out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to arrest me?\" Harley said as she raised her hands out towards Robin.<br>\r\n\"Sure, just let me get my cuffs.\" Robin said, caught almost off guard by how calm she was being.<br>\r\nAs he put his hands into his utility belt to get the Bat-cuffs, Harley lunged forward at the young detective.<br>\r\n\"She is trying to headbutt me.\" he thought, and braced himself to impact.<br>\r\nWhat he didn't expect was Harley's arms tightly embracing his back as she knocked him over.  Her breasts pressed up against his chest, and her lips met his.<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" Tim thought as his back hit the ground.  He flexed his arms, ready to break free, but felt her legs grinding against his.  Tim felt his member erect do to the increased blood-flow.  Her tongue entered his mouth as he pulled away, and rolled himself on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a giggle.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" he asked.  But before he could get an answer, three other barely clothed females came from behind and started rubbing their hands on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the women, why not the men?\" his mind thought.  He quickly jumped back, and looked around, there were no men.  Did they leave with some of the other women?  His mind raced with the possibilities.  His heart racing, his stomach began to fill with butterflies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butterflies quickly morphed into a tingly feeling that ran across his body.  He had to get to safety.  He broke free of the women's hold and sprinted towards one of the buildings.  Once inside, he could call for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran cramps began to form.  An odd sensation for him, he hasn't had cramps from running since his first year of training with Batman.  He let out a grunt, as his legs began to hurt.  It felt almost like a growth spurt, only different.  \"What's happening?\" he said to himself as he noticed his fingers, they were slimmer now, somehow his hands had lost mass.  He felt the back of his palms, his skin was defiantly smoother now.  There was a sharp pain below his mouth, as he touched it, he could feel his chin had receded a bit.  His nose felt a tiny bit smaller too.<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" he grunted again, but this time his voice was at a higher pitch.  It sounded noticeably feminine.<br>\r\nBefore he could get into the building, he collapsed on the pavement.  His hips seemed swollen, and as he moved his hands sound, he noticed his male genitalia had disappeared.<br>\r\nFinally he could feel his ass and chest inflate.  He let out a moan, one that was a mix between pain and pleasure.<br>\r\n\"Must warn Batman.\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n\"Batty.  Mhmmm, Bat-Man.\" he forced himself to say.  Before his mind got foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the pain stopped, and Tim got up.  But the Tim who had started tonight's patrol was gone.  Replaced was a woman with short hair, but with an hourglass figure.  Her C-cup breasts so large, that they cause her spandex to expand, and show a midriff.   She giggled as she tried to get her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind swilled in a pink haze.  Batman could solve solve her predicament, she just had to get close to him.  Then he's embrace her, and show his love for her.  But only her, she had to get rid of Harley, and the other women before making it back to the Bat Cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya, sis, how you doing?\" Harley asked.<br>\r\nRobin giggled. \"I've never felt better.\"<br>\r\n\"What can I say, Mista Jay's formula works wonders.\" she said, and they both giggled.  \"So can I see Batman now?\" she asked licking her lips.<br>\r\nRobin felt the butterflies return in her belly, she wanted nothing more than to see Batman right now too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The internal butterflies seemed to lead Robin, as she walked towards downtown Gotham.  It was going to take all night for her to get to Bruce Wayne's manor on foot.   She hadn't quite adapted to her new body either, it wasn't as fast as her old one, and it seemed to sway with every step.   Looking around her plump ass to her feet, she noticed that her heels refused to touch the ground, like her body instinctively walked like it was wearing hi-heeled shoes.  Before she could analyze why this was, her brain got distracted by what an amazing ass she had.  \"I could really knock a guy out with this.\" she thought as she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus.\" her brain told her body.  \"Get to Batman.\" Tim's voice seemed to say internally.<br>\r\n\"Get to Batman and he'll love us.\" a more feminine voice corrected her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley was swaying beside her.<br>\r\n\"Iz dis going to take long?\" she asked Robin.<br>\r\n\"Mhmmm, he's SO worth it.\" Robin said, almost in an almost orgasmic voice.<br>\r\n\"Ya, I guesses.\" Harley said.<br>\r\n\"Good, she's losing interest, he's all mine.\" Robin's brain thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the girls spotted two bikers parked by the side of the road.  One had just finished taking a piss in the alley.<br>\r\n\"Hey Dave, check this out.\" one shouted.<br>\r\n\"Damn, well hello ladies.  What are two fine girls like you doing out on a night like this?\" Dave called as his friend gave a wolf whistle.<br>\r\nThe girls giggled.<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, we were just making out way to the other side of the city.\" Robin moaned, as the butterflies in her body began to heat up.<br>\r\n\"What'z she sayz.\" Harley cooed.<br>\r\n\"Don't you women know it's not safe to be out in this part of town alone?\" the biker asked.<br>\r\n\"Huh, ya, lots of crazy characters on Gotham's streets.\" Dave mentioned.<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're not afraid, as long as there's big strong men like you to keep us safe.\" Robin said, getting close enough to Dave that she could brush her hands on this huge thick arm.<br>\r\n\"Well, huh, huh...\" Dave tried to say something as Robin leaned into kiss him.  The two locked lips, as Dave wrapped his huge arms around her, causing Robin's heart to melt as they connected.  Even Dave's musk and sweat didn't bother her, in fact it made him more intriguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley did the same thing with the other biker, but within seconds, Harley and him were on the ground, getting more intimate than just a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's kiss stopped, she saw Dave step back, he was grasping his stomach.  Robin watched slowly as Dave's facial features began to alter.  He toppled over as his hips widened.  Robin looked down at her own hands.  During the kiss her hand shuffled around in Dave's front pocket, but she at least got a pair of keys out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the bike, and started the engine.  Harley looked back surprised, she was too into the moment that she forgot about Robin.  Robin went full throttle and raced down the streets.   \"This is bad.\" she thought.  If she couldn't stop herself from kissing a man, what would the girls with less willpower do?   The germination time seemed to be even faster to her victim than it was for her.  Of course she didn't notice this, her mind was on one thing, getting to the Caped Crusader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butterflies in her seemed to create a hurricane's worth of fluttering.  The wind hit her exposed torso as she raced through the streets.   Other drivers honked as she tried driving between them.  Her motor skills were off, he mind wasn't paying full attention to the road.  Her brain kept flashing to images of Batman's abs.  That and the vibrations of the bike felt unnaturally erotic to her reproductive parts.  She let out a moan as she swerved between lanes.  If she kept this up too much longer, she would probably end up in an accident.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alfred sat before the Batcave's main computer, viewing dozen's of screens that showed the cities activity for the night.<br>\r\n\"Sir, I thought I might bring to your attention that there are reports of a young woman dressed as Robin riding a bike through the city.\" Alfred reported to his boss out in the field.<br>\r\n\"Another copycat?\" asked Batman on his bat-tooth mobile communications device.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, however, I have not been able to communicate with young master Tim for the past 20 minutes.  And traffic cameras have her coming out from near the warehouse district that your son has been lost in.\"<br>\r\nBatman gave no response.<br>\r\n\"Police chatter says they pulled her over three minutes ago, but the cops went silence since.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me when you hear more.\"<br>\r\n\"One last thing, sir.  There has been an abnormal amount of young women wandering the streets tonight.\"<br>\r\nThere was silence on Batman's end.<br>\r\n\"It's just something I thought was worth mentioning.\" Alfred finished.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Alfred.\" Bruce reluctantly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut on a stone gargoyle, Batman hunched over, using vision enhancers in his mask to look around the city.  It wasn't unusual for Tim to go silent for hours as Robin, he was a young teenager, and smart enough to know when to keep radio silence.  His mind was more preoccupied with Alfred's mention of young women.  It's not something Alfred would mention unless there were hundreds more than usual.   Hundreds of young women on Gotham's streets in the dead of night were always part of some greater scheme.  His mind started calculating all of the potential scenarios that could arise from the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir. There has been reports from the police station, some sort of attack has been reported inside.\" Alfred said after a half hour of silence.<br>\r\n\"On my way!\" Batman growled as he sped six blocks to the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside there were dozens of girls in police uniforms.  Most of the uniforms were too large, but some had had the legs of the pants cut off to create miniscule shorts.   Some of Their police uniforms were tied around there breasts, making them look like strippers.  Others were just naked in the street.  There was a lot of giggling coming from the women.  A few were even making out with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some sort of prank?  No, cops would have arrested them by now.  Most likely transformation.  Some sort of ray-gun?  Possibly.  Airborne contagion? If so, I'm already infected.  Men turned into dumb women.  Brain receives minor damage as a process of transformation.  Clearly highly contagious.  Do not allow victims to touch me.\"  Commissioner James Gordon's office on third floor. Possibility that he locked himself in there.\"  Batman's brain thought int about two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe easiest way was up the old fire escape on the building next to the police office.  Batman quickly sped past the 'girls' and hopped to the third floor.   Through the window, he saw Gordon knocking back three women with a chair.<br>\r\n\"Back, all of you!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman took a device out of his utility belt, creating a subsonic screen used to break the glass.  He jumped through the broken window. Tossing three bat-concussion grenades that released a knockout gas.  The girls fell back against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gordon, what happened?\" Batman asked.<br>\r\n\"Two girls in traffic cop uniforms drove to the front here.  When one of the office personal tried to arrest them for impersonating officers, they kissed him.  He fell over sick.  We tried subduing the women, but when the fallen officer got back up, she infected the police who were holding the women down.  It spread quickly throughout the office like some sort of zombie plague.\" Gordon explained with a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right Commissioner?\" Batman asked.<br>\r\n\"No, get back.\" Gordon said as he threw himself towards the wall away from Batman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon's facial hairs started shedding on the ground, his skin becoming smoother, his face younger, his height shorted.  His his expanded, and his chest inflated.<br>\r\n\"Find a cure.\" her voice said as it raised in pitch.<br>\r\n\"Gordon! Fight it!\" Batman shouted.<br>\r\n\"Hmmhmm. \"Gordon said licking her lips.  \"Batman...I...I need you!\" she said as she lifted herself from the wall falling over in the attempt.  She continued to drag herself towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jim.\" Batman said as he threw a compact new over her.  She was too dangerous to let leave the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Batman to Alfred.  There has been an outbreak.  Lock-down procedure Alpha!  Do not let Robin in the cave.  I repeat, do not let Robin in the cave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, the clock entrance just opened!\" Alfred said.<br>\r\n\"Subdue Robin, but do not touch her!\"<br>\r\n\"Her!\" Alfred asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman already pieced most of the situation together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Robin?\" Bruce heard Alfred say over the device.<br>\r\nThere was a giggle, as some rustling could be heard.<br>\r\n\"Alfred?\" Batman asked, concern slipping through his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, sir.\" Alfred finally said after a long silence.  \"She is subdued at the moment, and tied to your operating table.<br>\r\nBatman felt a sense of relief leave his chest.<br>\r\n\"Who did this to you Robyn?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you if you give me a kiss sexy.\" Robin said.<br>\r\n\"After I receive my information, miss.\"<br>\r\n\"Harley kissed me.\" she finally said, after Alfred used his gloved fingers to in a walking motion over her exposed torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for Batman.  He figured out all he needed.  Harley was infected by something the Joker gave her.  Robin was in the warehouse district.  Joker would most likely be there.  Joker would have enough information and possibly a cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went straight away to the area.</span></div></div>",

The Joker prided himself in being chaotic, but the simple truth was that in his insanity, he followed a pattern of habits, including picking out abandoned warehouses with trap doors leading to underground tunnels, or to a quick seaside escape.  Using this knowledge, Batman was able to narrow down the Joker to one of three locations.  He found the hideout on his first attempt.  It was the warehouse with the lights on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman swung down from the rafters and kicked in the door to the Joker\u2019s office.<br>\r\n\u201cBatty.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d shouted Batman in a gravelly voice.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no.  This is all wrong.  Come back later when I\u2019m ready for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d Batman yelled, pinning the joker against the wall.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. Honest.  I haven\u2019t left this office for weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve unleashed a plague on this city.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?  Please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve snapped.  You\u2019d be so much less fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman threw a lamp through the window, and grabbed the Joker as he leaped onto a trash bin below.  Dragging the Joker, Batman took them both around the corner.  In the distance, three large breasted women came strolling down the dock.  Giggling with their voluptuous curves, and tattered clothes, that were too tight in the chest, and too loose everywhere else.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d the Joker said.<br>\r\n\u201cWatch.\u201d Batman said, as he held the Joker down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the corner, a homeless man walked up to the women.  The city was never short of homeless men.<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me ladies.  Do you have some change?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\nThe girls giggled.  \u201cNo, but we can give you something better.\u201d one replied.<br>\r\nShe grabbed the homeless man and gave him a kiss on the lips.  The man started coughing, until he clutched his gut, and fell on his side.  The metamorphosis consuming him, until another bubbly headed women stood up.  She laughed at the girls, and they split up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced Harley was patient zero.\u201d Batman said.<br>\r\n\u201cHow?  I just used the basic chemicals in my lab.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJoker.  You are going to show me exactly what you made before you sent Harley Quinn out into the streets.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, if you insist.  How can I say no to that face?\u201d Joker said, reaching his hand to pinch Batman\u2019s cheek.  Batman slapped it away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once that happens, and you return to your right frame of mind, then you can decide if you want to go through with the action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnalyzing sample.\u201d The computer read as the rest of Tim\u2019s blood was scanned by Bruce Wayne\u2019s state of the art one billion dollar computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably solution found.\u201d the computer said after an hour.<br>\r\nRobyn started grunting and moaning in the chair.<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems to be getting worse.\u201d Alfred thought to himself.<br>\r\n\u201cBatman. Come in.\u201d Alfred signaled through the computer.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Batman said.<br>\r\n\u201cI have put Robyn\u2019s blood into the computer, the results look promising, but it\u2019s only a partial result.  We\u2019d need to find the strain in its purest form in order to completely reverse the effects.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIn other words, we need to get a sample from Harley Quinn, patient zero.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShould I try the antidote on Robyn sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin moaned, and started talking dirty nonsense at the other end of the Batcave.<br>\r\n\u201cDo we know the side effects?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo sir. But, I fear young master\u2026Robyn, may be starting to deteriorate sir.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer a test subject first, but\u2026\u201d Batman was cut off by a loud crash.<br>\r\n\u201cSir?  Sir?!\u201d Alfred yelled, barely managing to keep his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred felt a sudden weight of guilt come over him.  He distracted his son, and now the Joker probably used that to attack and incapacitate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUngff.  More! I need to be filled.\u201d Robyn yelled.<br>\r\n\u201cI cannot bear to see you like this.\u201d Alfred said to his patient.  He looked down at the test results,  he had enough material to create a partial cure.  But he didn\u2019t know the side effects, or if it would even work.  It could even make things worse.<br>\r\n\u201cHard to imagine things being worse.\u201d Alfred said to himself.  For the first time in years, Alfred felt completely alone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To find out why you are feeling different, slowly lift your head and try and look at your feet.\u201d<br>\r\nTim looked and noticed two large mounds on her chest.  She tries to jump in shock, but found that her limbs were all secured to the table.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked nerviously.<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that when you were out, you were into some very kinky stuff.\u201d Alfred joked.<br>\r\n\u201cAlfred!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou were infected by rapidly mutating strain of what we believe to be Joker venom.  You contracted it from either Harley Quinzel or one of her victims.   It not only mutated her, but forced mutations to all that we believe to have been in contact with any of her bodily fluids\u2026sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is that I am a carrier?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou were a carrier.

He ordered Robyn to open her mouth and allow for a cotton swab to be entered, and then put it into the computer to analysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am going to ask you some questions, it is of the upmost importance that you answer honestly.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you feel different?\u201d<br>\r\nRobyn looked at her chest again. \u201cYes.\u201d she responded.<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI feel\u2026vulnerable.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstandable\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like I need someone to tell me I\u2019m pretty.\u201d Robyn interrupted.  \u201cI feel like there is an emptiness in my stomach that I need to fill.\u201d<br>\r\nAlfred waited a few seconds to make sure she had finished talking.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have the urge to kiss me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEw, no.

But it is of utmost importance that you find Harley Quinn, she is the patient zero of this epidemic.  If you are to retrieve her, or at least a sample of her fluids, whether it be spit, blood, or other, then I am certain that we will be able to deconstruct this virus and create a cure.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA complete cure.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPut it this way Master Robin, if we successful, you\u2019ll not need to fear laying eggs anytime soon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNext Christmas I\u2019m getting you a new joke book.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThing about jokes in this household, Master Bruce does not approve of them.

She fled, she couldn\u2019t be around him.   As she turned the corner, her mind started to wander.

The number of buxom girls wandering the streets was noticeably increasing.  \u201cIf this keeps up, A.R.G.U.S. will quarantine Gotham, or worse,\u201d he thought.  He was keeping an eye out for Robin, or Nightwing.  One of them might help him out.  Even the Joker could have his uses in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then he noticed her, Selina Kyle, the woman who loved him, some of the time.  Selina looked injured, walking towards a hoard of whores.  Batman swooped down, grabbed her, and quickly carried her into an open window before shutting it behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you literally swept me off my feet.  What\u2019s the occasion?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSelina, have you seen the Gotham tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the prostituted doing their million woman march.  All the cops are busy dealing with them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not quite what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\nSuddenly, Selina\u2019s head shot back in pain.<br>\r\n\u201cBruce!\u201d she cried.<br>\r\nBatman ran over.<br>\r\n\u201cYou seemed injured when I picked you up. What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBruce, I\u2026\u201d Selina grabbed him and pulled herself up for a kiss.  Their lips locked.  Batman pulled back, but it was too late.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d Selina started to giggle like a girl hiding a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman stood still, stunned, as his mind raced with thoughts.  He pieced together what happened.  The change would come soon, it would be inevitable.<br>\r\n\u201cHarley.  She did this\u2026sexy.\u201d Selina said before breaking out in a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so close.  The time it took someone to change, Selina\u2019s mental effects, probably followed shortly by her physical ones, meant that Harley would have had to infect her less than five minutes ago.   Harley was unable to use a vehicle in her condition.  This meant that she had to be less than a hundred yards from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman opened a pouch on his utility belt, and popped a pill he designed to slow down his metabolism.  It was meant to be used if he was injected with poison, but hopefully, this would slow down the effects.  Selina\u2019s hips and breasts began to grow, along with her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes the Bat want to pet the sexy pussy\u2026cat?\u201d Selina said seductively.<br>\r\n\u201cMust focus.\u201d Batman said as he turned from her and burst through the door, out onto the street.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sexy.\u201d About a dozen voices greeted him as moved away from Selina.<br>\r\n\u201cGet Harley\u2019s blood, bring it to Alfred.\u201d Batman thought to himself over and over.  With any luck, his mental commands would stick with him even after the transformation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Harley\u2019s Harlequin Jester costume should have stood out, even in this mess.  His suit started to feel heavy.  \u201cNo.\u201d he said.  He could feel the bones reshaping themselves, the breasts starting to inflate on his chest.  All he had to do was get a sample of Harley Quinn\u2019s blood.  His hips began to widen.  \u201cAh.\u201d He let out a moan.   The male organs retreated into a newly formed slit, and her cries of pain began to come in a higher pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still have my brain for now,\u201d she thought, \u201cGet Harley\u2019s blood, bring it to Alfred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou.\u201d said a voice behind her.  \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be safe in my office while I deal with this mess.\u201d<br>\r\nShe turned around.  \u201cSorry.\u201d she said.

I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d<br>\r\nJoker actually paused for a moment, and thought about finally being dominant on his archenemy.  Then he remembered that he\u2019d end up worse than the Robyn girl, and shook loose from the fantasy. <br>\r\n\u201cNot like this, Bat-bimbo.\u201d he said as he slapped her across the face.  She landed harshly on the pavement.<br>\r\n\u201cBut pudding, I like it rough,\u201d she said with a laugh.<br>\r\n\u201cNo. You do not get to call me that!\u201d he said as he kicked her in the stomach.  The suit absorbed most of the force.<br>\r\n\u201cMore.\u201d she said as he continued kicked.<br>\r\nJoker couldn\u2019t believe it, even in her condition, she seemed to be playing him.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re worthless.  You know what you did?!  You ruined it!  We had this whole city in our hands.  Our own eternal playground for your gothic comedy,\u201d he said as he grabbed her by the neck and began to choke her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be enjoying that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not Batman. You\u2019re a grotesque parody of him.  You stupid, stupid girl.  You had to be infected by my plague.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Joker thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy plague\u2026my plague.  This started because of that idiot Harley.  But I had a part.\u201d He realized.<br>\r\nHe released his grip on her neck and slowly stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had won.  He had beaten the Batman.  He had made her smile, made her laugh.  But it meant nothing.  She wasn\u2019t laughing with him.  She didn\u2019t even know what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay there Bat-bitch.

Harley is nearby.\u201d Bruce managed to say as she returned her cowl to the proper position, before giggling uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker looked around at the chaos engulfing his city.

Harley you harlot, where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ground of ladies were rolling over each other, using their mouths for all sorts of things beside eating food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do that?!\u201d Joker asked in surprise.<br>\r\n\u201cWe can show you sexy.\u201d One said, as the others around him started saying sexy like an erratic echo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker ran to the next building entrance, thinking what a cruel joke the world played on him.  His greatest foe, his reason for crime, was reduced the one of the brain-dead women who seemed to be multiplying on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to find you Harley!\u201d he shouted in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey pudding.\u201d said a weak voice through an open doorway of a jewelry shop.  He had trained his ears to hear it.  He slid in through the entrance and closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarley, my darling!  Come here and give me your blood!\u201d he said in a welcoming manner.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sexy.  I didn\u2019t get the Batman like you wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh never mind that. Believe me, that\u2019s all taken care of.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo you mean we can, you know\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Harley, my little gesture queen of romantic gestures.  We can do that all night long.  But first, I just need something a drop of blood.   Maybe I\u2019ll get it from creating a smile on that pretty face of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m smiling, sexy.\u201d she said.<br>\r\n\u201cNo Harley, you\u2019re pouting.  Don\u2019t feel bad, I know that you can\u2019t tell the difference in your current state.  Although I doubt you could tell the difference before all this happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker leaned over her, about to grab the knife from his inside jacket pocket, only to find that it was missing.  Replaced by a tube of lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is embarrassing.\u201d he said, seeing that he was too late to back away from Harley, who had managed to wrap her arms around him and pull herself in for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmhmmmhmmm\u201d the Joker murmured as he tried to pull her off him.  Their lips seemed to be air locked.  Finally Harley relented, and released her grip, and Joker sent her falling to the floor.<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it woman.  I always knew you\u2019d be the end of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley looked confused.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Mr. Jay?  Don\u2019t you feel better?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?  It\u2019s inevitable.  My greatest joke is this atrocity I played on myself.  And now there\u2019s no one left to laugh,\u201d he sighed, as he walked over to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight as well enjoy the show.  It\u2019s a miserable farewell to such a great player.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all the other victims, he could feel his bones start to morph and take shape.  His breasts swelled as his hips widened.  \u201cThat kind of tickles.\u201d he said, before starting a low laugh, which eventually got louder.\u201d  Soon the voice became that of a woman\u2019s, her laughter echoing through the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the pancake make-up seems a bit campy now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStill got it. Ms. Jay\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but for what, another thirty seconds, a minute if I\u2019m lucky?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Jay\u2019s thoughts began to think of Batman, not the pathetic mockery of Batman that creature on the street was, but the original Batman, the one with chiselled abs and strong chin.   She imagined him stopping her latest crime, throwing her onto her back, and humping her criminal nature out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, there was no strong Bat-Adonis here.  Harley would have to do.<br>\r\n\u201cYou look sexy girl.\u201d she said, and immediately after, the two began making out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were going at it so hard that they didn\u2019t even notice a point end prick Harley\u2019s neck until after it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood going Joker.\u201d the woman said.  She looked behind and saw a girl dressed as Robyn, and a woman dressed as Batman.<br>\r\n\u201cYou distracted her. Now we can get the sample to the\u2026um\u2026Bat-computer.\u201d Bat-bimbo said.<br>\r\nRobin giggled.  \u201cIt comes and goes, they\u2019re brain\u2026um\u2026brain\u2026uh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBrain-forts.\u201d Bat-Bimbo said.<br>\r\n\u201cBrain-farts.\u201d Robyn corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Joker fell down laughing hysterically at the Joke.  After Joker left Batman, Robyn had found her mentor, and stuck her with the same partial antidote that Alfred had used on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Joker.  I\u2019ll let you do my make-up if you come to the station with me.\u201d Robyn said.<br>\r\nThe Joker kept laughing, as they dragged her off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Robyn on the other hand was still noticeably female.  She had cut her hair down to a manageable size, and had most of her mental abilities returned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce deduced that the return to normal had been caused by two major factors.  One was that Tim was infected longer than he was, so his body started to stabilize the changes that were made.   The second major factor was that Tim Drake wasn\u2019t quite finished puberty, so his body was more accepting of physical and mental changes that Bruce\u2019s was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce looked as his adopted son, who was temporarily his adopted daughter.  The girl had missed about a month of school and had to be home taught by Alfred.  Her reversion back to being male was slower, but it was happening.  Her breasts were shrinking a cup-size a week, and her shoulders were getting noticeably more broad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nails were painted red, the same shade that was on her uniform, and she was also wearing matching lipstick.  Her mind was clearly not male.  Still, she was acing all of her home subjects, and Bruce didn\u2019t want Alfred to accuse him of being sexist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, you can go out and patrol tonight.  But be back in three hours.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOnly three hours?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine, four.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, you\u2019re the best,\u201d she said as she hugged him, giving him a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\nShe ran towards one of the cave exits before Bruce could change his mind.  She was wearing the old Robin costume, the one that showed off her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWomen and their legs.\u201d Bruce thought, as he got back to trying to solve the mystery of a missing ancient tablet of transmogrification.  Gotham was getting weirder every year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the Gotham skyline, Nightwing was laying back on a gargoyle after just stopping a bank robbery, which seemed to be the pastime of half of Gotham\u2019s criminals.  He was young, the night was young, he thought about celebrating by going to a club.  Any club that wasn\u2019t owned by the Penguin or crime families loved having him there, and would usually wave all fees and costs for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d Robyn said, appearing behind him.<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRobyn.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell Batman has been training you well.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFeels like it\u2019s been a lot longer.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen or heard from you for a month.

It\u2019s a compliment.  Fit women are really gorgeous.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that.\u201d she said blushing.  Her mind was clearly feeling some after effects from the transformation.  She needed to be held, and no one at Wayne manor was offering to do that for her.<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m not going to be here for too much longer.  I have to go soon, and the regular Robin will be back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s too bad. I think you and him would get along.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I think I\u2019d embarrass him,\u201d she said, as she subtly touched his arm.<br>\r\nNightwing had picked up enough women to know where this was heading.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was going to call this and early night,\u201d he said.<br>\r\nRobyn looked disappointed.<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026But how about you and I go to a club just down the street from her.  We can dance, have a good time, and see where that leads.\u201d<br>\r\nRobyn smiled, she couldn\u2019t stop blushing.  Dick was so handsome and fit, and he was taking an interest in her.  Her eyes lowered to see Nightwing\u2019s pants were tightening a bit.  He was into her to!<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said twirling her hair, \u201cBut don\u2019t tell Batman.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI never do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two swung off the building as they raced towards the line-up outside the club.  It was just another quiet night in Gotham, thanks to her, and Robyn the Bimbo Wonder was about to live up to her name.  For the next few days at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a cell of Arkham Asylum, the Joker laid on his back, watching a news clip of Nightwing and a familiar looking pop up on the television.  Someone caught Robyn making out with Nightwing on the rooftop, and taped the event with their cellphone.  He laughed to himself, the joke may not have been on the Bat-Bimbo, but Bird Boy was going to be in for a surprise when she reverted to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the great thing about being the Joker, he could find the humour in any little victories her could get.   He took out a pack of playing cards and started playing solitaire as his mind hatched an escape plan.  He just had to break out of here and tell Nightwing who the new girl was.  The whole failed plague was still giving him a chance to tell one last joke.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The silver-age villain with the ray-gun that made Lois Lane fat! <br>\r\nDoctor Adipose is back with the invention he's been working on for the past three years, since he used his ray-gun to turn Lois into a BBW. And yes, he does think of it as turning women into BBWs, since he is a fat admirer and a chubby chaser and a feeder. Why else would he be spending so much of his genius on ways to make women fat? Hell, none of his transformations are even harmful, since he specifically makes the target healthier at the same time! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, this time, he's moving to Gotham. He's tired of living in a city with Superman, who turns his ray-gun to reverse the very next day. Instead, he's moving to Gotham, where the city is so full of crime that his harmless little scheme to make the city's women start getting fat will be left alone for long enough to enjoy. Maybe even left alone forever, if he helps the Bat-Family to catch their enemies, by having Gotham's female villains all getting too fat to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, under a new identity, Doctor Adipose opened a television studio: cooking shows, and sitcoms, and news programs. All of it is high quality, fat friendly programming. And all of it is completely harmless by itself... But as soon as it started to air, little bits of hypnotic suggestion started to take place, making all of Gotham start to change the way they think about gaining weight. Gradually, Gotham will start to become a city of BBW feedees, and fat admirers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more of the shows that air, the more ingrained the ideas become, making Gotham's idea of the 'normal' weight for women fatter and fatter. The more of the shows that air, the more of his fat-ray's affects take place, making it easier and easier to gain weight and stay healthy. And, the more of his shows that air, the more Gotham in general will start to promote this message of fat-admiration on their own. Gotham's rich and famous citizens will start to promote fat admiring to the world...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Batman has been involved in many fantastic stories and boasts a historic legacy, but in this interactive story, the dark knight finds himself in a collection of bizarre stories of transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it is not just Batman who endures these transformations. The Birds of Prey were also subject to these strange scenarios, and even the dark knight's rogue gallery, including Catwoman, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn, have a few problems of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything can happen in this interactive story. Does Catwoman tranform into an actual cat? Does Harley Quinn swap bodies with the Joker? Does Batman regress to the age of eight years again? Or does the Huntress expands into a blueberry? It is up to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can begin this interactive story however, you must first understand the following rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. If any addition to the story is unsatisfactory to me I will edit. Please do not take offense by this, but at least improve your grammar, and at least think of a good title for your addition!<br>\r\n2. No Death, Killing or Suicide, unless it is permitted.<br>\r\n3. If you wish, feel free to create your own character, but be sure to provide a suitable origin and description.<br>\r\n4. This is strictly a Batman story. Although the story doesn't necessarily have to feature Batman himself, please keep the story in Gotham city.<br>\r\n5. No other character from the DC universe, including Superman, Wonder Woman and the Flash, can be introduced, or even referenced, unless permitted otherwise.<br>\r\n6. Shrinking, growing, weight gaining, age regression and any other form of transformation is encouraged.<br>\r\n7. Fetishes are approved, but please, nothing too graphic (penetration, etc.), and nothing too humorous (farts, etc.)<br>\r\n8. I'd prefer it if these transformation stories don't effect the main plot in the Batman universe. So please avoid making permanent changes, unless a some kind of sequel where the character has a chance to return to normal is hinted. Think of each story as an unaired TAS episode!<br>\r\n9. Try your best not to reveal the identity of Batman, Robin, or any other masked character, unless permitted otherwise.<br>\r\n10. Homosexuality is permitted, as long as it isn't too graphic. Pedophilia however, is strictly prohibited.<br>\r\n11. Be sure to keep an eye on this page for any new rules and regulations.</td>",
