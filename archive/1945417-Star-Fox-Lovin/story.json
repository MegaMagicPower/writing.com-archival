When you got closer and closer, though, you started to try and walk ''more proffesionally''. You notice a panel sliding from the ship, giving you entrance to the ship.

Wolf said, as he reached out his hand, wanting to shake your hand. ''T-thank you, sir.'' you say, as you shake Wolf's hand. You notice Wolf's height, he is around 2 heads higher than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf turns around, and walks into the ship. ''Let's go to our base of operations, first.'' he said, as he moved forward, and explained some things about the ship in advance while you followed and listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came to the control room, and quickly noticed all the levers, buttons and switches on the ship. Looks like it's gonna be hard to master. You gulp. Wolf has seemed to notice. ''Hm? Oh, does the machinery look complicated? It may be hard in the beginning, but you'll get the hang of it.'' he said. You nod. ''All right, then.'' you say. ''Hey, Ray, do you mind flipping that switch over there?'' Wolf asked, as he began sitting in the flyer's seat. You bent forward, and flipped the switch, but you forgot you had baggy jeans on, making your pants lower a bit, revealing some of your boxer shorts and a good look of your butt. You quickly stood up again and held your pants up again. You hope he did not see it. You look over to Wolf to investigate, to see him looking for something under the dashboard of the plane. I guess you were lucky this time. ''Ah, there is the starting module.'' Wolf said, as he picked up an cylinder-shaped thing, and inserted it into an circle sized slot. You heard everything starting. ''Well, come on, have a seat.'' he said. You sat down, and looked in front of you. You notice Wolf pressing buttons, flipping switches and every move seems to confuse you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, the ship blasted itself in space. You were amazed. After a few light years of flying, which lasted around half an hour, Wolf suddenly stopped. ''This is Star Wolf HQ, Ray.'' he said. You look around you, but notice nothing at all. ''What? I don't see anything.'' you said. You suddenly heard Wolf snapping his fingers, and out of nowhere, an giant spaceship uncloacked itself from invisibility. You looked amazed. Wolf chuckles. ''Pretty amazing, huh?'' Wolf said. ''Y-yeah..'' you said. The ship took you in, and cloacked itself with invisibility again. Wolf lands neatly, and you both leave the ship. You notice a lot of people coming up to Wolf, complaining. ''Sir, where were you?! We need you right now!'' one of the crew members said. ''Quiet!'' Wolf snapped. Everything went completely silent. See, this is why Wolf is so scary. ''I am just trying to show our rookie the way around here. Is it urgent?'' Wolf asked. ''Y-yes, sir..'' the crew member said, with a frightened voice. You notice Wolf sighing. ''All right, then. Someone, please show the rookie the way around here.'' Wolf commanded. ''I will.'' someone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the certain person standing up is..</span></div></div>",

''Perfect, show this rookie the way, will ya, Panther?'' Panther nodded. You noticed Wolf doing gestures towards Panther, though, but he did not seem to care that much. You notice Wolf looking kind of angry when Caroso walked away with you. Man, Panther is pretty coureagous for standing up against Wolf himself. ''All right, what's your name, Rookie?'' Panther asked. ''Uh.. I'm Ray Azarus. It's an honor meeting you, Panther Caroso.'' you said. ''What? You seem to be the first person that's ''honored'' to meet me, I'm actually kind of flattered.'' Panther said, as he blushed. ''Well, anyway. This here is the engine room..''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Panther both walked all over the ship, which seemed to be like walking kilometres, because the ship is so darned huge. You listened to everything he had to say, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''And, here we are at the Recruit rooms. Yours is here. Panther said, as he gave you the key to your new recruit room. ''There you go. You can have a day off today, but tommorow you're gonna have to work. Any questions?'' Panther asks. ''Uhm, yeah.. what are my tasks tommorow?'' you ask. ''Well, someone of us is going to teach you how to fly and how to manege your ship.'' Panther said. ''All right. I'll guess I'll see you sometime then, maybe.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your apartment, and closed the door behind you. Oh, wow. This is pretty big for ''just an recruitment room''. You investigate your apartment and get everything in order. Unpacking your clothes and such. You look at the clock and notice it's already past midnight. You better get to sleep, because you're gonna need to be fresh tommorow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started undressing yourself, as you liked sleeping nude. You left your old clothes on the ground and you step into bed, and fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

You guess you'll just grow into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door and notice Panther Caroso in front of it, leaning against the wall. ''Oh, good morning Ray.'' Panther said. ''Oh.. uhm.. Good morning to you too, sir. Do you know what my schedule for today is?'' you ask. ''Yeah, I am the scheduler here, I give every unit his schedule of the day. The information is available on his or her computer trough our own system, but I came to tell you personally.'' Panther said. ''Oh, th-that's nice..'' you stutter.

''Well, no.. but knowing Wolf I may have a hunch myself, and I have to say I'm somewhat happy but concerned as well.'' Panther said. ''W-what? Y-you're c-concerned?'' you say, kind of scared. ''Don't worry, it's just a hunch. All right, follow me, Ray.'' Panther said, as he walked away. You gulp, and follow Panther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a lot of walking and elevator traveling, you come to the deck, and you notice Wolf indeed standing there, waiting for you. You gulp. You were kind of nervous again. ''All right, Ray. Good luck with the lessons.'' Panther said. ''Th-thanks, Sir Caroso..'' you stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to Wolf, and try to act normal. You look up to him. Man, still very tall. ''G-good morning, sir!'' you say. ''Good morning, private Ray. I'll be your teacher in the Arwing flying lessons, all right?'' he says. ''A-all right.'' you say. Wolf walked into the ship and cockpit, and you followed. ''Well, take a seat, private. And listen well.'' Wolf said, as he pointed to the ''flyer's seat''. You nod, and you sit down in the flyer's seat. Wolf sat down next to you in the co-pilot seat. ''Now then.. we'll start with the engines..'' he said, as he handed you the module to start the Arwing. You take it from his hand, and insert the module into the circle sized slot, and heard the engine running. ''All right.. first off.. we'll begin with..'' Wolf said, as an long explanation started from the engines itself to the rear exhaust. You learned how to fly, and flied already a little in space, fired the main weapons, and knew how to manuever. Even though you haven't fully mastered the barrel roll yet. ''All right, we can return to the base now.'' Wolf said, as he tapped a screen, and the radar went on. You notice a blue dot and a red dot on the radar. ''That's weird.. wait a minute..'' Wolf said, as he took control of the ship, turned around and noticed another Arwing from a distance, making haste to flee. ''Darned Star Fox! Have they sent spies on us?'' he said frustrated, as he tried to chase the ship, but the other ship getting away. ''Damnit, it got away..'' Wolf said. ''S-sir, who exactly are these people?'' you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, right.. I guess I do owe you an explanation now, don't I?'' Wolf said. ''Kinda.. not if you want to, but I would kind of like to know about your past, and maybe something about yourself while you're at it, maybe?'' you ask. Wolf blushes. ''You're.. Well, it starts like this..''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf started talking a bit about himself and how he first was hired to eliminate Star Fox, and all of the things that happened in the last few years. You listened with great interest. Wolf is actually a pretty cool guy, and he even saved his own rival once. While you were at it, you told something about yourself too, even though there was not really a lot to tell. Time flew by, and you have to say, you kinda like Wolf now, he always seemed pretty scary.. yet he is somewhat.. sweeter than you expected him to be. After the conversation fell still after a while, Wolf said it might be time to go back to the base. You agreed, and you both went back to base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arwing landed in the main deck, and you both left the Arwing. ''Well, Ray, I hope you understand everything now, any questions? I still have important business to attend to, but..'' Wolf said. ''Nothing in particular, sir. Anything I need to do for today or might you need some help, sir?'' you ask. ''Ray, I don't call you private for a reason, you can just call me Wolf, all right? And no, you have nothing else scheduled for the day, and I don't need any help. Thanks for the concerns, though.'' Wolf said. ''A-all right, Si-- I mean.. Wolf.'' you stutter. Almost did it again.. your manners can be annoying sometimes. Wolf smiles, ''All right, then. I'll be leaving. Have a nice day, Ray.'' Wolf said, as he wandered off. You looked at Wolf walking away, and noticed his tail wagging. You grin. You also couldn't help yourself looking at Wolf's ass, he walked so elegantly with it, and.. oh god, boner.. can't walk around with a boner, can't.. you quickly made haste to your room, trying to relax and act like nothing's happening with the bulge in your pants. You close the door behind you, Man, another day passed here.. and man, what a day. You think you even made friends with the boss himself, Wolf. You feel pretty proud of yourself. You were pretty tired, though.. it really is kind of late. You guess you just head for bed again. You undress yourself again and went to bed, and quickly dozed off.</span></div></div>",

There's a lot of nice people for a group of mercenaries, and scouting the area is pretty fun, altough you've spotted the same Arwing you saw with Wolf before more and more..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay in bed, still snoozing, when suddenly you heard an explosion. You woke up shocked at the sound of the explosion, and heard a voice on the speaker saying, ''Requesting all Arwing units to defend our base, repeat, requesting all Arwing units to defend our base!'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe base was getting attacked! You quickly put on your clothes, and hurried to the Arwing main deck. You notice every pilot hurrying to their Arwing, and Wolf too. You hurry to your ship and start it. You flew off to see almost at least 20 other Arwings. Luckily, you were at an advantage of 30. You assualted the ships, and tried to take them down, or chase them away, also maneuvering their shots a bit. The battle was fierce, but you noticed them fleeing one before one, and finally noticed all of them retreating. You sure were relieved. You wanted to return to the headquarters, but you noticed a Arwing of Star Wolf giving chase to the enemy Arwing's. You connect to the communication radio of the Arwing giving chase. ''What are you doing?! They're retreating! We're fine, come back!'' you say. No response. You heard Panther Caroso on your radio. ''Ray, what is wrong?'' he asks. ''One of our people is still giving chase. Go after him?'' you ask. ''Damn.. Wolf, not again.. All right, Ray, I need your help, chase after Wolf.'' he said. ''Roger that.'' You answered, as you gave chase to the Arwing of Wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Man.. Wolf is stubborn..'' you say. ''Don't let Wolf hear that, pal. Anyway, he's not replying to me, either.. Damn, this rivalry is gonna be his death.'' Panther said. You look at the Arwings, and suddenly noticed one taking a U-turn to get in Wolf's back. ''Crap! Wolf's in trouble! Ray, you try to keep the Arwings busy, I will try to help Wolf.'' Panther commanded. ''Roger.'' you say, as you flew off to distract the arwings. You managed to succesfully distract the Arwings, and they are giving chase to you. However, after a while, you noticed that the Arwings suddenly go back, to Wolf's ship. ''Panther! They're headed for you!'' you say. You see Panther's ship getting shot at, and Panther just barely escaped the crossfire. ''Ray, I can't help you anymore, you'll have to do this yourself. Try to keep them busy until the other pilots arrive!'' Panther said, as he flew off into the headquarters direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 Arwings you need to distract and saving Wolf.. you wonder if this really was the best job for you to take part in.. You tried to distract the Arwings, although not really anyone is reacting, as they're focused on Wolf. This is bad, Wolf can't dodge all this crossfire.. You notice his ship breaking apart piece after piece. You started shooting the Arwings desperately, and one after one retreated. But in this rate, Wolf's ship will definitely--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you heard the sound of screaking metal and parts of the ship breaking loose. That's it.. you can't try to desperately watch and shoot the arwings anymore. You were going in. You couldn't care less if you died here or not, you wanted to save Wolf, no, you HAD to. They're going down. You took a full speed boost in one arwing, knocking the arwing into two other Arwings. All the attention seemed to be up to you at the moment. 2 Arwings left for repairing, with 4 left to battle. You started shooting the Arwings one for one while covering Wolf's ship. One after another retreated with Wolf's help. You finally fend them all of but one. You tried to shoot it, but you couldn't just hit the darned thing. You tried to shoot and shoot, but noticed the enemy Arwing suddenly manuevering behind you, taking a final shot at Wolf's ship, letting it explode. You watched the explosion from afar of Wolf's ship. Wolf is.. dead..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt this burning feeling inside. You were thrown into a rage. You started shooting the ship at the finest accuaracy you could manege, and hit the fellow pretty hard. You managed to critically hit the Arwing enemy, and noticed him retreating. That fucker isn't getting away. You wanted to give chase when you noticed something fairly next to you. It was Wolf who was unconciously leaviating in space. You let the Enemy Arwing go, and opened the shaft of your ship for a while and catch Wolf in it. You close the hatch again, and quickly fly off out of distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped the Arwing, and quickly went out of the flyer's seat to Wolf. You checked for his vital signs. You could hear him breathing, but faintly. You guess you need to give him air.. this is awkward.</span></div></div>",

''Come on, Wolf.. Don't leave me like this.'' You gave him more air, and he seemed to regain conscious. You notice Wolf faintly opening his eyes, noticing you. You quickly backed off. ''Ray.. what are you..'' Wolf mumbled. ''You were unconscious and out of air. Are you okay?'' you ask. ''W-well.. yeah.. I..'' Wolf mumbled. ''Good.. then..'' you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached out as far as you could and slappen Wolf into the face. ''WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT, WOLF?'' you yell. Wolf looks surprised and frowns. ''I.. I..'' Wolf stutters. ''Carelessly giving chase, not responding to the radio.. don't you ever FUCKING do that again! I was worried, you know!'' you yell. Wolf started sitting up. ''I.. I'm sorry, Ray. I have been careless..'' he says, as his ears just flatten on his head, with his sorry looking face. Man, this made you feel kinda bad..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of no reason at all, you just hug Wolf. ''Sorry, Wolf.. I was just.. worried..'' you say. Wolf seems very surprised, but just hugs you back. ''I'm sorry.. I won't do it again.. I promise.'' Wolf says. ''Good..'' you say, as you let go, and kind of carry Wolf into the co-pilot seat. ''You just relax.. We're going back to the base.'' you say, as you flew off to the headquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed your ship in the main deck, and you let Wolf lean on your shoulder, while you both exit the Arwing. You notice Panther Caroso. ''Fuck, what happened?'' Panther said. ''I'll explain later, let's just get him to medical care.'' you say. Panther also lend an hand, and you three went to the Medical assistance, greeted by a nurse. ''Oh my.. Wolf, let's get you a room fast.'' the nurse says. You walk into the nearest room, and carefully let Wolf onto the bed. ''All right, Wolf.. you just rest now.'' you say. Wolf nods softly. ''Thank you, Ray.. and Panther..'' he says softly. ''We'll need to get busy with Mr. O' Donnell right away, gentlemen.. if you would leave. ''Okay then, miss Teraye. We'll be going now..'' Panther said. ''Yeah..'' you say. You both walked off, and a lot of medical assistance was called to help Wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Looks like you got away unscathed, Panther..'' you say. ''Yeah.. can't say the same about Wolf.. what happened now exactly?'' Panther asks. ''Well..'' you started, as you gave an explanation to what's happened to Panther, while you both walked off to the rooms. ''Well.. shit. Sadly that asshole got away, huh?'' Panther said. ''Yeah.. at least Wolf is still safe.'' you say. ''You do care about him, don't you?'' Panther asks. ''Well, I guess, kinda..'' you answer. Panther grins. ''Looks like you were a good guy for him after all..'' Panther says. ''What?'' you ask confused. ''Nothing.. heh heh.. welp, it's getting late. You should be heading to bed.'' Panther said. ''Oh, right.. sure..'' you say, as you see Panther walking away into his room. ''Good night, Ray.'' he says. ''Good night, Panther..'' you say, as you wandered off into your room. You quickly undressed and head for bed, and quickly dozed off.</span></div></div>",

You quickly turn on the computer to check your daily schedule. Scouting around the area, huh? Well, you can't have action everyday, and you already had enough for a week since yesterday.. especially when Wolf got hurt.. You feel like you need to check in with him again, to see if he's all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of your room and walked to the medical care center of the headquarters. ''Hello, here for Wolf, I assume? He recovered and can be here any second now.'' the nurse said. You wait around for a while, looking around when you suddenly saw Wolf standing next to you. ''Wha?!'' Out of shock you jumped and lost your balance, making you fall. Wolf chuckles. ''Sorry, I couldn't help it, come on, stand up.'' Wolf said, as he reached out his hand to you. You blush, and take on his hand, letting him pull you up. ''Th-thanks..'' you say. ''No, you thanks. For saving my life.'' Wolf said, with a gentle smile on his face. ''Yeah.. no problem.'' you say shyly. ''Hey, could I ask you to come to my room in the evening later on? I want to.. talk, to you.'' Wolf asked. ''Oh, uhm.. s-sure.. Why exactly?''  you ask. ''You'll find out then. Anyway, you're a great addition to the team, and maybe even more than that.'' he says. ''What?'' you say confused. ''Nothing.'' Wolf said, as he walks away, wagging his tail yet again, and his elegantly ass movement.. oh, there your dick goes again, not now, damnit, you just make haste to your Arwing to prevent awkward situations again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of the day scouting, and no threat besides some tiny meteor bits were found. Luckily those Star Fox guys didn't show up anymore.. hopefully. You still wonder what all this fuss is about, with Panther and Wolf being so mysterious.. more like mysteriously annoying. You noticed the ship's time, and just returned to the base again. You return to the main deck, to find it awfully quiet around here. Usually there are still the engineers repairing the ships, but they are suddenly gone.. You shrug. They probably took a day off. You walk around the hallways. Still not people here. What is going on..? You notice Panther in the hallway. ''Hey, Panther.. what's up? Where's everyone?'' you ask. ''Oh, you didn't hear? Everybody's got an off day, but they have to be in their rooms.'' Panther answered. ''What? But I still had an schedule for today..'' you say. ''Oh, that? Yeah, uhm.. That was for yesterday, but then the attack came. wolf said you were early up, so you might've missed the ''day-off'' schedule.'' Panther said. ''Darnit..'' you say. ''Well, anyway.. I'm off to Wolf's place, he invited me over.'' you say. ''Ohh, Wolfy's invited you over~?'' Panther said. ''What? Why are you..'' you ask. Panther grinned and cut you off. ''Don't worry, just hush and go. I'll be on my way too.'' Panther said. You watch Panther quickly walk away at a fast pace. Man, you were wrong about Panther.. he IS kinda weird too.. You shrug off the feeling, and you walk over to Wolf's room. You were pretty nervous, but you didn't really know why. You take a deep breathe to calm down, and exhale it. You knock on Wolf's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it opens, you notice..</span></div></div>",

I've been expecting you..'' Wolf said, while romantically glaring at you, followed by a wink. You blush heavily. Oh my god.. his body.. it's amazing.. you were amazed. ''Y-you were..?'' you stutter. ''Calm down, skunky~, and come in..'' Wolf said, putting his arm behind you, pulling you close to him, while closing the door behind you. 'W-Wolf.. I..'' you blush. ''What is it..?'' he asks.

I mean, we skunks aren't the nicest smelling fellows..'' you say. ''That is one of the reasons I like you.. Your fragrance smells amazing. Besides, you are sweet and kind, with a light touch of shyness.. That is already very cute.'' Wolf said. You blush. ''R-really?'' you ask. ''Yeah, really.. now, my question is if you want to be my special someone.. will you be mine?'' he asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I-I'm.. I'm yours.'' you say with full confidence. ''Perfect..''

You put everything off, and teased Wolf a bit by slowly sliding down your underwear.. ''Stop teasing me, and give me that skunky butt already..'' Wolf said. You pulled of your underwear, and jumped onto bed, kneeling and bending forward, so Wolf can get a good look of your ass. ''Come and get it, wolfy..'' you say, while you shake your ass a bit to tease Wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf grins, walks forward and joined you on the bed. He put his face between your buttocks, taking a good smell, and grabbing both your buttocks to squeeze in them. ''Hmm.. even better than I imagined.. smells great..'' he says. You clenched your buttocks together, and farted in Wolf's face. ''S-sorry.. that was probably a bit of a cockblock, wasn't it?'' you say. ''No.. actually, this makes me feel much hornier..'' Wolf said. You felt relieved. Luckily he has a fetish for this..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt Wolf's wet warm tongue licking your anus. ''Ohh.. Wolfy..'' you moan. Wolf grins, and penetrates your anus with his tongue. You felt him licking every side he could reach, satisfying you greatly with each lick. ''O-oh.. you're good at th-this..'' you moan. Wolf grins. ''I'm a natural, baby..'' he says, squeezing your buttocks. Man.. this feels great.. you still can't believe you're having sex with your idol, and that he is in love with you.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Wolf taking his tongue out of your anus. ''There.. it's wet enough..'' Wolf said. ''Heh.. now the good part comes.'' you say. You look behind you and notice Wolf putting his dick between your buttocks, hotdogging it between them. ''You've got such a soft little rump.. I love it..'' he says. You grin. ''Well, my ass is the best quality there is.. you've made a good choice.'' you say. ''Definitely..'' Wolf says, slapping your ass. You felt him taking his dick away from your buttocks, and suddenly felt him pentrate your anus at high speed. ''Hmm.. Nice and tight..'' he says. ''Virgin?'' he asks. ''Yeah..'' you say. ''Heh.. you're no different from me then, eh?'' he said, and started continiusly humping. ''Ahh, Wolf.. please.. harder..'' you moan. You felt Wolf's meat sliding in and out faster and faster, and felt his ballsack slapping against your ass. You heard Wolf moaning. You couldn't blame him, this felt great. You couldn't help but love it. Wolf started humping faster and furiouslier, and it felt even greater and greater every thrust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of humping, you felt like cumming and heard Wolf gasping; ''I'm.. I'm gonna cum, Ray.. get ready..'' Wolf said. You started cumming all over the bed, while you also felt Wolf lettin his semen stream throughout your ass. You felt Wolf taking his penis out of your ass, and laid straight out onto bed, exhausted. You started to lay down on bed as well. You look at Wolf, and cuddle up against him. ''Th-thanks.. that was great..'' you say. ''Yeah.. heh.. I always expected you to be bottom though.'' he says. ''Shut up..'' you say. Wolf chuckles, and hugged you too. ''Well, it's late and I'm getting kind of sleepy.. so.. good night, Ray..'' he says. ''Good night, Wolf..'' you say, as you cuddle up against Wolf, and you both fall to sleep.</span></div></div>",
