It's hard to take\" said Brandon in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish there was a way that we could change all that.\" James says to which Brandon nods his head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the boys notice something glinting on the ground and Brandon picks it up. \"Looks like some sort of coin.\" he says as he looks it over from front to back. On the front it says \"Magic Wishing Coin\" and on the back has a bunch of print that is so small that they would be unable to read it without a magnifying glass. \"Yeah right.\" he says sarcastically about what the coin says it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames however wants to try it out just for kicks. \"Come on man, what harm would it do?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon thinks about it for a moment and decides to try it out. \"Ok, I wish that tree trunk over there was red.\" he says. Just then, his and James' eyes widen. They watch as the tree trunk slowly starts shifting from it's usual brown to red. \"Wow, it does work.\" he says out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the boys decide to do now?</span></div></div>",

They make their way through the mall where one of the ATM's was located at. Once there Jessie step aside and jesters for Carly to use it. Carly rolls her eye's and goes to use the card like normal. As she puts in her pin she is surprised that it works as if it was her card. She looks over to Jessie who quickly gestures for her to check her balance. Carly pushes the button and both her and Jessie stare dumbfounded as the balance is nothing more then just a long string of 9's.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carly pulls her card out and starts panicking again while Jessie puts here card in to confirm here card has the same balance. \"Okay.\" Carly starts. \"Let's say this is a magic coin, What now?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What now?\" Jessie asked shocked. \"What now, we do whatever we want. If this thing can grant us infinite wishes then we can do anything we want. Plus, we are set for life. So,\" Jessie says holding up the coin, \"wanna make a wish?\" As she holds the coin out to Carly, Carly decides that \u2026.</span></div></div>",

Brandon had seen an occasional glimpse of it before in the gym locker room but it held way more interest to him...to her now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo ahead you little BITCH wrap your lips around that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi now felt so compelled to do as she was told it wasn't like an order but just felt like something she needed to do to be complete. <br>\r\nRocking forward onto her knees she knelt before James looking up with mixed emotions that seemed to be fighting one another but the girlish ones easily won out as she reached up and immediately took control of things.<br>\r\n Her wet tongue licked her lips before rolling her eyes to gaze up at James one last time before wrapping her full soft lips around him.<br>\r\nShe had barely started to work on his hard member before he tensed quickly losing all that he had in her mouth and down the front of her shirt as he jerked out experiencing his first bj by his bf. <br>\r\nJames quickly regained his composure from the moment and looked down at Brandi kneeling beneath him but quickly seen a flash of Brandon's old face before focusing back on Brandi's.<br>\r\nWhat had he just done! He abused this wishing coin and got punched in the face then humiliated his best friend like she was the school hoe. Teenage male hormones quickly gave room for the cold hard facts of reality now. <br>\r\nJames knew he could never let Brandi get a hold of that coin and the best place for her was probably right where she was now.James was finally seeing things from a bitter Brandon's perspective and after what he just did to her there was no undoing what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oooh.ugh..ugh. Ahhhh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of panic then pain trying to hold things back those several steps were more then enough to make James wish come true.

He then proceeded to pee himself totally relaxed now.<br>\r\n  He never even had chance to pull his pants down. It was exactly what she wanted, but it did put a temporary smile on Brandi's face as she watched the back of James pants buldge out.with more then a normal size pile of shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done with you yet jackass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi couldn't help but run off like a girl now and back home to think of what to do with herself and James now! <br>\r\n She did smile thinking about James knowing her push bought her plenty of time so he couldn't catch her having the need to shit himself instead first...lol</span></div></div>",

Although larger then any he had seen vestigial tails were not as uncommon as people thought...most not as developed as what James had but some people did have and live with them just fine.<br>\r\n  It wasn't until James got to school that he ran across Brandi in the near empty hall. James did turn sideways as she passed his arms to his side even though the hall was more then 15 feet wide.<br>\r\n  Things looked very awkward for the both of them but Brandi seemed to be dealing better then James in her new skin as she was compelled to act girly which made things appear more normal.<br>\r\n  Brandi had a big smile and looked adorable clutching her books in front of her pushing up against her awesome rack.Her two side ponytails flipped cutely as her finger unwrapped from holding her books to point to James's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..

Now he was wearing a flip-flop that highlighted his very long feet. James thought his toes were long. But somehow it made his feet pretty nice.

Upon that happening, he reaches into the bag to find five one hundred dollar bills inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, they walk inside the shop and start looking around for clothes. Brandon decides to find some women's clothes for James. He then finds a pair of ladies jeans. \"What do you think about these James?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looks at the measurements of it. \"I don't know, I think my waist is too big for these.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon then points at the stone. \"Oh yea, I wish that my waist was small enough to fit these jeans.\" he says as he then feels a pinching at his waist, causing it to draw inwards, dropping down to 24\" wide.</span></div></div>",

And looking at it makes Jaylor jealous. \"I wish my bag looked as nice as yours.\" he says which earns a stern look from Brandon. \"Oh right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls out the coin once again. \"I wish my bag looked like it was of the same quality as Brandon's.\" he says and watches as his gold bag gets larger and more expensive looking as the leather takes on a shiny, high quality sheen. \"Much better.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey have a bit of a discussion while they eat and once they're done, they throw their scraps and sodas away and resume their mall trip.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Brandon and James didn't even have to talk to each other about it, they both had the same thing in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day they went to school as usual and waited for PE when everything would unfold. After a few morning classes, they headed downstairs into the locker room. As expected their first target was there, Derek the basketball player. He always made a point of showing Brandon and James how much worse at basketball they were compared to him. He never picked them when he was team captain, and he always managed to make them look like fools on the court by giving them the ball only to take it away and score seconds later. The pair he picked on was determined to make him regret all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait for this Brandon, this going to be the best day of our lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon laughed back \"No, this is only the beginning, after we get Derek we'll move on to someone else, and by the time we're done we'll rule the entire school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done changing, they assembled with the other boys. Usually, they would wait for their PE assignment, but this time they would be in control. Mr. Hanson walked in front of the class and began to make the usual announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today is basketball, half court. You'll be divided into two groups and get your own basket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Brandon took out the coin and looked at James with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that today's PE assignment was what we decided on yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Hanson suddenly shook his head as if he had been momentarily confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I was saying, you'll be divided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to James and Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, Brandon, and Lucy will go play basketball by themselves. The rest of you will use the other half of the court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon and James got up and headed over to their court, and for some reason, Derek followed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, why did I have to get stuck with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall basket ball player grabbed a ball and started dribbling down towards the court where the other two were waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, it's Lucy, we'll never been him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Brandon cracked up after mocking Derek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up with you too. That almost sounded sarcastic. I wasn't going to take this seriously, but if you've forgotten how much better I am than you I'll remind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames managed to stop laughing long enough to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't forget anything, but it looks like you might have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you forgot that you're name isn't Lucy, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then whispered into the coin \"I wish Derek realized that his name isn't Lucy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek's eyes opened wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did Mr. Hanson... and I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked at the two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how did you do that? I know you're behind this because you're the only ones who noticed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon pretended to look confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noticed what? You're name is Lucy isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, if you won't tell me, I'll make you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek began to run at Brandon, who pulled out the coin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that Derek would become a girl named Lucy.\"</span></div></div>",

His feet were tiny, and even stranger, they were in a pair of girly pink and white sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon came up and Derek and gave him an evil smile as he looked down. Derek started to reach for him, but he stopped when his arm shrank right in front of him. It was only half as thick as it was before, and lacked any sign of muscle. It was also perfectly smooth and hairless. Finally Derek began to realize that he was in trouble, as he had no way to fight what James and Brandon were doing, but it was too late for him to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body underwent the same changes as his arms and legs and began to pull inwards. Derek was also quickly losing height and it seemed as though he would disappear into his clothes, but half way through the transformation his height stabilized while his hips bulged out slightly and his chest seemed to puff up. Now that his body was no longer out of proportion, Derek was able to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek put a hand over his mouth, his voice had changed completely. It was now at least two octaves higher. He began to feel his lips, then his entire face. He couldn't recognize any of it. Suddenly, his hair grew out, becoming many times longer than his normal cut. He was so shocked, that he inadvertently let out a high pitched scream and fell back onto the floor. His gym shorts had become displaced in the process, exposing the pink panties he was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know Derek was into wearing girl's clothes!\" James laughed and pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek pulled up his shorts, but this seemed to only triggered them to undergo their own transformation. They became tighter and a little shorter, more like the girls' uniform. The same happened to his top, making the changes to his body much more apparent. Finally, Derek's new breasts shifted up as a bra began to materialize under his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation was finished, leaving Derek as a tall and fit, but not necessarily athletic girl.</span></div></div>",

The winner gets whatever they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, why should I?\" Lucy was screaming, and shaking her fist, but it didn't make her look as intimidating as she hoped since she was obviously confused and a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ok, we'll just leave you alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, leave you just like you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon and James slowly turned around and started walking away. Before two seconds had past Lucy had jumped up and starting running after them. The two friends just turned and grinned at the poor bully tuned girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the two boys were watching from the side lines as Lucy stood in the middle of the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, start with some practice, here. Shoot until you get it in, so we know you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon tossed the ball over to her and she caught it. Lucy jumped when she felt her hair tickle her back, she wasn't used to it yet, and didn't know how to tie her hair into a ponytail. Even if she did, she would probably refuse to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on Derek, I mean Lucy, you'll make it one shot!\" James and Brandon weren't even hiding their laughter anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was getting angrier and angrier but couldn't do anything about. She squeezed the ball to release some frustration, then turned to the hoop. Her beautiful long hair shifted again, and she instinctively brushed it back where her hand in a slightly girly manner. She of course stopped and pulled her hand away when she realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying her best to ignore the laughter, she walked up to the basket to take her shot. It seemed higher than usual, which made Lucy a little more nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, show us how you're the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy just blocked them out as best as she could and tossed the ball into the air. It almost looked like it would go in, but when it him the rim, it bounced off to the side. But as soon as that happened, Lucy felt strange again. Her vision blacked out for a second. She looked around. The gym looked even bigger now. She turned to James and Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys laughed before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we forgot to mention, you'll get a year younger every time you miss.\"</span></div></div>",

She lifted up the ball and stood still for a moment, then threw the ball as accurately as she could. It missed completely and bounced out of the court. She hadn't accounted for her weaker arms now that she was a year a younger, now about to become two years younger. Lucy felt herself get shorter. Her body also changed in a few other ways, she knew her hips had become smaller and could feel her breasts shrink a little. She was now 14 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be a bad day for you Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy turned around and stomped her foot on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I'll make you regret this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon almost fell over laughing at Derek's squeaky voice. It had become even higher. Lucy looked like she was about to angrily leave the gym, but James wasn't going to let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you score remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out the coin and looked at Lucy. He wanted to make sure she heard what he was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that Lucy wouldn't be able to leave the gym until she scores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any choice, Lucy picked up the ball and lined up to shoot again. She looked down at the ball and closed her eyes. She was desperate enough to beg to the ball, no one else would listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please go in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed the ball, this time hitting the backboard, but it bounced off. Again she felt her body regress. Derek was now a 13 year old girl. She frowned and crossed her arms in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon turned to James laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what you did, you made her cry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, Lucy's eyes were tearing. She turned to hide it at first, but then turned toward the two boys that she used to enjoy bullying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" she sniffed and nearly choked up trying to stop the crying \"stop this. I'm... I'm so sorry, I won't bother you ever again. I'll do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' face soured. For some reason that pushed him over the edge. He didn't find this fun anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that Lucy would make the last shot and then go home because she felt sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek walked over to the ball as soon as James made his wish. He retrieved it and walked back to where he had been standing before, and shot the ball directly into the net. He then held his head, like it was aching, and went over to Mr. Hanson. After a brief exchange of words, the PE teacher called over a couple of girls, and they escorted Derek out of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon jumped off the stands he was sitting on and confronted James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting bored, so I stopped it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have told me first. I was still having fun. And we both know that he deserved it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends just stared at each other for a little while.</span></div></div>",

His honey blonde hair now spilled down his shoulders and onto his chest. His legs were much more slender and sexy with full, luscious thighs. Mitchell's hips were at about 34\" although they weren't done yet, same thing with his ass which looked better as well but still had a ways to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarther along up Mitchell's body, his waist was complete at a delicate 24\" wide and it's tinyness was shown off by how tight his clothing was. And James could swear that he saw a couple of nubs poking out from his blouse. His hands are smaller with long pink colored nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face though is really different from before as it's much softer with eyes that are a little bit wider, and poutier lips. \"So fellas mind if I come with you to lunch?\" Mitchell asks in a breathy tone of voice.</span></div></div>",

John had plenty of friends but really never dated a lot, mainly because John did have one fundamental flaw, one all men have somewhere in the corner of their minds; he was a pervert. John was the kind of lonely guy who would hang with his bros and have a laugh, but in the evenings without companionship, he'd turn to the trusty old internet to keep himself satisfied. While not being a very tasteful lifestyle, it was still more or less innocent. Well, innocent that is, until today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that particular moment John was staring at some beautiful redhead bending over by her locker to pick up something she dropped, and lucky for him (and every other guy around), she was bending low enough to reveal what little cleavage she had to the world. The mind races, people around her start walking slower, and men suddenly have a reason to readjust their jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn walked by, frankly disappointed. There weren't enough hotties in this school, he often thought to himself. This was most definitely one of those occasions. Why couldn't there be more sexy chicks like you see in movies? Then life would be so much simpler, all those stupid games girls play, adverted. Wouldn't it be nice....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking this, he noticed a coin glinting on the floor of the hallway. Curious, he picked up, rubbed some grime off the surface and held it before him. In his head he read \"Magic Wishing Coin\". He chuckled aloud at that. Sounded like something out of a fairytale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter discovering there was nothing more than small unreadable letters on the other side, John pocketed the coin, thinking to himself as he did it, \"You know what I wish, I wish there'd be some girls in this town. Yeah. Some sexy sluts who've been around the block a few times. Sluts who's reputation is almost as big as their cup size. That's what I'd wish for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked away off toward his next class, he failed to notice a slight tingling in his pocket, as the coin's magic started to work its stuff.</span></div></div>",

Brandon noticed this, as well as his slight shift in speech pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you talking like that?\" he said as his shoes too grew some short flats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, why am I talking like what?\" James replied, his voice still completely masculine, but his shirt lightening from black to a dark red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you're kind of speaking like, a girl sort of, ya know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smirked, his lips becoming a bit pinker in appearance, \"Bran, I'm only talking like exactly how you are, man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winked and headed into the classroom, a now worried Brandon quickly following in pursuit, starting to wonder if he was indeed talking similar to James' new speech pattern.</span></div></div>",

He'd never been lost distracted before, granted what was happening to them was amazing, but he should have at least sat down!!!!

Oh god, the things he'd like to do to Tori. It was then that he came back into focus, realizing he was doing nothing but twirling his pencil in between his ever-lengthening fingernails.

We should go look there after class.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his mind continued to race in the same endless circle, James' hair began to lighten from its natural red to a strawberry blonde color, lengthening ever so slightly down past his ears. His feet then shrunk slightly to fit his new medium-length pink heels, with his socks beginning to change into softer striped ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Brandon was still dealing with his own distractions, which were becoming worse and worse by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'So the Spanish Flu passed out from the mainland into other nations via ships- Mia Ships, now that's a girl I haven't thought about in awhile.

Ms. Harper bent down to pick up the coin which should have been a perfect time for them to admire her nice ass but, they did not seem to take the opportunity to look. Ms. Harper gingerly walked back to her desk and put the coin away. As she began her lesson, the boys noticed how easy the lesson was. 'She seemed pretty dim and gullible but maybe she is pretty smart', the two thought to themselves what they didn't seem to realize was she wasn't teaching Honors Algebra II but, Remedial Algebra I, There was no way a school would have a fresh new teacher teach such an important and advanced subject so early in her career. Nor did they seem to notice their different classmates, Sandra Bates and the other honor students had been swapped for the bro-y jocks and the bubbly cheerleaders taking remedial classes to get by. James and Brandon diligently followed the lesson plan without even realizing it, too focused on the class ending to get the coin back. As the class went on Brandon began to cross his legs during the lesson and soon James followed suit. The concepts that Ms. Harper was teaching were also slowly becoming harder to grasp and understand as there intelligence began to equal out for the class. After the lesson began the portion of class were everyone divided into groups four to do the homework or to ask Ms. Harper questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Brandon ended up getting paired with Gigi Summers and Nikki Davis, two of the most bubbly, girlish cheerleaders of the entire school. Neither of them had really talked to each other but, both quickly leap into talking about fashion and makeup while trying to bring James and Brandon into the conversation. The boys managed to find a balance in talking to the girls about fashion and asking Ms. Harper questions about the lesson and soon, the class ended.</span></div></div>",

And now it was Derek's turn to pick someone for his team. He was wondering who he could pick as his eyes glanced over at James to see if the changes were still going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were as James legs began to slim out in the calves, looking more toned and shapely. The opposite was happening with his thighs as those were still pretty thick and meaty. But what meat was there was very toned and shapely with very little fat on them, making them sleek and sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Derek gets the perfect idea. \"I choose Brandon.\" he says much to Brandon's chagrin as he didn't want to play against his best friend.

I wish you would go over to the bed and bend over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon, having no control over his body, did as Derek had wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that there was a mirror across the bed from Brandon so that he could see everything that I am about to do to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mirror that suddenly appeared in Brandon's view he could see Derek standing behind him holding the coin tightly in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's skip right to the fun part.\" Derek said. \"I wish that Brandon had a pussy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, Brandon felt movement in his crotch as his manhood shrank away to be replaced by female genitals. What he hadn't expected was the intense pleasure that the transformation brought with it. The change only took a few seconds but in that short span Brandon nearly came from pleasure. As the transformation finished and his vagina fully formed, Brandon experienced his first female orgasm. He moaned loudly with the experience and nearly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you enjoyed that wish. Let's see how much you enjoy this one. I wish that Brandon and I were naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold draft from his clothes suddenly disappearing snapped Brandon's attention back to the present. In the mirror he watched as Derek began stroking his penis to make it hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what you planned to do to me, isn't it shithead. Well lets see how you like being on the receiving end.\" Brandon gasped as Derek moved up behind him and began to run his penis up and down Brandon's newly formed vulva. He was still unable to talk due to Derek's earlier wish, but when he felt Derek's penis entering his vagina for the first time he was able to moan with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where has the coin gone while Derek has been distracted?</span></div></div>",

James thinks to himself as he's then reminded of the changes to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glances down to see that his shoes have now turned a shiny silver and have glitter on them. The toes are pointed with the toe portion of them gone, exposing a couple of his toes. His feet are also smaller too, making them a ladies' size six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys..I...\" he starts to say when Brian interrupts him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're changing now too right?\" he asks to which James nods his head. The wallet that Brian's holding is starting to get larger, getting hard and turning red before sealing itself up, it now only able to be opened by a diamond tipped clasp. And inside of it, his name has started shifting to Briay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn additon to that, his hips finish growing at 38\" wide which took him a bit of time to get used to as he shifted around in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jandicca got hit with a sense of worry as his underwear shifted into a pair of golden panties while a golden bra materialized under his dress. \"I gotta head back to the bathroom really quick.\" he says as he grabs his purse and starts heading back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames gets worried about this and deciddes to follow.</span></div></div>",

'I can't believe I actually came here without putting on my makeup.' he thinks to himself and shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, jewelery appears on him as he now has a wedding ring, bracelet, and long dangly earrings. He once again entered the women's restroom once more and since James wasn't far along enough yet, he would be unable to join him in there. 'Guess I'll wait again.' he thinks to himself as he was having trouble moving in his shoes which had completed their change into a pair of opened toed silver high heels with a 4\" heel to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing further down at his feet, he saw that is socks were now gone and his legs felt like they were starting to shift. the mass rearranging itself so that he too would have a sexy pair of legs rivaled only by his four companions. By this point, he noticed Hilary was coming back who gave him a polite smile before returning to the auditorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriay was beside himself as he felt his ass starting to inflate. \"How could those two leave me alone with Taylor again, and Hilary's bound to be on her way.\" he says quietly to himself as his ass finishes growing into a tight bubble shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJandicca quickly approaches a mirror and sets his purse down to get to work.</span></div></div>",

He then goes over his cheeks with a light dusting of pink blush. And then dark eyeshadow which really brings out his eyes and finishes up with some mascara to make his eyelashes curl. With his touching up completed, Jandicca blows himself a kiss. \"Perfect.\" he says to himself as he leaves the bathroom, his age finishing at 32 while his breasts start growing, reaching an A-cup for now. A void had also opened up between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as James heard the sound of high heels leaving the womens' restroom, he immdiately stood up and prepared himself to talk to Jandicca, but when his friend emerged, he was left with his jaw dropped. At this point, James' legs started getting a lean, toned appearance to them as they had begun filling out, mainly in the thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJandicca walks right by him before he comes to his senses and quickly follows as his pants begin turning a light violet and start poofing out causing him all sorts of trouble trying to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at their seats, Hilary had just returned to her seat and started making some small talk with Taylor which made Briay really uncomfortable. 'It's like they don't remember anything at all.' he thinks to himself as he feels his waist pulling on him. His clothes continue altering as his skirt and pants connect, the red satin material completely covering his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJandicca finally returns to his seat, as does James who had followed him.</span></div></div>",

Get it done now instead of possibly having to worry about it later.\" he says and then the two of them start heading towards where the restrooms are located at. Along the way, more people are staring at them. 'I wish people would stop looking at me.' Brandon thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally reach the restrooms but just as they're about to enter the mens room, something in their brains flips and they decide to go inside the womens restroom instead. Both of them going inside a stall and lowering their pants or in Brandon's case, lifting his dress and lowering his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of them go to do their business, they shake their heads wondering why they're standing up and sit down on the toilets instead. And even before they get what they need to do taken care of, they undergo some more changes. James' underwear starts to darken and become softer as they morph into a black pair of panties which hug his larger ass tightly. Brandon however has a more drastic change to his undergarments as his underwear loses most of it's material until there's nothing more than a small patch covering his crotch along with a thin strip up his backside as the material darkens and turns silky, becoming a black thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like most of the prior changes that had happened to them, this too brought on a new memory as they remembered putting on these undergarments before getting their outfits on. Brandon knew he looked good and that other people liked seeing him wear it while James liked what he had on for it's comfort.</span></div></div>",

For James, he's now wearing a simple black bra that goes with his panties. Brandon however, is now wearing a silky satin bra with some lace on the cups that once his breasts grow in, will look very tantalizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a new memory pops into their heads of them putting on their bras after they got their panties on and they give themselves a look over in the mirror to make sure it looks good. Brandon however spent plenty of time primping and posing, blowing himself kisses thinking about how insane some of the boys would look if they saw him like he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon then shakes his head. \"I don't know why I keep forgetting that, someone like me should be superior to such mistakes.

The iris' color altered as James' became darker while Brandon's turned a brighter shade of green than they already are. The lashes surrounding them got longer and thicker while being coated with a layer of mascara. Then their eyebrows thin out into tiny arches. Eyeshadow then applies itself to their eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then have a memory of that morning when their stylist got them ready for the day, making sure that their makeup looked impeccable and their features were flawless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then decided that they were done looking through the music as they suddenly realized that they have someplace that they have to be. \"That's right, we gotta be at the movie theater before the event starts.\" Brandon says while James nods his head.

As this is going on, their hands become smaller and more delicate as their fingernails extend beyond their fingertips while also getting manicured. In addition to that, Brandon's nails turn an orange color to match his shoes and purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, these changes also come with a new memory of them in the salon earlier in the day, getting their manicures done.

Katie was looking at the coin unsure about how it works and too prideful to ask she went ahead and tested out a simple wish \u201cI wish to be dressed in a super hot bikini that would always fit.\u201d Sure as heck her outfit morphed becoming a curve contouring bikini that was tight and hugged her supple breasts. James spoke out \u201cyou don\u2019t need to say it just focus on what you want to change\u201d Brandon yelled out for him to shut up.

Her d cups deminishing by the minute as pecs, abs, delts, quads, delts, traps, ,biceps and triceps all sprang to life gaining mass until a massive female bodybuilder stood before them bigger than Bryan ever was hard angles vaguely outlined her still georgeous face. She grinned \u201cI can do better\u201d a masculine husk to her voice she was taken aback and her eyes lit up like Christmas trees as her a cup athletic pancakes dissolved into her large veiny saturated pecs. Her face grew harder as she passed the 4 hundred threshold the magical fabric of the bikini stretched to accommodate what the boys saw, a clitoral bulge under her hem and gulped. Bryan stopped growing and examined herself she was the biggest female bodybuilder in the world \u201cI wanted side effects you guys ripped me off.\u201d Her voice a deep baritone. \u201cI\u2019m going to use this thing to rule the world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast!\u201d A rift opened up and two figures popped out it was Loki and Maui.

Maui and Loki weaken and collapse to the ground and a blinding flash blinds them when they can see they see a 100 foot golden goddess that still resembles the twisted Bryan-Katie form \u201cBehold I am  CALLAMASTIA GOD KILLER CURSED OF FEMALE VIRTUE!\u201d Her voice boomed and shook mountains.</span></div></div>",

That didn't sound like him at all. It was far too high and too...feminine. Looking up, James could see that his hand was also gloved, even though he knew he wasn't wearing gloves before. As he turned his head, a lock of blonde hair flew into his face, causing him to tuck it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What happened?!\" cried James as he finally sat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally got a good look at himself, stunned speechless by what he saw. He was glad in some white dress-like tunic, with thigh-high boots on his legs. He felt a weight on his chest, and immediately looked down to see two mounds sticking out. Near a panic, James touched around his body, feeling a totally alien feeling from everywhere. The kicker was when he felt down his groin, and felt no bulge at all beneath the skirt he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where am I?\" came a voice from behind James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames turned around and saw a feminine figure sit up a few yards from him. He noticed who it could be. It was Yan Leixia, more commonly known as Leixia. He would recognize that look anywhere from his knowledge of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. The game....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-James?\" asked \"Leixia\", causing James to yelp and turn around.

I'll stay up and take on any Stalfos that may appear.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them nod in agreement but just before Jameda lays his head down for sleep, he gives Grabdon a worried look. \"Please be careful.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabdon nods his head. \"I will Prince Zameda.\" he replies and turns his attention out of the woods. 'Wait a minute...did I just call him Zameda?' he thinks to himself as he glances back at Zameda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his eyes widen when he sees how the sleeves of Zameda's top turn into some sort of golden light mail plates which then connect to each other with some other piece that goes across his chest. Some intricate designs then appear on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he turns his attention back over to Karen although the name Karen in his mind didn't sound right. Like it's supposed to be Karenine. 'That's not right is it?' he thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't have time to worry about that though as he hears a nearby rustling.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But that didn't stop him from continually keeping an eye on them, watching out for anymore changes that were occurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore maturity appeared on Karenine's face as she aged her last little bit, making her seventeen years old, the same age that Zameda now was. And he noticed that her face seemed a lot smoother, as if it hadn't seen any wear or stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he sent his attention over to Zameda and saw that his own face was looking much more feminine by the second, his skin smoothing out and what's even more startling is that it looks like his lips are beginning to get poutier and then taking on a cupid's bow shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabdon's hair continued to grow from it's new length, all the way down to the middle of his back where it still didn't get the same kind of shine that Zameda's or Karenine's did as he wasn't that concerned with taking all that much care of of it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Brandon Grinned at all the possibilities he had to choose from, and grinned even wider given that James had given him the choice as to their 'victim.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Let's see...\" Said Brandon, scanning the household of the Walker family, processing in his mind the perfect candidate for their plans and schemes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He observed his older brother, Kevin Walker, whom was 18 years of age, and who possessed the same red hair owned by his mother and younger brother James, but had the brown eyes of his father. At this particular moment. Kevin was with his girlfriend in the living room, Elizabeth 'Liz' Davis, an 18 year old as well, though both you and James believed her to be much too attractive to be with a suitor such as Kevin. They, Brandon and James thought themselves more suitable candidates for her. Ms. Davis was a brunette haired girl, approximately 5'5\" and had dark emerald green eyes.  The girl was on the bubbly and popular side of the school's social ladder. Though, despite her stance on the social food chain, you thought her a great person. She was kind, smart and, only for the purpose of making this description shorter, the polar opposite of those on the higher end of the social food-chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Next, Brandon looked to James' younger brother, Nate Walker, 10 years of age, brown haired like his father, but blue-eyed like his mother. Nate was still at the innocent height of 4'9\" He has the attitude that is but too prevalent in the children of today's society. He thought he was on top of the world, he thought himself a genius and what not. Despite this poor attitude, the kid was likeable when he wanted to be. Although, Brandon and James only saw Nate for a fleeting second, only because he quickly rushed from the living room to his own room, to play with his video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Following, Brandon noted the only one of James' siblings that Brandon felt he really knew. This character was none other than Ms. Karen Walker. The sweetest girl you'd ever meet. She was 12 years of age, had brown hair that only went the slightest bit below her shoulders, and blue-eyed like her brothers and mother. And 4'11\" in height, only slightly overshadowing her younger brother, Nate. The girl liked track, animals, a staple of girls' likes, and taiquando, not so much a staple of today's pre-teen girl. She was a sweet girl, but knew how to fend for herself, if such is necessary. It can also be said that she has the best relationship with James out of all the other residents in the house. James and Karen hung out very often, their relation ship was all but in dire straits. In fact, if ever you called ti hang out with James', there would be occasions where he'd turn you down because he was hanging out with Karen. This you respected. And, hey, the kid was likeable. At this moment, Karen sat in the living room, on the couch opposite to where Kevin and Liz sat, simply reading one of her books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Subsequently, Brandon observed James' Father, Raymond Walker, a 44-year-old nicotine user and workaholic, a truly bad culmination. Raymond was brown haired and had the brown eyes to match. Raymond stood at a towering height of 6'3\" The man always wore his working clothes, the pants that always seemed a bit too formal for wherever the Walkers went, the tie and buttoned down shirt that was also too formal and up-tight for wherever they may have been. The perfectly shined work-shoes. And, the ugliest part of his whole appearance were his habits, that habit that killed it all being his smoking. He always had a lighter and pack of cigarettes handy, much to the dismay of his wife and children. The relationship between Raymond and his family, wife included, was strained. At this moment, he was in a heated business related phone call. Surely, he'd be an acceptable candidate for the coin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  Finally, and rounding off the Walker home, was Bridgette Walker, the mother of Kevin, Nate, James and Karen, second mother, practically, to Brandon Thomas. Bridgette was 39 years of age, had red hair that went only slightly past her shoulders, and blue eyes. Bridgette stood at 5'11\" only slightly surpassing her son, James. Speaking, of James and his mother, Bridgette, the two were practically spitting images of each other. Same hair color, eye color, skin color, almost the same height. Their personalities were both in sync as well, Bridgette loving to be adventurous, much like James. Bridgette had the strongest relationship with all of her children, but, again, the relationship between herself and Raymond was a train wreck. They hardly spoke. This is bad. You, along with all the other Walker children, were positive their marriage would end in divorce, but, despite everyone's knowledge of the divorce that was only a matter of time, no one spoke a word. At this moment, Bridgette sat in the kitchen, idly drinking coffee. All of her children were preoccupied with their own affairs, her husband being the jerk he'd always been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey, James.\" Brandon whispered to James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You made up your mind yet?\" James impatiently challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Let's go with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   (Given the brand new descriptions of all of the Walker family and friends, who's your choice?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Another interactive from me. You pretty much know the drill if you've read my other interactives. Please update! Thanks to Grungepunk for his much appreciated cooperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interactive involves transformations of most sorts. Things like TG, Age Progression or regression, and stuff like that. TF might be ok to an extent. Changing into Anime or Video game characters is ok too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing added is that one option will allow for alternate stories! These can have totally different characters, though the concept of the wishing coin will remain the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keep it PG-13!<br>\r\n2. You can have sex, but not descriptive and try not to have too much.<br>\r\n3. Keep language PG-13 and also keep it tame (like not cursing every sentence)<br>\r\n4. Keep the story going and no killing the characters.<br>\r\n5. At least try to make sure your grammer is correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's the story: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Brandon are two friends who, one day, are having some fun in the nearby woods. In there, they come across a mysterious coin with powers over reality itself. With it in hand, their lives will change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. James Walker: 16 years old, 5'9, 140 lbs, short red hair, blue eyes, likes books and video games as well as sports. Nice personality. This character is mostly based on myself, Sentinel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Brandon Thomas: 16 years old, 5'6, 145 lbs, dark blonde hair, green eyes, Loner, loves video games and computers, a bit of a slacker, kind of geeky. This character is mostly based on Grungepunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Karen Walker: 12 years old, 4'11, 92 lbs, brown hair that goes a little past shoulders, blue eyes, James' little sister, has a good relationship with him, likes animals, taiquando, and track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters may be added as it goes along.</td>",
