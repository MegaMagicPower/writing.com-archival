            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another day, another Saturday night spent alone. No car, no boyfriend, no money, but probably the most important thing that this evening was lacking in Alli's opinion... no Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh sure there was the internet, she and Emily were friends on all the major social networks; Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, and the always basic AIM or Windows Messenger. They could e-mail each other, text, or call one another any time they wanted. But all the messages, cute icons, and time spent over the webcam was no substitute for the real thing. No substitute for sad evenings like these when even her <i>parents</i> were going out with friends. And certainly no substitute for the long evening of lonliness ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, what tact was there in calling Emily and saying, \"Hey, I don't have anything better to do and I miss you <i>so</i> much, stay on the line with me for four more hours so I don't feel like a total social reject!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Actually, that sounds like something Alli would normally do. But no, she couldn't simply come out and say that- it was the subtle knowing that neither of them had nothing better to do this weekend that allowed them to stay on the phone for so long before, even when she lived in town! But now that her best friend had moved to Poland, how would Alli know anything about her friend anymore? Let alone how long they could talk! What if they had some kind of limit on minutes up there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides, even if she could work up the nerve to call her friend, it still wouldn't change the fact that on weekends like this Emily was always <i>here</i>, regardless of plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by 'here', one should take that as Alli's living room on the couch covered up in a blanket with a pint of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Sure, a little lame for a girl in her eleventh year of highschool, but when funds were limited \"Ben and Jerry's were always willing to entertain.\" That's what Emily would have said in a situation like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClumsily, Alli fumbled about her couch in search of the DVD remote. This episode of the Office sucked, and she'd seen it a million times. Stretching her arms to a dangerous extent, Alli let out a grunt as she pawed at the clicker. She swatted at it, hoping to hit it from the arm extension of the couch and onto a cushion (or hopefully into her lap, that'd be cool) but instead satisfied that she had merely accidentally pressed the fastforward button. She let out a contented sigh of relief at the minor exertion and resumed her stupored stare at yet another rerun courtesy of her many box sets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the theme song, Alli's fingers moved slowly towards her iPhone. She nimbly unlocked it, the sequence very much a second nature to her now, only to have her heart sink a little at the blank backdrop. It wasn't the late hour reminding her of her wasted day upsetting her, or even the fact that she hadn't gotten more than two text messages today; it was her backdrop, a photo of her, Emily, and their closest of mutual friends all gathered together in her living room to see their Polandbound pal off in high spirits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes softened a little and she felt a strange lump grow in the back of her throat. Immediately she turned to her ice cream in hopes of choking it down with the sweet sting of mint chocolate. Her spoon, bent from overuse, emerged with a more than modestly piled amount of cream which was then scraped off behind her lips and swallowed to join the rest of its kind in Alli's stomach. She felt a little better- she and Emily always used to have ice cream on these kinds of days, so it was a welcomed memory. In fact, one more little spoonful was called for right about now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the meter rose, Alli registered that there was no more sweet golden cream for her to tap. And of course, the antics of Scranton Branch were always better with ice cream. It didn't seem to register a problem that she should get up and get another carton. After all, she and Emily always managed to dig into a second flavor before the night was over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, the well-versed fact that Emily wasn't there pigging out with her didn't seem to reach Alli. Nor the fact that she was dipping into that second box <i>alone</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli hoisted herself up from the well-worn impression she had left on her couch cushions with a slight hint of difficulty. As she stood, Alli walked over to the remote and paused her entertainment for the evening so that she could get to the fridge without missing anything she'd seen about a million times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring just how cold the linoleum kitchen floors were beneath her, Alli made her way over to the double doored refrigerator and stuck her head inside, reaching behind her so that she might scratch her back (all that time sitting really makes you a little itchy, all five consecutive hours considering) and grab another carton of frozen creamery at random. With her luck, she'd picked Reese's PeanutButter Cup. A light \"mmm!\" escaped her as the lonely girl made her way back to the living room, tugging slightly at the seat of her seemingly shrinking scrubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, the scrubs weren't shrinking. I'd think we could all guess that by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli was always a pretty girl, usually well mannered and respectful, with short strawberry blond hair that came down to her chin and a modest to well built body. But above all things, she was a little bit of a ditz sometimes- with plenty of \"blond\" moments to entertain her many friends. And while hair color certainly had little to do with this argument, thinking that her pj's had shrunk was what could only be described as a \"blond moment\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no big surprise to anyone else. Shortly after Emily's departure, those closest to Alli noticed a few subtle changes in her. That pretty jawline of hers getting a little less defined and the tightening of her wardrobe. But at this point it was just flat-out hard to deny that Alli had allowed her loneliness to affect her waistline. With her breasts oozing out from underneath the straps on her tank top, soft paunch driving the poor black ensemble up on top of it's lovehandle companions, and her turquoise scrubs containing much more junk in Alli's trunk than usual. But of course, like many other things, this would have to be spelled out for Alli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting F-A-T!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, as the old expression goes, ignorance is bliss. And while wallowing about in her loneliness is far from bliss, why not let her tackle her weight problem when the time comes. Hopefully by then, she'd be over Emily's departure and able to deal with the growing problem that sat on top of her chubby thighs...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Alli's parents entered their house to find her passed out on the couch, they knew something had to be done.<br>\r\n\"Oh, look at her Rob, she's seemed so sad since Emily moved away,\" noted her mother<br>\r\n\"I know, and the school hasn't taken any action at all. I think it might be the best option to home school her. We could hire a private tutor, that way she'd probably get a better education too, and I think grades have been adding to her stress\"<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? What about her friends at school?\"<br>\r\n\"Emily was her only friend, and she clearly has made no attempt at getting a new one. I really think this is the best solution honey.\"<br>\r\n\"OK, I geuss it's best to do it now. I'll call the school, you find a good private tutor. And make sure they can tutor her here, alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Will do. Now lets go upstairs so we don't wake her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while after her parents went upstairs, Alli woke up and looked at the clock. It was just after midnight on Sunday morning.<br>\r\n\"I'll go to bed early tonight to make up for it, but right now I'm hungry,\" Alli thought to herself. <br>\r\nShe wandered into the kitchen and pulled a new box of oreos out of the pantry, along with a jug of whole milk from the fridge. Plugging her headphones into her iPad, she began absentmidedly eating and dunking her oreos while watching the movie. After two and a half of the three rows of cookies were gone, (one hour into James Cameron's Avatar), she put them away, thinking that she'd save them for later, and was unaware of the amount she'd eaten. Still hungry somehow, she stuck her head into the freezer, and pulled out a gallon (~3.8L) tub of Chocolate chunk cookie dough ice cream. Thinking it would go well with the ice cream, she also pulled out a can of reddi-whip. She went back to her iPad and unpaused the movie. For the next almost two hours, she'd dip her spoon into the tub, not realizing she had to reach a little deeper each time, stopping every so often (usually during a slow scene) to shake the reddi-whip and spray some into her mouth. By the end of the movie (Which I call \"Dances with Wolves - In Space!\"), she was much to tired to care she'd just consumed a gallon of ice cream and a can of whipped cream. However, she didn't feel like walking up stairs, so back to the pantry she went, looking for something to eat while waiting to fall asleep. She searched until she saw something that caught her eye: an unopened four-can pack of Pringles. <br>\r\n\"I didn't know they made these, sweet, I love Pringles!\" Alli exclaimed (quietly).<br>\r\nBecause she didn't like reaching into the can every time she wanted a chip, Alli opened one of the connected packs and started to empty it into a bowl, but then the lids popped off the other three, and all four emptied into the large dish. Too lazy to refill each can, Alli brought the whole bowl with her into the living. Knowing her parents would be asleep, she felt confident she could have the volume on. Turning the TV to a random channel, she started snacking while waiting to fall asleep. Laying under a blanket on her couch, she couldn't see that her formerly fitting pajama top now left a gap between it and her panties, and in that gap was a small muffin top with love handles just starting to form. Tired and distracted, she subconsciously stuffed crisp after crisp into her waiting mouth. At 5 AM, about an hour before her parents usually woke up, Alli fell asleep. Almost all of the Pringles were eaten. At 5:30, the Fays' housekeeper started her rounds, and cleaned up the evidence of Alli's early-hours stuffing.<br>\r\nAt 6 AM, Alli's parents, who do to their housekeeper had no idea how much their daughter had eaten, instructed their chef (in case you hadn't figured it out, they were quite affluent) To make as many of Alli's favorite foods as possible for breakfast, over which they would tell her their plan. And so, when Alli woke up, still tired, at 9, she was welcomed by the smell of wonderfully prepared, homemade omelets, cinnamon rolls, donuts, bacon, sausages, an entire smorgasbord of all her favorite breakfast foods.<br>\r\nBy this time, her small potbelly from earlier had receded enough that her parents didn't notice it at all. Walking into the kitchen, she was curious.<br>\r\n\"Mom, Dad, what's all this for?\" Alli inquired<br>\r\n\"Well honey, we thought that your current school wasn't quite working out for you, so we pulled you out of it and hire a personal tutor to come here three days a week to give you a better, more personal education,\" explained her father.<br>\r\n\"So, what do you thikn, dear?\" her mother asked nervously.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Needless to say, her parents were a little more than shocked at her reaction. The shaky confidence they had began this breakfast with was whisked out from under their feet, the confident smile painted onto their lips replaced with a look of nervous anxiety as their daughter's expression grew deeper and deeper into a look of mild fury. \"Is this some kind of joke?\" Allison continued in her parent's taciturn spell, \"How could you just take me out of my school?\" Her parents grew uneasy, mother reaching for her cup of coffee and father fidgeting like a loon. Rob took a deep breath and tried to calm his daughter down. \"We just thought,\" his voice was stern yet hushed, \"That after losing your only friend at school, it just seemed like the best thing for-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have other friends besides Emily, Dad!\" Alli said abruptly, \"And besides, who takes their daughter out of public school so she can go into homeschooling during one of the most important social periods of her life?\" A valid point. Her parents were befuddled, seeming to ignore the urge to get into a huddle and discuss their game plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuriously, Alli grabbed the butter knife laid out for her and started cutting into her omelet. After salvaging a reasonably sized bite, she stabbed it with her fork and devoured her a portion of her breakfast time opponent. Had she not been so blindly enraged, she would have had to compliment the housekeeper's skills with an egg, her breakfast was really tasty so far. \"This is so like you guys,\" Alli grumbled as she cut into her egg once again, \"You know there's a problem, but you don't want to put in the effort to ask <i>me</i> how you can fix it, so you just screw things up by yourselves!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison, I know you're upset, but we're still your parents and we still-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And another thing!\" she said through a mouth full of varied ingredients before swallowing, \"Why would you take your daughter out of school for social reasons when you both work?\" Again, another valid point. Her mother seeing the shifting levels of control in the argument, decided to side with Allison on this one. \"You know she's right, Rob.\" she said sympathetically, \"We'd have to leave her all by herself all day while all of her other friends are at school.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Fays would not be out done, he made a living working out arguments and there was no way he was going to lose one against his own daughter. \"Well that's okay, you can invite over as many friends as you want after school your mother and I won't say a word about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli rolled her eyes directly at her father, \"That's not the point, Dad!\" she dropped her utensils to the table, \"If you and Mom hadn't screwed up my whole social life, I wouldn't <i>have</i> to invite my friends over if I wanted to see them, I could just talk to them at school!\" Her mother turned to face her husband, \"She's right, Rob.\" she said as convincingly as possible, \"Friends are a very important part of a young lady's life right now, it wasn't fair of you to just take that away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison shook her head, ignoring her mother for the time being. \"Look, I'm just gonna go up to my room.\" she stood with noticeable difficulty due to her slowly digesting food baby of last night. \"What about all this food?\" her mother gestured to the cluttered table, \"Honey, we had it made just for you, it's all your favorite things and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eat it!\" Allison shouted back, now storming into the hall and into her bedchambers. She opened the door and slammed it shut, opening it once more simply to slam it back shut again. She stomped over to her bed and grabbed her pillow, forcing it onto her face and letting out the loudest, angriest scream that dwell within her out without fear of her parents hearing. After her roar, she spiked the pillow back onto her bed, where she jump face first onto her plush comforter and scream some more for a good five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, tears came to her eyes at the thought of losing all her friends to home schooling. There was no way Colleen would drive all the way out to her house, what with her crappy car and crappy attitude. Lindsey didn't have a car, Jordan couldn't find her way out of a paper bag, neither of the Joshes had the gas money and Luke was always too busy. But the problem rooted right back to Emily, the main reason she had all these friends in the first place. At the thought of Emily, these simple snivels turned into full-blown sobs that lasted for maybe ten minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her cry, she reached into her scrubs pocket for her iPhone and forwarded all her friends how stupid her parents were and what they had done and how they had totally screwed up her life and told all of them they would be friends no matter what. Of course she wasn't too sure about that last fact, having learned just recently that friends are so easily lost when they are taken out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she lay there for maybe a good five minutes before her tummy started rumbling again, no doubt struggling to digest the unbelievable portions of food she had consumed in the last few hours. But, too sad to think straight, Alli deemed it because she hadn't finished her breakfast. So she resigned to go back downstairs, chase her parents off, and finish. So, slowly, she hoisted herself up, out the door, and down the hall...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alli sat on the couch, arms crossed and her tensions nowhere close to being relieved. For the third day in a row she had sat at her place on that couch, ritualistically shooting nasty glares towards her parents when she wasn't sobbing or forcing something comforting through her lips. Her relationship with her parents was still torn asunder by their blatant disregard for her feelings, made even worse by her Father's sheer refusal to back down and re-enroll her into the public school system. Now, much like the consecutive days before this one, she was eating a hearty breakfast of the \"we're so sorry\" diet her parents placed her on (just another decision that Ali wasn't included in) that consisted of a high concentration of whipped cream, syrup, bacon, and butter spread onto a stack of pancakes so tall that one would expect Julie Andrews to prance across at any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she heard footsteps round the corner, Alli's already hostile expression became even darker. Those footsteps could only have belonged to her parents, knowing that the chef was in the kitchen working on her second serving and the maid hadn't arrived yet. \"Ali... your tutor's coming today, don't you think you should get dressed?\" her mother feigned sympathy, kneeling down beside her daughter as she churned masticated pancake in her mouth. \"No.\" she responded through her mouthful of mush, not even swallowing before lifting another thick forkful into her mouth. \"Honey, I think you should-\" her mother started, only for her husband to cut in, \"Meredith, if she wants to stay in her pajamas let her.\" he said in a diplomatic tone of voice, \"It's not like she's trying to impress the tutor, she'll get dressed when she wants to get dressed, right Honey?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli rolled her eyes and swallowed, \"Yeah, sure Dad.\" she said sarcastically, shifting slightly in her seat as she repositioned herself. \"That's a girl.\" he said with condescending enthusiasm, \"Well, your mother and I are headed to work, no wild parties while we're gone okay?\" Alli pursed her lips and sighed, \"Yeah, sure.\" He chuckled as he walked his wife out the door, exiting with the fallacious idea that relations were improving between them. It wasn't like he really had anything to worry about. Even before this whole ordeal started, Alli had always been a good kid who never really left the house much, and Emily was always the only one over so it wasn't like she was much of a party girl. Today, just like Monday and Tuesday, was going to be a quiet day where Alli did nothing. Except today, she was going to have to put up with a tutor, which only served to remind her that she wasn't in school with the rest of her friends, which in turn reminded her that her best friend had moved to Warsaw. Brilliant strategy, Mr. Fays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much like the previous couple of weeks beforehand, Alli's depression had been allowed to interfere with her personal health. While never exactly a health nut, Alli's lifestyle the past month or two could only be described as slothful. The past three days though had been killer, Alli had literally left the couch only a bare minimum of times. The rest of the time she was either pouting, crying, texting, or eating. It just wasn't healthy! Her paunch, steadily growing already, had surged forward ever so slightly with the large expense of junk food stuffed down into its confines, meaning that her hot pink top was even tighter over her belly as the gallant fabric struggled in futility to contain it. But, as stated before, there were much more pressing matters at hand that took priority over her unknowingly expanded waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamely, seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her fork scraped the bottom of the plate a mere thirty minutes later, Alli's natural appetite was overshadowed by her lack of attention and overpowered by her instincts. She rose from the couch for the first time in three hours to step into the kitchen catching the thick shape of the Fay's personal chef as he toiled away over the oven as he prepared the pre-requested second plate of pancakes. \"Thank you Augustus.\" Alli said courteously as he took her plate and started construction on another flapjack mountain, \"I'm sorry my stupid parents made you stay late today to cook all this for me.\" The portly German smiled happily behind is curled mustache, \"Think nothing of it.\" he said in his charmingly thick accent, \"Its no hair off of my beard, your parents pay wonderful overtime.\" Alli chuckled bemusedly and smiled at the sight of her second platter of pancakes, stacked even higher than the first. \"Again, I'm really sorry... and thank you.\" Augustus simply mussed the young girl's bedhead gently, \"Hey, you're a good kid, I don't mind.\" he said, smiling, \"Some of the brats I work for order me around like a slave, but not you.\" As he turned off the oven and grabbed his coat, he pointed to the lowermost cabinet, \"I left you a little something in the cubbards for you to snack on, be good for your tutor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the door shut behind him, the only human contact Alli was going to have for another hour and a half was gone. She was going to be all alone, again, for almost two hours. But at least this time she had something to occupy her time with... Augustus' delicious plate of pancakes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli headed back over to the sofa, she plopped her softened rear end down on its plush cushions and turned the channel on the television set in front of her. A little TV while she ate breakfast was nice, she had to admit. She could eat her mountainous breakfast in peace, with a little E! while she waited for her homeschool teacher to show up. Methodically, she pierced the buttery exterior of the syrup and cream soaked pancake stack and lifted it to her lips, chewing and swallowing bite after calorie-drenched bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about halfway through her plate, the doorbell rang. Rather than expend the energy to rise from her comfortable position hunched over her pancakes, Alli simply shouted, \"Come in!\" and listened as the doorknob turned. Slowly, in stepped a woman a little older than Alli herself -maybe in her early twenties- carrying several books, a purse, and a folder. She a mousy looking woman, scrawny and dressed casually with her brown hair tied back into a ponytail and glasses. This had to be her tutor, no doubt about it. She looked around for a second before seeing her pupil on the couch. \"Oh, I didn't realize you were.... well, alright, I'm Amy Aarons, you can call me whatever you want I guess.\" she said nervously, nearly charging through the kitchen and over to the couch to shake Alli's hand, \"Um, do you want to get dressed or, should I wait until you're done eating, or would you rather just go ahead and start now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypical Dad, he hired a pushover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started now, I guess.\" Alli said calmly, putting her plate on the end table to the left of her as she flicked off the television. The compliancy<br>\r\n seemed to shock Ms. \"Amy Aarons' somewhat, as she paused and gathered her jumbled words. \"Alrighty then, um, I guess I'll just go ahead.\" she laughed, \"So you're Allison Fays, do you go by Alli or Allison?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alli.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, well then Alli I guess I should give you these workbooks so we can get started for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison rolled her eyes, she hadn't had a workbook since the fourth grade. This was really lame. \"Hold on a second, let me go finish up really quick and rinse off my plate.\" Amy had no objections, of course. \"Oh, sure, fine, whatever works for you.\" she said meekly. Alli hefted up, grabbed her plate, and once she was in the kitchen took really big bites in order to just hurry up and be done. Fays rinsed off her plate and placed it in the sink before the afformentioned cubbard caught her eye. Standing on her tiptoes, she could just barely reach it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerman chocolate. Lots of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Augustus, I love you.\" Alli said happily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so began a long day of learning and snacking. Lots of snacking. Not a minute passed when Alli didn't have something to gnaw on in her hands as she halfheartedly listened in on whatever it was her teacher was squawking about. She laid one cheek in her palm as she used the other hand to feed herself, slumped over mindlessly- not even trying to look like she was paying attention...</span></div></div>",

Things had actually gone pretty well during their date night, not a single mention of their daughter to be heard of. It wasn't that Robert Fays didn't <i>care</i> about his daughter's plight; but being an attorney with a rather conflict oriented personality seemed to harden the still relatively young man's disposition. He rolled his eyes as he watched his wife hurry to the side of their slumbering daughter, who had all but officially started living on their couch. \"Oh come on, Meredith.\" he said in a dismissive tone of voice, \"She's got every kid's dream right here on a silver platter- I know I dreamed about staying home a lot more than I got to when I was a teenager in high school.\" His wife stood, standing up to about his shoulders, and furrowed her brow at her impossibly thick husband, \"When you were a teenaged <i>girl</i> in high school, Rob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, when I was a teenaged-\" he paused, catching his wife's message, \"You get my point; the only reason she keeps up this silly act is because you indulge it!\" He watched, vexed somewhat, as his wife kneeled down to examine her still slumbering daughter. \"Rob, all she does is lay around the house and eat.\" she said quietly, hoping not to rouse her log sawing daughter from her slumber, \"If this keeps up, she's going to need a forklift if she ever wants to get off of this couch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyed the slightly elevated rear of his daughter, uncovered by her blanket as she snuggled with it. Her butt blubber had already filled out her gray sweats, looking for more room to fill lest it pop them at the seams. His wife was right, Alli needed some cheering up; before she developed a serious problem. \"Alright, I see your point.\" he said sternly, \"But its not like we can send her back now- she's too far behind after missing these last two weeks of school.\" Meredith turned, concerned slightly with the results of the obviously overpaid tutor they had agreed on, \"What about Ms. Aarons?\" Rob sighed, rubbing the back of his head, \"She says that all Alli does is daydream all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor baby.\" Mrs. Fays cooed, \"Probably thinking about what Emily is doing in Warsaw.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a lightbulb goes off in Mr. Fay's noggin...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alli delicately floated back to consciousness, awoken from last night's deep slumber from natural means; the alarm clock she once relied so heavily on to get up in the morning now lay unused and simply taking up space. She shifted in her sleep, pulling the covers over her shoulder as she valiantly fought off the waking world. It didn't make much of a difference to her anymore though, now that all the days seemed to blend together after being fallaciously enrolled into the home schooling program. Mondays and Saturdays were seamlessly interconnected with Sunday made quick work of in the blink of an eye. The only thing that made this weekend special was that this was the first day, starting Wednesday, that she didn't have to worry about completing any school work or half-listening to the boring lectures that Ms. Aarons had in store for her. Admittedly, while it was a nice perk, having a comfortable sofa to accommodate you really took away from the whole 'school' experience that her tutor tried to convey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just like school days before, Alli found herself defeated and awoke to the bright sunlight that streaked through her curtains. She groaned slightly as she looked over to the left of her plush bed, the clock reading 9:42 am. A good eighteen minutes earlier than what she was averaging lately in no small effect to her late night television troping. Beneath closed eyelids, Alli rolled her pretty peepers and flipped the covers off of her in haste. Her significantly plumper rear shifted over to the edge of her bed and allowed her thickened legs to hang off the side as she blindly searched for her slippers using her toes. After feeling around for a bit, she finally came to the plastic insides that were her bedroom shoes. Slipping her steppers into them, she roused herself from the bed and gave a good, hearty stretch to start off the first real weekend that she'd had in a long time. She set one arm vertical and bent the other one behind it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere her arms always so... soft? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, she continued to investigate the mysterious afflictions that she had come down with; laying her arm out, she noticed that even in her loosest shirt they seemed to take up a lot of room. Poking one upper portion of her arm gently, she felt a strange squishiness that definitely hadn't been there before! She brought her strangely thick hands down to her waist, where more of the softness had accumulated. In abundance. Looking down past her larger chest, Alli could clearly see that paunch that all of her laziness and overeating had earned her; not one, but <i>two</i> belly rolls jutted out from her midsection and hung over the waistline of her gray sweats! And- oh God, she didn't want to even think about her ass! Her girlish figure was gone- evaporated into thin air! And it was replaced by a poorly reconstructed flabby form reminiscent of the Pillsbury Dough Boy! Unable to help herself at this point, Alli kept poking and prodding away at her \"newly\" fattened form. She was soft all over, and jiggled in every place that mattered! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that kept her calm was the simple fact that she had plenty of time to work off this extra weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have plenty of time to work off this extra weight!\" she reiterated the narration to herself, \"All I have to do is eat better, get some exercise... and maybe go for a ten mile jog or two!\" she said frantically, heading towards the full length mirror in hopes of fooling herself. \"It can't be all that noticeable!\" she rationalized, \"I mean, it's my body, and I didn't notice it until just now!\" However, her aspiration for rationalization quickly turned to shock and awe as soon as she saw the size of her thighs. They were enormous, thick and heart shaped! She was wider in her hips than she was in her entire body! Turning slightly, mostly out of sheer disbelief, she saw her quickly developing ghetto booty jutting out from behind her, a clear shot of her purple panties visible in the reflection. And there, on the uppermost section of her thigh, was a rip in the biggest pair of sweatpants she owned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!!\" she wailed, rushing out of her room and towards the bathroom, possibly hoping to magically wash the flab away? \"This can't be happening, this can't be happening!\" she repeated aloud as she forced her way into the bathroom, only to find that this mirror held the same truth as her own. Her hair was a mess, ridden with bedhead, her tummy bulged out from underneath her favorite undershirt, and her butt was too big to fit into the biggest pair of sweats she had ever owned! And the mirror wasn't helping! At this angle, she could clearly see her deepened naval as it cratered underneath the black hem of her top- her outie even seemed bigger with all the extra weight she had piled on! In disbelief, the short blond grabbed her stomach and jiggled it. Yup, it was there alright. Her hands traveled behind her to the plump, ham-hock thighs she had sprouted. They were huge! Desperation turned to bargaining, bargaining to anger (mostly at her parents), and anger turned to sadness, which in turn became a sort of fragile acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe emerged from the bathroom a good fifteen minutes later after her speed-run through the stages of denial still talking to herself. \"Okay, no big deal, no big deal.\" she said aloud, \"I can diet, exercise, stop eating so much for breakfast; I've done all of this before.\" she told herself... before looking up to see a good majority of her closest friends from school sitting at her dinner table opposite her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she supposed to do? She couldn't honestly face her friends like this, could she? No, of course not! But, she couldn't very well leave them at the table to the mercy of her parents. Maybe, just maybe, there was a long t-shirt hanging somewhere in her closet, or maybe a jacket or something. If she could just get to her closet, put on a hoodie, and get out, there was a chance that she could salvage-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alli!\" a voice, Josh, piped up from the dinner table at her direction. Unfortunately, all five other heads turned at his direction and everyone was alerted to the under dressed Alli standing in the hallway practically bursting out of her clothes. \"H-Hey guys!\" she said nervously, walking to the dining room as if she was walking on eggshells; very careful not to add too much stress to those already overstuffed bottoms of hers, \"Wh-What're you all doing here?\". Seemingly full of answers lately, her father decided to answer that question for her, \"Well, your mother and I noticed how unhappy you seemed lately with the homeschooling,\" Mr. Fays said through a bite of omelet, \"We thought you could use some cheering up, so we went through your phone-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went through my phone?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Online.\" her father said sternly before continuing, \"We picked out some key names that seemed to come up a lot and asked them all to come over first thing Saturday morning!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?\" Jordan signaled to Augustus who slaved away over the stove, \"I'm allergic to mushrooms, could you make me another plate? Thanks.\" Always far from polite, the short -even shorter than Alli- senior in high school had a certain way of grinding on a lot of people's nerves. If it weren't for Emily, she and Alli would have still been at each other's throats. She, as mentioned earlier, is a short girl with blond hair down to about her shoulders. As Augustus placed a pre-prepared plate in front of her, muttering something about ingratitude in his native tongue, she licked her lips in anticipation and hunger. \"Alli, how come you never mentioned you were loaded before?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I might have to start coming around more often.\" Jack teased, reaching for another side of french toast to go with his own egg. The attempted joker out of Alli's entire social circle, Jack seemed to laugh at everything and bust out his own jokes when the time called for it. But more often than not he only got in maybe two or three good ones before everyone was tired of hearing him talk. His black hair is rather long, and frames his face due to slight curling. He, like Jordan, was actually having a pretty good time enjoying the Fays Family affluence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, hey, Alli, you alright?\" Josh (Sterns) seemed to be the only one to notice Alli's discomfort at the situation. He was always the sensitive one in the group, be it to his own or to the emotions of other people. He always put everyone else first, something that Alli had come to respect about him. However, he along with everyone else present (sans Alli) had been taking advantage of Augustus' generous helpings of breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I'm alright.\" Alli lied, \"Mom, Dad, can I <b>talk</b> to you?\" she asked sternly through her teeth, only to be met with a dismissive gesture. \"No can do sweetie.\" Her father said rather laxly, \"We've got an appointment to keep, so you crazy kids have all the fun you want.\" Her mother chimed in, pushing away her second plate graciously, \"We'll be home at eight, call us if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alli, have fun with your friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but smile. In their own stupid way, Alli's parents really did love her. Even if this was the most intrusive, brainless thing that they'd ever done. Why would they just invite random people from her contacts list over for a Saturday dedicated entirely to hanging out?! What were they even supposed to <i>do</i>?!</span></div></div>",

The volume, turned down mostly due to complaints of the neighbors, was still moderately high enough for Debra to feel the base of the club scene from Batman &amp; Robin on the couch as she unwound from a hard day of studying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege life, while not without its perks that for the most part went outweighed, was far from what Debra had expected when she signed up. It was hard, with a lot of long hours spent studying and doing assignments leaving little time to salvage what was left of her neglected social life. Her professors were boring, the classes were dull, and the campus reeked of armpit. But hey, that's life at Hampton Arts College. What was a girl to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat phrase having become Debra's mantra in this pitstain of an apartment, it seemed a justification for her to just lay on her ass all day with either a notebook or the remote in one hand and a bag of chips in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that sentence did little to describe Debra Taft. In reality, Debra was a very hard worker at everything she did. She was head of the Art Squad back in high school and had organized charity fundraisers during her Senior year armed with only what she had painted and her natural charm. She had plenty of friends back home and seemed to command a great deal of respect from her peers. People were always telling her how good her paintings were and how she should go into art professionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confidence that other people had in her was what drove Debra into Hampton Arts College, which wasn't a <i>complete</i> mistake on her part. She had to admit that college was fun in the sense that she was finally away from her parents and out on her own... mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stared blankly at the television from her nook on the couch, the apartment door opened to reveal her sister, Delia, a reflection of herself in a Wendy's uniform, who let out a low grumble as she stumbled with the key in one hand and a big bag of Baconators in the other. \"Honey, I'm home.\" she imitated Ricky Ricardo in a bitter tongue as she forced her way through the door. Debra looked up, surprised to see her sister home so soon. \"Hey Del, no parties tonight?\" she asked her much more provocative sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, this town's lame and so are all the boys in it.\" she spat back as she hobbled over to the kitchen to drop her cargo on the counter. As many sets of twins seem to be, Delia and Debra were far from clones of each other. Where Debra was always the \"smart one\" or the \"artistic one\", Delia was much more the \"party girl\" or the \"cheap one\" of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that she didn't have the capability, it simply boiled down to the fact that Delia lacked the gumption to apply herself to anything that she couldn't wrap her lips around and guzzle. And yes, you dear readers can take that any way you'd like, there's no wrong answer there. She and her partying lifestyle were partially what got her parents into sending her off with Debra to college. She needed to straighten out. And who was a better teacher than cold, harsh reality? Mr. Ferguson, their landlord. But that was really more of a rhetorical question...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, no misconception intended, but even Debra and Delia themselves had to admit that the predicament seemed a little too much like a bad porno. Two beautiful sisters, twins no less, sharing an apartment together while one works so the other can go through college. The analogy was furthered by the two pair of geeky perverts staring into their window through a telescope, but that wasn't really the point. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ugh, my arms are <i>so</i> tired!\" she moaned, letting said appendages fall uselessly to her side as she slouched for effect, \"I must have flipped a hundred burgers today, I'm beat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia reached into the bag and pulled out a pair of baconators, tossing one across the counter and within her sister's reach. Her only meals lately being insta-cups of ramen noodles and microwavable soups, Debra found it hard to refuse a good burger. Let alone a brown Wendy's bag of what looked like eight or nine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Delia said weakly as she plopped herself down opposite her sister, \"What'cha watching?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebra hastily unwrapped her burger and took a satisfying bite before managing \"Batman and Robin\" through a mouth full of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, George Clooney in spandex, Debra you pervert.\" she teased, taking a veritably big bite out of her own sandwich. \"Oh shut up.\" she responded...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Deb, why'd they put nipples on the batsuit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Delia.\" she chuckled...</span></div></div>",

She decided to let it go, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut three days after the last incident was the last straw. Debra arrived home, only to see her sister with a dozen burgers or so with her.

But since you seem to be worried about me, have my burgers. I was gonna go out to a party anyways,\" said Delia as she tossed the bag of burgers to Debra. \"I'm gonna change, then head out. Don't expect me back anytime soon, big sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" said Debra as she pulled out on of the 12 or so Baconators in the bag. She leaned back and settled in for a TV marathon... the thoughts of her sisters weight gain long forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next 3 hours, Debra made her way through the remaining 12 Baconators (turned out there had been 13 in the bag). Not fully realizing the scale of what she had eaten, she grabbed a can of soda out from underneath the couch and polished it off, along with a \"few handfuls\" (most of the bag) of Doritos. Licking the orange-y powder remnants off of her fingers, her stomach rumbled from how uncomfortable it was with this quantity of food. Debra misinterpreted the rumbling. \"Still hungry?\" she said, rubbing her stomach contentedly. \"Guess I could order a pizza...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd order a pizza she did. A large one, to be exact. She had a coupon for a large Meatlover's pizza with 12 bread sticks for half off, and she definitely wasn't getting up just to grab something from the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 15 minutes later, a knock came on the door, along with a call of, \"Papa Johns delivery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebra, engrossed in her show, called back, \"It's open, come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and a acne-ridden teenager with jet black hair and a beanie in a Papa Johns uniform walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Debra?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be $4.39.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebra handed the man the money and grabbed the pizza box and bread sticks without ever glancing away from the screen. The delivery man shrugged and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 2 hours and 3 quarters of a pizza later, Debra was sound asleep on the couch, TV still blaring, when Delia staggered in through the door, drunk out of her mind. She had managed to put away 4 beers, 2 trays of nachos, and 4 shots of Tequila before leaving the party. She had also flirted with just about every guy, and an especially handsome man named Ryan had guided her to a room and done some- uh, EXPLICIT acts before Delia had hailed a cab and returned to the room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the weeks since the issue of Delia\u2019s softening shape was dismissed, things quickly returned to normal between the two of them\u2014or at least the routine. There was hardly anything normal about their interactions or their schedules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being sisters, locked into an inseparably deep (though somewhat vitriolic) relationship since the day they were born, their vastly opposing viewpoints tore the two of them to either side of their roaring twenties\u2014the two were hardly ever in the same room of their little loveshack, shared only one meal together, and gradually developed different habits that conflicted with the other\u2019s personality. Neither of the bodacious blondes\u2019 lifestyles could be considered healthy by any means, in fact both were just as harmful in very different ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the self-inflicted stress of schoolwork overcame Debra, the brainier of the two who was more conditioned to praise and applause, those few friends she had managed to make on campus were decidedly seeing less and less of her outside of her classes. While she was good in many art classes, the other courses she had been forced to enroll in (much to her confusion, since she didn\u2019t want to become a biologist nor a historian) were hard enough in high school\u2014now that her future was quite figuratively on the line, Debra thought it reasonable to drop out of her after-school activities in order for some study time in front of the television. Of course as she began to neglect her Art classes, those grades began to suffer too and\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say that Debra was an all-or-nothing kind of girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe direct result of this was the brainy blonde becoming something of an introvert. She still went outside, no fear to be held outside her front door, but even after her grades had evened out Debra had fallen too far into her new schedule of going right back to her dinky little apartment after classes. She missed on-campus events, slowly fell out of the few social circles she had managed to procure for herself, and eventually settled on a life that bordered on hermitism. Wake up, go to school, come home, study study study, bed, repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum was Delia, who was not enrolled in college and the actual breadwinner of their modest little household. She was here because her parents thought that she needed to even out, hardly by her own accord. She would much rather party her brains out and drink until she couldn\u2019t have a coherent thought even if it put her head behind her ankles for her. Which she still did, but of her own accord\u2014which happened to be a lot. Not quite, but <i>almost</i> every night of the week Delia spent her nights out on the town living out every horny teenaged girl\u2019s dream at almost twenty. Having been greatly conditioned to instilling shock and awe since she was about twelve, Debra was something of a pro partier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere her sister would wake up in the morning, come home in the afternoon, and sleep at night, Del did almost the exact opposite. She slept all morning and walked right out the door as Deb returned home, worked 2nd shift at Wendy\u2019s, came home to shower, change, and then walked right back out the door again and didn\u2019t come home until very early in the morning. She had a booming social life, but it was the only thing distracting her from her dead-end job behind the fryer. The only nights that the two actually spent together were those odd ones where Delia didn\u2019t have prior engagements or Debra just happened to wake up early enough to catch her party girl sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like they hated each other\u2014they still watched movies together, talked about their worries or how much they missed home, and more often than not managed to at least eat dinner together. It was just that they were at two very different points in their lives right now, ironically brought there by them being forced to live together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, Delia always made sure that there was food on the table, even if it wasn\u2019t always the healthiest food out there. Their parents were gracious enough to pay rent if Delia would pay for food and phone services, which she managed to do most of the time. Not to call her a saint; she still blew lots of money on clothes and beer and anything else she couldn\u2019t get a guy to buy her on an off night. But she always brought home bags and bags of food from Wendy\u2019s that would hold for a day or two\u2026 if they ever lasted that long at a time. Debra was a notorious comfort eater, and the stress of college had amplified that trait exponentially. Meanwhile Delia was out partying all night, drinking and losing her inhibitions\u2014God knows how many empty calories she guzzled in one evening, forget about all the food she scarfed at any one of her given parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe these twins weren\u2019t so different after all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Debra spent more and more nights at home, chowing down on greasy takeout food and cheap pizza, it was getting harder and harder to deny that the things around her weren\u2019t shrinking. Her shirts, her pants, her underwear\u2026 the couch. Rather it was she that was <i>growing</i>! Getting only softer at first, but slowly growing wider and wider as she reveled in her slothful indulgence. And while she was aware that she was growing, she was finding her new appetite far too powerful to deny\u2014all that wonderfully greasy food that had once only been for comfort was now a major staple of her diet! It was too good to give up, too good to resist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Delia, who wasn\u2019t quite as mentally versed as her sister was, obliviously began to drink and guzzle and scarf her way right out of every piece of clothing she owned! She popped her tube top, tore her jean shorts, ripped the zipper right down the middle on the biggest pants she owned\u2014and yet she still failed to see the correlation between her decadent lifestyle and her lacking wardrobe. As all her soft creamy flesh bulged out and about of everything she owned at any given time of the day, the sense of confinement on her physical body was translated as stress to her mental body. As a result she was somehow even more quick-tempered than before, causing her to seek the sweet solace of the club more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a major turning point was just over the horizon for these two\u2014one that could affect both of their lives for better or worse\u2026</span></div></div>",
